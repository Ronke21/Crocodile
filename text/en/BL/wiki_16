<text>The All-Russian Political Party United Russia (, ) is the ruling political party of Russia. As the largest party in the Russian Federation, it holds 325 (or 72.22%) of the 450 seats in the State Duma , having constituted the majority in the chamber since 2007. 

The party was formed on 1 December 2001 through a merger of Unity, Fatherland – All Russia, and the Our Home – Russia. Following the 2003 and 2011 election results, United Russia held a parliamentary majority in the State Duma and a constitutional majority in 2007, 2016, and 2021. In the Duma elections of 2011, for the first time, the United Russia electoral list was formed based on the results of the preliminary (primary) elections held jointly with the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front. According to the decisions of the XII Congress of United Russia, adopted on 24 September 2011, in the Duma elections, the party&#x27;s pre-election list was headed by the President of the Russian Federation at the time, Dmitry Medvedev, and in the 2012 elections, Vladimir Putin became the presidential candidate. The structure of the party is made up of regional, local, and primary branches. Regional branches of United Russia have been created in all subjects of the Russian Federation. In Russia, there are 82,631 primary and 2,595 local branches of the party. 

United Russia supports the policies of Putin, who is the incumbent Russian president and served as party leader during the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev; despite not currently being the official leader or a member of the party, Putin operates as its &quot;de facto&quot; leader. United Russia&#x27;s votes peaked in the 2007 Russian legislative election with 64.3% of the vote, while in recent years, it has seen its popularity decline. The party&#x27;s ideology is inconsistent and embraces specific officials, all of whom support Putin. Although in 2009 it proclaimed Russian conservatism as its official ideology, it appeals mainly to pro-Putin and non-ideological voters, and is often classified by political scientists as a &quot;big-tent party&quot;, or as a &quot;party of power&quot;, rather than an organization that is primarily based upon a political ideology.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
United Russia&#x27;s predecessor was the Unity bloc, which was created three months before the December 1999 Duma elections to counter the advance of the Fatherland – All Russia (OVR) party led by Yuri Luzhkov. The creation of the party was heavily supported by Kremlin insiders, who were wary of what looked like a certain OVR victory. They did not expect Unity to have much chance of success since President Boris Yeltsin was very unpopular and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#x27;s ratings were still minuscule. The new party attempted to mimic OVR&#x27;s formula of success, placing an emphasis on competence and pragmatism. Charismatic Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu was appointed as the party leader.

Tatyana Yumasheva, the daughter of Russia&#x27;s first president, Boris Yeltsin, wrote on her LiveJournal blog that Boris Berezovsky was a founder of United Russia: &quot;Now United Russia does not like to remember that Berezovsky had something to do with the idea of the emergence of Unity. But history is history. We must not forget those who stood at its origins. Otherwise, it resembles the history of the VKP(b), which was carefully rewritten every time when its next founder turned out to be an enemy of the people.&quot;

In 1999, Prime Minister Putin&#x27;s support increased to double-digit figures after he sent troops into Chechnya in retaliation for bombings in Moscow and other cities attributed to Chechen terrorists and in response to the Chechen invasion of Dagestan. The war effort was hugely popular and portrayed positively by the Boris Berezovsky-owned Public Russian Television (ORT) as well as by state-controlled RTR.

Contrary to its founders&#x27; expectations, Unity&#x27;s election campaign in the 1999 election was a success with the party receiving 23.3% of the votes, considerably more than OVR&#x27;s 13.3% and within one percentage point of the Communist Party&#x27;s 24.3%. The popularity of the prime minister proved decisive for Unity&#x27;s victory. The election results also made clear that Putin was going to win the 2000 presidential election, which resulted in competitors Luzhkov and Yevgeni Primakov dropping out. Yeltsin also gave Putin a boost by resigning as president on 31 December 1999.

=== Creation ===
While Unity initially possessed one narrow purpose, limited only to the 1999 Duma elections, state officials began transforming the party into a permanent one after the results. A large number of independent deputies who had been elected to the Duma were invited to join the party&#x27;s delegation. Many OVR deputies joined, including its leader Luzhkov. In April 2001, OVR and Unity leaders declared they had started the unification process. In July 2001, the unified party, the Union of Unity and Fatherland, held its founding congress. In December 2001, it became the All-Russian Party of Unity and Fatherland—United Russia, a merger of Unity, the Fatherland movement, and the All Russia movement that joined them later, led by Mintimer Shaimiev.

Instead of the &quot;communism versus capitalism&quot; dichotomy that had dominated the political discourse in the 1990s, in the 1999–2000 electoral cycle Putin started to emphasize another reason to vote for his party: stability, which was yearned for by Russian citizens after a decade of chaotic change. With the exception of the continued fighting in the Northern Caucasus, Putin was perceived to have delivered it.

=== 2001–2003 ===

After the merger of the parties at the founding congress, the leaders of the merged parties (Sergei Shoigu, Yuri Luzhkov, and Mintimer Shaimiev) were elected co-chairs of the Supreme Council of the party. Alexander Bespalov became the chairman of the party&#x27;s general council, which carried out practical leadership, and the party&#x27;s central executive committee. The council included the secretary of the Fatherland—All Russia political council, Alexander Vladislavlev, Franz Klintsevich, and a member of the Federation Council, Sergey Popov.

On 20 November 2002, Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov became chairman of the Supreme Council. Bespalov&#x27;s powers as chairman of the General Council were curtailed, and on 27 February 2003, he left his post. Valery Bogomolov became the chairman of the party&#x27;s general council, and Yury Volkov became the head of the central executive committee. On 13 January 2003, United Russia had 257,000 members, placing it behind only the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (600,000) and the Communists (500,000). On 31 January 2003, the party was registered by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.

On 29 March 2003, the Second Party Congress took place. The Congress approved the report presented by Boris Gryzlov and approved the manifesto &quot;The Path of National Success&quot;. At the congress, it was decided to develop an election program for the upcoming parliamentary elections. Sergei Shoigu stood down, and Boris Gryzlov was elected as the new party leader.

On 20 September 2003, the Third Party Congress adopted the election program and approved the list of candidates for the elections. The congress was welcomed by Vladimir Putin, who wished the party success in the elections. On 7 December, the party &quot;Unity and Fatherland - United Russia&quot; won the elections, receiving 37.57% of the vote, and with single-mandate members, a constitutional majority in the State Duma. Boris Gryzlov became speaker of the State Duma.

On 24 December 2003, the Fourth Congress took place, at which Boris Gryzlov made a report. The congress approved the main provisions and conclusions of the report, as well as the party&#x27;s activities during the election campaign. The congress adopted a unanimous decision to support the candidacy of Vladimir Putin in the presidential elections. In addition, it was decided to rename the party from Unity and Fatherland - United Russia into United Russia.

==== 2003 State Duma elections ====
Throughout Putin&#x27;s first years as president, the country&#x27;s economy improved considerably, growing more each year than in all of the previous decade and Putin&#x27;s approval ratings hovered well above 70%. Russia&#x27;s economic recovery was helped by high prices for its primary exports such as oil, gas and raw materials. The passage rate of law proposals increased considerably after United Russia became the dominant party in the Duma. In 1996–1999, only 76% of the legislation that passed the third reading was signed by the President while in 1999–2003 the ratio was 93%. While Yeltsin had often relied on his decree powers to enact major decisions, Putin almost never had to. United Russia&#x27;s dominance in the Duma enabled Putin to push through a wide range of fundamental reforms, including a flat income tax of 13%, a reduced profits tax, an overhaul of the labour market, breakups of national monopolies and new land and legal codes. United Russia characterised itself as wholly supportive of Putin&#x27;s agenda, which proved a recipe for success and resulted in the party gaining a victory in the 2003 Duma elections, receiving more than a third of the popular vote.

Throughout its history, United Russia has been successful in using administrative resources to weaken its opponents. For example, state-controlled news media portrayed the Communist Party as hypocritical for accepting money from several &quot;dollar millionaires&quot; during the 2003 Duma election campaign. Opposition parties also made several strategic mistakes. For example, Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces seemed to spend more effort attacking each other than Putin, which made it easier for United Russia to win over liberal voters on the strength of market reforms under Putin. The opposition parties faltered in the 2003 elections, with the Communists gaining just 52 seats, a drop from 113 in 1999. Liberal opponents fared even worse, with Yabloko and Union of the Right Forces failing to cross the 5 percent threshold.

===2004–2007===
On 27 November 2004, at the Fifth Congress, a management reform was carried out: the central political council was liquidated and the post of party chairman was introduced. Boris Gryzlov was elected chairman of United Russia. On 22 April 2005, Vyacheslav Volodin, Vice Speaker of the State Duma, was elected the new Secretary of the United Russia General Council, replacing Valery Bogomolov. On 23 April 2005, 35-year-old State Duma deputy Andrey Vorobyov, head of the United Russia Foundation, took over as head of the central executive committee.

The new leadership of &quot;United Russia&quot; has set the goal of &quot;partization of power&quot;. In the spring of 2005, a law was adopted on elections to the State Duma exclusively on party lists. Then the State Duma adopted amendments to federal legislation allowing the party that won the elections to the regional parliament to propose to the President of Russia their candidacy for the governor&#x27;s post. In the overwhelming majority of regions, this right belonged to United Russia. The vast majority of governors are members of United Russia. In April 2006, Boris Gryzlov announced that 66 out of 88 leaders of Russian regions were already members of the party. Since 2005, the leaders of the large industrial corporations Rot Front, Babaevsky, Mechel, and AvtoVAZ have joined the party.

On 26 November 2005, the 6th Party Congress was held in Krasnoyarsk, which approved a new charter version. According to one of the amendments, in case of failure to comply with the decisions of the central and regional party bodies, the activities of a regional political association that does not comply with these decisions may be terminated. No changes were made to the party program at the congress. On the eve of the 7th Congress of the Party, the leadership of the political party &quot;Russian United Industrial Party&quot; (ROPP) applied for a merger with the political party &quot;United Russia&quot;. The formal merger took place on 1 December 2006.

On 2 December 2006, the 7th Party Congress was held in Yekaterinburg. As a result of the congress, the program statement &quot;The Russia We Choose&quot; was approved, which outlined a development strategy based on the principles of sovereign democracy. In 2006–2007, United Russia initiated the creation of some new organizations: the Young Guard of United Russia, the Union of Pensioners of Russia, the Pedagogical Society of Russia, and the All-Russian Council of Local Self-Government, aiming to create more favourable conditions for the public realization of the interests of their members.

==== 2007 State Duma elections ====

As the economy continued to improve, Putin moved to rein in the unpopular oligarchs, Putin&#x27;s approval ratings stayed high and he won the 2004 presidential election with over 71% of the votes. The 2007 Duma elections saw United Russia gain 64.3% of the votes. The Communist Party became a distant second with 11.57% of the votes. Putin was the only name on United Russia&#x27;s national list. United Russia also introduced tougher party, candidate and voter registration requirements and increased the election threshold from 5% to 7% for the 2007 elections.

During the December 2007 election, the party was accused by voters and election monitoring group Golos of numerous election law violations banned in the Russian Constitution. The legislative agenda shifted somewhat after the 2007 elections. Anti-terrorism legislation, large increases in social spending and the creation of new state corporations became the dominant issues while less energy was devoted to economic reform.

=== 2008–2010 ===

For the 2008 presidential election, United Russia nominated Dmitry Medvedev to succeed Putin. Medvedev received Putin&#x27;s blessing and scored a clear victory, receiving 71% of the votes. As President, Medvedev nominated Putin as his Prime Minister. On 15 April 2008, Putin accepted a nomination to become the party&#x27;s leader, but declared that this did not mean he would become a member. Medvedev also refused to become a member. On 7 May 2008, Boris Gryzlov was replaced as party leader by Putin. The Agrarian Party supported the candidacy of Dmitry Medvedev in the 2008 presidential election and it merged into United Russia.

During regional elections of 11 October 2009, United Russia won a majority of seats in almost every Russian municipality. Opposition candidates stated they were hindered from campaigning for the elections and some were denied places on the ballot. There were allegations of widespread ballot stuffing and voter intimidation as well as statistical analysis results supporting these accusations. Support for United Russia was 53% in a poll held in October 2009. On 28 September 2010, the dismissed mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, left the post of co-chairman of the Supreme Council of United Russia and left the party.

=== 2011–2013 ===
In 2010–2011 and following the economic crisis, support for United Russia was variable but declined overall. The share of the population voting for the party reached its lowest point in January 2011 (35%) before recovering to 41% in March 2011. At the 12th Party Congress held on 24 September 2011, Medvedev supported Prime Minister Putin&#x27;s candidacy in the 2012 presidential election, which effectively assured Putin would return to the presidency, given the party&#x27;s near-total dominance of Russian politics. Medvedev accepted Prime Minister Putin&#x27;s offer to lead United Russia in the Duma elections and said that, in his opinion, Putin should run for president in 2012. The delegates gave this statement a standing ovation and unanimously supported his presidential candidacy. Medvedev reacted immediately, saying that applause was proof of Putin&#x27;s popularity among the people. About ten thousand participants in the meeting listened to Medvedev&#x27;s speech. In total, the congress was attended by about 12,000 participants, guests and journalists, which is unprecedented for such political meetings.

At the same congress, the pre-election list of candidates from the party for the December elections to the State Duma was approved. The list included 416 party members and 183 non-party members, 363 of whom are running for the first time. On 29 September 2011, the list was submitted to the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation. President Medvedev headed the party&#x27;s list. 582 congress delegates voted for the list, and one voted against. The election program of United Russia was announced in speeches by Medvedev and Putin at the congress. Medvedev identified seven strategic government policy priorities, and Putin proposed writing off 30 billion rubles in erroneous tax debts of 36 million Russians and raising the salaries of public sector workers by 6.5% from 10 October. Putin also noted that taxes for wealthy citizens should be higher than for the middle class and suggested raising housing and communal services tariffs only over the established norm. Among other priorities, Putin named the complete rearmament of the army and navy in 5–10 years, doubling the pace of road construction in 10 years, creating or updating 25 million jobs in 20 years, and Russia becoming one of the five largest economies in the world.

At the 13th Party Congress on 26 May 2012, Medvedev was elected chairman of United Russia. United Russia decided not to use Medvedev and Putin&#x27;s portraits during the autumn election campaign. On 26 September, the &quot;Vedomosti&quot; newspaper wrote about this, citing a high-ranking source within the party. In March 2013, about 50 United Russia members from the Abansky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai announced their withdrawal from the party. They sent an open letter (stating that 60 people signed it) to party chairman Medvedev, in which they criticized the party&#x27;s activities, which, according to them, has ceased to fulfil its political function. On 5 October 2013, the 14th Party Congress took place in Moscow. According to the registration data, out of 726 delegates to the 14th Congress, 697 were present.

==== All-Russia People&#x27;s Front (ONF) ====
On 6 May 2011, during the interregional conference in the Southern Federal District, the acting Prime Minister of Russia and the leader of United Russia, Vladimir Putin, took the initiative to create the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front, a political union of public organizations. Representatives of the ONF, according to his idea, were included in United Russia list in the Duma elections in 2011 and took part in the party&#x27;s primaries.


On 7 May 2011, the first meeting of the coordinating council of the new organization was held, which was attended by representatives of 16 public organizations. On 13 June, a draft declaration on the formation of the front was published on the United Russia website. The ONF included more than 500 public organizations. The largest are Opora Rossii, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, Delovaya Rossiya, the Union of Pensioners of Russia, the Young Guard of United Russia, the Union of Transport Workers of Russia, and the Union of Women of Russia. Also on 7 June, after numerous appeals from citizens, it was decided to allow individuals to join the ONF. As of 14 June 2011, more than 6,000 people wished to join the movement.

The political and economic program of the ONF was developed by the Institute for Socio-Economic and Political Research under the leadership of the former president of Chuvashia, Nikolay Fyodorov, in the fall of 2011 and was adopted by the party congress. As Fyodorov noted, the People&#x27;s Program became a guide for the legislative work of the State Duma of the new convocation, and all agreed decisions became mandatory for deputies from United Russia and the ONF.

According to a Gazeta.ru author, by creating the ONF, Vladimir Putin and United Russia, for the first time, openly violated the principle of departization of the economy and public life, which was introduced on 20 July 1991 by Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s decree &quot;On the termination of the activities of the organizational structures of political parties and mass social movements in state bodies, institutions and organizations of the RSFSR&quot; and which became one of the foundations of the Russian political system.

=== 2014–present ===
On 5–6 February 2016, the 15th Party Congress of United Russia took place in Moscow. The main topic was the approval of the procedure for holding a preliminary vote to select candidates for elections to the State Duma of the seventh convocation. On 22 May 2016, United Russia held party elections (primaries) on an all-Russian scale - formally for selecting candidates from the party in the elections to the State Duma; however, the victory of one or another person in these primaries did not mean at all that the winner would become a candidate from United Russia in the elections to the State Duma.

Some winners were excluded from the lists by the party leadership (often under strange pretexts), and their places on the party list were given to persons who showed very low results in the voting on 22 May 2016. For example, in the final regional party list for Sverdlovsk Oblast, the &quot;passing&quot; 2nd and 3rd places went to the participants who took 9th and 10th places in the primaries. By a similar principle, some of the winners of the primaries in single-member constituencies were replaced. For example, the party appointed a person as a candidate from the party in the Nizhny Tagil district, who, according to the results of the voting in the district, took only fourth place.

More than 20 people who did not participate in the primaries on 22 May were nominated by the party as candidates for the State Duma, moreover, in &quot;passing places&quot;. In addition, in 18 single-member districts where the primaries were held, United Russia did not nominate anyone to the State Duma in 2016. The motives for this decision are unknown, especially since the results of the primaries for these districts were not canceled. By the beginning of the active stage of the election campaign for the State Duma, reshuffles were made in the campaign headquarters headed by Sergei Neverov, which began work in two different formats: the operational headquarters (meets twice a week in a narrow format to solve operational problems) and the extended headquarters (meeting in full force once every two weeks). On 22 January 2017, Medvedev was re-elected as party chairman.
On 26 May 2019, for the first time in the history of large-scale political elections held in Russia, the party applied the secret electronic preliminary voting procedure using blockchain technology. Secret electronic voting was used by voters in 47 regions of Russia in multi-level elections to determine candidates for subsequent nomination from United Russia to the State Duma, regional parliaments, and local governments. In the 2021 Duma elections, the party retained its supermajority in the State Duma, despite polls before the election indicating historic low levels of support for the party at around 30%, leading to widespread allegations of electoral fraud in favour of United Russia.

In March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the party opened an aid centre in Mariupol. In November 2022, several United Russia sources reported that the party would not hold an annual congress because &quot;the party is not ready to propose a strategic agenda.&quot; Refusal to hold an annual congress is a violation of the party charter. In December 2022, the European Union sanctioned United Russia due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Participation in elections ==
=== Elections to the State Duma ===
United Russia has participated in all elections to the State Duma of the Russian Federation since 2003 (since 1999 through its predecessors: Fatherland – All Russia and Unity). At the same time, the party actively used the &quot;locomotive&quot; political strategy: including in its party lists well-known persons who were not going to become deputies or refused mandates immediately after the election, while less well-known party members worked in the State Duma instead of them. In 2003, 37 elected candidates from United Russia refused deputy mandates; in 2007, they were 116 candidates, and 99 candidates in 2011. Among the participants of United Russia&#x27;s &quot;locomotive&quot; were the President of the Russian Federation (2007, 2011), the heads of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, ministers of the Russian Government, and mayors of cities.

==== Elections to the State Duma of the IV convocation, 2003 ====
Elections to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia of the fourth convocation were held on 7 December 2003 and became the first elections in which United Russia acted as a political party. As a result of voting, United Russia received 223 seats in parliament (120 on the list and 103 in single-member districts). Boris Gryzlov, Sergei Shoigu, and Yuri Luzhkov headed United Russia&#x27;s list. The voter turnout was 55.75%. United Russia gained 37.56% votes, giving it 120 mandates; the party received another 103 mandates in single-mandate districts, which, together with joining the self-nominated faction, allowed it to form a qualified majority in the State Duma.

==== Elections to the State Duma of the V convocation, 2007 ====
Elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the fifth convocation were held on 2 December 2007. United Russia won 315 seats in the parliament following the elections. For the first time, the elections were held exclusively according to the proportional system, without the participation of single-mandate candidates.

Vladimir Putin single-handedly headed United Russia&#x27;s federal list. On 1 October 2007, President Putin announced at the United Russia party congress that he would accept the party&#x27;s invitation to head the list of candidates, although he refused to join the party. In his speech, Vladimir Putin said that a previous speaker&#x27;s suggestion that he become prime minister after the end of his second presidential term &quot;is completely realistic, but it&#x27;s too early to talk about it now.&quot; United Russia refused participate in any broadcast political debates, but on 1 October, it approved a program in which it promised to continue Putin&#x27;s political course. The electoral program was called &quot;Putin&#x27;s Plan: A Worthy Future for a Great Country.&quot; During the 2007 campaign, President Putin gave United Russia official permission to use his name and image in the party&#x27;s election campaign to the State Duma of the V convocation.

The voter turnout was 63.78%, and United Russia received 64.20%, which allowed it to get 315 seats and secure a constitutional majority in the State Duma after uniting with single-mandate members and members of the faction of the People&#x27;s Party of Russia.

==== Elections to the State Duma of the VI convocation, 2011 ====
Elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the VI convocation were held on 4 December 2011. For the first time, the State Duma was elected for five years. As a result of the elections, United Russia received 238 seats. As in 2007, the elections were held only under the proportional system. On 24 September 2011, at the 12th United Russia Party Congress, President Medvedev headed the United Russia electoral list. The voter turnout was 60.1% of voters. According to official data from the Central Election Commission of Russia, 49.31% of voters voted for United Russia. In the 2011 Duma elections, United Russia formed an electoral list based on the All-Russian primaries together with the All-Russian Popular Front, at least 150 of whose representatives were included in the party&#x27;s federal list. Boris Gryzlov also noted that federal politicians and ministers would be at the head of some regional groups of the party in the elections and did not rule out that after the elections, the composition of the Russian Government would change.

Also in 2011, United Russia took part in a televised debate for the first time. It was announced that Speaker of the State Duma Boris Gryzlov, Secretary of the Presidium of the General Council Sergey Neverov, head of the CEC of the party Andrey Vorobyov, deputies Andrey Isayev, Svetlana Orlova, Andrey Makarov, Governor of the Krasnodar Krai Alexander Tkachev could take part in the debate. However, United Russia members participated in free debates within the framework of the air provided by law. They abstained from participating in some paid debates, particularly with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, preferring to meet with the Communists at free debates. Putin, the leader of United Russia, and Medvedev, the leader of the federal list of United Russia in the elections, the chairman of the supreme council of the party Boris Gryzlov, as well as members of the government who headed the lists of the party in power in the regions, did not take part in the pre-election debates.

==== Elections to the State Duma of the VII convocation, 2016 ====
Elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the VII convocation were held throughout Russia on 18 September 2016, on a single voting day. The elections were held in a mixed electoral system: out of 450 deputies, 225 were elected on party lists in a single federal district (proportional system), and another 225 were elected in single-member districts (majority system). The party&#x27;s federal list was again headed by Dmitry Medvedev, chairman of the United Russia party. As a result of the elections, United Russia received 343 mandates in the new convocation and formed a constitutional majority. The turnout in the elections was 47.88%; the party won 54.20% of the votes on the lists, which brought it 140 mandates. United Russia received another 203 mandates according to voting results in single-mandate constituencies. The final 343 seats in parliament are the highest indicator of the party in the elections to the State Duma.

==== Elections to the State Duma of the VIII convocation, 2021 ====
Elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the VIII convocation were held on 17–19 September, ending on a single voting day on 19 September 2021. The elections were held according to a mixed electoral system: according to party lists (225 deputies) and single-mandate constituencies (225 deputies). At the party congress on 19 June 2021, President Vladimir Putin proposed to include Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Chief Physician of the Moscow City Clinical Hospital No. 40 &quot;Kommunarka&quot; Denis Protsenko, head of the Sirius Educational Center and co-chairman of the central headquarters of the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front Yelena Shmelyova, and the Commissioner for Children&#x27;s Rights under the President of the Russian Federation Anna Kuznetsova.

To select the remaining candidates in all constituencies, the party was the only one of all the election participants to conduct a preliminary vote (primaries). From 15 March to 14 May, more than 7.5 thousand applications were accepted from applicants - members of United Russia and non-partisans. 30% of the participants in the preliminary voting were volunteers working during the pandemic and social activists. For the first time, advance voting became electronic throughout the country, but in 46 regions, the possibility of in-person voting remained. More than 12 million voters participated in the intra-party elections, of which about 6 million voted online. United Russia went to the polls with the People&#x27;s Programme, a policy document based on the President&#x27;s April message and the wishes of the people who gathered traditionally - at meetings and through public reception parties - and on a specially created website, np.er.ru. More than 2 million people submitted their proposals for the country&#x27;s development.

Another trend of the party in the elections was renewal. Already at the primaries stage, only half of the current State Duma deputies took part in them, but more than 30% of the participants were volunteers, social activists, and graduates of Russian and party personnel projects. The voter turnout was 51.72%. United Russia won 49.82% of the votes on party lists, which allowed it to receive 126 seats. The party managed to get another 198 mandates in single-mandate constituencies, which made it possible to get 324 seats in parliament and maintain a constitutional majority.

=== Practice of nominating formally independent candidates ===
Since 2009, in many regions, the practice of United Russia supporting formally independent candidates has occurred in local elections. Political scientist Sergei Dyachkov believes this is a well-thought-out tactic related to the fear of candidates losing votes due to dissatisfaction with the authorities&#x27; actions in the context of the financial-economic crisis. According to Roman Prytkov, a journalist for the Agency for Federal Investigation, the candidates who represent the authorities believe that it has become unprofitable to go to the polls under the banner of United Russia because it will deprive them of part of the vote. &quot;Kommersant&quot; believes that &quot;large cities have become an electoral problem for United Russia - candidates prefer not to advertise their party affiliation.&quot; Candidates nominated by United Russia are reportedly often embarrassed about their party affiliation and try not to advertise it when meeting with voters and do not indicate it in their campaign materials.

In the mayoral elections in Khimki in 2012, the party supported a self-nominated member of United Russia, Oleg Shakhov, who acted as mayor. In the municipal elections in 125 intra-city municipalities of the city of Moscow on 4 March 2012, candidates (members of the United Russia party and those previously elected from the United Russia party) were nominated independently. Not a single official candidate from the United Russia party was nominated. In June 2013, Member of the Supreme Council of United Russia Sergey Sobyanin, proposed by United Russia in 2010 to President Medvedev as a candidate for the mayor of Moscow, went to early re-elections as an independent candidate. United Russia considered that &quot;Sergei Sobyanin&#x27;s decision not to run for mayor from the party was the right one, because in this way he would be able to gather representatives of the &quot;most diverse&quot; forces&quot;, and promised to provide support in any case.

On 8 September 2013, simultaneously with the election of the mayor of Moscow, elections of municipal deputies were held in several districts, part of the territory of the Moscow Oblast that was recently annexed to the capital. As in 2012, United Russia will not directly participate in these elections. Candidates affiliated with this party or with district administrations will go to the polls as &quot;self-nominated&quot; because of, according to an unnamed Gazeta.Ru source, &quot;the poor rating of United Russia both in Moscow and the Moscow Oblast.&quot;

According to Aleksey Melnikov, an author of Gazeta.ru, &quot;the type of &quot;self-nominated&quot; that has appeared in the political life of Russia, diligently hiding the United Russia party card and the pocket of a government faithful, shows a crisis ... when the new mask of the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front has not yet been put on, while it lies on the shelf, and the old one, the so-called &quot;United Russia&quot;, has almost been taken off.&quot; In November 2019, the secretary of the general council of the party, Andrey Turchak, said that in the upcoming elections to the State Duma in 2021, United Russia would nominate its own candidates and stop providing support for self-nominated United Russia members since &quot;United Russia should not be &#x27;ashamed&#x27; of their party affiliation, but, on the contrary, be proud of it.&quot;

=== Preliminary voting ===
Preliminary voting of United Russia (colloquially known as &quot;primaries&quot;) is a procedure for intra-party voting on candidates for subsequent nomination from United Russia, its regional branches as candidates for deputies of the legislative bodies of state power of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Preliminary voting is organized and conducted to provide opportunities for citizens of the Russian Federation to participate in the political life of society. According to the results of the preliminary voting in 2011, organized by United Russia and the ONF for the first time in Russian political history, more than 150 non-partisan candidates were included in the electoral lists of United Russia, and the successful holding of the primaries prompted Vladimir Putin to propose legislatively making this procedure mandatory for all political parties.

Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM) Director General Valery Fyodorov notes that, according to an August 2011 VTsIOM poll, about a third of Russians were aware of the party and ONF primaries, and United Russia &quot;tried to turn an intra-party ... event into a topic of interest to those who are not only members of United Russia, but are often generally apolitical.&quot; After the primaries were held, Vladimir Putin said in August 2011 that he considered it expedient to hold primaries for all parties and extend this practice to the regional and municipal levels. On 24 August, acting Vice Speaker of the State Duma Oleg Morozov announced that in September, United Russia intends to submit to the State Duma a bill introducing mandatory primaries. Since 2016, preliminary voting in the party has been held annually. From 2016 to 2020, it lasted one day; in 2021, the practice of weekly voting was introduced, with voters making their choice electronically for six days. United Russia remains the only political force using the preliminary voting mechanism.

==== Single Advance Voting Day 2021 ====
The preliminary voting held by United Russia on 24–30 May 2021 throughout the country was the largest in the history of this procedure. It was attended by about 11 million people (more than 10 percent of the total number of voters in the country). The average age of the candidates was 41 years.

==== Electronic preliminary voting ====
Electronic preliminary voting is a form of remote voting. For this purpose, a special site for preliminary voting, adapted for smartphone use, has been created. In addition to the convenience for voters, the site allows candidates to independently fill out their pages: post news, videos, and photos, and distribute their pages. The personal account is integrated with the leading social networks. In 2018, as an experiment in several regions, United Russia held the first electronic voting. 140,000 people took part in the voting.

In 2021, United Russia&#x27;s preliminary voting occurred online from 24 to 30 May nationwide. In total, 6,031,800 people took part in the preliminary electronic voting. Access to voting on the site is provided after authorization through the State Services portal. To prevent fraud, United Russia independently developed and implemented special software to simplify the monitoring of electronic voting by all interested participants in the procedure.

== Current status ==
=== Federal Assembly ===

United Russia currently holds 340 of the 450 seats in the State Duma. It heads all five of the Duma&#x27;s commissions, and holds 14 of the 26 committee chairmanships, and 10 of the 16 seats in the Council of Duma, the Duma&#x27;s steering committee. The speaker of the Duma is United Russia&#x27;s Vyacheslav Volodin. The party has only informal influence in the upper house, the Federation Council, as the Council has rejected the use of political factions in decision making.

=== Party membership ===
In 2013, United Russia claimed a membership of 2 million. According to a study conducted by Timothy J. Colton, Henry E. Hale and Michael McFaul after the March 2008 presidential elections, 30% of the Russian population are loyalists of the party. As of 2010, 26% of party members were pensioners, students and temporarily unemployed, 21.2% worked in education, 20.9% in industry, 13.2% were in the civil service and worked in government, 8% worked in healthcare, 4% were entrepreneurs, and about 4% worked in the art field.

== Party platform ==
The party&#x27;s official ideological platform, described by its leaders as centrist, conservative, and Russian conservatism, suggests a statist stance and declared pragmatism. Researchers also singled out in the party Russian integralism, Eurasianism, statism, and Putinism. According to the party&#x27;s 2003 political manifesto, &quot;The Path of National Success&quot;, the party&#x27;s goal is to unite the responsible political forces of the country, aiming to minimize the differences between rich and poor, young and old, state, business and society. The economy should combine state regulation and market freedoms, with the benefits of further growth distributed mostly to the less fortunate. The party rejects left-wing and right-wing ideologies in favour of &quot;political centrism&quot; that could unite all sections of society. In addition, the official party platform emphasizes pragmatism and anti-radicalism. The party regards itself as one of the heirs to Russia&#x27;s tradition of statehood, both tsarist and Soviet eras. United Russia&#x27;s long-time moniker is &quot;the party of real deeds&quot;.

In April 2005, State Duma Chairman Boris Gryzlov announced that United Russia was choosing a socially conservative policy. Gryzlov stressed that United Russia opposes &quot;both various kinds of communist restorationism and ultra-liberalism&quot;. He criticized the supporters of the liberal theory, which, in his opinion, &quot;reinforces the advantages of the strong and rich, gives them a head start, makes it difficult for new people and enterprises to enter.&quot; Since 2006, when Vladislav Surkov introduced the term sovereign democracy, many party figureheads have used the term. Former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has criticised the term. United Russia voted against the Council of Europe resolution 1481 (Need for international condemnation of crimes of communist governments).

The party supports the policies of the current government and the president. United Russia went to the 2007 parliamentary elections with slogans supporting the course of President Vladimir Putin and Putin&#x27;s plan. In 2009, the party proclaimed Russian conservatism as its official ideology. This was stated with complete clarity and certainty at the 11th Party Congress in St. Petersburg. On 21 November, the program document of the party was adopted, which stated: &quot;The ideology of the Party is Russian conservatism.&quot;
The program document of the United Russia party notes: &quot;Our absolute priority is people. This priority was gained by Russia - for centuries the price of human life was almost negligible. All human rights proclaimed by the Constitution and international law have the same, unconditional and supreme value for us: whether it be freedom of speech, freedom of movement, access to cultural values, the right to housing or social security.&quot;

The party has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism as well as scientific and technological progress. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, restoring Russia&#x27;s historical greatness, and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. Vladislav Surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin&#x27;s presidency.

In 2015, United Russia changed its ideology to liberal conservatism, which is right-leaning centrism. The change in United Russia&#x27;s positions was due to the economic crisis in Russia at the time. The charter states the main values of the party:
* well-being of a person: his health and longevity, social security, decent wages and opportunities for entrepreneurship, accessible infrastructure and a comfortable environment, freedom of creativity and spiritual search;
* unity and sovereignty of the country: common history and common victories, centuries-old experience of interethnic and interfaith harmony, political, legal, cultural unity of the country, intolerance to attempts to revise and distort the history of Russia, to any manifestations that destroy our country, to attempts of external interference in the life of the state;
* leadership and development of Russia: in improving the quality of life of people, in education and science, in modernizing the economy and infrastructure, in ensuring defense and security.

To comply with these values, per the charter, the party must:
* to be a team of like-minded people united for the sake of improving the lives of people and the breakthrough development of the country;
* to be the party of the popular majority - citizens of the country supporting the President of the Russian Federation and his strategic course;
* openly, honestly and professionally represent the interests of citizens in government and local self-government bodies;
* uncompromisingly and effectively control the fulfillment of the tasks set by the President of the Russian Federation, compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation;
* to be a political force that creates the basis for the future of Russia, supports and promotes the initiatives and projects of entrepreneurs, scientists, social activists, young leaders, advanced ideas, technologies and innovative solutions;
* protect human dignity and justice in society.

The United Russia party is also ideologically heterogeneous. It has a left, socially conservative &quot;wing&quot; and a right, liberal-conservative &quot;wing&quot;. There is also a national-conservative group in the party. They are officially recognized parts of the party as debating clubs. These are the &quot;liberal&quot; club &quot;November 4&quot;, the &quot;social&quot; club &quot;Center for Social Conservative Policy&quot;, as well as the State Patriotic Club. In cultural and social affairs, United Russia has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Mark Woods provides specific examples of how the Church under Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine. More broadly, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in September 2016 how that Church&#x27;s policy prescriptions support the Kremlin&#x27;s appeal to social conservatives:A fervent foe of homosexuality and any attempt to put individual rights above those of family, community or nation, the Russian Orthodox Church helps project Russia as the natural ally of all those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women&#x27;s and gay rights.

On 21 October 2021, Putin, speaking at the plenary session of the Valdai Discussion Club, announced the principles of the ideology of &quot;healthy conservatism&quot; at the heart of Russia&#x27;s approaches. According to Putin, a conservative approach does not mean &quot;thoughtless guarding&quot;, fear of change and playing for hold or &quot;locking in one&#x27;s own shell.&quot; According to the president, moderate conservatism is a reliance on traditions, the preservation and growth of the population, a real assessment of oneself and others, the precise alignment of a system of priorities, the correlation of what is necessary and what is possible, the prudent formulation of goals, and the principled rejection of extremism as a way of action.

=== &quot;Putin&#x27;s Plan&quot; ===

Putin&#x27;s Plan is an ideological cliché introduced to refer to the political and economic program of Russia&#x27;s second president, Vladimir Putin, for later use in United Russia&#x27;s election campaign in the 2007 Duma elections. It was used in the slogan &quot;Putin&#x27;s plan is Russia&#x27;s victory&quot; on the cover of a brochure and outdoor campaign advertising. In the election program of the United Russia party for the 2007 parliamentary elections, the &quot;Putin&#x27;s Plan&quot; was formulated as follows:

Later, an illustrated brochure &quot;Putin&#x27;s Plan&quot; was published and distributed free of charge as an election advertisement for United Russia.

=== Sovereign democracy ===

In February 2006, the party&#x27;s official website published a transcript of a speech by Vladislav Surkov, deputy head of the presidential administration of Russia, to the audience of the United Russia Center for Party Education and Personnel Training, in which he made an attempt &quot;to describe recent history in assessments and from the point of view that generally corresponds to the course of the president, and through this to formulate our main approaches to what was before and what will happen to us in the future.&quot;

Surkov&#x27;s party was tasked with &quot;not just winning the parliamentary elections in 2007, but thinking about and doing everything to ensure the dominance of the party for at least 10-15 years to come.&quot; In order to maintain positions, Surkov advised members to &quot;master the ideology&quot; - and to do this, create &quot;permanent groups for propaganda support in the fight against political opponents&quot; in the regions. The term &quot;sovereign democracy&quot; became the core concept of Surkov&#x27;s ideological platform. Subsequently, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev noted that he supported &quot;genuine democracy ... or simply democracy in the presence of a comprehensive state sovereignty.&quot;

===Federal party projects===
Federal party projects were created on 13 November 2013. A party project is understood as a set of measures at the federal level, united by common goals, executors, and implementation deadlines, ensuring the achievement of the goals and objectives set by the party. The purpose of the federal project is to implement in more than one constituent entity of the Russian Federation initiative projects and programs relevant to all citizens of the Russian Federation aimed at modernizing primary health care, building new schools and kindergartens, developing road infrastructure, building sports and recreation centres and developing children&#x27;s sports, development of patriotism and cultural values in society, development of an accessible barrier-free environment, assistance to the older generation, improvement of yards and public spaces, solving environmental problems, and development of the village and industry. To date, there are 15 federal party projects:
* Safe Roads
* Urban Environment
* Children&#x27;s Sports
* One Country – Accessible Environment
* Healthy Future
* Historical memory
* A strong family
* Culture of a Small Motherland
* Locomotives of growth
* People&#x27;s Control
* New school
* Russian Village
* Older generation
* Clean Country
* School of a competent consumer

=== Party position on major social issues ===
On 19 June 2018, deputies of the State Duma from United Russia almost unanimously (except for Natalia Poklonskaya) supported in the first reading the government bill on raising the retirement age, rejected by the majority of Russians and all opposition factions. According to earlier statements by its leaders, the party was categorically against raising the retirement age, and against lengthening the working week and increasing housing and communal services tariffs relative to inflation. In the early 2010s, United Russia noted that the achievement of their team&#x27;s work in power was the growth in the income level of Russian citizens by 2.4 times and the income level of pensioners by 3.3 times over ten years.

====Socially significant initiatives and bills of 2021====
* At the initiative of United Russia, disability pensions and other social benefits are now assigned on an unclaimed basis.
* In May 2021, a law was passed to combat &quot;black collectors&quot;. Illegal debt recovery activities are punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 years.
* From 20 May 2021, parents can refund 50% of the cost of their children&#x27;s trips to health camps. The refund period is, at most, five days. One of the main conditions is that tickets must be paid for with a Mir card (the program was valid until the end of 2021).
* In June 2021, a law amended by United Russia was adopted on free connection to gas (the amendments aim at solve the task set by President Vladimir Putin - to bring gas to each section free of charge).

* On 17 December 2021, the State Duma adopted in the second reading a bill obliging owners of industrial enterprises to eliminate the consequences of a negative environmental impact. The norms of the bill are proposed to be extended to include coal mines.

==== Amendments to the 2022–2024 budget ====
When considering the draft budget for 2022–2024, the United Russia faction proposed the following amendments:
* On the provision of housing for disabled people registered before 1 January 2005
* On the system of long-term care for the elderly and disabled
* On subsidies for state support of certain public and other non-profit organizations
* On ensuring the availability of air transportation to the Far East for citizens
* On providing persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, including in combination with hepatitis B and C viruses, with antiviral drugs for medical use

The priorities were to support families with children and help the most vulnerable categories of citizens. The proposed amendments were taken into account when the budget was adopted.

===Manifestos===
====Draft Manifesto 2002====
On 23 December 2002, published a draft manifesto for United Russia, which, in particular, contained the following promises:
United Russia did not accept this draft manifesto, but political opponents of United Russia repeatedly used it to illustrate the party&#x27;s activities. United Russia supporters claim that this manifesto is fake. According to Dmitry Rogozin, &quot;this is the most real final document of the seminar of the leaders of the regional branches of United Russia, proposed for discussion by the general council of this party.&quot; Political journalist Oleg Kashin pointed to a discussion in his blog dated 17 January 2003 of the draft manifesto, located on the official website of United Russia. Later, Kashin wrote that &quot;Alexander Bespalov, who at that time headed the General Council of United Russia, soon lost his post and, as they said, the formal reason for this was precisely that slanderous manifesto, which since then United Russia has preferred not to remember, and its opponents, on the contrary, like to remember.&quot;

Also noteworthy is the version according to which the draft is both a fake in the sense that it was not officially adopted and genuine in the sense that it was prepared by a group of United Russia political technologists, and the publication of the &quot;raw&quot; draft manifesto was a reflection of the intra-party struggle. Political technologist Vyacheslav Smirnov, who in 2002 was a member of the campaign headquarters of United Russia, notes that the text was authored by a group led by the St. Petersburg sociologist Yu. Krizhanskaya:

Political scientist Pavel Danilin noted:
====Manifesto 2003====
The manifesto, approved by the 2nd Congress of the All-Russian Political Party &quot;Unity and Fatherland - United Russia&quot; on 29 March 2003, did not contain specific dates, figures and promises, but in spirit and name &quot;The Path of National Success&quot; corresponded to the project.

This document ended with the program slogan &quot;We believe in ourselves and in Russia!&quot;.

=== Electorate ===
According to studies, United Russia voters in 2006 were younger and more market-oriented than the average voter. The party&#x27;s electorate includes a substantial share of state employees, pensioners and military personnel who are dependent on the state for their livelihood. Sixty-four percent of United Russia supporters are female. In the run-up to the 2011 Duma elections, it was reported that support for United Russia was growing among young people.

=== Foreign opinions ===
Foreign media and observers describe United Russia as a pure &quot;presidential party&quot;, with the main goal of securing the power of the Russian President in the Russian parliament. The vast majority of officeholders in Russia are members of the party, hence it is sometimes described as a &quot;public official party&quot; or &quot;administration party&quot;. Due to this, it is also often labelled the &quot;Party of Power&quot;.

==== International activities and alliances ====
United Russia is active in international activities, develops and strengthens ties with political parties of other states, and establishes constructive interaction and cooperation with them. To date, the party has 58 agreements on interaction and cooperation. In pursuance of the provisions of these agreements, constant bilateral inter-party consultations, exchange of delegations, participation in the work of congresses of partner parties, and holding forums and round tables are carried out. Joint consultations and exchange of information take place on the most pressing issues of our time, on the issues of bilateral relations, exchange of experience in the areas of party building, organizational work, youth policy, the use of new information and communication technologies in political activities, work in parliament and government, and other areas of mutual interest. The most important vector of international work is interaction with the political parties of the CIS countries. Contacts are also effectively developing on the Eastern Track, where strategic partnership relations have been established with the ruling parties of China and Vietnam. One of the most important areas of interaction between Russia and China is the cooperation between United Russia and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). An important format of inter-party interaction, fixed in the text of the bilateral protocol, is the holding of dialogue meetings and the forum United Russia-CCP, regularly organized since 2007, alternately on the territory of Russia and China. In 2007, United Russia signed a cooperation agreement with the Kazakh Nur Otan party, as well as the Ukrainian Party of Regions; in 2008, with the South Ossetian Unity Party; in 2010, with the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party, which in the Soviet years collaborated with the CPSU, as well as the Serbian Progressive Party, the Kyrgyz Ar-Namys Party, and the Georgian A Just Georgia Party.

In July 2008, the media, citing Konstantin Kosachev and Boris Gryzlov, reported United Russia&#x27;s entry into the Asia-Pacific branch of the Centrist Democrat International. Representatives of United Russia also attended a congress of the center-right European People&#x27;s Party, with which Mikheil Saakashvili, Yulia Tymoshenko, Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Silvio Berlusconi, José Manuel Barroso, and Herman Van Rompuy are associated, in December 2009, without formally applying for a membership. The further fate of these relationships is unknown. However, a few years later, the party and its leader Vladimir Putin, according to several news agencies, began to increasingly actively oppose their ideology to the Western one and, at the same time, position themselves as conservatives (in world politics, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and George W. Bush are considered well-known conservatives). In 2014, journalist Alexei Venediktov characterized party leader Vladimir Putin&#x27;s views as right-wing: &quot;If Putin lived in America, he would be a member of the right wing of the Republican Party. Vladimir Vladimirovich is becoming more conservative, he is moving towards the conservative, reactionary wing of the Republican Party, much more to the right than McCain. McCain is a liberal by his side.&quot; Russian political scientists and Western politicians have repeatedly noted the indistinctness and inconsistency of United Russia&#x27;s positioning.

In 2016, United Russia signed the Lovcen Declaration with the leader of the Montenegrin Democratic People&#x27;s Party, Milan Knezevic, later joined by the leader of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro, Srdjan Milic. United Russia has signed cooperation agreements with right-wing populist parties, such as Freedom Party of Austria, as well as the Republican Party of Armenia, the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party, the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, and the italian League for Salvini Premier. Its youth wing, the Young Guard of United Russia, has an alliance with the youth wing of Alternative for Germany, Young Alternative for Germany. The party has also signed cooperation agreements with the Serb nationalist Alliance of Independent Social Democrats of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Estonian Centre Party (though party leader Jüri Ratas recently claimed that the agreement has not been active for ten years and that there is no current cooperation between the parties). The party has proposed a cooperation agreement to the Five Star Movement (M5S). The M5S never gave a proper answer to the proposal and it is currently unknown whether it actually accepted the proposal or not.

United Russia has signed cooperation agreements with a number of big tent and left-wing parties, including Kazakhstan&#x27;s Nur Otan party, the Serbian Progressive Party, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party, the Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party, the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Tajikistan, the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova, the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, the Communist Party of Vietnam, South Africa&#x27;s African National Congress, the New Azerbaijan Party, the Prosperous Armenia party, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party – Syria Region, the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Philippines&#x27; PDP–Laban party, and the Latvian Harmony Centre Party. The party used to have an agreement with the Latvian Social Democratic Party &quot;Harmony&quot;, but the agreement lapsed in 2016 and was not renewed.

Until 2014, United Russia was in the European Democrat Group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe alongside the British Conservative Party, Polish Law and Justice and Turkish Justice and Development Party. United Russia has also signed cooperation agreements.
===== United States =====
On 20 September 2012, the United States State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland announced that United Russia had for several years taken part in programs funded through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which the United States is implementing through the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and International Republican Institute (IRI). Member of the Presidium of the General Council of United Russia and the Federation Council of Russia Andrey Klimov, who oversees the interaction of United Russia with international organizations, said that United Russia has never taken part in any programs of USAID or its partner organizations. Politician Boris Nemtsov responded that he had documented evidence of United Russia&#x27;s cooperation with USAID. Political scientist Sergei Markov, who worked for NDI in the 1990s, elaborated on United Russia&#x27;s ties to USAID. According to Konstantin Kosachev, United Russia maintains international ties with the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. In these parties, the maintenance of international contacts is entrusted to the IRI and NDI.

===== Inter-party cooperation in 2018–2021 =====
The inter-party dialogue in the BRICS format has been actively developed in the 2010s. The party attaches particular importance to such an authoritative association as the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP). Today, this largest inter-party structure in the world has united over three hundred political parties of the Eurasian continent and has established strong ties with similar organizations in Africa and Latin America. United Russia not only actively participates in the work of the ICAPP but is also a member of its governing body - the Standing Committee.

The largest forum of the ICAPP, its 10th General Assembly, was held in October 2018 in Moscow with the participation of 400 representatives of 74 parties from 42 countries. The final Moscow declaration of the assembly contains an appeal to the world&#x27;s parties to jointly fight against terrorism, extremism, and outside interference in the internal affairs of states and for equality, social justice, and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries and peoples. In July 2020, under the leadership of party chairman Dmitry Medvedev, a round table of representatives of the leading parties in Europe, Asia, and Africa was held on the issues of consolidating efforts in the fight against COVID-19 and its socio-economic consequences.

In the summer and autumn of 2020, Internet conferences were held between United Russia and the political parties of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, with public associations of Russian compatriots living on all continents, a meeting of international secretaries of African countries and the international commission of United Russia was held. At the party&#x27;s initiative, on 24–25 March 2021, the first-ever international inter-party conference &quot;Russia-Africa: Reviving Traditions&quot; was held. Delegates from 50 leading African parliamentary parties, heads of state, and ministers participated in its work, and more than 12,500 people from 56 countries watched the discussions.

As part of the preparations for the Russia-Africa: Reviving Traditions conference, as well as following its results, several agreements on interaction and cooperation were signed with the leading political parties of the African continent. United Russia is actively working to support compatriots living abroad. Thus, in the summer of 2021, several events took place in multilateral and bilateral formats, in which Russians living in all corners of the globe took part. To strengthen this vector, as well as inter-party work in the international direction in general, on the initiative of President Vladimir Putin, a commission of the General Council of the party for international cooperation and support for compatriots abroad was created. The commission&#x27;s main task was to implement the provisions of the Foreign and Defense Policy section of the People&#x27;s Program adopted at the 20th Party Congress in August 2021. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov became the chairman of this commission.

===Interaction with other Russian political parties===
====Agrarian Party of Russia====
On 28 April 2004, at the 12th Congress of the Agrarian Party of Russia, with the recommendations of the Chairman of the State Duma of Russia, Boris Gryzlov, a new chairman of the Agrarian Party, Vladimir Plotnikov, was elected. Since the election, the party began open cooperation with United Russia. In 2008, the Agrarian Party of Russia announced its dissolution and joined United Russia. In 2012, the Agrarian Party of Russia was re-established under the chairmanship of Olga Bashmachnikova, executive director of the Association of Peasants&#x27; (Farmers&#x27;) Households and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia (AKKOR), an association headed by Vladimir Plotnikov, a member of the Presidium of the General Council of United Russia.

====A Just Russia====
On 8 February 2010, A Just Russia, whose chairman in 2006–2011 and again since 2013 was the Chairman of the Federation Council of Russia (2001–2011) Sergey Mironov, concluded a political agreement with the United Russia party, in which both parties declared that they were committed to striving for coalition actions: A Just Russia supports the strategic course of acting President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin on strategic issues, and United Russia supports Mironov as Speaker of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. The parties to the agreement expressed their readiness to work together in resolving personnel issues, including those based on the election results, by concluding package agreements when forming governing bodies. However, this agreement was annulled a month after the signing since, according to Mironov, United Russia did not fulfil the terms. In March 2011, Mironov announced his refusal to support the candidate from the United Russia party in the upcoming 2012 presidential elections.

On 18 May 2011, at the suggestion of the United Russia faction in the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg, Sergei Mironov was recalled from the post of representative of the Legislative Assembly of the city in the Federation Council, thus losing the post of Chairman of the Federation Council, as well as the mandate of a senator. A Just Russia endorsed the United Russia presidential candidate in the 2018 Russian presidential election and in the 2024 Russian presidential election.

====Antifascist Pact====
On 20 February 2006, in Moscow, at the initiative of United Russia, 12 Russian political parties signed the so-called &quot;antifascist pact&quot;. An agreement on combating nationalism, xenophobia, and religious hatred was signed by United Russia, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Agrarian Party of Russia, the Union of Right Forces, Socialist United Party of Russia, the Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice, Patriots of Russia, the Russian United Industrial Party, the Russian Peace Party, Civilian Power, the Party of Social Justice, and the Democratic Party of Russia. Acting United Russia General Council Secretary Vyacheslav Volodin called on all parties to unite around the pact, stressing that those who do not &quot;should withdraw from political life and become pariahs.&quot; The Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Rodina, and Yabloko remained outside the pact, skeptically assessing the document, and the last two refused to participate in the pact due to the participation of the Liberal Democratic Party in it. The Communist Party refused to participate in the pact since, in their opinion, United Russia staged a PR on this topic to increase their party&#x27;s popularity.

== Structure ==

In April 2008, United Russia amended Section 7 of its charter, changing its heading from Party Chairman to Chairman of the Party and Chairman of the Party&#x27;s Supreme Council. Under the amendments, United Russia may introduce a supreme elective post in the party, the post of the party&#x27;s chairman, at the suggestion of Supreme Council and its chairman. The Supreme Council, led by the Supreme Council chairman, defines the strategy for the development of the party. The General Council has 152 members, is the foremost party platform in between party congresses and issues statements on important social or political questions. The Presidium of the General Council is led by a secretary, consists of 23 members and leads the political activity of the party, for instance election campaigns or other programmatic publications.

United Russia introduced a local chapter system that mimicked the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party&#x27;s (LDP) organization as a strong foundation for the one-party dominant system in the early 2000s. United Russia eagerly interviewed the LDP mission and studied their party structure. The number of party members was steadily increased by the introduction of the system. As of 20 September 2005, the party has a total of 2,600 local and 29,856 primary offices. United Russia runs local and regional offices in all parts of the Russian Federation and also operates a foreign liaison office in Israel through a deal with the Kadima party.

== Program and charter ==

The officially registered charter of the United Russia party was available on the website of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. In 2010, the Ministry of Justice website also contained the United Russia program dated 1 December 2001. There is currently no mention of the United Russia program on the website of the Ministry of Justice. The current charter dates from 26 May 2012 and has undergone several changes compared to the 2001 charter.

On the official website of United Russia, as a program of the party until September 2011, the &quot;Election Program of the All-Russian Political Party &quot;United Russia&quot; &quot;Putin&#x27;s Plan is a Worthy Future of a Great Country&quot; was submitted, adopted by the 8th Party Congress on 1 October 2007. The previous election program, approved on 20 September 2003 at the 3rd Congress of the All-Russian Political Party &quot;Unity and Fatherland&quot; - &quot;United Russia&quot;, is not available on the official website, but copies are available on other sites. In particular, this program contained the following items:

Also on the official website is the policy statement of United Russia, adopted by the 7th Congress on 15 April 2008. In addition, on the official website of the United Russia party, there is a &quot;programme document&quot; called &quot;Russia: let&#x27;s save and increase!&quot;, adopted on 21 November 2009 at the 11th Party Congress in St. Petersburg. The &quot;programme document&quot;, in particular, states:

&quot;Strategy 2020&quot; is in fact another program of the party; however, unlike other programs and program documents, it is not framed as a separate completed document. Putin spoke about the &quot;Strategy 2020&quot; for the first time at the expanded meeting of the State Council of the Russian Federation &quot;On the Development Strategy of Russia until 2020&quot; on 8 February 2008 in Krasnoyarsk. The Strategy 2020 page has been removed from the United Russia official website but is still available on the Internet Archive. &quot;The official website of the expert groups updating the Strategy 2020&quot; is located on the RIA Novosti web portal. In May 2011, at the suggestion of Putin, then Prime Minister of Russia and chairman of the United Russia party, a coalition of public organizations with the participation of United Russia was created - the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front. The Front&#x27;s and United Russia&#x27;s election programs, the &quot;People&#x27;s Program&quot;, were approved at the 12th Party Congress of United Russia on 23 and 24 September 2011. At Putin&#x27;s suggestion as party chairman, the Institute for Socio-Economic and Political Research was created to prepare the Front&#x27;s program, headed by Senator Nikolay Fyodorov, but the final scenario has changed.

=== Programs and policy message 2011 ===
On 24 September 2011, acting President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin spoke at the 12th Congress of United Russia. Medvedev identified seven strategic priorities for government policy: modernizing the economy; fulfilment of social obligations; rooting out corruption; strengthening the judiciary; maintaining interethnic and interfaith peace and combating illegal migration and ethnic crime; the formation of a modern political system; internal and external security, independent and reasonable foreign policy of Russia. Putin, in turn, set a goal for Russia to become one of the world&#x27;s five largest economies and proposed writing off the erroneous tax debt of 36 million Russians in the amount of 30 billion rubles and raising salaries for public sector workers by 6.5% from 10 October. Vladimir Putin also noted that taxes for wealthy citizens should be higher than for the middle class and suggested raising housing and communal services tariffs only above the established norm. Putin also set as priorities the complete rearmament of the army and navy in 5–10 years, the doubling of the pace of road construction in 10 years, and the creation or renewal of 25 million jobs in 20 years.

After Medvedev and Putin&#x27;s speeches were met with stormy, prolonged applause, State Duma Vice Speaker Oleg Morozov suggested that these speeches be considered the party&#x27;s program for the elections. The congress unanimously approved the party&#x27;s pre-election program proposed in this form for the upcoming Duma elections. According to the authors of Gazeta.Ru, this is how the so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Programme&quot;, an extensive document that the institute of Senator Nikolai Fyodorov prepared all summer long, publicly collecting &quot;instructions&quot; of voters and recommendations of experts throughout the country, lost its pre-election status. The document was supposed to be presented at the congress but was absent without explanation. Later, the Secretary of the United Russia General Council, Sergey Neverov, noted that the People&#x27;s Program, or the &quot;Program of People&#x27;s Initiatives&quot;, published on 23 October 2011, is considered by United Russia as a plan for the development of the country and should be considered as a whole with the program appeal of the party. Neverov said that United Russia&#x27;s program address contains the strategic goals of the country&#x27;s development set by Putin and Medvedev, and the &quot;People&#x27;s Initiatives Program&quot; contains tactical steps to achieve these goals.

On 14 October 2011, United Russia published a &quot;programme appeal&quot; composed of replicas of speeches by acting President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at the party congress. According to Gazeta.ru experts, the document resembles a text from the Brezhnev era and is consistent with forebodings of the coming stagnation. Later, the &quot;programme appeal&quot; was published with the addition &quot;Approved by the 12th Congress of the All-Russian Political Party United Russia&quot; on 24 September 2011&quot; and the subtitle &quot;Election Program of the All-Russian Political Party &quot;United Russia&quot; for the Election of Deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the Sixth Convocation (Programme Appeal of the United Russia Party to the Citizens of Russia)&quot;. The programme appeal, in addition to general words, contains the following specific points:
# &quot;To be strong and in the next five years to enter the top five largest economies in the world&quot;
# &quot;The national goal for the next 20 years is to radically upgrade or create at least 25 million modern jobs in industry and in the public sector&quot;
# &quot;In the next 5 years, we will ensure the almost complete independence of the country in all basic types of food&quot;
# &quot;By the end of 2014, the average wage in the country should increase by 1.5 times&quot;
# &quot;In two years, the wage fund in healthcare will grow by 30 percent. Already next year, the salaries of school teachers and teachers of all Russian universities will equal or exceed the average salary in the economy in all regions of Russia without exception.&quot;
# &quot;In 5 years we must build at least 1,000 new schools in Russia, and in the same 5 years we must not have a single school in disrepair&quot;
# &quot;Affordable housing for every Russian family. By 2016, it is necessary to almost double the volume of housing construction&quot;
# &quot;Already in the near future, following the decline in inflation, we intend to ensure a further reduction in annual rates on mortgage loans&quot;
# &quot;As planned, we will provide housing for all participants in the Great Patriotic War.&quot;

In the same address, United Russia nominated Putin for the post of President of Russia and Medvedev for Prime Minister. On 27 November 2011, after the closing of the second part of the 12th Congress of United Russia, at which Vladimir Putin was officially nominated as a candidate for the presidency of Russia, a document appeared on the official website of United Russia entitled &quot;Election program of the United Russia party in the elections President of Russia&quot;.

=== Party report on the implementation of the 2016 program ===
Party chairman Dmitry Medvedev presented a report on the party&#x27;s work over the last five years at a joint meeting of the Supreme and General Councils of United Russia, which was held on 9 June 2021 in Moscow. According to him, the vast majority of the provisions of the 2016 program have either been implemented or are under implementation. Among the achievements of the party, he noted amendments to the labor code, including those regulating the position of remote workers, supporting small businesses, regulating the status of the self-employed, the adoption of a law on free hot meals for schoolchildren, on the priority right of brothers and sisters to go to the same school or kindergarten, and extending the maternity capital program until 2026. At the same time, the process of reporting to voters the work of the past five years began at the federal and regional levels. Deputies from the party at all levels had to report to their voters about the changes that had taken place with the participation of United Russia.

==== Implementation of the 2016 program ====
In August 2021, Secretary of the General Council of the party Andrey Turchak announced the annual report of the deputies of United Russia to his voters. This will become a mandatory norm for United Russia.

=== Moral code ===
At the 18th Party Congress (December 2018), rules of conduct were adopted, binding on all party members. It highly recommends to:
* be humble
* be discreet in public
* protect honor and dignity by legal means
* leave the party in case of committing &quot;illegal or immoral acts&quot;
* treat people and their problems with attention and respect, protect the rights of citizens
* help Russians in overcoming difficult life situations
* be intolerant of attempts to distort the history of Russia, trample on traditions, and show disrespect for culture
* be responsible for your words

=== People&#x27;s Program 2021 ===
The people&#x27;s program of the party was prepared during the 2021 election campaign. It was based on the April message of President Putin and the results of a survey of more than two million Russians. Its totality is positioned as a plan for the country&#x27;s development over the next five years. The collection of proposals started in June 2021, and the website np.er.ru was explicitly created to receive feedback from voters. President Putin took part in preparing the proposals and proposed some measures of social support for citizens and projects for the country&#x27;s development at the second stage of the United Russia congress on 24 August 2021.

All program points have passed preliminary discussions with experts, deputies, and officials of relevant departments. Among other things, some proposals were discussed in the created headquarters of public support with the participation of representatives of the federal five of the party list: Anna Kuznetsova, Sergey Lavrov, Sergei Shoigu, Yelena Shmelyova, and Denis Protsenko. The people&#x27;s program of &quot;United Russia&quot; consists of two main sections: &quot;People&#x27;s Wellbeing&quot; and &quot;Strong Russia&quot;. Each includes topics covering all spheres of life of every inhabitant of the country. The &quot;People&#x27;s Wellbeing&quot; section includes several blocks: &quot;Good work – prosperity in the house&quot;, &quot;Strong family&quot;, &quot;Human health&quot;, &quot;Care for all who need it&quot;, &quot;Modern education and advanced science&quot;, &quot;Convenient and comfortable life&quot;, &quot;Ecology for life&quot;, &quot;State for the human&quot;. The second section, &quot;Strong Russia&quot;, includes such topics as &quot;Economics of Development&quot;, &quot;Rural Development&quot;, &quot;Development of the Regions and Transport Infrastructure of the Country&quot;, &quot;Culture, History, Traditions&quot;, &quot;Civil Solidarity and Youth Policy&quot;, and &quot;Foreign and defense policy&quot;. The program commission of the party, which includes party and external experts and representatives of relevant ministries and the public, will control the implementation of the People&#x27;s Program.

== Governing bodies ==
United Russia consists of regional branches, one per subject of the federation, regional branches from local branches, one per urban district or municipal district, local branches from primary branches, one per urban settlement or rural settlement. The supreme body is the congress; between congresses, it is the General Council (until 2004, the Central Political Council). The executive bodies are the Presidium of the General Council and the Central Executive Committee. The highest official is the Chairman. The supreme audit body is the Central Control and Audit Commission.

The supreme body of a regional branch is the conference of the regional branch; between conferences of the regional branch, it is the regional political council. The executive bodies of the regional branch are the presidium of the regional political council and the regional executive committee. The auditing bodies of the regional branch is the regional control and audit commission. The highest official of the regional branch is the secretary regional branch.

The supreme body of the local branch is the conference of the local branch. Between the conference of the local branch, it is the local political council. The highest official of the local branch is the secretary of the local branch. The executive body of the local branch is the local executive committee. The auditing body of the local branch is the local control and audit commission. The supreme body of the primary branch is the general meeting; between general meetings, it is the council of the primary branch. The highest official of the primary branch is the secretary of the primary branch.

=== Party congress ===
The highest body of the party is the party congress. The congress resolves the most important issues, including the creation or liquidation of structural divisions, central and governing bodies, determines the main directions of the activity of the political association, and approves the charter and program documents. The congress makes decisions on the participation of the party in elections at various levels, including nominating and recalling candidates for the post of President of Russia and deputies of the State Duma, electing the chairman of the party, the head and members of the Supreme Council, the composition of the General Council and the Central Control Commission, and also makes decisions on early termination of their powers.

As a rule, the Congress is convened by the General Council of the Party or its Presidium once a year. An extraordinary congress may be convened by the decision of the governing bodies of United Russia or at the suggestion of more than one-third of its regional branches. In the entire history of the party, 20 congresses have passed. In 2020, the congress was not held due to the unfavourable epidemiological situation.

=== Party Chairman ===
According to the charter of United Russia, the party congress has the right, at the suggestion of the chairman of the Supreme Council, to establish the highest elective position: the chairman of the party. The position was introduced at the 5th Party Congress on 27 November 2004. The chairman is elected by open vote at the party congress; a candidate must gain two-thirds of the delegates&#x27; votes for election. The party chairman represents it in relations with Russian, international, and foreign state and non-state bodies and organizations, public associations, individuals and legal entities, and the media. The Chairman opens the United Russia congress, chairs its governing bodies&#x27; meetings, and also proposes candidates for election or appointment to some positions. Boris Gryzlov was the first chairman of the party. On 7 May 2008, at the 9th Party Congress, non-partisan Vladimir Putin was elected chairman, for which the charter was previously changed. On 26 May 2012, at the 13th Party Congress, Dmitry Medvedev was elected chairman of United Russia, having joined the party before the congress.

The position of party chairman should not be confused with that of the chairman of the party&#x27;s Supreme Council, who, according to the charter, &quot;is the highest elected official of the party.&quot; Since the introduction of this position in April 2008, Boris Gryzlov has been the Chairman of the Supreme Council of United Russia. Initially, the party&#x27;s governing bodies were the General Council (15 people), the Central Executive Committee, the Supreme Council, and the Central Political Council (liquidated in November 2004).

=== Supreme Council ===
Consisting of 100 members, the Supreme Council determines the development strategy of the party and provides support for the implementation of the program and charter. In addition, it contributes to strengthening the authority and growth of the influence of the party in Russian society. The Supreme Council is elected from among prominent public and political figures of the Russian Federation who have great authority in Russian society and in the international arena, including those who are not members of United Russia. The elections of the Supreme Council, as well as its chairman, are held by open voting at the party congress.

At the party congress on 4 December 2021, 98 members of the Supreme Council were elected and two seats remained vacant. Almost half of the staff has been updated: it includes such people as the presidential envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District Yuri Trutnev, State Duma Vice Speaker Sergei Neverov, chief doctor of the hospital in Kommunarka Denis Protsenko, People&#x27;s Artist of Russia Vladimir Mashkov, Deputy Chairman of the Committee of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on Youth Policy Mikhail Kiselyov, First Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Protection and Chairman of the Public Council of the Strong Family party project Olga Batalina, President of the all-Russian public organization of small and medium-sized businesses &quot;Support of Russia&quot; Alexander Kalinin, and General Director of the ANO &quot;Agency for Strategic Initiatives to Promote New Projects&quot; Svetlana Chupsheva. The Supreme Council also includes a number of regional governors. The Chairman of the Supreme Council is Boris Gryzlov.

=== General Council ===
The General Council directs the activities of United Russia between its congresses. It ensures the implementation of all party decisions, develops draft election programs and other documents, recommendations on the main directions of the political strategy, and directs the political activities of the party. To date, it includes 170 people (the number of members is determined by the congress), who are elected at the congress by secret ballot. At the same time, the composition of the council is subject to annual rotation of at least 15%, according to the charter.

=== Presidium of the General Council ===
The leadership of the General Council is entrusted to its secretary and presidium. The Presidium directs the party&#x27;s political activities: from the development of draft election programs to organizational, party, and ideological documents. Its competence includes making decisions on convening an extraordinary congress and creating and liquidating regional branches. The presidium has the right to approve the budget of the party and also, on the proposal of the bureau of the Supreme Council, to submit to the congress a proposal to nominate a candidate for the post of President of Russia and nominate lists of candidates for deputies of the State Duma. The secretary of the presidium of the General Council directs the activities of the presidium and is authorized to make political statements on behalf of the party, put the first signature on the financial documents of the party, sign documents related to the competence of the General Council and its presidium. Sergey Neverov was the Acting Secretary of the Presidium of the General Council of the Party from 21 October 2010. On 15 September 2011, Neverov, at the suggestion of Putin, was approved as secretary.

On 12 October 2017, Andrey Turchak became secretary. To date, the Presidium of the General Council includes 35 people. Their number and personal composition were approved on 4 December 2021 at the United Russia party congress. Andrey Turchak was re-elected Secretary of the General Council.

=== Party Central Executive Committee ===
The Party Central Executive Committee is the main executive body, supervising the work of regional branches. It also organizes the work of several party institutions and is responsible for interaction with the United Russia faction in the State Duma. The term of office of the CEC expires after the completion of the regular elections to the State Duma, after which a new structure is approved at the party congress. Alexander Sidyakin became the head of the Central Executive Committee at the congress on 4 December 2021. From 2009 to 2011, Sidyakin was the secretary of the movement of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, the head of the department for collective action and the development of the trade union movement of the FNPR. In 2011, Sidyakin became a State Duma deputy from United Russia, where he worked as deputy chairman of the State Duma committee on housing policy and housing and communal services. After the 2016 elections, he became the first deputy head of the same committee and, in 2017, a member of the Presidium of the United Russia General Council. Many political scientists associated Alexander Sidyakin&#x27;s appointment with his extensive experience in technological and legislative work and with the need to transform the central executive committee of United Russia into a permanent electoral headquarters.

=== Regional branches ===
Regional branches were created in all subjects of the Russian Federation, including Crimea. Like the federal structure, the supreme political body of the region is the regional conference of the party, which approves the quantitative and personal composition of the regional political council and the presidium of the regional political council. The party&#x27;s main executive body in the region is the regional executive committee. The chief political head of the regional branch of the party is the secretary of the regional political council. The head of the executive committee is responsible for the entire organizational component of the work of the regional branch. Local party branches are created in the region&#x27;s municipalities and are accountable for their work to the regional party branch. They also consist of local political councils headed by the secretary of the local branch and local executive committees headed by the head of the local executive committee.

Since 2019, United Russia has begun to apply the practice of appointing regional governors as secretaries of regional political councils. In 2019, thirteen governors were appointed: Marat Kumpilov in the Republic of Adygea, Gleb Nikitin in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Aisen Nikolayev in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Andrey Travnikov in the Novosibirsk Oblast, Radiy Khabirov in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Kazbek Kokov in the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, Oleg Kozhemyako in the Primorsky Krai, Vladimir Vladimirov in the Stavropol Krai, Igor Vasiliev in the Kirov Oblast, Dmitry Azarov in the Samara Oblast, Alexander Bogomaz in the Bryansk Oblast, Andrey Chibis in the Murmansk Oblast, and Mikhail Razvozhayev, Acting Head of Sevastopol.

== Party institutions ==
=== Young Guard of United Russia ===

The Young Guard of United Russia (MGER) is a youth public association with a fixed membership, founded on 16 November 2005. The Young Guard supports the party&#x27;s course and acts as its personnel reserve.

=== Interregional conferences ===
In March 2010, United Russia launched interregional conferences dedicated to the socio-economic development of federal districts. The conferences aim to define a clear and concrete development plan for each region for 2010-2012.

This involved the selection of extremely specific proposals and projects that could be implemented in the short term. At the conference&#x27;s plenary sessions, the drafts were presented to Putin, who was then party leader. The first interregional conference was held in the Siberian Federal District in Krasnoyarsk (29–30 March 2010) and Novosibirsk (9 April 2010). It was called &quot;Development of Siberia 2010–2012&quot;. The second conference was held in the North Caucasian Federal District, in Nalchik and Kislovodsk, from 5 to 6 July 2010 and was called &quot;Development of the North Caucasus 2010–2012&quot;. The third conference, &quot;Development of the Volga Region 2010–2012&quot;, was held in Ulyanovsk (9 September 2010) and Nizhny Novgorod (14 September 2010).
The Interregional Party Conference of the Far Eastern Federal District &quot;Strategy for the socio-economic development of the Far East until 2020&quot; was held from 4 to 6 December 2010 in Khabarovsk. On it, Putin pointed out that one of the main problems for the Far East is the transport issue. He proposed significantly reducing flight prices within Russia and building new roads (in particular, by modernizing the Amur highway). He outlined the energy security of the Far East region as another significant problem. Putin promised to subsidize the supply of gas along the route Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok, which will significantly reduce the price for the end consumer.

At a party conference in the Central Federal District in Bryansk (3–4 March 2011), Putin invited party members to declare income and expenses. At the same time, specialists were asked to &quot;think about the tools&quot; of such control. Putin also demanded that the regional authorities restrain food prices, solve the problem of deceived equity holders by the end of 2012, and reduce the tax burden on small businesses. On 6 May 2011, the United Russia Interregional Conference was held in the Southern Federal District. It was held on the eve of the celebration of the next anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War in Volgograd. Putin again took part in the conference as party leader. To promote new business and social projects and support young professionals, Putin proposed the creation of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives; he also proposed the creation and formation of the All-Russia People&#x27;s Front.

On 30 June 2011, the interregional conference in the Ural Federal District was held in Yekaterinburg. On 5 September 2011, the last Interregional Conference was held in the Northwestern Federal District. At the conference in Cherepovets, Vladimir Putin touched upon many socio-economic and political issues. The acting prime minister also announced the need to form a petrochemical cluster in the Northwestern Federal District and support several projects in other regions of the district. During the five-hour conference, among other things, Putin proposed to allocate a lifting allowance of 1 million rubles to each young doctor working in the countryside and to organize a mortgage program for young teachers.

According to the charter, the party&#x27;s funds are formed from membership fees, federal budget funds provided per the legislation of the Russian Federation, donations, proceeds from events held by the party and its regional branches, as well as income from entrepreneurial activities, proceeds from civil law transactions, and other receipts not prohibited by law. Membership fees are voluntary. The Presidium of the General Council of the Party determines the procedure for making membership fees and accounting for their payment.

Membership dues have never been the main source of income for the party. In 2002, the party collected 7.7 million rubles in membership fees; in 2008, it collected 157.8 million rubles (7.6% of the party&#x27;s income). Donations from individuals did not play a significant role for the party - in 2009, 0.3% of the proceeds to the party were received under this item. The main funding source for the party in 2009 was donations from legal entities (63.8% of the party&#x27;s income) and state funding (26.8% of the party&#x27;s income). Consolidated financial reports for 2005–2011 are located on the party&#x27;s official website. Reports for 2005, 2006 and 2008 are not available, and the available ones are presented in non-textual form, which makes it impossible to search for information, including by search engines.

Donations made violating the Law on Political Parties include donations from persons who did not indicate all the necessary data in financial documents and donations from state or municipal enterprises or organizations that do not have the right to do so. For example, as a result of checking information on the receipt and expenditure of funds from the Moscow Regional Branch of United Russia for the 2nd quarter of 2012, it was found that a donation was received on 30 May 2012 of 30,000 rubles from OJSC Sergiyevo-Posadsky Electricity Network, the founder of which (share - 100%) is the administration of the Sergiyevo-Posadsky municipal district of the Moscow Oblast. The head of the district, V. S. Korotkov, is also the secretary of the local political council of United Russia. Most of the donations come from regional public foundations to support United Russia. The funds do not disclose who exactly gives them money; however, according to the heads of regional funds, mostly representatives of medium-sized businesses make donations. According to them, there is no &quot;coercion&quot;, as donors &quot;contribute as much as they can and want&quot; in response to a written or oral request.

The Tula United Russia Support Fund, headed by the Deputy Governor of the Tula Oblast, Vadim Zherzdev, in 2009 collected the maximum possible 43.3 million rubles under the law. The Moscow Regional Fund, headed by Igor Parkhomenko, First Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Moscow Oblast, raised the same amount. Chairman of the All-Russian Gas Society, State Duma deputy Valery Yazev, according to the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, was listed as the founder of five regional support funds: Yamalo-Nenets, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen, Khanty-Mansiysk, and Kurgan (and collected 83.7 million rubles in total in 2009).

In 2007, the largest donation came from Favor Capital LLC (19.9 million rubles), and three confectionery factories (Rot Front, Krasny Oktyabr, and Babaevsky) made the same contribution of 10 million rubles each. In 2009, the largest donation came from the OJSC &quot;Moscow Television Plant Rubin&quot; (43 million rubles); taking into account its subsidiaries, MTZ Rubin donated 47.8 million rubles. In 2011, the largest donation came from CJSC Mikhailovcement (43 million rubles). According to the calculations of the Vedomosti newspaper, United Russia received 6 billion rubles in donations between 2005 and 2009, with Eurocement Group, Russia&#x27;s largest cement producer, donating 253 million rubles, Mechel - 72 million, United Confectioners - 58.5 million rubles, and Motovilikha Plants - 48.7 million. With an annual profit of 2.1 million rubles, the Aksai Land enterprise managed to help United Russia with 30 million rubles over three years.

According to Vedomosti, the Peresvet Bank for Charity and Spiritual Development of Russia, whose founders include the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate and the Moscow Patriarchate and the Kaluga Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church, supported United Russia for 30 million rubles in 2005-2007; it provided support in 2002–2004, but the amounts remain unknown. In 2007, a letter from the secretary of the Kemerovo branch of United Russia, Gennady Dyudyaev, to the managing director of the Siberian Coal Energy Company was published on the Internet, in which he called the company&#x27;s refusal to help the party with money a refusal to support the creative course of the incumbent President Vladimir Putin and promised to &quot;inform the Administration of the President and the Governor of the Kemerovo Region about this.&quot; On 5 March 2013, TV Rain announced that the Mosenergosbyt company, under the guise of charitable activities, transferred 300 million rubles to the Sozidaniye fund, associated with the United Russia party fund, created in early February 2013 to conduct regional election campaigns.

At the end of March 2013, it became known that OJSC Yaroslavl Supply Company, which is a regional energy monopoly, transferred 55 million rubles to the United Russia Party Support Fund in just six months, which is approximately one-fifth of the company&#x27;s net profit in the first nine months of 2012. The board of directors of the company, who unanimously voted for the allocation of funds, consists of the secretary of the political council of the Yaroslavl regional branch of United Russia, member of the Federation Council Viktor Rogotsky, and Dmitry Vakhrukov, the son of the former governor of the Yaroslavl Oblast Sergey Vakhrukov, who led the regional electoral list of United Russia in the 2011 State Duma elections. This transfer was contrary to Article 30 of the Federal Law &quot;On Political Parties&quot;, which prohibits donations from Russian legal entities with foreign participation to a political party.

In 2014, funding for political parties from the federal budget sharply increased in Russia - now, for every vote received in the elections, the party began to receive 110 rubles (increased from 50 rubles before 2014). As a result, United Russia&#x27;s revenues increased from 3.4 billion rubles in 2014 to 5.2 billion rubles in 2015. In 2015, United Russia received 5,187,693,300 rubles (first place among political parties in Russia) and spent 4,292,304,600 rubles. The main share of United Russia&#x27;s income in 2015 was state funding (for votes received in elections) - 68.6% of income, the lowest percentage among parties that received state funding. The party&#x27;s spending structure in 2015 was as follows:
* Maintenance of the leading bodies of the party – 13.2%
* Maintenance of regional branches – 45.5%
* Transfers to election funds – 8.5%
* Campaign and propaganda activities (establishment and maintenance of own media, news agencies, printing houses, educational institutions, and the release of campaign and propaganda materials) – 14.3%
* Public events, conventions, meetings, and the like – 17.2%
* Other expenses – 1.3%

From these figures, in 2015, the main expenditure of United Russia was the maintenance of the central leadership and regional branches of the party. According to the report of the Golos movement, a third of the companies that donated more than 1 million rubles to United Russia in 2015 began to receive government contracts regularly and an order of magnitude larger than the amount invested. A similar connection was also found among patrons of the parties Communists of Russia and Patriots of Russia (who began to serve orders from the Russian Ministry of Defense). As RBC noted, the 2016 party primaries were won by eight company executives and private donors, who are among the twenty largest sponsors of the party.

===Financing of party projects===
On 18 May 2013, at a joint expanded meeting of the supreme and general councils of United Russia, it was announced that party projects would become one of the main activities of the party in the coming period. Then it was first indicated that they would be financed from the federal budget with the participation of the Russian government, chaired by party leader Dmitry Medvedev. Representatives of other political parties announced their readiness to apply to the Constitutional Court of Russia because they saw in these actions a violation of Article 13 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation (&quot;public associations are equal before the law&quot;, &quot;no ideology can be established as a state ideology&quot;).

==Symbolism==
The symbol of the party is a marching bear. The party congress on 26 November 2005 adopted decisions on changes in the party&#x27;s symbolism: instead of a brown bear, a white bear, outlined in blue along the contour, became the party symbol. Above the image of the bear is a fluttering Russian flag, and below the image of the bear is the inscription &quot;United Russia&quot;. On 12 July 2001, at the Union of &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Fatherland&quot; founding congress, the symbol of the new party was presented - a bear in a cap. Subsequently, it was never used again. The party uses the 1991–1993 Russian flag with an azure stripe in the middle instead of the current blue one.

===Slogans===
* &quot;We believe in ourselves and in Russia!&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Russia, forward!&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s save and increase!&quot; (2009)
* &quot;Unity, Spirituality, Patriotism&quot; (2010)
* &quot;The future is ours!&quot;, &quot;Together we will win!&quot; (2011)
* &quot;To act in the interests of the people is our task&quot;, &quot;To hear the voice of everyone is our duty&quot;, &quot;To create and protect the future of Russia is our goal&quot;, &quot;We made Russia United – Let&#x27;s make Russia Strong!&quot; (2016)

== Internal groupings and debate clubs ==
At the beginning of 2005, several active members made a public presentation of so-called &quot;socially oriented&quot; and &quot;right-liberal&quot; or &quot;liberal-conservative&quot; approaches to the development of the Russian economy and society. Some media outlets hastened to announce the breakup of the party into several wings and possibly factions, but party chairman Boris Gryzlov rejected this assumption, stating that the party should not be divided into left and right, &quot;there are interests of the country, its citizens, and we are united in defending them.&quot; As a result, the intra-party discussion in United Russia is focused on several ideological informal clubs.

The party has four internal groupings organized around common policy interests. In addition, the party uses four internal political clubs to debate policy: the liberal-conservative 4 November Club, social conservative Centre for Social Conservative Politics, conservative liberal State Patriotic Club, and liberal Liberal Club. Based on this division, the party considered entering the 2007 Duma elections as three separate &quot;columns&quot; (liberal, conservative and social), but the idea was subsequently abandoned.

=== 4 November Club ===

The goals and objectives of the club include:
* development of a liberal-conservative program for the development of the country and measures for its implementation;
* formation in the country of broad public support for the liberal-conservative path of development;
* organizing a broad discussion among the politically and economically active sections of Russian society;
* involvement in this work of public organizations, intellectuals, journalists;
* assistance in forming a configuration of socio-political forces adequate to the state of society on the eve of the 2007-2008 elections.

The club relies on the ideas formulated in the President&#x27;s message to the Federal Assembly in 2005. The club&#x27;s activities are concrete, pragmatic, and even &quot;lobbyist&quot; concerning those initiatives and actions that will be developed by the club or are consonant with its position. The club considers the party the most significant political partner but is a non-party platform. The club holds functions, including conferences, round tables, and seminars. A distinctive feature of the activity is the focus on the regions. One of the co-chairs of the club is the well-known journalist and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Expert&quot; magazine Valery Fadeyev.

=== Center for Social Conservative Policy ===

The non-profit partnership &quot;Center for Social and Conservative Policy&quot; is a private club for discussing social problems. It is a non-state and non-party organization, but each club member is somehow connected with the party and its faction in the State Duma of the Federal Assembly. At the same time, discussions within the club served as a medium for forming both currents in United Russia: liberal (Vladimir Pligin) and social (Andrey Isayev). The heads of relevant committees of the Duma, interested executive authorities, drafters of bills, and experts take part in the work of the &quot;round tables&quot; of the TsSKP, dedicated to certain areas of Russia&#x27;s modernization. The founders of the non-profit partnership &quot;Center for Social Conservative Policy&quot; are Leonid Goryainov, Igor Demin, Igor Igoshin, Andrey Isayev, Denis Kravchenko, and Konstantin Tarasov.

=== State Patriotic Club ===
The club&#x27;s main areas of work are:
* national unity and patriotism of action, effective public administration;
* regional development as a condition for ensuring the quality of life of Russian citizens and innovative development of the country.

The ideological basis for the SPC is the Political Declaration of the Club. The authors of the Declaration note that &quot;democracy and the development of public institutions, a competitive economy, and a stable geopolitical position of Russia are impossible without a strong and responsible state that is in organic unity with society on the basis of national history and culture, national traditions.&quot; Among the experts who spoke at the meetings of the club at various times were: Minister of Education of the Russian Federation Andrei Fursenko, Minister of Culture of the Russian Federation Aleksandr Avdeyev, Minister of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu, Head of the Moscow Department of Education Isaac Kalina, Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, film director and actor Nikita Mikhalkov, theater director Aleksandr Galibin, People&#x27;s Artist of Russia Yevgeny Steblov, and Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Stanislav Naumov.

Regional branches of the State Patriotic Club operate in 42 regions of Russia. The coordinators of the club are State Duma deputies Irina Yarovaya and Grigory Ivliev.

=== Liberal club ===
On 18 March 2010, the first meeting of the United Russia liberal club was held, which included representatives of business and culture. The club, in particular, included businessman Vadim Dymov, musician Igor Butman, deputy head of the party&#x27;s central executive committee Andrei Ilnitsky, State Duma deputy Vladimir Medinsky, State Duma deputy and lawyer Andrey Makarov, sociologist Olga Kryshtanovskaya, as well as some members of the 4 November club. The head of the public council under the presidium of the party&#x27;s general council for interaction with the media and the expert community, Alexey Chesnakov, explained the formation of another liberal club in the party by the fact that the liberals &quot;are not in the niche allocated to them by someone, even the best people.&quot; According to him, the difference between the new club and the already existing 4 November club is in organizational forms: a discussion platform without rigid membership.
On the air of Radio Svoboda, Olga Kryshtanovskaya, answering a question about the tasks of the new right-wing liberal club, stated the following: &quot;I would not say that the party declares that it needs such a new club. These are some members of the party, specific people have united because they feel that they are like-minded people. We are like-minded people, no one invited us anywhere. We just decided to create such a club ourselves in order to express our position. We have a common ideology.&quot; The ideology of the liberal club is neoconservatism.

=== Patriotic Platform ===
In 2012, following the results of the 13th Party Congress, a decision was made to transform the state-patriotic club into an independent patriotic platform of the party. Dmitry Medvedev also announced the need to restart the platform at the congress. Irina Yarovaya, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, was approved as the coordinator. As part of the platform&#x27;s activities, the work of the following federal projects was coordinated: IT Breakthrough, Libraries of Russia, Children&#x27;s Sports, the Gardener&#x27;s House is the Support of the Family, Historical Memory, Strong Family, Youth Anti-Corruption Project, People&#x27;s Control, Runet Development, and Own House.

On 5 April 2017, the Presidium of the General Council of United Russia approved Dmitry Sablin, deputy of the State Duma and first deputy chairman of the All-Russian Public Organization of Veterans &quot;Military Brotherhood&quot;, as the coordinator of the party&#x27;s Patriotic Platform. The change of coordinator was connected with the need to intensify intra-party work and structural changes in the management of the platform.

=== Entrepreneurial Platform ===
On 10 March 2016, the Entrepreneurial Platform was created, the co-coordinators of which were the founder of the Korkunov chocolate brand Andrey Korkunov, the head of the Splat-Cosmetics company Evgeny Demin, and State Duma deputy and Chairman of the Board of the Kuzbass Chamber of Commerce and Industry Tatyana Alekseyeva. The first two also entered the supreme council of United Russia. By the end of the month, a presentation of a program of priority steps to support business was promised, which will then be given to the government.

== Faction in the State Duma ==
After the 2003 parliamentary elections, United Russia, having accepted into its faction the deputies who passed through single-mandate constituencies, the majority of independents, all deputies from the People&#x27;s Party and those who switched from other parties, received a constitutional majority, which allowed it to pursue its line in the Duma, not taking into account the opinions and objections of the opposition (CPRF, LDPR, Rodina, independent deputies).

The book &quot;Operation United Russia&quot;, written by Forbes and Vedomosti journalists Ilya Zhegulev and Lyudmila Romanova, describes the functioning of the United Russia faction in the State Duma:
After the Duma elections in 2007, United Russia again had a constitutional majority. The number of deputies in the United Russia faction amounted to 315 people. Due to the large size of the faction and to improve the efficiency of its management, four groups were created in the faction, the leaders of which are Artur Chilingarov, Vladimir Pekhtin, Tatiana Yakovleva, and Nikolay Bulayev. The leader of the faction was Boris Gryzlov. After the 2011 elections, the size of the faction decreased to 238 deputies, which, although it retained the ability for it to adopt federal laws without taking into account other opinions (quorum - 226 deputies), created the need to support other factions for the adoption of federal constitutional laws and amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation (the quorum for the adoption of which is 300 deputies). In the 2016 State Duma elections, held on party lists and in single-mandate districts, United Russia received a record number of seats for the party: 340.

===Leadership of the faction in the State Duma of the VIII convocation===
*Faction leader: Vladimir Vasilyev
*First deputy heads of the faction: Dmitry Vyatkin, Vyacheslav Makarov
*Heads of intra-factional groups – deputy heads of the faction: Aleksandr Borisov, Vladimir Ivanov, Ivan Kvitka, Viktor Seliverstov, Adalbi Shkhagoshev
*Deputy heads of faction: Andrey Isayev, Yevgeny Revenko, Sergey Morozov, Igor Kastyukevich

United Russia has created an expert council for legislative activities, whose task is to evaluate all the initiatives of the members of the faction and their elaboration before submitting them to the State Duma. It included members of the governing bodies of the party, representatives of the faction, and party experts. The first meeting of the council took place on 14 December 2021. Legislative initiatives are assumed to first come to the coordinating council for a preliminary assessment. Then, if necessary, they will be taken up by the working groups of the expert council, which will further develop the bills. The decision to create such a scheme was made on 10 November by the Presidium of the General Council of United Russia.

== Representation in the leadership of the State Duma ==
Since 2003, the Chairman of the State Duma has been a deputy from the United Russia faction: Boris Gryzlov (2003–2011), Sergey Naryshkin (2011–2016), and Vyacheslav Volodin (since 2016). First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma from the party included Oleg Morozov (2005–2011) and Alexander Zhukov (since 21 December 2011). Deputy Chairmen of the State Duma from the party are Olga Timofeeva (since 9 October 2017), Sergey Neverov (since 4 December 2011), Pyotr Tolstoy (since 5 October 2016), Irina Yarovaya (since 5 October 2016). The head of the United Russia faction in the State Duma from the party were Boris Gryzlov (2003–2011), Andrey Vorobyov (2011–2012), Vladimir Vasilyev (2012–2017), and Sergey Neverov (since 9 October 2017).

==Party work in the pandemic==
United Russia was the only political force that had not gone into isolation for a period of restrictive measures. Party members helped doctors and provided support to the victims. The party has successfully established volunteer activities, deployed volunteer headquarters in all regions of the country, and initiated &quot;social&quot; lawmaking and the adoption of joint decisions with the government to support citizens and businesses. At the initiative of party chairman Dmitry Medvedev, more than 500 million rubles of membership fees and charitable donations were directed to support doctors during the pandemic.

The party purchased and donated ten reanimobiles to needy regions for medical institutions in the Altai Krai, Kursk and Pskov Oblasts, and the Republics of Adygea, Altai, Kalmykia, Karelia, Mari El, Tuva, and Chuvashia. Funds were raised to purchase 500,000 sets of personal protective equipment (gloves and masks) distributed among 67 regions. 10,000 protective suits were sent to doctors in the Jewish Autonomous Region, the Trans-Baikal Kra and Krasnoyarsk Krais, the Nizhny Novgorod, Pskov, Samara, and Smolensk Oblasts, and the Republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia, North Ossetia-Alania. As part of the all-Russian action &quot;Thank you to the doctors&quot;, the party donated 200 cars to medical institutions nationwide. Through volunteer centers, specialists working in the red zone received about 360,000 tea kits. The volunteer center in Stavropol donated 20 tons of drinking water to the hospital in Kommunarka. The United Russia Volunteer Center donated five ventilators to one of the hospitals in the Lipetsk Oblast. The regional branch of United Russia in the Novgorod region purchased 87 units of new medical equipment for the region&#x27;s clinics, thanking the financial assistance of entrepreneurs.

United Russia has significantly reduced campaign costs for the 2020-2021 elections and reduced travel and organizational costs, directing all its resources to help those who need it most. Most party members, including candidates for the governor&#x27;s chair, were active participants in the work of the party&#x27;s regional volunteer centers. In addition to helping medical workers, United Russia supported teachers and students as part of the all-Russian action &quot;Help study at home&quot;. Schoolchildren in need were provided with tablets, computers, and laptops for distance learning. The party took on the task of organizing the collection of equipment, attracting major sponsoring partners, and distributing the collected equipment throughout the country. First, such assistance was provided to residents of rural areas, children from low-income and large families, and children from orphanages. As a result of the campaign, more than 500,000 schoolchildren and teachers from all regions where applications were received acquired the necessary devices for learning at home. United Russia launched a large-scale program to support the elderly, especially veterans. Volunteers delivered daily food, medicine, and essential goods, fulfilled many other pensioner requests, explained social support measures, and provided necessary psychological assistance. In some regions, it was possible to identify people needing constant outside care and organize home-based social services. A two-way hotline was created: party representatives were engaged not only in receiving calls but also in calling veterans with the subsequent resolution of problematic issues. United Russia has agreed with the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia that students&#x27; volunteer activities should be considered an educational or industrial practice.

===Party volunteer centers===
To help people during the pandemic, United Russia has created volunteer centers in all regions of the country. The first of them opened on 19 March 2020 in Kaluga. The centers united more than 100,000 volunteers. This made it possible to provide targeted assistance to all those in need and reduce the burden on the state healthcare system and social services. The most demanded areas of work were auto-volunteering (delivering doctors to patients&#x27; homes), providing doctors in the &quot;red zone&quot; with hot meals and food packages, delivering free medicines to outpatients, supporting the elderly, and helping to organize the work of call centers. During the work of volunteer centers, the following was delivered:
* 10 million hot meals for medical personnel;
* more than 1.8 million food packages for citizens;
* more than 2.4 million drug kits for home delivery.

Almost 1.7 million calls to the hotline and more than 1.1 million shifts by medical volunteers have been worked out.

===Headquarters &quot;We Are Together&quot;===
The all-Russian action #МыВместе () and its headquarters united those who needed help during the coronavirus pandemic and those who provided it. Volunteers helped deliver food and medicine to those who applied to the &quot;Hot Line&quot;. The We Are Together campaign&#x27;s volunteer headquarters and hotline were launched on 21 March 2020. United Russia and the All-Russian People&#x27;s Front have become an infrastructure platform for Medical Volunteers and the Association of Volunteer Centers. First, headquarters were deployed in the regions, and then local volunteer organizations began to join them.

==Opinions about the party, criticism, accusations, and scandals==
===Rating polls===
According to a poll by the Levada Center at the beginning of 2021, only 27% of Russians would vote for United Russia if elections to the State Duma were held in the near future. This is the lowest support rating for the party among all published polls since mid-2016. In August 2020, 31% of respondents were ready to vote for the party.

===Support===




According to correspondence published in February 2012, employees of the central executive committee of United Russia (Sergey Gorbachev, Pavel Danilin, Alexander Dupin, Yefim Kuts), under the leadership of Alexey Chesnakov, have been creating custom publications (at least 250) since the spring of 2011 in support of the party and criticizing the opposition. Subsequently, these materials were published in several online publications (&quot;Aktualnye Kommentarii&quot;, &quot;Obshaya Gazeta&quot;, &quot;Newsland&quot;, &quot;Infox.ru&quot;, &quot;The Moscow Post&quot;, &quot;Utro.ru&quot;, &quot;Vzglyad.ru&quot;, &quot;Vek&quot;, &quot;Polit.ru&quot;) and paper newspapers (&quot;Argumenty i Fakty&quot;, &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;, &quot;Moskovskij Komsomolets&quot;, &quot;Nezavisimaya Gazeta&quot;) under the guise of editorial texts and credited to fictitious names.

===Criticism===



In 2003, political scientist V. Bely called the party &quot;a colossus with feet of clay&quot; because, in his opinion, the main source of its strength is reliance on Vladimir Putin and power. Some politicians believe that United Russia has become, or is becoming, similar to the CPSU. In 2005, political scientist Vladimir Vasiliev, in an interview with the REGNUM News Agency, said that after making changes to the electoral legislation that are beneficial for the ruling party, &quot;United Russia will turn out to be not a combat-ready army for Putin, but a convoy that needs to be saturated.&quot; Opponents of the party often use ideological clichés in relation to it. In particular, the leader of the Youth Yabloko, Ilya Yashin, in 2004; the leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Gennady Zyuganov, in 2008; and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, in 2015 used the expression &quot;aggressively obedient majority&quot; concerning the party and its faction in the State Duma of Russia.

The party is criticized both in Russia and abroad. For example, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claimed that United Russia &quot;pushed through a series of laws that critics say are designed to prevent genuine electoral struggle and consolidate the party&#x27;s dominance.&quot; According to the adopted laws, parties must have their organizations throughout the country and have at least 50,000 members. According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist, &quot;party registration is overseen by the Russian Ministry of Justice, which is accused of intimidating those who oppose the government. In order to secure representation in parliament, any party must obtain the support of at least 7% of the voters, and if it fails, the votes cast for the party are distributed among the larger parties, which increases the proportional share of parliamentary seats given to these parties. Political analysts believe that United Russia received the greatest benefit from the introduction of the 7 percent threshold.&quot; Party representatives, on the contrary, believe that &quot;its policy leads to the creation of a competitive system of parties and may even weaken the position of the party in the next parliament.&quot;

Commenting on the 2007 Duma election campaign, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that United Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin received &quot;huge amounts of airtime on Kremlin-controlled television channels&quot; even though, according to the newspaper, the opposition&#x27;s election campaign was taken off the air, and its publications were confiscated. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that government officials pressured subordinates and directors of large companies to vote for United Russia and that, according to some allegations, company employees were instructed by management to photograph their completed ballot before putting it in the ballot box. According to journalist Chrystia Freeland, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;We have known since 1996 that Russia is not a democracy. We now know that Russia is not a dictatorship controlled by one party, one spiritual hierarchy, or one dynasty. This is a regime ruled by one person. &quot;There is no party,&quot; said one of Russia&#x27;s leading independent economists. &quot;All politics is built around one person.&quot;

The party has been repeatedly criticized for the lack of a real program. On 8 April 2011, Russian political scientist Gleb Pavlovsky, in an interview, in particular, said: &quot;We see chaos, where no one is sure of anything: six months before the elections, the ruling party does not know what its program is and whose interests it will represent&quot;. On 27 October 2011, &quot;Gazeta.Ru&quot; published an article titled Vacuum Bomb of Power. The authorities failed to come up with not only a program for the elections, but at least a more or less fresh idea&quot;, which states that the authorities admit that they do not have any program of action yet; that the &quot;Program of People&#x27;s Initiatives&quot; is not a program, but a set of wishes, considerations, which cannot be taken as a guide to action. &quot;The programmatic appeal of the United Russia party&quot;, published on the website of the party, the author of &quot;Gazeta.ru&quot; calls &quot;something&quot; that the authorities also do not hold for the program of action, after the publication of which a joke was born in the circles of the political elite: &quot;In the next election of V. Putin, the program will be a joke about V. Putin.&quot;. Gennady Zyuganov, in an interview with &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, spoke about the second stage of the 12th Congress of United Russia, held on 27 November 2011:

Former Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who once stood at the beginning of the creation of the party and left it, called United Russia a &quot;political corpse&quot;. Yevgeny Urlashov, mayor of Yaroslavl, 19 June 2013: &quot;The United Russia party in the [Yaroslavl] region is the most corrupt, arrogant, and engages in blackmail, bribery, deceit, and hates people.&quot; Notably, a month later, by the decision of the Basmanny District Court of Moscow, Urlashov was temporarily removed from office for taking a bribe; in 2016, he was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison with a sentence in a strict regime colony. United Russia&#x27;s support for the raising of the retirement age in 2018 led to the party&#x27;s ratings to fall to its lowest level since 2011. Mass protests against the measure were also held. The pension reform also led to a negative impact on the party&#x27;s performance in regional elections later in the year.

==== &quot;Party of crooks and thieves&quot; ====
United Russia has come in for criticism that it is &quot;the party of crooks and thieves&quot; (, abbreviated as PZhiV, a term coined by activist Alexey Navalny in February 2011) due to the continuing prevalence of corruption in Russia. He argues it by the presence in the party of major officials and businessmen involved in corruption and criminal cases. In October 2011, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; published an article describing how members of the public were writing the slogan on banknotes in protest. In December 2011, Putin rejected the accusation of corruption, saying that it was a general problem that was not restricted to one particular party: &quot;They say that the ruling party is associated with theft, with corruption, but it&#x27;s a cliché related not to a certain political force, it&#x27;s a cliché related to power. ... What&#x27;s important, however, is how the ruling government is fighting these negative things&quot;. A poll taken in November 2011 found that more than one-third of Russians agreed with the characterisation of United Russia as &quot;the party of crooks and thieves&quot;.

After the 2011 legislative elections, a few leaders within United Russia called for investigations of fraud and reform of the party. According to the Levada Center in April 2013, about half of Russians agreed with this characterization of the party. On 28 September 2010, Boris Nemtsov spoke about United Russia on the air of Radio Liberty, saying that &quot;all the people know that this is a party of thieves and corrupt officials.&quot; According to the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, he used this expression back in 2009, and Nemtsov simply intercepted these words. In April 2013, during a sociological survey conducted by the Levada Center, the majority of Russians surveyed (51%) agreed with the characterization of United Russia as a &quot;party of crooks and thieves.&quot;

==== Pension reform of 2018 ====
The support in the summer and autumn of 2018 by the Duma deputies from the United Russia party of the government bill on changes in the pension system, which boils down to raising the retirement age, sharply reduced the level of public confidence in the party, as well as in the president and the Government of Russia. In the eyes of many ordinary citizens, belonging to the &quot;United Russia&quot; has become a fact that discredits the politician, and not belonging, on the contrary, has become a virtue. This, in particular, affected the gubernatorial elections in a number of regions in September 2018, where candidates from the opposition parties won with a significant advantage.

===Allegations of violations of the electoral law===
====Regional elections (2008-2009)====
During regional elections and elections of mayors of Russian cities in March 2009, individual cases of voter bribery, falsification of voting results in favor of some representatives of the United Russia party, and their use of negative campaigning were recorded. On 1 March 2009, police in Murmansk detained a group of citizens distributing bottles of vodka to voters in exchange for votes for United Russia candidate Mikhail Savchenko, the current mayor of Murmansk. One of the detainees wrote to the police that he had personally received 600,000 rubles to organize the bribery. In Karachay-Cherkessia, according to the protocol of precinct No. 50, out of 2,664 voters, 1,272 voters (47.8%) voted for United Russia, and in the protocol of the Republican Election Commission (RIC) in the same precinct, 2,272 votes for United Russia were already listed (85.3%). The votes were taken from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Patriots of Russia party. Following a decision of the city court of Cherkessk, 1000 votes were taken from United Russia and distributed between the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Patriots of Russia. During the elections of the mayor of Tomsk on 15 March 2009, on the personal instructions of the chairman of the regional election commission, Yelman Yusubov, it was impossible to demand from the voter a document (a business trip order, a travel document, a referral to a doctor, etc.) confirming his absence on the day of voting at his place of residence, which led to mass illegal early voting of students and significantly affected the outcome of voting in favor of the United Russia candidate, Mayor Nikolai Nikolaychuk, who, according to official data, won the election.

A telephone poll conducted by the local television company TV2 in the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; program showed that opposition candidate Alexander Deyev was winning the mayoral election by a wide margin, after which there were immediate failures at the city telephone exchange, and the poll was disrupted. In one of the maternity hospitals, women in labor were forced to vote for Nikolaichuk; otherwise, their babies were threatened with harm. In the lists of voters now and then, there were unidentifiable people registered in the apartments of the townspeople. Some residents of Tomsk were surprised to see the names of their deceased neighbors among those who voted. As a result of such machinations, the turnout of voters from 17:00 to 19:00 sharply increased by 7,000 people. Representatives of the electoral committee then could not clearly explain this fact. Even before voting legally ended at 20:00, the sign of &quot;Mayor Nikolaychuk Nikolai Alekseevich&quot; was hung in the administration of Tomsk. In the reception room of the United Russia deputies of the regional and city dumas Chingis Akatayev and Denis Molotkov, newspapers with negative press directed against Deyev were found. Tomsk Governor Viktor Kress, fearing that the candidate from the party in power would lose the election, put pressure on voters, saying several times on local TV channels that he would not work with the mayor if opposition self-nominated Alexander Deyev became the mayor. Moreover, he slandered Deyev, saying that he was convicted.

According to the CEC of the Russian Federation, United Russia won 77.3% of the vote in the municipal elections in St. Petersburg. On 30 March 2009, Anton Chumachenko, a member of United Russia, who allegedly won in one of the districts of St. Petersburg, in an open letter to the residents of the Morskoy district, called the methods of his fellow party members &quot;a cynical mockery of the right&quot;, stating that &quot;the results of the vote in our district were frankly rigged. From all the protocols of the six precinct election commissions, it follows that I was not included in the top five candidates who received the majority of votes.&quot; Yabloko candidate Boris Vishnevsky, whose victory appeared on the CEC website the night after the election (according to zaks.ru) but then disappeared, claimed that the votes were allocated to his rivals from United Russia. During the election campaign for the post of head of the city of Vologda (2008), candidate Alexander Lukichev (a member of the A Just Russia party) was removed from the election on charges of violating intellectual property rights. Ye. Shulepov, a United Russia candidate, won the election.

====Federal election irregularities====
=====Elections to the State Duma (2007)=====
The party has been repeatedly accused of illegal use of administrative resources (for example, the so-called campaign assignments to recruit supporters). One of the well-known cases was the confession of the mayor of Khabarovsk, Alexander Sokolov, before the Duma elections in 2007: &quot;Given the special role of United Russia, we recommended that the chairmen of precinct commissions join the party.&quot; In addition, precedents were recorded in the Duma elections of 2007, when up to 109% of votes were for United Russia. There were cases of massive ballot stuffing, forcing students to vote under the threat of failing exams, etc.

=====Elections of the President of Russia (2008)=====
On 7 October 2011, the leader of the A Just Russia party, Sergey Mironov, published on his blog a copy of an internal document of the St. Petersburg headquarters of United Russia, which describes in detail the technologies for falsifying the protocols of precinct election commissions and instructions for stuffing ballots in the 2008 presidential elections in Russia.

In the presidential elections of Russia on 2 March 2008, such violations were noticed as giving a bribe to an observer, multiple voting by one person (and without documents), and issuing already filled-out ballots to voters.

=====Elections to the State Duma (2011)=====

By the start of the 2011 federal election campaign, &quot;Gazeta.Ru&quot; and the Association for the Protection of Voters&#x27; Rights GOLOS launched an interactive map of law violations, which any participant in the elections could take part in creating. As of 7 November 2011, there were 956 messages in the database of the map of violations, of which 403 related to &quot;using the possibilities of power to create advantages&quot;; as of 1 December 2011, 4316 and 1674 in total; according to the results of the elections, 7801 and 2024. United Russia then created a website to &quot;confront opposition violations&quot; in the elections.

On 24 October 2011, on the website of State Duma deputy Gennady Gudkov, the abstracts of the report were published, which the governor of the Moscow Oblast, Boris Gromov, allegedly delivered on 6 October 2011 in the Odintsovo district. Gudkov considered this report a &quot;plan for preparing election fraud&quot; in the Moscow Oblast. According to him, in the report, Gromov called: &quot;to aim local administrative bodies and the apparatus of administrations to suppress any attempts to violate the electoral legislation&quot;, &quot;to contribute to the filling of financial resources&quot;, &quot;to try to limit opponents in advertising&quot;, and &quot;to pay attention to pre-election work in municipalities where the positions of United Russia are not so unambiguous.&quot; According to Gudkov, the violations are not limited to one report: on 15 September, the Minister of Press and Information of the region, Sergey Moiseyev, &quot;instructed&quot; 56 chief editors of regional and municipal media in approximately the same style.

On 24 October 2011, the Election Commission of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast warned United Russia in the Jewish Autonomous Region for placing banners violating the electoral law. On 27 October 2011, a video appeared on the Internet where Denis Agashin, a member of the General Council of United Russia and the head of the administration of the city of Izhevsk, called on pensioners to vote for United Russia, saying that the financing of the city depends on the results of the vote. Sergei Zheleznyak, First Deputy Secretary of the Presidium of the General Council of the United Russia party, said that Agashin is not a candidate for deputy from the party and held a meeting with representatives of veteran organizations &quot;on his own initiative.&quot; On 18 November 2011, the Leninsky District Court of Izhevsk found Agashin guilty of illegal campaigning and fined him 2,000 rubles. On 5 November 2011, the head of the administration of the President of Udmurtia and the government of the republic, Alexander Goriyanov, announced on camera the scheme &quot;money for votes in favor of United Russia&quot;:

According to the aforementioned First Deputy Secretary of the Presidium of the General Council of the Party, Sergei Zheleznyak, it is quite logical to link the socio-economic development of a region or municipality with United Russia since it is United Russia that proposes budget projects related to the socio-economic development of the region and votes for them. According to the &quot;Kommersant&quot; newspaper, since 2 November, a &quot;signature collection form in support of United Russia&quot; has been distributed among Voronezh civil servants, in which the regional governor Alexey Gordeyev asks to support the party in the elections to the State Duma. As a sign of consent, officials must put their signature under this, having previously indicated their addresses and telephone numbers.

According to the news agency URA.ru, on the evening of 5 November in Yekaterinburg, police detained a resident, Daniil Kornev, on whose car there was a sticker, privately made by the townspeople, with the well-known aphorism of blogger Alexei Navalny &quot;United Russia is a party of crooks and thieves&quot; and an image of a bear with a bag in its mouth against the backdrop of a map of Russia. An administrative offense report was drawn up against him (Part 1 of Article 5.12 of the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses &quot;Production, distribution or placement of campaign materials in violation of election legislation&quot;), from which it follows the sticker is campaigning for United Russia not paid for from the election fund, and a subpoena was served. In Pervouralsk, local businessman Vitaly Listratkin was fined 1,000 rubles for distributing forty mugs with a statement about United Russia. On 31 October, at the office of the Parnassus branch in Yekaterinburg, law enforcement officers seized a batch of stickers with Navalny&#x27;s phrase and a computer.

On 6 November 2011, journalist and blogger Oleg Kozyrev discovered an almost complete &quot;confusing&quot; similarity between the campaign materials of United Russia and the Moscow Electoral Commission. Subsequently, it turned out that under the slogan &quot;Moscow for life, for people&quot; and the design accompanying it, there was a simultaneous advertising campaign, firstly, by the Moscow government, secondly, by the Moscow City Electoral Committee, and thirdly, by the United Russia party. The Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation and the Moscow City Electoral Committee did not find any contradictions to the electoral legislation in that the election billboards of the United Russia party are similar to the Moscow City Electoral Committee&#x27;s public service announcements dedicated to the December elections. A similar point of view was expressed by Senator Valery Ryazansky, member of the Bureau of the Supreme Council of the United Russia party, on Echo of Moscow radio:
Also on 6 November 2011, a video appeared on the Internet with information that in Murmansk, United Russia members concluded agreements for &quot;self-agitation&quot; at 1,500 rubles per vote given to the party and 250 rubles per brought friend. On 23 November 2011, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; published an article about the correspondence between United Russia, the department for the media, press, broadcasting, and mass communications of the Krasnodar Krai, Internet trolls, and regional officials, from which it follows that pro-United Russia comments in the blogosphere are most often written by officials and deputies for money, and that United Russia is conducting its election campaign in the Kuban with a blunt and blatant use of administrative resources. The election posters of the ruling party, which are hung all over the country, are pasted during working hours by the same officials who are united by Internet mailings conducted by the Kuban media department on instructions from Moscow.

On 23 November 2011, &quot;Gazeta.ru&quot; published an article with a transcript of a closed speech by Alexander Aksyonov, head of the Sokolinaya Gora District Council in Moscow. The transcript explains in detail how the plan to collect votes for United Russia should be carried out. Aksyonov demands the heads of enterprises collect absentee certificates from their subordinates and hand them over to officials so that United Russia can gain 58% in the elections in Moscow (even though according to a closed Foundation &quot;Public Opinion&quot; poll conducted at the start of the campaign and published in &quot;Gazeta.ru&quot;, United Russia had a rating of 29% in Moscow). According to RIA Novosti, the Moscow City Electoral Committee stated that the information contained in the article &quot;is unfounded&quot; and that the audio recording raises doubts about its authenticity.

On 21 December 2011, a member of the regional political council of United Russia, Vladimir Semago, appeared in &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; with an article titled &quot;This is not a falsification of the election results, but a conspiracy to forcibly retain power&quot;. In the article, he stated that a group of conspirators created a criminal community to rig parliamentary elections to retain power. The community included the CEC headed by Vladimir Churov and the chairmen of grassroots election commissions. Similar communities were created at the regional level in executive power structures. The conspirators&#x27; activities received support from the FSB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and, most likely, were coordinated at the very top. Such actions fall under articles 210 and 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and are punishable by imprisonment from 10 to 20 years.

Scientists from the Medical University of Vienna have proposed a method for assessing the presence of electoral fraud. As a result, they proved that there were falsifications in the elections of the Russian President in 2012 and to the State Duma of the Russian Federation in 2011; in particular, ballot stuffing for some candidates. The article appeared in the journal &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; and is available in the public domain.

== Notable departures from the party ==
Former co-chairman of the Party Supreme Council Yury Luzhkov, who left the party simultaneously with a resignation from the post of mayor of Moscow, speaking on 21 October 2010 as a dean of the International University in Moscow with the lecture &quot;Development of Moscow and the Renaissance of Russia&quot; and answering questions from the audience, said that he was always wary of United Russia since there were no democratic institutions. &quot;The irony of fate: I am one of the founding fathers of the United Russia party. My attitude towards it has always been warily critical.&quot; &quot;I always told the party chairman Boris Gryzlov that we have no discussions. We always and in everything obey the administration.&quot; &quot;When the 122 federal law on the monetization of benefits was adopted, there were two thousand comments to it; we accepted it without discussion. Then there was the popular phrase: Duma is no place for discussions. You can not do it this way!&quot;. &quot;The party is a servant, and I left it,&quot; Luzhkov concluded.

Other famous personalities that left the party include State Duma deputy (2000-2016) and ex-governor of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Valery Zubov, State Duma deputy (1999-2005) and ex-governor of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Mikhail Yurevich, ex-head of Khakassia Aleksey Lebed, ballerina and actress Anastasia Volochkova, farmer and politician Zhoakim Krima, writer Yevgeny Kasimov, General Yevgeny Yuryev, former State Duma deputies Vladimir Semago and Anatoly Yermolin, director of the Lenin State Farm CJSC and, at the time of leaving the party, the operating deputy of the Moscow Oblast Duma Pavel Grudinin, former State Duma deputy Igor Morozov, Deputy Prime Minister of the Irkutsk Region Alexander Bitarov, former head of the Bolshaya Okhta municipality of St. Petersburg Nikolai Payalin, ex-head of the administration of several St. Petersburg regions and brother of politician Arkady Dvorkovich Mikhail Dvorkovich, and cousin of Vladimir Putin Igor Putin.

In addition to criminal grounds in some cases (see below), for political reasons, the Governor of the Stavropol Krai Alexander Chernogorov, the mayor of Volgograd Roman Grebennikov, and mayor of Tula Alisa Tolkacheva were excluded from the party.

=== Mass departures from the party ===
In 2015, almost a hundred people in Kopeysk left United Russia. All employees who left the party worked at three Kopeysk enterprises: Gorvodokanal CJSC, Kopeysk Treatment Plant LLC, and Kopeysk Water Supply Networks LLC. The employees of these enterprises have not been paid salaries for a long time since the organizations do not have the funds for this. Employees blamed the head of Kopeysk, Vyacheslav Istomin, for the lack of money. According to the employees of the enterprises, their complaints about the situation were ignored. This prompted them to write a statement about leaving the party.

In 2021, in the Altai Krai village of Stepnoye, more than 120 employees of the Kuchuksulfat plant simultaneously left the United Russia party. According to these employees, because of the current situation with the plant, they are worried about the possible change of the owner of the enterprise and afraid of a raider seizure of the enterprise, and they do not see any actions from the party to help resolve the issue.

== Sanctions ==
On 16 December 2022, due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, United Russia was included in the EU sanctions list. According to the European Union, the party supported Russia&#x27;s aggressive war against Ukraine and the annexation of Ukrainian territories; thus, the party is responsible for supporting actions that undermine or threaten Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and independence. All party assets in the European Union will be frozen, and any member of these parties will be banned from entering the EU. On 24 February 2023, United Russia was included in the sanctions list of Canada.

<text>Johan Vincent Galtung (24 October 1930 – 17 February 2024) was a Norwegian sociologist and the principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies. He was the main founder of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) in 1959 and was its first director until 1970. He also established the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot; in 1964.

In 1969, he was appointed to the world&#x27;s first chair in peace and conflict studies, at the University of Oslo. He resigned his Oslo professorship in 1977 and thereafter held professorships at several other universities; from 1993 to 2000 he taught as Distinguished Professor of Peace Studies at the University of Hawaii. He was the Tun Mahathir Professor of Global Peace at the International Islamic University Malaysia until 2015.

==Background==

Galtung was born in Oslo. He earned the cand. real. degree in mathematics at the University of Oslo in 1956, and a year later completed the mag. art. (PhD) degree in sociology at the same university. Galtung received the first of thirteen honorary doctorates in 1975.

Galtung&#x27;s father and paternal grandfather were both physicians. The Galtung name has its origins in Hordaland, where his paternal grandfather was born. Nevertheless, his mother, Helga Holmboe, was born in central Norway, in Trøndelag, while his father was born in Østfold, in the south. Galtung was married twice, and had two children by his first wife Ingrid Eide, Harald Galtung and Andreas Galtung, and two by his second wife Fumiko Nishimura, Irene Galtung and Fredrik Galtung.

Galtung experienced World War II in German-occupied Norway, and as a 12-year-old saw his father arrested by the Nazis. By 1951, he was already a committed peace mediator, and elected to do 18 months of social service in place of his obligatory military service. After 12 months, Galtung insisted that the remainder of his social service be spent in activities relevant to peace.

Galtung died in Stabekk Helsehus og Hospice, Baerum, Norway, on 17 February 2024, at the age of 93.
Galtung&#x27;s daughter, Irene Galtung, demanded an autopsy. The final autopsy report (September 2024) revealed the cause of death was pneumonia. Stabekk Helsehus did not know he had pneumonia; nor did they check whether he had it; nor did they treat it. 

Furthermore, it was revealed (October 2024) that Galtung was not given any treatment whatsoever in Stabekk Helsehus from 2 to 17 February, 2024, even though he repeatedly expressed he wanted to live. 

On 6 February 2024, the Stabekk Helsehus doctor had even confirmed that Johan was - not - dying, and could live weeks, months or years. Galtung was given morphine in Stabekk Helsehus, even though he did not want it because he said it is dangerous. There was no indication that he had the type of pain that necessitated morphine. Galtung was given increasing doses of morphine in the days before he died. At 6 am on February 17, 2024, only a short time before he died the same day, he was given morphine.
==Career==
Upon receiving his mag. art. degree, Galtung moved to Columbia University, in New York City, where he taught for five semesters as an assistant professor in the department of sociology. In 1959, Galtung returned to Oslo, where he founded the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO). He was the institute&#x27;s director until 1969.

In 1964, Galtung led PRIO to establish the first academic journal devoted to Peace Studies: the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot;. In the same year, he assisted in the founding of the International Peace Research Association. In 1969, he left PRIO for a position as professor of peace and conflict research at the University of Oslo, a position he held until 1978.

Galtung was the director general of the International University Centre in Dubrovnik and helped to found and lead the World Future Studies Federation. He has held visiting positions at other universities, including Santiago, Chile, the United Nations University in Geneva, Witten/Herdecke University in Germany, and at Columbia, Princeton and the University of Hawaii in the USA. In 2014, he was appointed the first Tun Mahathir Professor of Global Peace at the International Islamic University Malaysia.

Economist and fellow peace researcher Kenneth Boulding has said of Galtung that his &quot;output is so large and so varied that it is hard to believe that it comes from a human&quot;. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

In 1993, he co-founded TRANSCEND: A Peace Development Environment Network. In 1987, he was given the Right Livelihood Award.

==Work and views==
===Conflict Triangle===
In Galtung&#x27;s 1969 paper, &quot;Violence, Peace and Peace Research&quot;, he presents his theory of the Conflict Triangle, a framework used in the study of peace and conflict, with the purpose of defining the three key elements of violence that form this &quot;triangle.&quot; The theory is based on the principle that peace must be defined by widely accepted social goals, and that any state of peace is characterized by the absence of violence. When a conflict has features of all three areas of violence, the result is a more consolidated, static state of violence in a social system, which may include a conflict or a nation-state, whereas the absence of these three typologies of violence results in peace.

==== Structural Violence ====
Galtung&#x27;s concept of structural violence refers to the indirect forms of violence originating from social, economic, and political structures and manifesting primarily as oppression and exploitation. These indirect forms of violence result in injustices in the distribution of political power and economic benefits.

Rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs. Structural violence is increased in situations where low income individuals also suffer in the rank dimensions of education, health, and power. This is due to an overall consolidation of factors in the social structure, resulting in a high correlation between social class and disempowerment. Structural violence can be recognized through its relative stability, having been built into the social structure. This can make structural violence difficult to ascertain, despite its often vast consequences. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of the most notable are listed below.

Akhil Gupta argued in 2012 that structural violence has been the key influence in the nature and distribution of extreme suffering in India, driven by the Indian state in its alleged corruption, overly bureaucratic standards of governance used to exclude the middle and working classes from the political system through a system of politicized poverty.

Jacklyn Cock&#x27;s 1989 paper in the &quot;Review of African Political Economy&quot; applied Galtung&#x27;s theory of structural violence, analysing the role of militarized society under the apartheid regime of South Africa in the development of patriarchal values that is a form of structural violence against women. Cock found that tacit misdirection of women in society by its leadership focused their energies toward the direct and indirect incorporation of the patriarchal regime in order to maintain the status quo.

Mats Utas claimed that even those youth in Liberia indirectly unaffected by direct violence in the civil war of 1989-1996 suffered from structural violence in the form of association with different blocs, leading to poverty, joblessness and marginalisation effects.

==== Cultural Violence ====
Galtung defines cultural violence as ideas, consciousness, language, art, or science that can be used to legitimize or enable direct violence or structural violence. The existence of prevailing or prominent social norms make direct and structural violence seem natural or at least acceptable, and serves to explain how prominent beliefs can become so embedded in a given culture that they function as absolute and inevitable and are reproduced uncritically across generations. Galtung expanded on the concept of cultural violence in a 1990 paper also published in the Journal of Peace Research. This concept has been applied in a limited number of cases, with most occurring after Galtung&#x27;s follow up paper in 1990, some of the most notable of which are listed below.

Johan Galtung has written about Zionism and violence. He has discussed various forms of violence, including structural and cultural violence, in his extensive body of work. Galtung has been critical of Zionism, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and has linked it to broader themes of structural violence. He has framed Zionism within his broader theories of structural and cultural violence, suggesting that the establishment and actions of the state of Israel have contributed to ongoing conflict and suffering in the region.

Gregory Phillips argues in his 2003 book, Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country, that resistance to the Western medical sphere driven by previous atrocities committed against the Aboriginal community has led to a fierce resistance effort against modern medicine, addiction treatment and perhaps fuels a desire to seek out drugs and illicit substances as a starting point of addiction. Wide scale suspicion against medical practitioners and government representatives has become engendered in the Aboriginal community.

In Enduring Violence: Ladina Women&#x27;s Lives in Guatemala, the 2011 book by Cecilia Menjívar, it is argued that the preexisting cultural conditions of &quot;mediania&quot;, or half and half, agriculture led to women facing large scale cultural violence due to high rents, low returns and high required investment with additionally harsh conditions due to the conflict in Guatemala. Given the patriarchal culture of Guatemala, any earnings would go to the partner of the working woman, leaving a large poverty gap enshrined in the demographic diversity of the country.

The Austrian peace researcher Franz Jedlicka has tried to measure the level of cultural violence in a &quot;Culture of Violence Scale&quot; in 2023.

==== Direct Violence ====
Direct Violence is characterised as having an actor that commits the violence, and is thus able to be traced back to persons as actors. Direct violence shows less stability, given it is subject to the preference sets of individuals, and thus is more easily recognised. Direct violence is the most visible, occurring physically or verbally, and the victim and the offender can be clearly identified. Direct violence is highly interdependent with structural and cultural violence: cultural and structural violence causes direct violence which on the other hand reinforces the former ones. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of which are listed below.

A 2011 paper by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) demonstrated the widespread nature of child marriage in South Asia. The ICRW highlighted marriage before the age of 18 as a fundamental human rights violation, one that leads to early childbearing, with significantly higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates as well as higher infant mortality rates amongst women. The paper most directly presented evidence to show that child brides are at heightened risk of violence in the home.

In Matthew Chandler&#x27;s 2009 paper on so-called &quot;non-violent&quot; techniques utilised by Hezbollah still include forms of Direct Violence, most notably the threat of violence toward Fouad Siniora&#x27;s allies after his 2008 order to dismantle the Hezbollah telecommunications network in 2008, which led to the freezing of the order. Further, Hezbollah are argued to have used their operation of social services, in lieu of government operations, as a ransom for support as well as rewarding their fighters with guaranteed healthcare and support for their families. Chandler argues this is due to opposition within the group to harming Lebanese civilians, who they view as &quot;their own&quot;, or exacerbating conflict through civil war.

In 2005, Steven Wright made the case for Peacekeeping efforts to be regarded as violence due to increasing use of techniques such as pre-interrogation treatment, and the use of non-lethal weapons such as tear gas for crowd dispersal and plastic bullets, which he terms &quot;torture-lite&quot;, being increasingly common in peacekeeping manuals across a number of nation-states and supranational organisations.

==== Reinforcing Factors ====

Galtung focuses a section of the paper on the means of direct and structural violence, in particular, developing groups of factors that may be included as types of such forms and methods of maintaining and reinforcing the mechanisms of such violence. In terms of reinforcing factors, Galtung identifies six key areas:

;Linear Ranking Order
:Systems in which there is an open and complete ranking of actors leaves no doubt as to the actor who is ranked more highly, and is thus a mechanism of structural violence due to the reinforcement of an existing power dynamic.
;Acyclical Interaction Pattern
:Systems in which all actors are connected via a one-way ‘correct’ path of interaction, where outcomes are structurally dependent on using this system in the intended way of its design. This makes structural systems stable, as change can only be achieved through this consolidated power-seeking and power-retaining system.
;Rank-Centrality Correlation
:Within the social system, actors that are higher ranked are more central within the system itself, reinforcing their importance to the status quo as well as their incentives to maintain it.
;(4) System Congruence
:Social systems are made up of similar components, allowing those who are ranked highly and are successful at mobilising one system shifting from a comparative advantage within one system to an absolute advantage over all systems of desired operation.
;Rank Concordance
:Actors that are ranked highly within one metric, such as income, are also ranked highly on other metrics such as education and health. This congruence is also present in actors ranked low within these metrics, and serves to limit mobility within the social system.
;Interlevel High Rank Coupling
:Collaboration amongst the highest ranks results in the system being defined in such a way that benefits the most powerful actors, usually through a sub optimally ranked representative (not the highest ranked actor), which limits allegations of system consolidation by the most powerful.

Beyond Galtung&#x27;s initial paper and thesis, scholars have applied the Conflict Triangle to a broad array of conflicts, struggles and occupations since 1969, and retroactively.

==== Criticism of the model ====
Galtung&#x27;s Conflict Triangle and Peace Research paper are widely cited as the foundational pieces of theory within peace and conflict studies. However, they are not without criticism. Galtung uses very broad definitions of violence, conflict and peace, and applies the terms of mean both direct and indirect, negative and positive, and violence in which one cannot distinguish actors or victims, which serves to limit the direct application of the model itself.

Galtung uses a positivist approach, in that he assumes that every rational tenet of the theory can be verified, serving to reject social processes beyond relationships and actions. This approach enforces a paradigm of clear-cut, currently testable propositions as the ‘whole’ of the system, and thus is often deemed reductionist. Galtung also wields an explicit normative orientation in the paper, in which there is a weighting toward evaluative statements that may show bias or simply opinion, or indeed a trend toward the institutions and concepts of peace in the West, which may serve to limit the applicability of the model more widely.

=== Peacebuilding ===
Galtung proposes resolving conflicts through peacekeeping, peacemaking, and peacebuilding. Peacekeeping and peacemaking primarily involve eliminating violence and bringing about immediate peace. In Galtung&#x27;s view, addressing the root causes of violence requires peacebuilding which goes beyond ending direct violence to end structural violence and cultural violence.

The peacebuilding structures needed to address the root causes of conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution. Galtung has held several significant positions in international research councils and has been an advisor to several international organisations. Since 2004, he has been a member of the Advisory Council of the Committee for a Democratic UN.

Galtung is strongly associated with the following concepts:
* Structural violence – widely defined as the systematic ways in which a regime prevents individuals from achieving their full potential. Institutionalized racism and sexism are examples of this.
* Negative vs. positive peace – popularized the concept that peace may be more than just the absence of overt violent conflict (negative peace), and will likely include a range of relationships up to a state where nations (or any groupings in conflict) might have collaborative and supportive relationships (positive peace). Though he did not cite them, these terms were, in fact, previously defined and discussed in a series of lectures starting in 1899 by Jane Addams (in her 1907 book she switched to calling it &#x27;newer ideals of peace&#x27; but continued to contrast them to the term negative peace), and in 1963 in the letter from a Birmingham jail by Martin Luther King Jr.

===Criticism of the United States===
In 1973, Galtung criticised the &quot;structural fascism&quot; of the US and other Western countries that make war to secure materials and markets, stating: &quot;Such an economic system is called capitalism, and when it&#x27;s spread in this way to other countries it&#x27;s called imperialism&quot;, and praised Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba in 1972 for &quot;break[ing] free of imperialism&#x27;s iron grip&quot;. Galtung stated that the US is a &quot;killer country&quot; guilty of &quot;neo-fascist state terrorism&quot; and compared the US to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

In an article published in 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will &quot;decline and fall&quot; by 2020. He expanded on this hypothesis in his 2009 book titled &quot;The Fall of the US Empire - and Then What? Successors, Regionalization or Globalization? US Fascism or US Blossoming?&quot;.

Following the election of Donald Trump in 2016, Galtung revised forward his theory of American global power decline, citing Trump&#x27;s deportation policy and critical views of NATO would accelerate it.

=== Views on Communist regimes ===
During his career, Galtung statements and views have drawn criticism including his criticism of Western countries during and after the Cold War and what his critics perceived as a positive attitude to the Soviet Union, Cuba and Communist China. A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published by the &quot;City Journal&quot; magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the &quot;National Post&quot; criticised Galtung&#x27;s opinion of China during the rule of Mao Zedong. China, according to Galtung, was &quot;repressive in a certain liberal sense&quot;, but he insisted &quot;the whole theory about what an &#x27;open society&#x27; is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of &#x27;democracy&#x27;—and it will take a long time before the West will be willing to view China as a master teacher in such subjects.&quot; Calling Galtung a &quot;lifelong enemy of freedom&quot;, Bawer said Galtung discouraged Hungarian resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1956, and criticized his description in 1974 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov as &quot;persecuted elite personages&quot;.

=== Views on Jews and Israel ===
Galtung recommended that people should read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fabricated antisemitic text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. In defending his claims that Jews control American media companies, Galtung cited an article published by National Vanguard, a neo-Nazi organization. Galtung&#x27;s rhetoric has been criticized by Terje Emberland, a historian at the Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities in Oslo, and Øystein Sørensen, a University of Oslo historian known for his scholarship on conspiracy theories. Asked by NRK about his controversial remarks, Galtung reiterated his recommendation that people should read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Galtung rejected that he was anti-Semitic.

The Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; accused Galtung in May 2012 of antisemitism for (1) suggesting the possibility of a link between the 2011 Norway attacks and Israel&#x27;s intelligence agency Mossad; (2) maintaining that &quot;six Jewish companies&quot; control 96% of world media; (3) identifying what he contends are ironic similarities between the banking firm Goldman Sachs and the conspiratorial antisemitic forgery &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;; and (4) theorizing, although not justified, antisemitism in post–World War I Germany was a predictable consequence of German Jews holding influential positions. As a result of such statements, TRANSCEND International, an organisation co-founded by Galtung, released a statement in May 2012 attempting to clarify his opinions. On 8 August 2012, the World Peace Academy in Basel, Switzerland announced it was suspending Galtung from its organization, citing what it posited were his &quot;reckless and offensive statements to questions that are specifically sensitive for Jews.&quot;
Galtung said the claims were &quot;smearing and libel&quot;.

<doc id="396341" wikidata="Q4443170" url="?curid=396341" title="Galtung (noble family)">
<text>The Galtung family was a Norwegian noble family dating from the ennoblement of Lauritz Galtung in 1648. However, when he was ennobled, documents indicated the family descended from an older noble family, the Galte family. This led to both Hardanger families being referenced as Galtungs in history books.

A male-lineage connection between the two families has not been identified. A female-line bridging them was long proposed until that too was debunked in 1950, by professor Lars Hamre&#x27;s discovery of the Torsnes&#x27; family lineage in Copenhagen archives. The lineage stated that the younger Galtungs were descendants of Sigurd Guttormsson at Torsnes, not Sigurd Gautsson Galte at Hatteberg as previously claimed.

==The old family, Galte==
The first family called Galte, belongs to what was called the uradel (i.e., undocumented as nobility by letters of patent, but widely recognized as nobility in other sources) in the Middle Ages. It is believed that the descendants living today represent the oldest surviving noble family in Norway, commonly known as clan Mel, &quot;Melsætten&quot;. The old Galte farm estates of Mel and Hatteberg were the core of the later Danish-Norwegian Barony of Rosendal.

==The younger family, Galtung==
The younger Galtung family male-line can be traced back to Laurits Johanneson who was born around 1519. It was his great-grandson Lauritz Galtung, Admiral of the Dano-Norwegian fleet, who later renewed the nobility of the family in 1648, changing the name from Galte to Galtung. The present family belonged to an influential circle of families in the Hardanger area, including the owners of the farms Aga and Torsnes, and had many well-known naval officers, including admirals .

In 1885, historian Henrik Jørgen Huitfeldt-Kaas said that in the period 1670-1870 the family started marrying commoners, and thus, should be considered to have lost their nobility (later it was asserted that this position was influenced by the Danish, whose nobility, to a large degree, supplanted Norwegian nobility during the Dano-Norwegian union). Early in the 18th century the remaining family lived on the old family farm of Torsnes, which is still occupied by descendants today. By the end of the 18th century, many of the family&#x27;s members could be found in the cities, populating professional classes as lawyers, doctors and such.

Living descendants today include sociologist Johan Galtung, recognised for his contributions to peace research and practice of conflict-solving, the so-called transcend-method. According to &quot;Statistics Norway&quot; 100 persons have Galtung as their surname as of 2009.

<text>The Falkland Islands wolf (Dusicyon australis), also known as the warrah ( or ) and occasionally as the Falkland Islands dog, Falkland Islands fox, warrah fox, or Antarctic wolf, was the only native land mammal of the Falkland Islands. This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times.

Traditionally, it had been supposed that the most closely related genus was &quot;Lycalopex&quot;, including the culpeo, which has been introduced to the Falkland Islands in modern times. A 2009 cladistic analysis of DNA identified the Falkland Islands wolf&#x27;s closest living relative as the maned wolf (&quot;Chrysocyon brachyurus&quot;), an unusually long-legged, fox-like South American canid, from which it separated about 6.7 million years ago. However, the Falkland Islands wolf diverged from its mainland ancestor &quot;Dusicyon avus&quot; very recently, around 16,000 years ago. &quot;Dusicyon avus&quot; persisted on the South American mainland until around 400 years ago.

The Falkland Islands wolf existed on both West and East Falkland, but Charles Darwin was uncertain if they were differentiated varieties or subspecies. Its fur had a tawny colour and the tip of the tail was white. Its diet is unknown, but due to the absence of native rodents on the Falklands, probably consisted of ground-nesting birds, such as geese and penguins, seal pups and insects, as well as seashore scavenging. It has sometimes been said that it may have lived in burrows.

==History==

The first recorded sighting was by Capt. John Strong in 1690. Captain Strong took one on his ship, but during the voyage back to Europe it became frightened by the firing of the ship&#x27;s cannon and jumped overboard. Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who established the first settlement in the Falkland Islands termed it a &quot;loup-renard&quot; (&quot;wolf-fox&quot;). The name &quot;warrah&quot; is an anglicised approximation of the term &quot;aguará&quot; (meaning &quot;fox&quot; in Guaraní, a Native American language), because of its similarity to the maned wolf (&quot;aguará guazú&quot;). 

When Charles Darwin visited the islands in 1833 he found the species present in both West and East Falkland and tame. However, at the time of his visit the animal was already very rare on East Falkland, and even on West Falkland its numbers were declining rapidly. By 1865, it was no longer found on the eastern part of East Falkland. He predicted that the animal would join the dodo among the extinct within &quot;a very few years.&quot; It was hunted for its valuable fur, and settlers regarding the wolf as a threat to their sheep, poisoned it. However, the belief that Falkland Islands wolf was a threat to sheep was probably due to the sheep mistaking the Falkland Islands wolves for dogs (especially at night), and, in terror, the sheep ran into bogs and swamps, where they became lost. There were no forests for the animal to hide in, and it had no fear of humans; it was possible to lure the animal with a chunk of meat held in one hand, and kill it with a knife or stick held in the other. However, it would defend itself occasionally if it needed to, as Admiral George Grey noted when they landed on West Falkland at Port Edgar on 17 December 1836:

A live wolf was taken to London Zoo, England in 1868. Another &quot;Antarctic wolf&quot; arrived in 1870. Neither animal survived long. Only a dozen or so museum specimens exist today.

In 1880, after the animal had become extinct, Thomas Huxley classified it as related to the coyote. In 1914, Oldfield Thomas moved it to the genus &quot;Dusicyon&quot;, with the culpeo and other South American foxes. (These other canids have since been removed to &quot;Lycalopex&quot;.)

===Darwin&#x27;s description===
Darwin writing about his 1834 visit to the Falklands in his &quot;Journal and Remarks&quot; (&quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;) has the following to say of &quot;Canis antarcticus&quot;:

==Biogeography and evolution==

===Darwin&#x27;s comments===
When organising his notes on the last stage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; expedition, Darwin wrote of his growing suspicions that the differences between the various Galápagos Islands mockingbirds and tortoises, as well as the possible dissimilarity of West Falkland and East Falkland Islands wolves, were but variants that differed depending on which island they came from:

The word &quot;would&quot; was added after this passage was first written, suggesting a cautious qualification from his initial bold statement. He later wrote that such facts &quot;seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species&quot;.

=== Related species ===
A DNA analysis and a study of comparative brain anatomy suggest that the closest living relative of the Falkland Islands wolf is the South American maned wolf. Their most recent common ancestor was estimated to have lived some 6 million years ago and was close to the most recent common ancestor of all South American canids, &quot;Eucyon&quot; or a close relative. It would seem that the lineages of the maned wolf and the Falkland Islands wolf separated in North America; canids did not appear in South America until roughly 3 million years ago in a paleozoogeographical event called the Great American Biotic Interchange, in which the continents of North and South America were newly connected by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. However, no fossil from North America can be assigned to the Falkland Islands wolf or its immediate ancestors.

&quot;Dusicyon avus&quot;, known from fossils from southern South America as recent as 400 years ago, was the closest known relative of the Falkland Islands wolf.

In terms of skull shape and feeding habits, the animal was an opportunistic predator, more like a jackal.

===Biogeographical isolation on the Falklands===
The route by which the Falkland Islands wolf was established in the islands was unknown for a long time, as the islands have never been connected to the mainland and there are no other native land mammals. No other oceanic island as remote as the Falklands has a native canid; the island fox of California in the US and Darwin&#x27;s fox of Chile both inhabit islands much closer to a continent.

Berta and other authors suggest that it was unlikely that the wolf&#x27;s ancestors could have survived the last Ice Age on the Falklands and they must therefore have arrived later, within the last ten thousand years, crossing a wide expanse of the South Atlantic. Its close relative, &quot;Dusicyon avus&quot;, did survive in South America until a few thousand years ago, but swimming such a distance or even drifting on a floating log would appear effectively impossible for the wolf. A study by a University of Maine team in 2021 reports evidence of potential visitation to the islands by indigenous South Americans before the Age of Discovery. The authors speculated that the ancestors of the wolf could have been domesticated and brought with the visitors.

The oldest known remains of Falklands Islands wolves date to approximately 3396–3752 years Before Present, found at Spring Point Farm in West Falkland, the only place in the Falkland Islands where subfossil bones of the wolf have been found. The scarcity of remains is likely due to the acidic peaty soil of most of the Falklands, which rapidly degrades bones.

==== Genetics ====
DNA of the extinct mainland relative, &quot;D. avus&quot;, analyzed in 2013 suggests that its genetic history diverged from the Falkland Islands wolf only some 16,000 years ago, during the last glacial phase. This is strong evidence that the ancestors of the wolf were isolated on the islands only since the last glacial maximum. A 2009 analysis of mitochondrial DNA from five museum specimens of the Falkland Islands wolf indicated that they had multiple mitochondrial haplotypes whose most recent common ancestor lived about 330,000 years ago, giving some idea of the genetic diversity of the founding population.

==== Ice Age land bridge ====
An Ice Age land bridge or ice connection between the Falkland Islands and South America, enabling the species&#x27; ancestors to traverse the gap, has long been suggested. There was never a true land bridge between the islands and South America, but submarine terraces have been found on the Argentine coastal shelf, formed by low sea-stands during the last glacial phase. This suggests that there was a shallow strait as narrow as 20 km, which may have frozen completely at times. It is possible that the founding population of the wolf crossed on this ice bridge during the last Ice Age. The absence of other mainland mammals on the islands might be due to the difficulty of an ice crossing.

<text>LDPR – Liberal Democratic Party of Russia () is a Russian ultranationalist and right-wing populist political party. It succeeded the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union (LDPSU) in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The party was led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky since its inception until his death in April 2022. Opposing both communism and capitalism of the 1990s, the party scored a major success in the 1993 Duma elections with almost 23% of the vote, giving it 64 seats of the 450 seats in the State Duma. In the 2021 elections, the party received 7.55% of the vote, giving it 21 seats.

Despite the party&#x27;s name, it has been described as &quot;neither liberal nor democratic nor a party&quot;. The LDPR was centered around Zhirinovsky, and is often described as populist, nationalist, or ultranationalist. It has been described as adhering to statism and authoritarianism, and has also been described as fascist, though this label has been disputed. The party, as part of the &quot;systemic opposition&quot;, is considered to be traditionally loyal to the Kremlin. Its members are generally called &quot;zhirinovets&quot; (Russian: &quot;жириновец,&quot; lit. &#x27;Zhirinovite&#x27;).

== History ==

=== Creation ===
====Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union====

An effectively multi-party system emerged in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s in wake of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms. A formal law for this purpose was introduced in October 1990. In April 1991, the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union (LDPSU) became the second officially registered political party in the country.

Former KGB General Filipp Bobkov has stated that &quot;in line with Zubatov&#x27;s ideas,&quot; the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union &quot;proposed creating a pseudo-party controlled by the KGB&quot; to direct the interests and sentiments of certain social groups, however he said that he was against the idea. Former Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev described how KGB director Vladimir Kryuchkov proposed the creation of the party with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a meeting. He also stated that the Central Committee took over which led to the creation of the Liberal Democratic Party. Yakovlev called the creation of the party a joint effort of the Central Committee and the KGB. In the early 1990s, Mayor of [[Saint Petersburg], [[Anatoly Sobchak]] claimed that party leader [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]] was a &quot;reserve&quot; KGB captain, and a number of key supporters in the LDPR leadership quit the party, accusing Zhirinovsky of KGB ties.

The outspoken leader of the party, [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], an effective media performer, gained 8% of votes during the [[1991 Russian presidential election|1991 presidential elections]]. He also supported the [[1991 Soviet coup attempt|August 1991 coup attempt]].

====Liberal Democratic Party of Russia====
In 1992, the LDPSU broke apart into its regional offsprings and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) was created as its successor in Russia.

=== 1993–1999 ===
In the [[1993 Russian legislative election|1993 Duma elections]], the pro-reform party supporting [[List of presidents of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia&#x27;s Choice]], received only 15% of the vote and the new [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] only 12.4%. The LDPR emerged as the winner with 22.9% of the popular vote. In effect, the Russian population was divided to those who supported Yeltsin&#x27;s reforms and to those who did not. It is regarded that the popularity of Zhirinovsky and his party arose from the electorate&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Yeltsin and their desire for a non-communist solution.

Zhirinovsky is credited with having successfully identified the problems of ordinary Russians and offering simple remedies to solve them. For example, he has suggested that all leaders of [[organized crime]] should be shot and all [[Chechens]] deported from Russia. Zhirinovsky also called for territorial expansion of Russia. Many of Zhirinovsky&#x27;s views are highly controversial and the LDPR&#x27;s success in the early 1990s shocked observers both inside and outside Russia.

The [[State Duma|Duma]] elected in 1993 was as an interim solution and its mandate expired in 1995. During the two years, Zhirinovsky&#x27;s popularity waned and his party&#x27;s support was halved in the [[1995 Russian legislative election|1995 elections]] (11.2%). The Communists emerged as the winners, with 22.3% of the vote.

In the [[1996 Russian presidential election|presidential elections of 1996]], the LDPR nominated Vladimir Zhirinovsky as a candidate. Zhirinovsky gained 5.7% of the votes in the first round.

In 1999, the party participated in the [[1999 Russian legislative election|elections]] as a &quot;Bloc of Zhirinovsky&quot; since the [[Central Election Commission (Russia)|Central Election Commission]] initially refused to register in the election lists of LDPR, which received 6.0% of the votes. In the [[3rd State Duma]], Zhirinovsky took up the post of [[List of deputy chairmen of the State Duma|Deputy Chair of the State Duma]] and the post of the head of the faction occupied by his son [[Igor Lebedev (politician)|Igor Lebedev]].

=== 2000–2009 ===
In the [[2000 Russian presidential election|presidential election of 2000]], the party has again put forward Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who won 2.7% of votes.

In the [[2003 Russian legislative election|parliamentary elections of 2003]], the party won 11.5% of the votes and received 36 seats.

In the [[2004 Russian presidential election|2004 presidential election]], the LDPR nominated [[Oleg Malyshkin]]. The party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky was hoping to take the post of [[Prime Minister of Russia]] in case of Malyshkin&#x27;s victory on elections. In the end, Malyshkin scored 2% of votes, having lost the election.

In the [[2007 Russian legislative election|legislative elections in 2007]], the LDPR received 5,660,823 votes (8.14%) and received 40 seats in the State Duma.

In the [[2008 Russian presidential election|2008 presidential election]], Zhirinovsky was re-nominated as a candidate and scored 9.4% of the vote.

=== 2010–2019 ===
In the [[2011 Russian legislative election|parliamentary elections of 2011]], the party scored 11.7% of the vote and won 56 seats. In the [[6th State Duma]], Vladimir Zhirinovsky returned to the post of head of the LDPR faction and his son Igor Lebedev has held the position of Vice Chairman of the State Duma. In these elections the LDPR gained over one-fifth of votes in [[Russian Far East]] (e. g. [[Primorsky Krai]]).

In the [[2012 Russian presidential election|presidential elections 2012]], the party again put forward by Zhirinovsky, whose campaign slogan for 2012 was &quot;Vote Zhirinovsky, or things will get worse&quot;. [[Prokhor|Proshka]], a [[donkey]] owned by Zhirinovsky, became prominent during the presidential campaign when he was filmed in an [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky&#x27;s donkey video|election advertisement video]]. On the last episode of debates with [[Mikhail Prokhorov]] just before the elections, Zhirinovsky produced a scandal by calling those Russian celebrities which supported Prokhorov, including a pop-[[diva]] and a veteran of Russian pop scene [[Alla Pugacheva]], &quot;prostitutes&quot; (&quot;I thought you are an artful person, politician, cunning man, but you are just a clown and a psycho&quot;, replied Pugacheva. &quot;I am what I am. And such is my charm&quot;, replied Zhirinovsky). As a result, Zhirinovsky gained 6.2% of the votes.

During the [[International incident|diplomatic crisis]] following the [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown]] by Turkey, Zhirinovsky suggested to bomb the [[Bosporus]] with nuclear weapons.

In the [[2016 Russian legislative election|parliamentary elections in 2016]], the party improved its result compared to the previous elections. The LDPR surpassed the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] party [[A Just Russia – For Truth|A Just Russia]], becoming the third largest party in the State Duma. The LDPR won 39 seats, gaining 13.1% of the vote, nearly reaching the second placed Communist Party, which won 13.3% of votes and 42 seats. Also, the party gained single-member constituencies in Russian Far East (notably in [[Khabarovsk Krai]]).

In 2015, Zhirinovsky expressed a desire to participate in the [[2018 Russian presidential election|presidential elections in 2018]]. In the past, key figures in the LDPR other than Zhirinovsky had been discussed as potential presidential candidates, such as Zhirinovsky&#x27;s son Igor Lebedev as well as his close associates [[Mikhail Degtyarev]], [[Yaroslav Nilov]] and [[Alexei Didenko]]. After the parliamentary elections of 2016, Zhirinovsky said he would run himself.

===2020–present===
On 9 July 2020, the popular governor of the Khabarovsk Krai and member of the LDPR, [[Sergei Furgal]], who defeated the candidate of Putin&#x27;s [[United Russia]] party in elections two years previously, was arrested and flown to Moscow on charges of involvement in the murders of several businessmen in 2004 and 2005. He denied the allegations. Starting on 11 June, [[2020–2021 Khabarovsk Krai protests|mass protests]] were held in Khabarovsk Krai in support of Furgal. On 20 July, President Vladimir Putin dismissed Furgal from his position of governor and appointed Moscow-based politician [[Mikhail Degtyarev]], who is also a member of the LDPR, as acting governor. Several regional lawmakers in Khabarovsk opted to leave the LDPR in protest against Furgal&#x27;s dismissal. The protests included chants of &quot;shame on LDPR&quot;, with LDPR loyalists outraged at the party leadership&#x27;s failure to rally around Furgal.

====Zhirinovsky&#x27;s death====

In February 2022, Zhirinovsky was hospitalized in [[Medical state|critical condition]] in [[Moscow]] with [[COVID-19]]. In March, he was reportedly placed in a [[Induced coma|medically induced coma]], and underwent treatment for COVID-19 complications such as [[sepsis]] and [[respiratory failure]]. Zhirinovsky claimed to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 eight times.

On 25 March 2022, Zhirinovsky was reported to have died in a hospital. Despite confirmation from several sources, including his own political party, the news was quickly denied by family members. On 6 April 2022, [[Vyacheslav Volodin]], the [[Chairman of the State Duma|Speaker of the Duma]], announced that Zhirinovsky had died following a long illness. He was 75.

After Zhirinovsky&#x27;s death, [[Leonid Slutsky (politician)|Leonid Slutsky]], the head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, was elected party leader.

== Political positions ==

The LDPR seeks &quot;a revival of Russia as a great power&quot;. It opposes both [[communism]] and [[capitalism]]. It prefers a [[mixed economy]] with [[Private property|private ownership]], but with a strong management role reserved for the state. In [[foreign policy]], the party places a strong emphasis on &quot;[[Feliks Koneczny#Theory of Civilizations|civilizations]]&quot;. It has supported the restoration of Russia with its &quot;natural borders&quot; (which the party believes include [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]], [[Central Asia]], [[Belarus]] and Ukraine). The LDPR regards the United States and [[NATO]] as Russia&#x27;s main external threats. The party has harshly criticised the [[Human rights in Estonia|discrimination against ethnic Russians]] in the [[Baltic states]] and demanded that they should be given [[Russian citizenship law|Russian citizenship]] and protected against discriminatory legislation. The LDPR is also against [[corruption]] and [[enlargement of the European Union]], identifying as a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] party, instead preferring [[pan-Slavism]]. Professor Henry E. Hale lists the party&#x27;s main policy stands as [[Russian nationalism|nationalism]] and a focus in [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]. Although it often uses radical opposition rhetoric, the LDPR frequently votes for government proposals. This has led to speculation that the party receives funding from the [[Kremlin]]. Political parties in Russia that had broken the 3% voting barrier and entered the parliament (State Duma) are officially financed by government, according to federal law. As such, all opposition parties in the State Duma are largely funded by the federal budget (e. g. in 2018, LDPR received 99.7% of its funding from the government, [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|CPRF]] 90%, and [[A Just Russia – For Truth|A Just Russia]] 81%).

Zhirinovsky had stated that he wants to see a [[monarch]] titled &quot;supreme ruler&quot; lead Russia and had promised to shoot his political opponents if elected president.

== Structure and membership ==

The party&#x27;s organization was almost entirely centered on its former leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who died on 6 April 2022.

The party is in alliance with several parties in the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], including [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Estonia]] and Ukraine.

In 2003, the party claimed 600,000 members and had issued 475,000 party cards. According to a 2008 survey by Colton, Hale and McFaul, 4% of the Russian population are loyalists of the party.

The prototypes were developed as part of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon program in the 1990s. The term SABR (&quot;Selectable Assault Battle Rifle&quot;) was also used at certain points, but is less common.

==Overview==
Developed by Alliant Techsystems, with Heckler &amp; Koch as a major subcontractor, the most commonly seen version of the XM29 consisted of a semi-automatic 20×28mm smart grenade launcher, an underslung &quot;KE&quot; assault carbine (derived from the HK G36 then in its late developmental stage) firing a standard 5.56×45mm NATO round, and a top-mounted computer-assisted sighting system with integrated laser rangefinder, thermal vision night vision capabilities, and up to 6× optical telescopic sight. Earlier designs used different configurations and setups.

The launcher part has been described variously as a light semi-automatic 20 mm cannon, a grenade launcher, or an airburst weapon. It poses a classification problem, in that it does not fit neatly into any one category. On one hand, it uses much smaller shells and has a much flatter trajectory than grenade launchers. On the other, while its caliber and velocity is more similar to light cannon, it does share traits with other infantry grenade launchers.
Various problems have effectively ended the program as it was originally envisioned, including weight, bulk, and lack of effectiveness of the 20×28 mm airburst round. Upon cancellation in 2004, it was split into three related programs. OICW Increment One is a program to develop a family of light kinetic energy weapons, OICW Increment Two is a program to develop the airburst grenade launcher as a standalone component, and OICW Increment Three is a program to re-integrate the two components. The XM8 was developed in an attempt to meet Increment One requirements. Instead a new program known as Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) was begun. Meanwhile, the XM25 25×40mm airburst launcher began development to meet the Increment Two requirements. Increment Three will not be initiated until after One and Two are completed.

The OICW Increment One Request for Proposals was cancelled in October 2005, while development of the 25×40mm XM25 continued, and the 25×59mm OCSW program as well until its termination. It is not clear if LSAT is intended to meet the goals of OICW Increment One or if it is a standalone weapon system. However, for all intents and purposes, the OICW program is no longer under development.

<text>The politics of Australia has a mild two-party system, with two dominant political groupings in the Australian political system, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal/National Coalition. Federally, 17 of the 151 members of the lower house (Members of Parliament, or MPs) are not members of major parties, as well as 21 of the 76 members of the upper house (senators).

The Parliament of Australia has a number of distinctive features including compulsory voting, with full-preference instant-runoff voting in single-member seats to elect the lower house, the Australian House of Representatives, and the use of the single transferable vote to elect the upper house, the Australian Senate.

Other parties tend to perform better in the upper houses of the various federal and state parliaments since these typically use a form of proportional representation, except for in Tasmania where the lower house is proportionally elected and the upper house is made up of single member districts.
==History==

Two political groups dominate the Australian political spectrum, forming a de facto two-party system. One is the Australian Labor Party (ALP), a centre-left party which is formally linked to the Australian labour movement. Formed in 1893, it has been a major party federally since 1901, and has been one of the two major parties since the 1910 federal election. The ALP is in government in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Federal Government of Australia.

The other group is a conservative grouping of parties that are in coalition at the federal level, as well as in New South Wales, but compete in Western Australia and South Australia. It is in government in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. The main party in this group is the centre-right Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is the modern form of a conservative group that has existed since the combination of the Protectionist Party and Free Trade Party into the Commonwealth Liberal Party in 1909. Although this group has changed its nomenclature, there has been a general continuity of MPs and structure between different forms of the party. Its modern form was founded by Robert Menzies in 1944. The party&#x27;s philosophy is generally liberal conservatism.

Every elected prime minister of Australia since 1910 has been a member of either the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, or one of the Liberal Party&#x27;s previous incarnations (the Commonwealth Liberal Party, the Nationalist Party of Australia, and the United Australia Party).

The Liberal Party is joined by the National Party, a party that represents rural and agricultural interests. The Nationals contest a limited number of seats and do not generally directly compete with the Liberal Party. Its ideology is generally more socially conservative than that of the Liberal Party. In 1987, the National Party made an abortive run for the office of prime minister in its own right, in the Joh for Canberra campaign. However, it has generally not aspired to become the majority party in the coalition, and it is generally understood that the prime minister of Australia will be a member of either the Labor or Liberal parties. On two occasions (involving Earle Page in 1939, and John McEwen from December 1967 to January 1968), the deputy prime minister, the leader of the National Party (then known as the Country Party), became the prime minister temporarily, upon the death of the incumbent prime minister. Arthur Fadden was the only other Country Party prime minister. He assumed office in August 1941 after the resignation of Robert Menzies and served as prime minister until October of that year.

The Liberal and National parties have merged in Queensland and the Northern Territory/South Australia, although the resultant parties are different. The Liberal National Party of Queensland, formed in 2008, is a branch of the Liberal Party, but it is affiliated with the Nationals and members elected to federal parliament may sit as either Liberals or Nationals. The Country Liberal Party was formed in 1978 when the Northern Territory gained responsible government. It is a separate member of the federal coalition, but it is affiliated with the two major members and its president has voting rights in the National Party. The name refers to the older name of the National Party.

Federally, these parties are collectively known as the Coalition. The Coalition has existed continually (between the Nationals and their predecessors, and the Liberals and their predecessors) since 1923, with minor breaks in 1940, 1973, and 1987.

Historically, support for either the Coalition or the Labor Party was often viewed as being based on social class, with the upper and middle classes supporting the Coalition and the working class supporting Labor. This has been a less important factor since the 1970s and 1980s when the Labor Party gained a significant bloc of middle-class support and the Coalition gained a significant bloc of working-class support.

The two-party duopoly has been relatively stable, with the two groupings (Labor and Coalition) gaining at least 70% of the primary vote in every election between 1910 and 2019 (including the votes of autonomous state parties). Third parties have only rarely received more than 10% of the vote for the Australian House of Representatives in a federal election, such as the Australian Democrats in the 1990 election and the Australian Greens in 2010, 2016, 2019 and 2022. Additionally, support for Independent politicians in Australia has resulted in major parties having to come to agreements to form government at times, including the 2010 Australian Federal Election.

==Membership requirement==
To maintain registration, parties must demonstrate that they have a certain number of members.

Federally, since 2022, unless a party has current parliamentary representation, they must demonstrate they have 1,500 members. For the state and territory elections, parties require 100 members in Tasmania and the ACT, 200 in South Australia and Northern Territory, 500 in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, and 750 in New South Wales.

<text>The People&#x27;s Republic of China is a one-party state ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Despite this, eight minor political parties subservient to the CCP exist.

Under the one country, two systems principle, the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which were previously colonies of European powers, operate under a different political system from the rest of China. Currently, both Hong Kong and Macau possess multi-party systems that were introduced just before the handover of the territories to China.

==Legal parties==
===Ruling party===
The Chinese Communist Party is the sole ruling party of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Chinese constitution states that &quot;The defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China&quot;, while the CCP constitution declares the party to be the &quot;highest force for political leadership&quot;.
===Minor parties===

While only the CCP holds effective power at the national level, there are officially eight minor and non-oppositional parties that exist alongside the CCP that are officially titled &quot;democratic parties&quot; (). Founded before the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, these parties must accept the &quot;leading role&quot; of the CCP as a condition of their continued existence. The relationship between these parties and the CCP has officially been described as &quot;long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, treating each other with full sincerity and sharing weal or woe&quot; (prosperity or adversity) According to Human Rights Watch, these parties &quot;play an advisory rather than an oppositional role&quot;.

The eight minor parties take part in &quot;united front work&quot; and also take part in the political system, but they have no power at a national level. The Chinese political system allows for the participation of some members of the eight minor parties and other non-CCP members in the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), but they are vetted by the CCP. According to Aaron Friedberg, these parties&#x27; &quot;purpose is to create the illusion of inclusiveness and representation.&quot; One of the ways the CCP controls the minor parties is through its United Front Work Department (UFWD), which vets the membership applications and controls who is the leader of these parties. UFWD also keeps the parties in check by preventing them from expanding widely in counties and villages. The cadres of the eight parties are trained at the Central Institute of Socialism. The parties are directed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to study and implement Xi Jinping Thought. There is officially a ranking system of the parties; the ranking is based on their &quot;contribution to the new democratic revolution&quot;.
==Other parties==

===Banned parties===
The following parties formed in China are (or have previously been) banned by the government:
*The Communist Party of China (Marxist–Leninist) () is an anti-revisionist communist party founded in 1976 by several Maoist rebel factions of the Red Guards in Wuhan, Hubei. They believed it was illegal to arrest the Gang of Four and that the new leadership of the CCP is revisionist and unlawful. They were suppressed after attempts at an armed revolt failed in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Canton and Yunnan.
*The Communist Party of China (Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Liberation Army) () is an anti-revisionist communist party founded in 1976 by a Maoist rebel faction of the Red Guards in Fujian. They used the old fortifications built during the Chinese Civil War and organized a partisan army named the &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Liberation Army&quot;. They announced that the new leadership of the CCP is revisionist and called for uprising and reestablished the Party Central Committee. Their activities lasted until 1978.
*The Democracy Party of China () was founded by participants of the 1978 Democracy Wall movement and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Founded in 1998, it was declared illegal that same year.
*The Union of Chinese Nationalists () supports the ideals of the Pan-Blue Coalition in Taiwan. As such, its goals include establishing a liberal democracy in China, based on Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People. The group originated from an internet forum discussion in August 2004. The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said it is an illegal organization on April 25, 2007.
*The New Democracy Party of China () was founded by Guo Quan in Nanjing at the end of 2007.
*The Maoist Communist Party of China () is an anti-revisionist communist party founded in 2008. The party seeks to initiate a &quot;second socialist revolution&quot; to re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. It has been subject to crackdowns by the Chinese government.
*The Zhi Xian Party (), also known as the Chinese Constitutionalist Party in English. Founded by the supporters of Bo Xilai in 2013 and banned in December of that year.
*The Chinese Proletarian Revolutionary Central Committee (, abbreviated ) is an anti-revisionist communist party founded in the 2010s by Zhou Qun (). The party leaders were members of a rebel faction () during the Cultural Revolution, and the committee core consisted of dozens of laid-off workers () in Jiangsu. It was suppressed after the police found their &quot;provocative&quot; online activities.

===Overseas parties===
*Shanghai National Party is a pro-democracy party which advocates for Shanghai independence, led by He Anquan, who left China after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. The party was notable for its opposition to China&#x27;s COVID-19 lockdown policies. In particular, he referred to the lockdowns in Shanghai as a genocide and maintained a hunger strike outside the Chinese consulate in New York City. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, He visited Ukraine in order to document the war.

<text>This article lists [[political party|political parties]] in [[Costa Rica]]. 
Costa Rica used to have a two-party system, which meant that there were two dominant political parties, the Social Christian Unity Party and the National Liberation Party, with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. After the 2002 elections and the strong showing of the brand-new Citizens&#x27; Action Party, it was considered very likely that the old two-party system was on the verge of giving way to a multi-party system. Several other parties have gained prominence since then, and the 2006 elections made it clear that Costa Rica is now a multi-party system.

Starting in the 2000s, disagreement about many of the neo-liberal policies promoted by the dominant PLN caused the traditional party system of alliances among a few parties to fracture. Although still a stable country, the shift toward many political parties and away from PUSC and PLN is a recent development. Various elected positions within the country, such as mayors and city council members, are held by many different national and local political parties.

<text>This is a list of political parties in the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic has a multi-party system. Due to the electoral system used, a limited number of parties are successful in each parliamentary election.

==Parliamentary parties==
There are currently seven parties in the Chamber of Deputies – ANO 2011, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mayors and Independents (STAN), the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party (KDU-ČSL), Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), TOP 09 and the Czech Pirate Party (Pirates). All of these parties except the SPD also have at least one seat in the Senate. Since the 2022 Czech Senate election, Senator 21 (SEN 21) have had four seats in the Senate, Mayors for the Liberec Region (SLK) have two Senate seats, and Svobodní have one Senate seat. None of these three parties have any seats in the Chamber of Deputies or the European Parliament. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM) hold no seats in the Chamber or the Senate but do have one elected member of the European Parliament and have elected representatives at the regional level.

The only party to have had members elected to every Parliament since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia is ODS.

The next legislative election will be held no later than 2025.


Note: The sum of the total seats held by each party may not amount to the total seats as a whole in the Chamber, Senate, Regions, and/or European Parliament because of independent politicians (i.e. those not members of any political party) holding the remaining seats.

<text>From the restoration of democracy in 1974 to the 2012 elections, the characteristic [[Politics of Greece|Greek political system]] was predominantly a two-party system. The historically dominant parties were New Democracy and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). Under the electoral system, a party needs to surpass a 3% threshold in the popular vote in order to enter parliament. Until 2023, the largest party used to get a 50-seat bonus (out of 300 seats), ostensibly to ensure elections returned viable governing majorities. The 2023 Greek legislative election was the first and only that was held without the 50-seat bonus rule. Although New Democracy achieved a large percentage of 40.7% and beat the opposition party by 20%, they fell short of forming a majority by 5 seats. The Hellenic Republic had a caretaker prime minister until the June 2023 Greek legislative election was held.

==History==
===1915–1967===
This period was mainly ruled between the right-wing and the centre.

The major parties that emerged were the People’s Party and the Liberal Party. In 1926, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), which would later define the left for years, entered the parliament.

From 1950 to 1963, the predominant parties that won all elections in this period were the People’s Party (later Hellenic Rally) and the National Radical Union (ERE) (both from the right).

===1974–2009===
After the seven-year dictatorship ended, the former leader of ERE, Konstantinos Karamanlis, was called back from exile to form a new government and then created the New Democracy (ND) party. Monarchy was abolished in 1974, making the political parties the sole determinants of politics in Greece.

Further, 1974 saw the establishment of a new party, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) under Andreas Papandreou, representing a socialist ideology. For the decades to come, PASOK and New Democracy were the two parties that dominated Greek politics, creating a formidable two-party system, with the communist party KKE coming third.

The party system during this period was characterised by strong bureaucratic clientelism.

===2009–present===
The global economic crisis that heavily affected Greece had an impact in reshaping the party system that had been stagnant for decades. Confidence in the traditional parties declined; this led to the end of the continuous two-party system and single-party governments. There was new movement towards the creation of coalitions and an increase in the number of parties entering parliament.

The party that rose through the crisis was the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA). It finished second on the crucial May 2012 legislative elections and later won the 2015 elections. It was the first party from the left wing in Greece&#x27;s history to win an election.

A new split in the party system ideology (created during the economic crisis) which was evident in the 2012 elections was a pro- or anti-European stance. This resulted in an unprecedented coalition between the major traditional parties New Democracy and PASOK and the minor party DIMAR. Similarly, the coalition that was created after the 2015 elections between SYRIZA, a left-wing party, and ANEL, a populist right party, was based on their common views regarding Europe.

This period of turmoil also saw the rise of the controversial far-right party Golden Dawn. It became a third party in parliament after the 2015 elections.

In 2018, the past major party PASOK merged with other centrist parties and created the Movement of Change (KINAL) formation.

The elections in 2019 saw a return to a single party government with the continuously dominant New Democracy claiming the majority in parliament.

<doc id="396370" wikidata="Q1369087" url="?curid=396370" title="List of political parties in India">
<text>India has a multi-party system. The Election Commission of India (ECI) grants recognition to national-level and state-level political parties based on objective criteria. A recognised political party enjoys privileges such as a reserved party symbol, free broadcast time on state-run television and radio, consultation in the setting of election dates, and giving input in setting electoral rules and regulations. Other political parties wishing to contest local, state, or national elections must be registered with the ECI. Registered parties can be upgraded to recognized national or state parties by the ECI if they meet the relevant criteria after a Lok Sabha or state legislative assembly election. The ECI periodically reviews the recognized party status.

Before the amendment in 2016 (which came into force on 1 January 2014), if a political party failed to fulfill the criteria in the subsequent Lok Sabha or state legislative assembly election, it would lose its status as a recognized party. In 2016, the ECI announced that a review would take place after two consecutive elections instead of after every election. Therefore, a political party will retain its recognized party status even if it does not meet the criteria in the next election. However, if it fails to meet the criteria in the election following the next one, it would lose its status.

As per latest publications dated 23 March 2024 from Election Commission of India, and subsequent notifications, there are 6 national parties, 58 state parties, and 2,763 unrecognised parties. All registered parties contesting elections need to choose a symbol from a list of available symbols offered by the EC. All 28 states of the country along with the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, National Capital Territory of Delhi, and Puducherry have elected governments unless President&#x27;s rule is imposed under certain condition.

==National parties==
A registered party is recognised as a national party only if it fulfills any one of the three conditions listed below:
*If its candidates have secured at least 6% of total valid votes in at least 4 states (in latest Lok Sabha or Assembly elections) and the party has at least 4 MPs in the last Lok Sabha polls.
*If it has won at least 2% of the total seats in the Lok Sabha from at least 3 states.
*It is ‘recognised’ in four or more states.

==State parties==
A registered party is recognised as a state party only if it fulfils any one of the five conditions listed below:

*A party should secure at least six per cent of valid votes polled in an election to the state legislative assembly and win at least two seats in that state assembly.
*A party should secure at least six per cent of valid votes polled in an election to Lok Sabha and win at least one seat in Lok Sabha.
*A party should win at least three per cent of the total number of seats or any fraction thereof allotted to that state.
*At least one MP for every 25 members or any fraction allotted to the state in the Lok Sabha.
*Under the liberalised criteria, one more clause that it will be eligible for recognition as state party if it secures eight per cent or more of the total valid votes polled in the state.

<text>There are a number of political parties in Ireland, and coalition governments are common. The two historically largest parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, arose from a split in the original Sinn Féin. Fine Gael is the successor of Cumann na nGaedheal, the faction that supported the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, while Fianna Fáil arose from members of the anti-Treaty faction who opposed Sinn Féin&#x27;s abstensionism. The division on the Treaty had also caused the Irish Civil War (1922–1923), leading to the difference between the parties being described as &quot;Civil War politics&quot;, to distinguish it from a more common left-right political divide. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together are sometimes pejoratively referred to as &quot;FFG&quot;.

, Fianna Fáil is the largest party in Dáil Éireann, followed by Sinn Féin in second, and closely by Fine Gael in third position. The Labour Party was formed in 1912, and it had usually been the third party in parliamentary strength, though it is currently the fourth largest party in the Dáil, followed closely by the Social Democrats in fifth.

The Electoral Commission maintains a Register of Political Parties under the Electoral Reform Act 2022. Before the establishment of the Commission 2023, the register was maintained by the Houses of the Oireachtas. To register to contest national elections a party must have either at least one member in Dáil Éireann or the European Parliament, or 300 recorded members aged 18 or over. Parties that register only to contest elections in part of the state or in local elections need only 100 recorded members aged 18 or over. In either case, at least half of the recorded members must be on the register of electors.

==Political parties with representation at a local, national or European level==
===Party details===
===Party representation===
==Parties and groupings represented in the Oireachtas==

===Fianna Fáil===
Fianna Fáil is the joint largest party in the Dáil, has the joint largest delegation of MEPs from Ireland, and has the largest number of city and county council seats. It has been in government more than any other party: 1932–1948, 1951–1954, 1957–1973, 1977–1981, 1982, 1987–1994, and 1997–2011, and since 2020. On all occasions up to 1989, it was in a single-party government; on all occasions since then it was the leading party in a coalition government. It is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and is led by Taoiseach Micheál Martin. 

It was founded in 1926 by Éamon de Valera in a split from Sinn Féin. When Sinn Féin refused to drop its abstentionist stand, de Valera led most of its TDs out of that party with a view toward republicanising the Free State from within. It was founded as a radical anti-Treaty party drawing support from small farmers and urban workers but has since become a party of the establishment. It was first elected to power in 1932 on a constitutional republican platform, promising to remove constitutional links with Britain and reduce poverty by creating employment. It oversaw much of the industrial development of the Republic and has consequently drawn support from all social classes, making it a classic populist party.

Fianna Fáil has 48 TDs, 19 senators, four MEPs and 246 councillors.

===Sinn Féin===

Sinn Féin is the joint largest party in the Dáil and the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The name Sinn Féin, meaning &quot;ourselves&quot; or &quot;we ourselves&quot;, has been used by a number of political organisations in Ireland since 1905, when first used by Arthur Griffith. Sinn Féin was the party of separatism before Irish independence, and broke through in the Westminster election of 1918, where it won 73 of the 105 Irish seats.

The modern-day Sinn Féin party emerged in 1970 after a split in the party, and was often distinguished as Provisional Sinn Féin. It was closely linked to the Provisional Irish Republican Army. It is led by Mary Lou McDonald.

Sinn Féin has 39 TDs, six senators, two MEPs and 99 councillors in the Republic of Ireland.

===Fine Gael===
Fine Gael is the third largest party in the Dáil, the second largest party in local government in Ireland and has joint largest delegation of MEPs from Ireland. It was founded in 1933 by a merger of Cumann na nGaedheal, which had supported the Treaty and formed the government between 1922 and 1932, the National Guard (popularly called the Blueshirts) and the small National Centre Party. It is a member of the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party and is led by Tánaiste Simon Harris. Counting the tenure of predecessor Cumann na nGaedheal, Fine Gael has been in government in the periods 1922–1932, 1948–1951, 1954–1957, 1973–1977, 1981–1982, 1982–1987, 1994–1997, and 2011 to date. On each occasion from 1948 until 2016, it was the leading party of a coalition with the Labour Party, and in three of those cases also with other smaller parties. At the 2011 general election, Fine Gael became the largest party in the Oireachtas with 36.1% of the vote.

Fine Gael has 38 TDs, 17 senators, four MEPs and 246 councillors.

In June 2007, the Green Party entered coalition government with Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. In January 2011 they left the coalition, and at the 2011 general election, lost all of their Dáil seats. From 2020 to 2024, it was in a coalition government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

In the 2024 election, they went from 12 seats to one seat. The Green Party has one TD, one senator and 23 councillors.

===Labour Party===
The Labour Party is a social democratic party, founded in 1912 as part of the trade union movement, with which it maintains organisational links. For most of the history of the state, it was the third largest party, though it is currently in fifth position in parliamentary strength.

On each occasion, it was in coalition with Fine Gael, with the exception 1993 to 1994, when it was in coalition with Fianna Fáil.

<text>This is a list of political parties in Italy since Italian unification in 1861.

Throughout history, numerous political parties have been operating in Italy. Since World War II no party has ever gained enough support to govern alone; thus, parties form political alliances and coalition governments.

In the 2022 general election, four groupings obtained most of the votes and most of the seats in the two houses of the Italian Parliament: the &quot;centre-right coalition&quot; composed of the Brothers of Italy, Lega, Forza Italia and minor allies; the &quot;centre-left coalition&quot; composed of the Democratic Party and minor allies; the populist Five Star Movement; and the liberal Action – Italia Viva (also known as &quot;Third Pole&quot;).

Coalitions of parties for regional elections can be slightly different from those for general elections, due to different regional conditions (for instance, in some regions the Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement are in coalition, but not in others; same for the Democratic Party and the Third Pole) and the presence of several regional parties, some of which active only at regional level.

==History==
The first modern political party in Italy was the Italian Socialist Party, established in 1892. Until then, the main political groupings of the country, the Historical Right and the Historical Left, were not classifiable as parties, but as simple groups of notables, each with their own electoral fiefdom, that joined together according to their own ideas. From time to time, in the context of the Historical Far Left, other parties emerged: the Italian Republican Party, established in 1895, and the Italian Radical Party, established in 1904.

The Italian Socialist Party envisaged itself as a mass party, a form of party that would dominate throughout the 20th century. It was followed a few years later by the Italian People&#x27;s Party, established in 1919. Both parties achieved electoral success until the advent of fascism, contributing decisively to the loss of strength and authority of the old liberal ruling class, which had not been able to structure itself into a proper party: the Liberal Union, launched in 1913, was not a coherent one and the Italian Liberal Party, formed in 1922, came too late. The beginning of 1921 saw the foundation of the Communist Party of Italy, born from a split of the Italian Socialist Party. Also in 1921, Benito Mussolini gave birth to the National Fascist Party, and the next year, through the March on Rome, he was appointed Prime Minister. In 1926, through the so-called &quot;leggi fascistissime&quot; (), all parties were dissolved except the National Fascist Party, which thus remained the only legal party in the Kingdom of Italy until the fall of the regime in July 1943. Meanwhile, following the dissolution of the Comintern in May 1943, the Communist Party of Italy was rebranded Italian Communist Party. The following September, six anti-fascist parties – the Christian Democracy, the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Liberal Party, the Action Party and the Labour Democratic Party — formed the joint National Liberation Committee, which gained official recognition as the representative of the Italian resistance movement (the Committee recognised the monarchy, thus the Italian Republican Party stayed out because of its full loyalty to republican principles). The parties of the Committee then formed, in various combinations, the governments of Italy from the liberation of Rome in 1944 until 1947, when the Socialists and the Communists were ejected.

In 1946, through a referendum, Italy became a republic and a Constituent Assembly wrote the republican Constitution. Between 1948 and 1992, the party system was dominated by two major parties: the Christian Democracy, the structural party of government, and the Italian Communist Party, the main opposition party. Another stable opposition party was the post-fascist Italian Social Movement. For about half a century, following a so-called &quot;conventio ad excludendum&quot; of the Italian Communist Party, the governments were led by the Christian Democracy, that chose its coalition partners among smaller parties situated either to its left or right: the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Republican Party. Between 1981 and 1991, the Christian Democrats formed coalition governments named &quot;Pentapartito&quot; with all four of them. That was the time when several northern regional parties, whose policy themes were federalism and autonomism, were established. In 1991 they federated themselves into Lega Nord, which became the country&#x27;s fourth largest party in the 1992 general election.

Between 1992 and 1994, the established party system was shaken by a series of corruption scandals known collectively as &quot;Tangentopoli&quot;. These events led to the disappearance of the five parties of government. Consequently, the Italian Communist Party, which had evolved to become the Democratic Party of the Left in 1991, with the exit of the Communist Refoundation Party, and the post-fascists, who had launched National Alliance in 1994, gained strength. On the contrary, the Christian Democracy, which changed its name to Italian People&#x27;s Party in 1994, lost its centrality in the Italian party system. Following the 1994 general election, media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi became Prime Minister at the head of a government composed mainly of his brand-new Forza Italia party, joined by several members of the defunct mainstream parties, National Alliance and Lega Nord.

Between 1996 and 2008, the political parties were organised into two big coalitions, which took turns in government: the centre-right Pole for Freedoms, which was renamed House of Freedoms after the re-entry of Lega Nord in 2000, and The Olive Tree, lately part of a broader coalition named The Union, on the centre-left. As for the centre-left, the Democratic Party of the Left changed its name again in 1998, becoming Democrats of the Left, while in 2002 a new party called Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy was founded by the merger of some centrist parties (including the Italian People&#x27;s Party). In 2008, following the fall of the centre-left government led by Romano Prodi, the Democratic Party (established in 2007 upon the merger of the Democrats of the Left and The Daisy) decided to break the alliance with the Communist Refoundation Party and other minor left-wing parties. Contextually, on the centre-right of the political spectrum, Forza Italia and National Alliance merged to form The People of Freedom, which continued the alliance with Lega Nord and prevailed in the 2008 general election.

In the 2013 general election, the party system was fragmented in four groupings: the centre-left alliance led by the Democratic Party; the traditional centre-right alliance between the People of Freedom, Lega Nord and the newly-founded Brothers of Italy (a right-wing split of the People of Freedom, formed mainly by former members of National Alliance); Beppe Grillo&#x27;s Five Star Movement; and a new centrist coalition around the outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti&#x27;s Civic Choice party. In November 2013, the national council of People of Freedom, at the behest of Berlusconi, suspended all party activities, to relaunch Forza Italia, which would experience multiple splits. In the 2018 general election, the major groupings were reduced to three: the centre-right coalition, composed of Lega (Lega Nord&#x27;s evolution on a countrywide scale), Forza Italia, Brothers of Italy and minor allies; the Five Star Movement (which was the single most voted party); and the centre-left coalition, composed of the Democratic Party and minor allies. The centre-right coalition won a full majority in the 2022 general election, leading to a government led by Brothers of Italy&#x27;s leader Giorgia Meloni (the first since 2008 to be formed by a coalition of parties having fought the election together), while the opposition was fragmented in three segments: the Democratic Party-led centre-left coalition; the Five Star Movement; and a centrist alliance between Action and Italia Viva (both splinter groups of the Democratic Party).

This term was first coined in during the 1994 Sabah state elections after United Sabah Party losing its majority even the party won the state elections. Despite its usage nationwide, it is more familiar within the state of Sabah. Since May 25, 2023, nine states of Malaysia has approved the &quot;Anti-Switching Parties Law&quot; or &quot;Anti-Hopping Parties Law&quot; for both states legislative assembly and parliament including Sabah and Sarawak.

===Election expenses===
The Election Offences Act (1954) regulates the maximum expenses allowed for candidates vying for parliamentary seats and for state seats during the campaign period (excluding before the nomination day and after election day). The permissible campaign expenditure set by the Election Offences Act (1954) is RM 100,000 per candidate for state seats and RM 200,000 per candidate for federal seats. According to this guideline, with 505 state seats and 222 parliamentary seats in the 2013 general election, the maximum amount that Barisan Nasional was allowed to spend was only about RM 95 million. Due to the lack of records and regulations, Malaysian politicians may not even know how much they spent on their campaigns or overspending the expenditure than permitted by law. Another related problem was the secrecy surrounding political funds and their use. Although many politicians, including members of newly appointed cabinets, voluntarily disclosed their personal finances, such disclosure is not compulsory and many sources of revenue remain obscure.

===Election deposits===
The deposit was RM 10,000 to contest a parliamentary seat, or RM 5,000 to contest a state assembly seat. The deposit is used to pay for infringements of election laws and is returned after polling day unless the candidate loses and fails to garner more than 12.5 per cent or one-eighth of the votes cast. Additionally it is required that each candidate provide a RM 5,000 deposit for cleaning up banners and posters after the election.

===Political donations===
Political donations are legal in Malaysia. There is no limit, and parties are not obliged to disclose the source of the funding, which makes political donations a vague subject but still entirely legal in the country. All political donations are allowed to be given into accounts of individuals and accounts of the political party. Anonymous donors and foreigners may request to not to reveal their identities.

Political parties are funded by contributions from:
* party members and individual supporters (via membership fees/dues/subscriptions and/or local/foreign small donations),
* organisations, which share their political views (e.g. by trade union affiliation fees) or which stand to benefit from their activities (e.g. by local/foreign corporate donations) or
* taxpayers respectively the general revenue fund (by grants that are called state aid, government or public funding).

==Latest election results==
==Currently active parties==
===Parties represented in the Parliament and/or the state legislative assemblies===
This is the list of coalitions and parties that have representation in the Parliament of Malaysia (Dewan Rakyat &amp; Dewan Negara) and/or the state legislative assemblies, sorted by seats held in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia. Unless noted, numbers exclude independents and loose allies linked to each party

==Coalitions and electoral pacts==

=== Pakatan Harapan (PH, Alliance of Hope) ===

The list is sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS).

=== Perikatan Nasional (PN, National Alliance) ===

The list is sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS).

=== Barisan Nasional (BN, National Front) ===
The list is sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS).

=== Gerakan Tanah Air (GTA, Homeland Movement) ===
The list is sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS).

=== Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS, Sarawak Parties Coalition) ===
The list is sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS).

=== Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS, Sabah People&#x27;s Coalition) ===
The list is sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS).

==Parties without representation in the Parliament and the state legislative assemblies==
This is the list of active coalitions and parties that do not have representation in the Parliament of Malaysia (Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara) and the state legislative assemblies, sorted by the year in which the respective parties were legalised and registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS). Parties that are part of a coalition that is represented are not listed here even if the party itself is not represented. This list does not include parties that are active but have yet to be registered with the ROS or EC such as the Green Party of Malaysia.

=== Parties registered with the ROS and EC ===
Political parties registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS) and with the Election Commission (EC).

=== Parties registered with the ROS but not with the EC ===
Political parties registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS) but not with the Election Commission (EC). They are therefore unable or able to contest in elections using their own symbols.

==Historical parties==
These organisations have never been or are no longer registered as political bodies, and can thus no longer contest elections. Parties that were registered in British Malaya but operated solely in the territory of Singapore are also excluded from this list. Parties that have been renamed but still exist today as registered political parties are also excluded from this list. A number of these may still exist as organisations in some form, but none are recognised as political parties.

===Before 1925===

===1950–1959===

===1960–1969===

===1970–1979===

=== 1980–1989 ===

===1990–1999===

<text>This article lists [[political party|political parties]] in [[Malta]]. 
Since World War II, Maltese political culture has developed into a two-party system dominated by the centre-left Labour Party () and the centre-right Nationalist Party (). Although other political parties have presented candidates and, in some cases, elected MPs, in most cases these were splinter groups of the main parties and, on the rare occasions when they were successful, this success was short-lived.

In the case of Local Councils however, independent candidates and village-dedicated parties have better chances of being elected. Għarb l-Ewwel (en: Għarb First), Floriana l-Ewwel (mt: Floriana First) and AD+PD hold representation in a Local Council. 

Until 2015, there was no law in Malta requiring the registration and regulation of political parties; the &quot;General Elections Act&quot; made the necessary provisions for party participation in elections but no official list was maintained between elections. The &quot;Financing of Political Parties Act&quot;, which passed in 2015 and came into effect on 1 January 2016, introduced the requirement for political parties to register themselves with the Electoral Commission and declare all donations in order to be able to field candidates in general elections and European Parliament elections. The Labour Party was the first party to attempt to register, on 3 June 2016, however its statute was found to be non-compliant, therefore making Moviment Patrijotti Maltin the first party to be officially registered, on 24 November 2016.

<text>This article lists political parties in Peru.
Peru has a multi-party system with several political parties competing in legislative elections according to a party-list proportional representation system. As a consequence, it is rare for any single political organization to obtain an absolute majority in the Congress of Peru, thus, these parties often work with each other to form coalition governments.

<text>This article lists political parties in Portugal. The Portuguese political scene has been dominated by the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party since the 1974 Carnation Revolution although there are several important minor parties (discussed below).

As of 2024, the parties represented in the Assembly of the Republic are the Democratic Alliance (80 MPs), Socialist Party (78 MPs), the Chega party (49 MPs), the Liberal Initiative (8 MPs), the Left Bloc (5 MPs), the Unitary Democratic Coalition (4 MPs), the FREE party (4 MPs), and the People-Animals-Nature party (1 MP). Several other parties are represented in the legislatures of the autonomous regions, the Legislative Assembly of the Azores and the Legislative Assembly of Madeira.

=== Parties without representation in the Assembly of the Republic or the European Parliament ===
==General overview==

This list presents all the existing parties recognized by the Portuguese Constitutional Court.

* The Social Democratic Party (PPD/PSD), despite the name, is not a traditional social democratic party, being much closer to the centre-right. A big tent party, it is the equivalent of any other liberal conservative party in Europe such as the French Republicans or the German CDU. The PSD was founded right after the 1974 Revolution as &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (Democratic People&#x27;s Party) by many personalities of the so-called &quot;liberal wing&quot; of the fascist regime, like Francisco Sá Carneiro (the PSD historical leader), Francisco Pinto Balsemão, and Joaquim Magalhães Mota. Its leader, Luís Montenegro, is the current Prime Minister of Portugal and the current President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is a former leader.
* The Socialist Party (PS), a social democratic party, is a major party in Portugal, resembling the British Labour Party, the German SPD or the Spanish PSOE. The party was founded before the 1974 Revolution by (among others) Mário Soares, its historical leader and one of the main opponents of the dictatorial regime. The current Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres is a former leader and Prime Minister.
* Chega (CH) is a Portuguese a national conservative, right-wing populist party founded by PSD dissident André Ventura, similar to the French National Rally, the Spanish Vox or the Dutch Party for Freedom. 
* The Liberal Initiative (IL) is a classical liberal and right-libertarian party, which advocates for capitalism and social liberalism. They are similar to the German FDP, the Lithuanian Freedom Party or the Danish Liberal Alliance.
* The Left Bloc (BE), formed as a result of the merger of three left-wing parties (the Popular Democratic Union, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the Politics XXI), is an overwhelmingly urban party, adopting a wide range of left-wing policies and portrays itself as the modern, progressive alternative to the Portuguese Communist Party.
* The Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), founded in 1921 as the Portuguese Section of the Communist International, has its major influence among the working class and played a major role in the opposition to the Estado Novo regime, being brutally repressed in the process. After being one of the most influential parties in the years that followed the Carnation Revolution, it lost most of its power base after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, but still enjoys popularity in some sectors of Portuguese society. It also has a major influence among the biggest Portuguese labour union – General Confederation of the Portuguese Workers (CGTP). Its historical leader was Álvaro Cunhal.
* FREE (L) is a green political, social democratic, and pro-European party.
* The CDS – People&#x27;s Party (CDS–PP) is a traditional Christian Democrat and conservative party, similar to the German CSU or the Spanish PP. Founded after the revolution, its historical leaders were Diogo Freitas do Amaral and Adelino Amaro da Costa. In 1976 it was the only party that voted against approval of a socialist constitution. Later, it was part of several governments in coalition with the PSD. The CDS congregates several right-wing tendencies ranging from christian democrats to neoliberals and more conservative elements.
* People-Animals-Nature (PAN) is a party inspired by environmentalism and strongly focused on the rights of animals and animal welfare and which considers itself to be socially progressive, defending LGBT rights and women&#x27;s rights.
* The Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot; (PEV) is the first Portuguese green party, traditionally allied with the Communist Party in the Unitary Democratic Coalition.
* The National Democratic Alternative (ADN) was founded by the former leader of the Portuguese Bar Association, António Marinho e Pinto. He ran as the Earth Party candidate for the 2014 European elections but left the party soon after to form his own party. A populist party, it became COVID-19 denialist and anti-environmentalist, defending a reform of the electoral system and reform of justice system.
* React, Include, Recycle (RIR) is a humanist, pacifist and universalist party (&quot;Rir&quot; in Portuguese means &quot;laughing&quot;).
* Together for the People (JPP) was formed as an independent movement for the local elections of 2013 in the municipally of Santa Cruz in Madeira. Transformed into a political party in 2015 in order to contest the regional elections in Madeira.
* The New Right (ND) is a party created by Ossanda Liber, a former candidate for mayor of Lisbon and a former member of Alliance that created a right-wing conservative party that is looking to occupy the place of CDS–PP in national politics after they left parliament following the 2022 legislative elections.
* The Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party (PCTP/MRPP) is a Maoist party. It had a high-profile during the Carnation Revolution, mostly due to its influence among some groups of students, although it never reached 2% of the votes or elected a single MP.
* Volt Portugal (VP), portuguese chapter of Volt Europa, is a pro-European and European federalist political movement. The organisation follows a &quot;pan-European approach&quot; in many policy fields such as climate change, migration, economic inequality, international conflict, terrorism and the impact of the technological revolution on the labour market. It identifies itself as a pan-European, progressive, social-liberal and environmentalist political party.
* Rise Up! (E) is a far-right nationalist party with little political expression. 
* The Earth Party (MPT) is a centre-right green conservative party, founded in 1993 by a faction of the People&#x27;s Monarchist Party.
* Alliance (A) is a party formed by former Social Democratic leader and former Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes.
* The Portuguese Labour Party (PTP) is a minor party of the centre-left.
* We, the Citizens! (NC) is a minor centre-right party founded as a result of the anti-austerity movement.
* The People&#x27;s Monarchist Party (PPM) is a small monarchist party with little political expression. It is known that the pretender heir to the Portuguese throne, Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, does not support this party, since the question of monarchical regime is considered to be above partisanship.
* The Socialist Alternative Movement (MAS) was formed in 2000 as a Portuguese Trotskyist political organization and it is the result of a merger between the Left Revolutionary Front (FER - &quot;Frente da Esquerda Revolucionária&quot;), and the young activists of the student movement &quot;Ruptura&quot;. The &quot;Ruptura&quot;/FER activists integrated the Left Bloc since its formation. In 2011, the movement split from the Left Bloc and formed a new party called &quot;Socialist Alternative Movement&quot; that was approved by the Constitutional Court in July 2013.
* The (A)TUA A)T is a small party with the goal to defend the rights of retirees and pensioners, aiming to position itself as the political voice of the members of this age group. Originally called &quot;United Party of Retirees and Pensioners (PURP)&quot;, the current name, (A)TUA, was approved in 2024, it was founded as a result of the anti-austerity movement.

<text>This article discusses political parties in Russia.

The Russian Federation has a &quot;de jure&quot; multi-party system, however it operates as a dominant-party system. , six parties have members in the federal parliament, the State Duma, with one dominant party (United Russia). , 27 political parties are officially registered in the Russian Federation, 25 of which have the right to participate in elections.

== History ==

After the Perestroika reforms in the 1980s Russia had over 100 registered parties, but the people elected to the State Duma represented only a small number of parties. After 2000, during Vladimir Putin&#x27;s first presidency (2000–2008), the number of parties quickly decreased. From 2008 to 2012 there were only seven parties in Russia, and every new attempt to register new parties was blocked. The last registered party of this period was the government-organized Right Cause (now the Party of Growth) which was registered on 18 February 2009. Before the 2011 parliamentary election, about 10 opposition parties were denied registration.

In 2001, the federal law &quot;On political parties&quot; was adopted. All parties had to be re-registered. Parties have been assigned the status of the only type of public association that has the right to independently nominate candidates for deputies and other elective positions in government bodies. One of the major provisions of the law is the establishment of a single national status of a political party, and, as a result, the liquidation of regional and interregional political public associations. According to paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 95-FZ “On Political Parties”, a political party in Russia is recognized as &quot;a public association created for the purpose of participation of citizens of the Russian Federation in the political life of society through the formation and expression of their political will, participation in public and political actions, in elections and referendums, as well as in order to represent the interests of citizens in state authorities and local governments&quot;.

In December 2004, amendments were introduced requiring a minimum number of party members of 50,000 and the presence of more than 45 regional branches of 500 people each. By January 1, 2006, all parties had to submit documents proving that their party structures complied with the requirements of the law on the minimum number of members and the number of regional branches.

In 2009, a bill was introduced to reduce the minimum number of party members from 50,000 to 45,000, and from 500 to 450 members in regional branches. This law came into effect on January 1, 2010. The minimum number of party members was reduced again on January 1, 2012, to 40,000 and to 400 members per regional branch.

On February 28, 2012, an election law was adopted meaning parties were exempted from collecting signatures and making a cash deposit for nominating a party and its candidate, and gubernatorial elections were restored. The number of required signatures for candidates for the presidential elections was reduced from 2 million to 100,000 for party candidates, and 300,000 for self-nominated candidates. The electoral threshold for parties was also reduced from 7% to 5%.

On March 20, 2012, the State Duma approved a presidential bill to reduce the minimum number of political party members from 40,000 to only 500 people, and from 500 to 5 members for a regional branch.

However, after a series of mass protests and a 2011 European Court decision on the case of the Republican Party of Russia (now the People&#x27;s Freedom Party), the law changed and the number of registered parties quickly increased to more than 48 .

===Party of Power===

A &quot;party of power&quot; refers to a political party that has a close relationship with the executive branch of government such that the party appears to function as an extension of the executive rather than as an autonomous political organization. The concept resembles that of a cartel party. These parties are considered by some to have been especially established for support of the incumbent president or prime minister in the Russian parliament:
*Inter-regional Deputies Group/Democratic Russia (1990–1993, Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union/Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of Russia/Supreme Soviet of Russia)
*Democratic Choice of Russia (1993–1994)
*Our Home – Russia (1995–1999)
*Unity (1999–2001/2003)
*A Just Russia - For Truth (the second &quot;party of power&quot;, supporting Vladimir Putin and opposing United Russia)
*United Russia (2001–present)

== Voter demographics ==

According to studies, United Russia voters in 2007 were younger and more market-oriented than the average voter. The party&#x27;s electorate includes a substantial share of government employees, pensioners and military personnel, who are dependent on the state for their livelihood. Sixty-four percent of United Russia supporters are female. In the run-up to the 2011 Duma elections, it was reported that support for United Russia was growing among young people.

In April 2023, a survey on the issue of the dissolution of the United Russia Party was conducted among Russians. About 2,500 people participated in the survey, mostly aged 45+. The question was &quot;Is it necessary to dissolve the United Russia party with the inability of its members to participate in political life in the future?&quot; the answers were distributed as follows: 65% stated: &quot;I am for dissolution without permission to participate in political life in the future&quot;, 3% stated &quot;I am against dissolution&quot;, 6% stated &quot;I am for dissolution, but with permission to participate in political life in the future&quot;, and 26% stated &quot;I am for the dissolution of all bourgeois parties&quot;.

== Current parties ==
All parties registered with the Ministry of Justice have the right to participate in any elections across the country. A list of registered parties is placed on the Ministry website. In December 2012, there were 48 registered parties in Russia; 7 of them are currently represented in the State Duma as of 2021.

<text>This is a list of political parties in Singapore, including existing and historical ones. The earliest political parties were established in the lead-up to Singapore first Legislative Council elections in 1948. Singapore is a republic. While the country has a multi-party system, the dominant political party have often been the People&#x27;s Action Party since 1965, along with the main opposition party, the Workers&#x27; Party. Minority governments are uncommon, as elections have not resulted in a hung parliament since independence.

Legislative power is vested in parliament, which consists of the president as its head and a single chamber whose members are elected by popular vote. The role of the president as the head of state has been, historically, largely ceremonial although the constitution was amended in 1991 to give the president some veto powers in a few key decisions such as the use of the national reserves, as well as the appointment of key judiciary, civil service and Singapore Armed Forces posts. They also exercise powers over national security matters.

Singapore has consistently been rated as the least-corrupt country in Asia and globally amongst the top five by Transparency International&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index, and the degree of accountability and transparency is reflected in the public&#x27;s high level of satisfaction with the political institutions. Thomas Friedman of the &quot;New York Times&quot; also considers the country&#x27;s civil service to be one of the most efficient and uncorrupt bureaucracies in the world, with a high standard of discipline and accountability. The World Bank&#x27;s governance indicators have also rated Singapore highly on rule of law, control of corruption and government effectiveness.

==History==
===Pre-independence===
Amongst the oldest parties, the Malay Union, traced its history back to 14 May 1926, was initially a non-political association as the party only participated in the 1955 election. The Progressive Party and Labour Party, both established in the late 1940s, were some of the pioneering local establishments, with the PP the only party to contest in the first elections in 1948, and the LP coming on board in 1951. By 1955, the fledgling British colony had seven parties contesting, and reached a pinnacle of 13 parties in 1959. A total of three parties were established in the 1940s, 12 in the 1950s and five in the 1960s.

===Post-independence===
====20th century====
Post-independence Singapore saw the dominance of the People&#x27;s Action Party, which first came into power in 1959. On 16 May 1960, a new Societies Ordinance was passed, and in December 1966, local parties were forbidden from being affiliated to foreign ones. This directly impacted the handful of small parties with links to Malaysia, most of which renamed themselves and/or cut formal foreign ties. The PAP&#x27;s dominance stemming from Singapore&#x27;s economic advancement further weakened the smaller opposition parties, with a majority of Singaporeans voting for the PAP in subsequent elections. 

Still, new parties continued to be established, and to date, there are therefore a total of 30 registered political parties today, of which ten have never contested in an election, 13 parties have officially dissolved with most through mergers with other parties. A few opposition parties, those of Workers&#x27; Party and Singapore Democratic Party, had gained some success towards the 80s with the captures of its safe seat of Hougang and Potong Pasir respectively, with the former went with further success heading towards the 21st century. 

====21st century====
Over the years, alliances between political parties existed, however short-lived. Presently, only one functioning multi-party alliance, the Singapore Democratic Alliance, which was formed on 3 July 2001, initially composed of the Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP), National Solidarity Party (NSP), Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura and the Justice Party, Singapore, with the SPP being the lead party. The vision was to bring all opposition parties under one banner to counter the PAP&#x27;s dominance, but it was met with limited success due to opposition infighting. The NSP left the alliance in 2007, and in 2010, the SPP itself left when there was internal disagreements over the SPP&#x27;s attempts to bring in the newly formed Reform Party (RP).

Many party members have resigned from its former parties and later formed newer parties over the years following the aftermath of its respective general elections, notably People&#x27;s Power Party (PPP) formed by former WP and NSP member Goh Meng Seng in 2015, the Peoples Voice (PV) by former-National Solidarity Party&#x27;s Secretary general Lim Tean in 2018, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) in 2019 by former People&#x27;s Action Party Member of Parliament Tan Cheng Bock, Red Dot United (RDP) in 2020 by former PSP members Ravi Philemon and Michelle Lee, and Singapore United Party (SUP) by former RP members in 2021.

==Legislation==
Under the current legislation, all political parties (termed &quot;Political Associations&quot;) must be registered under the Societies Act. As such, the following rules pertaining to political associations apply:
* All members of political parties must be Singaporean citizens.
* Political Association must not be affiliated or connected with any organisation outside Singapore. The fact that a political association uses a name or symbol which is the same as that of an organisation outside Singapore shall be deemed to be sufficient evidence that the political association has an affiliation or connection with that organisation.
The government has the power to dissolve the party if it contravenes the above rules, or any other rule applicable to all forms of registered societies.

Under the Political Donations Act which came into force on 15 February 2001, Political Associations are also barred from accepting any donation in cash or kind from impermissible donors, or from anonymous donors where the value exceeds S$5,000. The government announced that it was to &quot;prevent foreigners from interfering in domestic politics through the financial support for any association&#x27;s cause&quot;, and cited an example of a case in 1959 when S$700,000 was sent to Chew Swee Kee, then Education Minister from the Singapore People&#x27;s Alliance by a &quot;neighbouring intelligence service in a &quot;black operation&quot; against the interests of Singapore&quot;. Another case was also cited pertaining to foreign financial support for Francis Seow of the Workers&#x27; Party in 1988. 

The People&#x27;s Action Party donated $20,000 to Australian political parties through (Singtel-owned) Optus in 2010, although the motives and details of the donation remain unverified. 

==Political parties==
There have been a total of 44 political parties (not including Malaysia&#x27;s parties, those contested in both Malaysia and Singapore elections, or those which contested during Singapore&#x27;s merger with Malaysia) in Singapore.

 Party or Alliance active &lt;br&gt; Party or Alliance active, but collated to another party or alliance &lt;br&gt; Party or Alliance dissolved &lt;br&gt; Party or Alliance registered, but is yet to contest &lt;br&gt; Party or Alliance&#x27;s status unknown

<text>This article serves as a list of the political parties in Spain.

Spain has a multi-party system at both the national and regional level, the major parties nationwide being the People&#x27;s Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE).

Spain was formerly considered to have a two-party system dominated by the PSOE and the PP; however, the current makeup has no formation or coalition with enough seats to claim a parliamentary majority in the bicameral Cortes Generales (consisting of both the national Congress of Deputies and regional representation in the Senate). Regional parties can be strong in autonomous communities, notably Catalonia and the Basque Country, and are often essential for national government coalitions.

The People&#x27;s Party originates from the People&#x27;s Alliance (&quot;Alianza Popular, AP&quot;), which refounded in 1989. The party has governed from 1996 to 2004 and from 2011 to 2018. 
* Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Partido Socialista Obrero Español, PSOE&quot;) — mainstream centre-left social democratic party linked to General Union of Workers (&quot;Unión General de Trabajadores, UGT&quot;) trade union. The Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (&quot;Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya, PSC&quot;) acts as the party&#x27;s instance in Catalonia. The party has governed from 1982 to 1996, from 2004 to 2011 and since 2018.
* Vox — a right-wing to far-right party that split from the PP in 2014; its main ideologies are social and national conservatism, economic liberalism and centralism (i.e. strong opposition to Spain&#x27;s peripheral nationalisms). Vox opposes LGBT movements in Spain while endorsing anti-LGBT rhetoric abroad, rejects European federalism and defends narrowing the naturalisation of immigrant individuals of Maghrebi origin. It has allied to similar political parties from Latin America, the Italian Brothers of Italy and the Hungarian Fidesz.
* Sumar — a left-wing and progressive electoral platform established in 2022, constituted as an instrumental political party. It conforms an alliance of left-wing formations, some of them formerly comprising the Unidas Podemos and Más País political alliances, including nationwide United Left, Más Madrid, Greens Equo and regional Compromís, Chunta and Batzarre, among others. Like preceding Unidas Podemos, Sumar forms a coalition with governing PSOE.
* We can (&quot;Podemos&quot;) — a left-wing populist political party founded in 2014 in the aftermath of the 15-M Movement. It was in government as junior partner of the PSOE from 2020 to 2023, within the alliance Unidas Podemos.
* Citizens (&quot;Ciudadanos, Cs&quot;) — a centre-right liberal and pro-european party. It supports a high degree of political decentralization, but rejects autonomous communities&#x27; right to self-determination. Once the third-largest force in Congress, its popular support sharply declined in the November 2019 general election. The party didn&#x27;t contest the latest general elections.

<text>This article lists the political parties in the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]) from 7 December 1949.

The organization of political parties in Taiwan is governed by the Political Parties Act, enacted on 6 December 2017. The Political Parties Act defines political parties as &quot;political groups consisting of ROC citizens with a common political ideology who safeguard the free, democratic, constitutional order, assist in shaping the political will of the people, and nominate candidates for election to public office.&quot;

Prior to the passage of the Political Parties Act, political organizations in Taiwan followed the Civil Associations Act, also known as the Civil Organizations Act, promulgated in 1989. The Civil Associations Act required that groups held a convention to announce the formation of a political party, and within thirty days of the announcement, provide a list of party members and a party charter to the Ministry of the Interior. Groups established when the Civil Associations Act was in effect should have revised their charters to comply with the Political Parties Act by 7 December 2019. To be compliant with the Political Parties Act, political groups must additionally convene a representative assembly or party congress for four consecutive years and have followed relevant laws and regulations governing the nomination of candidates to campaign in elections for public office for the same time period. Within one year of filing for political party status, a political group must complete legal person registration. The Ministry of the Interior requires that political parties submit annual property and financial statements. Political organizations that do not meet these regulations were dissolved and removed from the registry of political parties.

== Current parties ==

=== Parties with national or local representation ===
* National representation includes the President, the Vice President, and the 113 national legislator seats in the Legislative Yuan.
* Local representation includes the 22 mayors/magistrates executive positions and 912 local legislator (councils) seats of the 6 special municipalities, 3 cities and 13 counties.


=== Full list of registered political parties ===
The following is a full list of registered political parties according to the Ministry of the Interior, by order of registration. Dates indicate date of founding. A large number of these political parties have been officially deregistered or dissolved.


== Historical parties ==
=== Taiwan under Japanese rule ===
Political party movements in Taiwan started in the late 1910s after World War I, during the Taishō era (Taishō democracy). Taiwanese political movements at this time were to modify the discriminatory colonial laws established in earlier years, and to set up local autonomy systems like in Mainland Japan. The largest political movement at this time was the Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament. At the same time, the International Communist Movement also influenced Taiwan, many Left-wing parties and organizations were also established.

Notable Taiwanese parties during this time are:
* Taiwan Dōkakai (, Japanese: &quot;Taiwan Dōkakai&quot;)
* New People Society (; &quot;Shinminkai&quot;)
* Taiwanese Cultural Association (; &quot;Taiwan Bunka Kyōkai&quot;)
* Taiwanese Federation of Workers&#x27; Unions (; &quot;Taiwan Kōyū Sōrenmei&quot;)
* Taiwanese Peasants Union (; &quot;Taiwan Nōmin Kumiai&quot;)
* Taiwanese Communist Party (; &quot;Taiwan Kyōsan-tō&quot;)
* Taiwanese People&#x27;s Party (; &quot;Taiwan Minshu-tō&quot;)
* Taiwan Local Autonomy Union (; &quot;Taiwan Tihō-jiti Renmei&quot;)

At the same time, the political parties in Mainland Japan also affected Taiwan. Those who served as Governor-General of Taiwan were also members of the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet . Party affiliations of the Governor-Generals were:
* Rikken Seiyūkai 
* Kenseikai 
* Rikken Minseitō 

In the late 1930s, the Empire of Japan joined the Second World War. To prepare for the Pacific War, all political parties in Mainland Japan were merged by then-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe into a single organization
with its Taiwanese branch
was the only legal political party-like organization in Taiwan until the end of World War II.

=== Taiwan under the Republic of China ===
Taiwan was ceded back to the Republic of China, founded in 1912 on the mainland, on 25 October 1945. From 1945 until 1949, political parties in China which had operated covertly under Japanese rule were permitted to operate in Taiwan province. The ruling Kuomintang set up formal branches in Taiwan, and so did other major political parties including the Chinese Communist Party (in 1946). Although it had no formal connection with the Taiwanese Communist Party suppressed by Japanese authorities in the 1930s (which was instead affiliated with the Communist Party of Japan), the Taiwan branch of the Chinese Communist Party absorbed many former members of the Taiwanese Communist Party. However, against the backdrop of the Chinese Civil War which erupted soon after the retrocession of Taiwan, the Kuomintang-controlled Republic of China government attempted to restrict the operation of Chinese Communist Party cells in Taiwan, and other opposition parties.

With the Republic of China government rapidly losing the Chinese Civil War against the Chinese Communist Party, the ruling Kuomintang began preparing to move the government to Taiwan in 1949. Taiwan was placed under martial law from 19 May 1949 to 15 July 1987. The Taiwan provincial branch of the Chinese Communist Party was particularly targeted, and by 1952 had been completely destroyed.

During this time, all forms of opposition were forbidden by the government, only three political parties that retreated to Taiwan were allowed to participate the elections.
* Kuomintang ()
* Chinese Youth Party ()
* China Democratic Socialist Party ()
All other oppositions who were not allowed not form a political party could only be listed as &quot;independent candidate&quot;. These movements were called Tangwai movement (, literally &quot;outside of Kuomintang&quot;). A notable exception in this era was
* Democratic Progressive Party ().
It was established &quot;illegally&quot; on 28 September 1986, then was legalized in the next year by the lifting of the martial law.

As Taiwan democratized in the late 1980s, the number of legally registered political parties in Taiwan had increased exponentially and continued to increase year by year, indicating a liberal democracy and high political freedom in Taiwan.
In recent decades, Taiwan&#x27;s political campaigns can be classified to two ideological blocs
* The Pan-Green Coalition, led by Democratic Progressive Party, favors Taiwanization and the Taiwan independence movement, eventually aiming to establish a Taiwanese sovereign state.
* The Pan-Blue Coalition, led by Kuomintang, is in favor of building closer ties with mainland China and the eventual Chinese unification under the Government of the Republic of China.
The majority in both coalitions state a desire to maintain the status quo for now. Many minor parties in Taiwan are unaligned with either coalition.

On 6 December 2017, the &quot;Political Parties Act&quot; () was enforced. The &quot;Act&quot; requires the political parties to maintain a number of compliance, including
* File a declaration to the Ministry of the Interior, AND register as a legal person to a District Court,
* Convene representative assembly or party congress at least once in a four-year period,
* Nominate candidates in national or local elections at least once in a four-year period, and
* Compliance on funding source, accounting, and financial transparency.
By the end of 2018, among the 343 existing political party declarations: 220 have met the new compliance, 56 chose to dissolve or transformed to a national political association.

<text>The National Assembly of Quebec (, ) is the legislative body of the province of Quebec in Canada. Legislators are called MNAs (Members of the National Assembly; ). The lieutenant governor of Quebec (representing the King of Canada) and the National Assembly compose the Legislature of Quebec, which operates in a fashion similar to those of other Westminster-style parliamentary systems. The assembly has 125 members elected via first past the post from single-member districts.

The National Assembly was formerly the lower house of Quebec&#x27;s legislature and was then called the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. In 1968, the upper house, the Legislative Council, was abolished and the remaining house was renamed. The office of President of the National Assembly is equivalent to speaker in other legislatures. As of the 2022 Quebec general election, the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) has the most seats in the Assembly.

== History ==

The Constitutional Act 1791 created the Parliament of Lower Canada. It consisted of two chambers, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly. That parliament and both chambers were abolished in 1841 when the Act of Union 1840 merged Upper Canada and Lower Canada into a single province named the Province of Canada. The Act of Union created a new Parliament of the Province of Canada, also composed of a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly. That Parliament had jurisdiction over the entire province, with members from Lower Canada and Upper Canada in both houses.

The Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly known as the British North America Act), created the Dominion of Canada, and also created the provinces of Ontario and Quebec by splitting the old Province of Canada into two, based on the old boundaries of Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The act created a new bicameral Legislature for the province of Quebec, composed of the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec.

In December 1955, the assembly passed a bill according the title &quot;Member of Provincial Parliament&quot; () and the initialism &quot;MPP&quot; () to members of the legislature. Previously, there had been no fixed designation, but they had often been referred to as &quot;Members of the Legislative Assembly&quot; (MLAs) (), which Premier Maurice Duplessis noted in his speech on the bill, &quot;can sometimes be pronounced as &quot;, which means &#x27;evil&#x27; in French.&quot;

In 1961, Marie-Claire Kirkland became the first woman elected to the Legislative Assembly.

In 1968, Bill 90 was passed by the government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand, abolishing the Legislative Council and renaming the Legislative Assembly the &quot;National Assembly&quot;, in line with the more strident nationalism of the Quiet Revolution. Before 1968, there had been various unsuccessful attempts at abolishing the Legislative Council, which was analogous to the Senate of Canada. With the adoption of the new name, members of the assembly were now designated Members of the National Assembly (MNA) in English. In French, they are referred to as either with the initialism M.A.N. or as .

In 1978, television cameras were brought in for the first time to televise parliamentary debates. The colour of the walls was changed to suit the needs of television, and the (green hall) became the (blue hall).

In 1984, Canadian Forces corporal Denis Lortie stormed into the Parliament Building and opened fire, killing three government employees and wounding thirteen others. His intended target was Premier René Lévesque and his Parti Québécois government. However, he was around 15 minutes early and the Assembly floor was still mostly empty; no politicians were shot. He surrendered to police hours later.

==Parliament Building==
Constructed between 1877 and 1886, the Parliament Building features the Second Empire architectural style that was popular for prestigious buildings both in Europe (especially France where the style originated) and the United States during the latter 19th century.

Although somewhat more sober in appearance and lacking a towering central belfry, Quebec City&#x27;s Parliament Building bears a definite likeness to the Philadelphia City Hall, another Second Empire edifice in North America which was built during the same period. Even though the building&#x27;s symmetrical layout with a frontal clock tower in the middle is typical of legislative institutions of British heritage, the architectural style is believed to be unique among parliament buildings found in other Canadian provincial capitals. Its façade presents a pantheon representing significant events and people of the history of Quebec.

In 1936, Maurice Duplessis hung a crucifix in the Legislative Assembly chamber. It hung there for 83 years, until it was removed on 10 July 2019.

Additional buildings were added, adjacent to the Parliament Buildings:
* Édifice André-Laurendeau was added from 1935 to 1937 to house the Ministry of Transport.
* was added from 1922 to 1925 to house the Ministries of the Treasury (Finance), the Attorney General and the Secretary General of the National Assembly.
* Édifice Jean-Antoine-Panet was added from 1931 to 1932 for the Ministry of Agriculture.
* added from 1910 to 1915 for the Library of the National Assembly, various other government offices and for the Executive Council.
== Elections ==
General elections are held every four years or less. Since 2014, the legislature has had a fixed four-year term, with elections taking place no later than &quot;the first Monday of October of the fourth calendar year following the year that includes the last day of the previous Legislature.&quot; However, the lieutenant governor, acting on the advice of the premier, can dissolve the legislature and call an election earlier. Any Canadian citizen at least 18 years old who has been residing in Quebec for at least six months qualifies to be on the electoral list.

Normally, the lieutenant governor invites the leader of the political party with the largest number of elected candidates to form the government as premier ( in French; French does not make a distinction between &quot;premier&quot; and &quot;prime minister&quot;).

Quebec&#x27;s territory is divided into 125 electoral districts (ridings). In each riding, the candidate who receives the most votes is elected and becomes a member of the National Assembly (MNA). This is the first-past-the-post voting system. It tends to produce strong disparities in the number of seats won compared to the popular vote, perhaps best exemplified by the 1966 (wrong-winner result), 1970 (false-majority result), 1973, and 1998 election (wrong-winner and false-majority result).

Quebec elections have also tended to be volatile since the 1970s, producing a large turnover in seats. Consequently, existing political parties often lose more than half their seats with the rise of new or opposition political parties. For instance, the 1970 and 1973 elections saw the demise of the Union Nationale and rise of the Parti Québécois, which took power in 1976. The 1985 and 1994 elections saw the Liberals gain and lose power in landslide elections. The 2018 elections saw the rise of the Coalition Avenir Québec, which took power for the first time.

== Proceedings ==
One of the members of the National Assembly is elected as President of the Assembly (a post called &quot;speaker&quot; in most other Westminster System assemblies). Any member of the assembly is eligible to stand for election, other than party leaders and Cabinet ministers. The election is the first order of business for a newly elected assembly. It is conducted by secret ballot of all members, with successive rounds of voting if needed before one candidate gains a majority of the votes.

The president of the assembly is the arbiter of the parliamentary debates between the members of the government and the members of the Opposition. In order for a member to address the assembly, the member speak through the president. The president is usually a member of the governing party.

The proceedings of the National Assembly are broadcast across Quebec on the cable television network Canal de l&#x27;Assemblée nationale.

<doc id="396398" wikidata="Q917980" url="?curid=396398" title="Witch Hunter Robin">
<text>Witch Hunter Robin (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime series created by Sunrise and animation director Shūkō Murase. The series originally aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between July and December 2002. The series was licensed for North American distribution by Bandai Entertainment.

The series follows a fictional Japanese branch of a secret global organization called &quot;SOLOMON&quot; or the &quot;Solomon Toukatsu Nin&#x27;idantai&quot; (roughly &quot;Solomon Executive Organization&quot;), abbreviated as &quot;STN&quot; or &quot;STN-J&quot;. Solomon fights the harmful use of witchcraft using a database of witches, which includes those who have obtained the power of witchcraft through genetics and others who carry the gene (called &quot;seeds&quot;) in order to arrest or eliminate them should their powers &quot;awaken&quot;. The series focuses on one STN-J member, Robin Sena.

==Plot==

Robin Sena is a &quot;craft user&quot;, born in Japan and raised by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy. She is trained to use her craft of fire to hunt down witches. Witchcraft is a genetic trait, dormant within a number of individuals within the human population. Powers can be &quot;awakened&quot; in these dormant human &quot;seeds&quot; at any time, which seems to also drive the awakened witch into various forms of homicidal madness or sociopathy. Trained hunters, craft-users or &quot;seeds&quot; themselves that have not become full witches, are needed to keep watch over &quot;seeds&quot; and hunt those whose abilities become active, serving in secret organizations, such as the parent branch &quot;Solomon&quot; and the &quot;STN-J&quot; branch in Japan, as self-appointed witch police to curtail the use of witchcraft in society, and to keep the witch kind a secret from the public. Even the police, who cooperate with STN-J in abnormal criminal cases, do not know what STN-J does. The series begins when Robin arrives in Japan from Italy to gain information for Solomon headquarters about a fabled item that holds the &quot;secrets of the craft,&quot; while acting undercover as a new hunter to the STN-J in their efforts to stop and capture witches.

&quot;Orbo&quot; is a green liquid that negates witch abilities. STN-J&#x27;s hunters carry small vials of it on necklaces in the shape of a cross as a form of protection against their targets&#x27; craft. Hunters also carry air pistols which fire darts or pellets of Orbo that dampen witch powers when it enters the bloodstream of the target witch. Hunters who are craft-users or seeds can use Orbo without ill effects, although their own powers are reportedly diminished while using it. Robin, a craft-user herself, declines to use Orbo because she feels it is &quot;disgusting&quot;. As the series goes on, Robin grows increasingly uncomfortable with her role in hunting and capturing other witches. She begins to question the treatment they receive while incarcerated in the mysterious &quot;Factory&quot;. After the discovery of &quot;secrets of the craft,&quot; she is entrapped and attacked twice by &quot;witch bullets&quot;. Subsequently, the STN-J is attacked, presumably for &quot;secrets of the craft,&quot; although the Solomon attack was carried out to find what Zaizen, the director of the STN-J, was planning.

Robin begins to worry that she will become a target and grows to suspect that her partner Amon will hunt her. Eventually, Robin does become a target of Solomon and labeled a witch, becoming &quot;hunted&quot;. In the end, Robin finds out more about her craft and that of witches than she knew at the beginning. Initially, the series appears to take a &quot;monster of the week&quot; approach. About halfway through the 26-episode season, the characters and the relationships between them are established and the main plot gets underway.

==Media==
===Anime===

The TV series was produced by Sunrise and Bandai Visual and directed by Shūkō Murase, with Aya Yoshinaga serving the role of chief writer, Kumiko Takahashi designing the characters and Taku Iwasaki composing the music. The series originally aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between July 2 and December 24, 2002.

The series was licensed for North American distribution by Bandai Entertainment. In October 2003, it debuted at the 3rd Annual Metreon Festival of Anime in San Francisco, followed by a Q&amp;A and autograph session from Kari Wahlgren, who provided the voice for the title character. It was later aired across the United States on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim late-night programming block beginning February 16, 2004 (it was given a second full run on Adult Swim in the Fall of 2004 before the broadcast rights were left to expire). It has also been aired across Canada on YTV&#x27;s Bionix block from September 10, 2004. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, Sunrise announced at their at Otakon 2013, that Funimation has rescued the series, along with a handful of other former Bandai Entertainment titles. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the series was broadcast in a daily stripped timeslot on AnimeCentral from January 5 to January 30, 2008, with an immediate rerun from January 31.

====Soundtrack====
The music of &quot;Witch Hunter Robin&quot; was composed by Taku Iwasaki. Both the opening and ending themes were performed by Bana (aka Chino Takayanagi). Two soundtrack CDs have been released by Victor Entertainment. The first &quot;Witch Hunter Robin Original Sound Score I&quot; was released on September 21, 2002. It contains twenty-three tracks, including TV edits of the opening and ending themes. The second soundtrack &quot;Witch Hunter Robin Original Sound Score II&quot; was released on November 21, 2002. It also contained twenty-three tracks with a guitar version of the opening theme. A shortened version of this guitar-only theme was used as the ending theme for Episode 15 &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;. A single containing the opening and ending themes and karaoke versions was released on August 21, 2002.

===Live-action series===
On April 5, 2004, the SciFi Channel released a press release stating a listing of new series and films in development for the future, one of which was a live action version of &quot;Witch Hunter Robin&quot; produced by Roy Lee and Doug Davison, who were credited as the producers for the movie &quot;The Ring&quot;. No premiere date was given. It was later revealed that the live action version developed by Sci-Fi had been dropped from production.

==Reception==
The series has received many comments from staff of &quot;Anime News Network&quot;. Bamboo Dong, a columnist from the website, has stated that she cannot make enough positive comments about the series and that it is &quot;a show that everyone must absolutely see&quot;. She also comments that the ending &quot;is a wonderful way to cap off the series&quot; and that it retained the series&#x27; solid sense of action. However, she comments that the ending moved a little too fast and spent much of its time with plot revelations, missing its chance to give the series &quot;that extra kick&quot;. Carlo Santos praised the series, saying that it was a unique tale that was gorgeous and engrossing to watch and one of 2004&#x27;s best adventure anime. Ryan Matthews has praised the cast choices in his column, saying that the cast is well-suited to their roles, but the performances were flat. He also notes that the ADR script was filled with clumsy wording and mid-sentence stops. He comments that it seems that the script was written without trying to match the animation. In his review, Zac Bertschy from &quot;Anime News Network&quot; says that the series is highly original and very well executed. Bertschy praises the sound track. He notes that the character designs fit well with series&#x27; visual style and the characters&#x27; expressions were convincing. And concluded his review with &quot;In short, &quot;Witch Hunter Robin&quot; is this fall&#x27;s anime bright spot (despite being almost entirely black and gray). This is a mature, evenly paced supernatural thriller, chock full of mystery, intrigue, and a few exciting battles for good measure. One of the best anime series of all time and certainly the best one this year&quot;.

Jason Bustard from &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; comments that the supernatural and spooky undercurrent in the setting would fit perfectly into &quot;The X-Files&quot; or &quot;Millennium&quot; television series. The characters are received as a &quot;mixed bunch&quot;. The main cast is said to have &quot;distinct and fully rendered personalities&quot;, all of which are well-done. In contrast to the review from &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, Bustard believed that the story moved at a brisk pace. Although he agreed that action fans would find the series dull and added that comedy and romance fans would not enjoy the series either. Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot; commented that it was difficult to decide whom to &quot;root for&quot; as the witches seemed to be insane killers, but the protagonists were &quot;killers of a colder, more controlled stripe&quot; and were generally unpleasant, with the exceptions of Karasuma and Zaizen. She also noted that the characters give no indication as to why they work for the STN. Robin and Amon&#x27;s character designs are said to be strange. The series&#x27; setting was said to be &quot;a fairly severe, almost oppressive gothic design&quot; and that the color palette and the plot&#x27;s focus on the occult contributed to the dark feel. The pace steeply picks up once the protagonists head into battle. It is also noted that the series&#x27; could have afforded to reveal more information earlier in the series instead of teasing the audience with mysteries; just like many other reviewers, she comments that the mysteries were worth the wait.

&quot;Witch Hunter Robin&quot; placed second on a list of top anime properties for 2004&#x27;s first quarter and placed sixth for the third quarter.

<text>Rabwah (; Punjabi / ; ; ), officially known as Chenab Nagar (; ), is a city in Chiniot District, Punjab, Pakistan on the bank of Chenab River.

It was the headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community from September 20, 1948 when the community relocated from Qadian, India to the newly created state of Pakistan, where the community bought the area of present-day Rabwah from the government to establish its home. This continued until 1984 and the establishment of Ordinance XX. In 1984, the headquarters were moved to the United Kingdom with Mirza Tahir Ahmed, first to London and then in 2019 to the Islamabad compound in Tilford, Surrey.

== Etymology ==
Rabwah is an Arabic word meaning an &quot;elevated place&quot;. The formal inauguration of the settlement took place on 20 September 1948 after prayers and a sacrifice of five goats at the corners and centre of the area. The town was named Rabwah by then leader of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad. However, the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab passed a resolution on 17 November 1998 changing the name of Rabwah to ‘Nawan Qadian’. On 14 February 1999, a new directive was issued, renaming Nawan Qadian to Chenab Nagar. The other names considered were Chak Dhaggian, Mustafa Abad, and Siddiq Abad. 

==History==
=== Medieval History ===
From a historical perspective, Rabwah is from where Muhammad Bin Qasim, after conquering Sindh and Multan, crossed the Chenab River and moved towards Kashmir. Here the Arabs fought against the Hindu Raja of Chandrod (which is probably the ancient name of Chiniot). More than 100 Arab soldiers lost their lives in the battle and a &quot;Graveyard of Martyrs&quot; exists to this day in Chiniot.

=== Modern Era ===
Before the establishment of Rabwah, the area was barren and was known as Chak Digiyaan. The land was bought by the Ahmadiyya community following the migration of most of its members from Qadian and other parts of Indian Punjab, to the newly created nation of Pakistan. In June 1948, 1,034 acres of land were bought from the government for PKR 12,000. 

The place where Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad led the first ever prayers became the first mosque of Rabwah, the Yadgaar (memorial) Mosque. The first settlements were in camps which were later replaced by buildings constructed of mud. The first ever building constructed using concrete was the Mahmood Mosque. Electricity was provisioned to the city in 1954.

Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad relocated to Rabwah on 19th of Sept 1949. By that time the population had reached 1,000. The first ever Jalsa Salana in Rabwah took place from 15 to 17 April 1949, attended by 17,000 people.

== Demography ==
The city has a population of 70,000, of which 97 percent belong to the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. The rest 3 percent includes Christians and other Muslims. As the city has seen many migrations of Ahmadis fleeing persecution, it has a very diverse ethnic mixture. 

=== Languages ===
The mother tongue of the majority of the populace is Punjabi, while for a small minority it is Urdu. Most of the students are also fluent in English.

==Life for the residents of Rabwah==

As the city is the only Ahmadi majority city in Pakistan, its residents face legal discrimination due to Ordinance XX. They have been denied the right to hold peaceful religious gatherings since 1983. In 1989, a report was registered by Punjab police against the whole of the population of the city for the crime that they were displaying Quranic texts on their graves and buildings.

==Geography==

Rabwah covers an area of about 24 km2 (9.3 sq mi). It is located in the temperate region of Central Punjab, approximately halfway between Faisalabad and Sargodha. The River Chenab surrounds the city on its Eastern and Southern sides. The area is higher than the surrounding plains due to the dry hills which dot the landscape, providing a natural barrier against floods. These hills are part of the Kirana Hills, also known locally as the Black Mountains, which reach from Sargodha to Jhang. The area, which used to be arid and barren, has been transformed through more than fifty years of aggressive plantation into a lush green city.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification Rabwah experiences a borderline hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;)/hot arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;). The city shares typical weather patterns of the northwestern Subcontinent: sweltering summers and pleasant to warm winters. The summer season is from April to October where May, the hottest month, sees temperatures regularly reach . The location in the centre of the dry plains is responsible for dust storms in the summer. Summer also brings the Indian Monsoon which increases the precipitation in the month of June and July to above . The winter season is from November to February where January is the coldest month and temperatures may fall to the freezing point. The winters also bring fog which can reduce the visibility to dangerously low levels.
===Neighborhoods===
The planned city was originally divided into following neighbourhoods:
* Darus-Sadr or Dar al-Sadr (The Main/Central Area)
* Darur-Rahmat or Dar al-Rahmat (The Abode of Mercy)

<doc id="396400" wikidata="Q7888102" url="?curid=396400" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with the song &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, written by Martin Isherwood, and performed by the duo Jemini. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, &quot;A Song for Europe 2003&quot;. Eight acts competed in the national final which consisted of a semi-final and a final, during which the winner was selected entirely through a regional televote.

In the final of the Eurovision Song Contest, the United Kingdom performed in position 15 and placed twenty-sixth (last) out of the 26 participating countries, failing to score any points. This was the first time that the British entry had placed last in the history of the competition and also the first time it received &quot;nul points&quot;.

==Background==

Prior to the 2003 contest, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom forty-five times. Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; performed by Sandie Shaw, in with the song &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; performed by Lulu, in with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; performed by Brotherhood of Man, in with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; performed by Bucks Fizz, and in with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , it had only twice finished outside the top 10, and . Since 1999, the year in which the rule was abandoned that songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, it has had less success, thus far only finishing within the top ten once: with the song &quot;Come Back&quot; performed by Jessica Garlick.

As part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster announced that it would participate in the 2003 contest on 3 September 2002. BBC has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for Eurovision. The broadcaster announced that it would held a national final involving a public vote to select its 2003 entry.

== Before Eurovision ==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 2003&quot; ===

&quot;A Song for Europe 2003&quot; was the national final developed by the BBC in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003. Eight acts competed in the competition which consisted of a radio semi-final on 31 January 2003 and a televised final on 2 March 2003. The semi-final was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, while the final was broadcast on BBC One.

==== Competing entries ====
On 3 September 2002, BBC together with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) announced an open submission for interested songwriters to submit their songs. The BBC stated that they would seek out songs &quot;that work instantly rather than be a slow burner&quot; and &quot;that is not typically a Eurovision song&quot;. A fee was also imposed on songs being submitted to the national final: £40 for BASCA members, £60 for non-BASCA members and £10 for songwriters under the age of 17. The submission period lasted until 18 October 2002. The 700 received submissions were reviewed and a shortlist was presented to a professional panel consisting of representatives of BASCA and the BBC as well as music industry experts that ultimately selected eight semi-finalists to compete in the national final. The eight competing songs were premiered during &quot;The Ken Bruce Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2 between 27 and 30 February 2003.

==== Shows ====
====Semi-final====
Eight acts competed in the radio semi-final which was hosted by Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce during &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; on 31 January 2003. A public vote consisting of televoting and online voting, which registered over 30,000 votes, selected the top four songs that proceeded to the final.
====Final====
Four acts competed in the televised final on 2 March 2003 which was held at the BBC Television Centre in London and hosted by Terry Wogan. Before the final, Tricity was renamed as Jemini, while the song &quot;Wait for the Moment&quot; was rewritten and retitled as &quot;Now and Forever&quot; with its performer being changed from Esther Hart, who withdrew in favour of competing in the Dutch national final (where she eventually won), to Simon Chapman. The group United Colours of Sound was originally announced as Hart&#x27;s replacement before they also withdrew and were replaced in turn by Chapman.

A regional televote selected the winner, &quot;Cry Baby&quot; performed by Jemini. The respective spokespersons for the results in Southern England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Midlands, Northern England and Scotland were: Esther Rantzen, Jessica Garlick, Joe Mace, Mel and Sue, Matt Baker, and Nicholas Parsons. The televote in the final registered over 100,000 votes, with Emily Reed reported to have received the most overall votes. 

=====12 points=====
==At Eurovision==

The Eurovision Song Contest 2003 took place at the Skonto Hall in Riga, Latvia, on 24 May 2003. According to Eurovision rules, the participant list for the contest was composed of: the host country, the &quot;Big Four&quot; (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom), the fifteen highest-scoring participating countries in the previous year&#x27;s contest and any non-participating countries in the previous year&#x27;s contest, up to the maximum 26 participants in total. As a member of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the contest. On 29 November 2002, an allocation draw was held which determined the running order and the United Kingdom was set to perform in position 15, following the entry from the and before the entry from . The United Kingdom finished in twenty-sixth (last) place and failed to score any points. This was the first time the United Kingdom finished in last place and also the first time the nation received &quot;nul points&quot;.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s last-place finish was greeted with much consternation in the British media. Terry Wogan, who commentated the contest on BBC One, said that &quot;the UK is suffering from post-Iraq backlash&quot;. Jemini attributed their failure at the contest to technical problems. Member Chris Cromby said: &quot;The monitors were off. Maybe it was sabotage, but we couldn&#x27;t hear anything... we used the floor monitors, the others used their own.&quot;

In addition to BBC One, BBC Radio 2 also broadcast the contest with commentary by Ken Bruce. The BBC appointed Lorraine Kelly as its spokesperson to announce the results of the British televote during the show.

<doc id="396412" wikidata="Q1127246" url="?curid=396412" title="Changeling">
<text>A changeling, also historically referred to as an auf or oaf, is a human-like creature found throughout much of European folklore. According to folklore, a changeling was a substitute left by a supernatural being when kidnapping a human being. Sometimes the changeling was a &#x27;stock&#x27; (a piece of wood made magically to resemble the kidnapped human), more often the changeling was a supernatural being made magically to look like the kidnapped human. 
Supernatural beings blamed for stealing children included fairies, demons, trolls, nereids and many others. Usually, the kidnapped human was a child; but there were cases, particularly in Scandinavia and Ireland, where adults were taken. 
==Description==
A changeling is typically identifiable via several traits, which vary from culture to culture.
In Irish legend, a fairy child may appear sickly and will not grow in size like a normal child, and may have notable physical characteristics such as a beard or long teeth. They may also display intelligence far beyond their apparent years and possess uncanny insight. A common way that a changeling could identify itself is through displaying unusual behaviour when it thinks it is alone, such as jumping about, dancing or playing an instrument – though this last example is found only within Irish and Scottish legend.

&quot;A human child might be taken due to many factors: to act as a servant, the love of a human child, or malice. Most often, it was thought that fairies exchanged the children. In rare cases, the very elderly of the fairy people would be exchanged in the place of a human baby so that the old fairy could live in comfort, coddled by its human parents. Simple charms such as an inverted coat or open iron scissors left where the child sleeps were thought to ward them off; other measures included a constant watch over the child.&quot;

Folklorist D. L. Ashliman proposes in his essay &#x27;Changelings&#x27; that changeling tales illustrate an aspect of family survival in pre-industrial Europe. A peasant family&#x27;s subsistence frequently depended upon the productive labour of each member, and it was difficult to provide for a person who was a permanent drain on the family&#x27;s scarce resources. &quot;The fact that the changelings&#x27; ravenous appetite is so frequently mentioned indicates that the parents of these unfortunate children saw in their continuing existence a threat to the sustenance of the entire family. Changeling tales support other historical evidence in suggesting that infanticide was frequently the solution selected.&quot;

Fairies would also take adult humans, especially the newly married and new mothers; young adults were taken to marry fairies instead, while new mothers were often taken to nurse fairy babies. Often when an adult was taken instead of a child, an object such as a log was left in place of the stolen human, enchanted to look like the person. This object in place of the human would seem to sicken and die, to be buried by the human family, while the living human was among the fairies. Bridget Cleary is one of the most well-known cases of an adult thought to be a changeling by her family; her husband killed her, attempting to force the fairies to return his &#x27;real&#x27; wife.

==Function==
In medieval Scandinavia, it was believed that trolls considered it more respectable to be raised by humans than by their kind and would consequently seize the opportunity to give their children a human upbringing. Some believed that trolls would only take unbaptised children, since once a child had been baptized – and therefore received into the Catholic faith – the trolls were powerless to abduct it.

Beauty in human children and young women, particularly traits that evoke brightness or reflectivity, such as blonde hair and blue or silver eyes, are said to attract fairies, as they perhaps find preciousness in these traits.

In Scottish folklore, the children might be replacements for fairy children in the tithe to Hell; this is best known from the ballad of &quot;Tam Lin&quot;.
According to common Scottish myths, a child born with a caul (part of the amniotic membrane) across their face is a changeling and will soon die (is &quot;of fey birth&quot;).

Other folklore says that human milk is necessary for fairy children to survive. In these cases, either the newborn human child would be switched with a fairy baby to be suckled by the human mother, or the human mother would be taken back to the fairy world to breastfeed the fairy babies. Human midwives were also thought to be necessary to bring fairy babies into the world.

Some stories tell of changelings who forget they are not human and proceed to live a human life. However, in some stories, changelings who do not forget return to their fairy family, possibly leaving the human family without warning. The human child that was taken may often stay with the fairy family forever. Feeling connected to a changeling&#x27;s fate, some families merely turn their changeling loose to the wilderness.

Some folklorists believe that fairies were memories of inhabitants of various European regions who had been driven into hiding by invaders. They held that changelings had occurred; the hiding people would exchange their sickly children for the healthy children of the occupying invader.

==In folklore==

===Cornwall===
The Mên-an-Tol stones in Cornwall are said to have a fairy or pixie guardian who can make miraculous cures. In one case, a changeling baby was passed through the stone for the mother to have her real child returned to her. Evil pixies had changed her child, and the stones could reverse their spell.
===Germany===
In Germany, the changeling is known as &quot;Wechselbalg&quot;, &quot;Wechselkind&quot;, &quot;Kielkopf&quot; or &quot;Dickkopf&quot; (the last hinting at the huge necks and heads of changelings).

Several methods are known in Germany to identify a changeling and to return the replaced real child:
* confusing the changeling by cooking or brewing in eggshells. This will force the changeling to speak, claiming its age and revealing its position beyond synchronicity.
* attempting to heat the changeling in the oven – perhaps a lie by capacity to endure present.
* hitting or whipping the changeling
* The changeling must sometimes be fed with a woman&#x27;s milk before replacing the children.

In German folklore, several possible parents are known for changelings. Those are:
* the devil, a belief shared by Martin Luther who advocated for baptism of changelings.
* a female dwarf
* a water spirit
* a &quot;Roggenmuhme&quot;/&quot;Roggenmutter&quot; (&quot;Rye Aunt&quot;/&quot;Rye Mother&quot;, a demonic woman living in cornfields and stealing human children)

===Ireland===

In Ireland, looking at a baby with envy – &quot;over looking the baby&quot; – was dangerous, as it endangered the baby, who was then in the fairies&#x27; power. So too was admiring or envying a woman or man dangerous, unless the person added a blessing; the able-bodied and beautiful were in particular danger. Women were especially in danger in liminal states: being a new bride or mother.

Putting a changeling in a fire would cause it to jump up the chimney and return the human child. Still, at least one tale recounts a mother with a changeling finding that a fairy woman came to her home with the human child, saying the other fairies had done the exchange, and she wanted her own baby. The tale of surprising a changeling into speech – by brewing eggshells – is also told in Ireland, as in Wales. Various legends describe other ways to foil a would-be fairy kidnapper. One was to shout &quot;&quot;Gairim agus coisricim thú&quot; &quot; (I bless you) or &quot;God bless you,&quot; which would cause the fairy to abandon the child it was trying to steal. Another possible tactic was to insert oneself into an argument over who would keep the child; shouting &quot;Give it to me&quot; would trick the fairy into releasing the child back to a human.

In some instances, changelings were regarded not as substituted fairy children but as old fairies brought to the human world to die.

Irish legends regarding changelings typically follow the same formula: a tailor is the one who first notices a changeling, the inclusion of a fairy playing bagpipes or some other instrument, and the kidnapping of a human child through a window.

The modern Irish girl&#x27;s name, Síofra, means an elvish or changeling child, deriving from Síobhra(í), meaning fairy(/fairies). The Aos sí, &quot;siabhra&quot; (commonly anglicised as &quot;sheevra&quot;), may be prone to evil and mischief. However, the Ulster folk song &#x27;The Gartan Mother&#x27;s Lullaby&#x27; also uses &quot;sheevra&quot; simply to mean &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;fairy&quot;.

===The Isle of Man===
The Isle of Man had a wide collection of myths and superstitions concerning fairies, and numerous folk tales have been collected concerning supposed changelings. Sophia Morrison, in her &quot;Manx Fairy Tales&quot; (David Nutt, London, 1911), includes the tale of &quot;The Fairy Child of Close ny Lheiy&quot;, a story of a child supposedly swapped by the fairies for a loud and unruly fairy child. The English poet and topographer George Waldron, who lived in the Isle of Man during the early 18th century, cites a tale of a reputed changeling that was shown to him, possibly a child with an inherited genetic disorder:

&quot;Nothing under heaven could have a more beautiful face; but though between five and six years old, and seemingly healthy, he was so far from being able to walk, or stand, that he could not so much as move any one joint; his limbs were vastly long for his age, but smaller than an infant&#x27;s of six months; his complexion was perfectly delicate, and he had the finest hair in the world; he never spoke, nor cried, ate scarcely anything, and was very seldom seen to smile, but if any one called him a fairy-elf, he would frown and fix his eyes so earnestly on those who said it, as if he would look them through. His mother, or at least his supposed mother, being very poor, frequently went out a-charing, and left him a whole day together. The neighbours, out of curiosity, have often looked in at the window to see how he behaved when alone, which, whenever they did, they were sure to find him laughing and in the utmost delight. This made them judge that he was not without company more pleasing to him than any mortal&#x27;s could be; and what made this conjecture seem the more reasonable was, that if he were left ever so dirty, the woman at her return saw him with a clean face, and his hair combed with the utmost exactness and nicety.&quot;

===Lowland Scotland and Northern England===
In the Anglo-Scottish border region it was believed that elves (or fairies) lived in &quot;elf hills&quot; (or &quot;fairy hills&quot;). Along with this belief in supernatural beings was the view that they could spirit away children, and even adults, and take them back to their world (see Elfhame). Often, it was thought a baby would be snatched and replaced with a simulation of the baby, usually a male adult elf, to be suckled by the mother. The real baby would be treated well by the elves and would grow up to be one of them, whereas the changeling baby would be discontented and wearisome. Many herbs, salves, and seeds could be used for discovering the fairy-folk and ward off their designs. It was also believed that to force a changeling to reveal itself, it must either be surprised into speech or made to laugh.

In one tale, a mother suspected her baby had been taken and replaced with a changeling. This view was proven to be correct one day when a neighbour ran into the house shouting, &quot;Come here and ye&#x27;ll se a sight! Yonder&#x27;s the Fairy Hill a&#x27; alowe&quot; (i.e., &quot;the Fairy Hill is on fire&quot;). To this, the elf got up, saying &quot;Waes me! What&#x27;ll come o&#x27; me wife and bairns?&quot; and made his way out of the chimney.

At Byerholm near Newcastleton in Liddesdale sometime during the early 19th century, a dwarf called Robert Elliot or &quot;Little Hobbie o&#x27; The Castleton&quot; as he was known, was reputed to be a changeling. When taunted by other boys, he would not hesitate to draw his gully (a large knife) and dispatch them; however, being woefully short in the legs, they usually out-ran him and escaped. However, he was courageous, and when he heard that his neighbour, the six-foot three-inch () William Scott of Kirndean, a sturdy and strong borderer, had slandered his name, he invited the man to his house, took him up the stairs and challenged him to a duel. Scott beat a hasty retreat.

Child ballad 40, &quot;The Queen of Elfland&#x27;s Nourice&quot;, depicts the abduction of a new mother, drawing on the folklore of the changelings. Although incomplete, it contains the mother&#x27;s grief and the Queen of Elfland&#x27;s promise to return her to her child if she would nurse the queen&#x27;s child until it can walk.

=== Poland ===
The Mamuna or Boginka is a Slavic spirit that exchanges babies (making them into odmieńce) in the cradle. The changelings left by the Mamuna were said to have a noticeably different appearance; an abnormally large abdomen, unusually small or large head, a hump, thin arms and legs, a hairy body, and long claws. Mamuna changelings would also get their first set of teeth prematurely compared to a human baby.

To protect a child from being kidnapped by the Mamuna, the mother would tie a red ribbon around the baby&#x27;s wrist, put a red hat on its head, and keep it out of the moonlight. Other preventative methods included not washing diapers after sunset and never turning their head away from the baby as it slept. Still, even if the Mamuna took a child, there was a way to force her to return it. The mother would take the changeling child to a midden, whip it with a birch stick, and pour water from an eggshell over it, all while shouting, &quot;Take yours; give mine back.&quot; Typically, the Mamuna would feel sorry for their child and return the human baby to its mother.

===Scandinavia===
In Nordic traditional belief, it was generally believed that trolls or beings from the subterranean realms exchanged children. 
Since most of the supernatural beings of Scandinavian folklore are said to be afraid of iron, Scandinavian parents would often place an iron tool such as a pair of scissors or a knife on top of the cradle of an un-baptised infant to prevent its abduction by the trolls. It was believed that if a human child were still taken, despite such measures, the parents could force the child&#x27;s return by treating the changeling cruelly, using methods such as whipping or even inserting it in a heated oven. In at least one case, a woman was taken to court for killing her child in an oven. In Sweden, it was believed that a fire must be kept lit in the room housing a child before it is christened and that the water used to bathe the child should not be thrown out, since both of these precautions will prevent the child from being taken by trolls.
In one Swedish tale, the human mother is advised to brutalize the changeling (&quot;bortbyting&quot;) so the trolls will return her son. Still, she refuses, unable to mistreat an innocent child despite knowing its nature. When her husband demands she abandon the changeling, she refuses, and he leaves her – whereupon he meets their son in the forest, wandering free. The son explains that since his mother had never been cruel to the changeling, so the troll mother had never been cruel to him, and when she sacrificed what was dearest to her, her husband, they had realized they had no power over her and released him.

The tale is notably retold by Swedish children&#x27;s story author Helena Nyblom as &quot;Bortbytingarna&quot; in the 1913 book &quot;Bland tomtar och troll&quot;. (which is depicted by the image), a princess is kidnapped by trolls and replaced with their offspring against the wishes of the troll mother. The changelings grow up with their new parents, but both find it hard to adapt: the human girl is disgusted by her future bridegroom, a troll prince, whereas the troll girl is bored by her life and her dull human prospective groom. Upset with the conditions of their lives, they both go astray in the forest, passing each other without noticing it. The princess comes to the castle, whereupon the queen immediately recognizes her, and the troll girl finds a troll woman cursing loudly as she works. The troll girl bursts out that the troll woman is much more fun than any other person she has ever seen, and her mother happily sees that her true daughter has returned. The human girl and the troll girl marry happily on the same day.

===Spain===
In Asturias (Northern Spain), there is a legend about the Xana, a sort of nymph who used to live near rivers, fountains, and lakes, sometimes helping travellers on their journeys. The Xanas were conceived as little female fairies with supernatural beauty. They could deliver &quot;xaninos&quot; babies that were sometimes swapped with human babies – some legends claim this was for them to be baptized, while others claim that it is because the Xana cannot produce milk. The legend says that to distinguish a &quot;xanino&quot; from a human baby, some pots and egg shells should be put close to the fireplace; a xanino would say: &quot;I was born one hundred years ago, and since then I have not seen so many egg shells near the fire!&quot;.

===Wales===
In Wales, the changeling child (&quot;plentyn cael&quot; (sing.), &quot;plant cael&quot; (pl.)) initially resembles the human child for which it has been substituted, but gradually grows uglier in appearance and behaviour: ill-featured, malformed, ill-tempered, given to screaming and biting. It may be of less than usual intelligence but may equally well be identifiable because of its more-than-childlike wisdom and cunning.

The common means employed to identify a changeling is to cook a family meal in an eggshell. The child will exclaim, &quot;I have seen the acorn before the oak, but I never saw the likes of this,&quot; and vanish, only to be replaced by the original human child. Alternatively, or following this identification, it is supposedly necessary to mistreat the child by placing it in a hot oven, holding it in a shovel over a hot fire, or bathing it in a solution of foxglove.

=== The United States ===
There are some rare instances of changeling beliefs being brought across the Atlantic by European settlers. The best attested case is from Iowa, 1876, where a Miss Kittie Crowe was taken by the fairies.

==In the historical record==
King Charles I of England (1600–1649) was reportedly rumored to have been a changeling due to his &quot;peevish nature&quot; as a child and a nursemaid&#x27;s claim that a figure appeared mysteriously at his bedside and cast a cloak over the sleeping baby&#x27;s cradle.

Children identified as changelings by the superstitious were often abused or murdered, sometimes in the belief that changelings could be forced to admit their true nature by beatings, exposure to fire or water, or other trials.

Two 19th-century cases reflect the belief in changelings. In 1826, Anne Roche bathed Michael Leahy, a four-year-old boy unable to speak or stand, three times in the Flesk; he drowned the third time. She swore she was merely attempting to drive the fairy out of him. The jury acquitted her of murder. In 1895, Bridget Cleary was killed by several people, including her husband and cousins, after a short bout of illness (probably pneumonia). Local storyteller, Jack Dunne accused Bridget of being a fairy changeling. It is debatable whether her husband, Michael, actually believed her to be a fairy; many believe that he concocted a &quot;fairy defense&quot; after murdering his wife in a fit of rage. The killers were convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, as even after the death, they claimed to be convinced they had killed a changeling, not Bridget Cleary herself.

==Outside Europe==

===Africa===
The Igbo people of eastern Nigeria traditionally believed that a woman who lost numerous children, whether stillborn or early in infancy, was being tormented by an &quot;ogbanje&quot;, a malicious spirit that reincarnated itself over and over again. One of the most commonly prescribed methods for ridding oneself of an &quot;ogbanje&quot; was to find and destroy its &quot;iyi-uwa&quot;, a buried object tying it to the mortal world.

Many scholars now believe that &quot;ogbanje&quot; stories arose as an attempt to explain the loss of children with sickle-cell anemia. Even today, infant death is common among children born with severe sickle-cell anemia, especially in areas of Africa lacking adequate medical resources.

The similarity between the European changeling and the Igbo &quot;ogbanje&quot; is so marked that Igbos themselves often translate the word into English as &quot;changeling&quot;. The &quot;abiku&quot; was a rough analogue of the &quot;ogbanje&quot; among the related Yoruba peoples to the west of Igboland.

==In the modern world==
The word oaf, a clumsy or stupid person, is derived from the historic English word for a changeling, &quot;auf&quot;. This, in turn, is believed to have originated from the Middle English &quot;alven&quot; and &quot;elven&quot;, and ultimately from the Old Norse word for an elf, &quot;alfr&quot;.

===Medical explanations===
Modern scholars hypothesize some changeling tales developed in an attempt to explain deformed, developmentally disabled, or neurodivergent children. Scholars Goodey and Stainton have rejected a simple mapping of the modern understanding of disability onto the changeling folklore, suggesting that the word itself is too contextual and variable, and that modern sensibilities and contemporary feelings of guilt and aversion are coming into play. 

Among the diseases or disabilities with symptoms that match the description of changelings in various legends are spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, PKU, progeria, Down syndrome, homocystinuria, Williams syndrome, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, Prader-Willi Syndrome, and cerebral palsy. The greater incidence of congenital disabilities in boys correlates to the belief that male infants were more likely to be taken by fairies. Psychologist Stuart Vyse writes that modern parents have higher expectations of childbirth, and when &quot;children don&#x27;t meet these expectations, parents sometimes find a different demon to blame.&quot; A condition known as regressive autism, where children appear to follow normal development in their early years and then start to show symptoms of autism, can also be compared to marks of a changeling child.

Some autistic adults have come to identify with changelings (or other replacements, such as aliens) due to their experiences of feeling out of place in the world.

===In nature===
Several species of birds, fish, and arthropods regularly practice brood parasitism, or non-reciprocal offspring-swapping. Rather than raising their young alone, they will lay their egg in another&#x27;s nest, leaving the burden of raising their young on the unsuspecting parents of another species altogether. More often than not, the invading species hatches sooner than its &quot;stepsiblings&quot; and grows faster, eventually hogging most nourishment brought in, and may actually &quot;evict&quot; the young of the host species by pushing them out of their own nest.

<text>&quot;Above-the-line&quot; refers to the list of individuals who guide and influence the creative direction, process, and voice of a given narrative in a film and related expenditures. These roles include but are not limited to the screenwriter, producer, director, and principal cast.

Often, the term is used for matters related to the film&#x27;s production budget. Above-the-line expenditures reflect the expected line item compensation for an official above-the-line member&#x27;s role in a given film project. These expenditures are usually set, negotiated, spent and/or promised before principal photography begins. They include rights to secure the material on which the screenplay is based, production rights to the screenplay, compensation for the screenwriter, producer, director, principal actors and other cost-related line items such as assistants for the producers, director or actors.

The distinction originates from the early studio days when the budget top-sheet would literally have a line separating the &quot;above-the-line&quot; and &quot;below-the-line&quot; costs.

<text>Quaternary geology is the branch of geology that study developments from 2.58 million years ago to the present. In particular, Quaternary geology study the process and deposits that developed during the Quaternary, a period characterized by glacial-interglacial cycles. Quaternary geology has developed over time from being originally a branch of historical geology to becoming a science on its own.

==Quaternary geochronology==
Quaternary geological investigations that require the dating of rocks or sediments require a complementary array of methods to determine that age. Although radiometric dating has rapidly gained importance for Quaternary dating, there has historically been a reliance on chemical and biological traces, geomorphic, and relative dating (also known as correlative dating). Since Quaternary geology involves studying changes on the Earth&#x27;s surface up to the present, Quaternary geologists benefit from the preservation of time-dependent chemical or biological processes. These methods include lichenometry, dendrochronology, and amino-acid racemization.

<doc id="396418" wikidata="Q1518716" url="?curid=396418" title="Social order">
<text>The term social order can be used in two senses: In the first sense, it refers to a particular system of social structures and institutions. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all.

==Sociology==
Thomas Hobbes is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem, to answer which he conceived the notion of a social contract.
Social theorists (such as Karl Marx, Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Jürgen Habermas) have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of, and what its real basis is. For Marx, it is the relations of production or economic structure which is the basis of social order. For Durkheim, it is a set of shared social norms. For Parsons, it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation, which again are based on a frame of cultural values. For Habermas, it is all of these, as well as communicative action.

==Principle of extensiveness==
Another key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness. This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a society, the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole.

A good example of this is smaller religions based in the U.S., such as the Amish. Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values, it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community.

==Groups and networks==
In every society, people belong to groups, such as businesses, families, churches, athletic groups, or neighborhoods. The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society. There are networks and ties between groups, as well as inside of each of the groups, which create social order.

==Status groups==
&quot;Status groups&quot; can be based on a person&#x27;s characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc. They are defined as &quot;a subculture having a rather specific rank (or status) within the stratification system. That is, societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups, some enjoying high ranking and some low.&quot; One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a university professor compared to that of a garbage man.

A certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups. For example, around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate Hanukkah while a Christian family may celebrate Christmas. Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups.

Smaller groups exist inside of one status group. For instance, one can belong to a status group based on one&#x27;s race and a social class based on financial ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when they feel they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed.

==Values and norms==
Values can be defined as &quot;internal criteria for evaluation&quot;. (Uses &quot;evaluation&quot; with its root-word &quot;value&quot; to define the word &quot;value&quot;) Values are also split into two categories, there are individual values, which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values. Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group, we associate with: friends, family, or co-workers.
Norms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation. Unlike values, norms are enforced externally – or outside of oneself. A society as a whole determines norms, and they can be passed down from generation to generation.

==Power and authority==
An exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is deviant behavior. Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group&#x27;s norms all the time. For this reason, it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority. The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from social inequality. 

In a class society, those who hold positions of power and authority are among the upper class. Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values. Tension can form, therefore, between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that do not conform to the values of both classes.

==Spontaneous order==
The order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government. Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems. These systems, being planned by more than one person, may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person. This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government&#x27;s control. These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare. Considering this, Thomas Schelling studied neighborhood racial segregation. His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability, but it does not always increase social order. In his researching, he found that &quot;when all individuals pursue their own preferences, the outcome is segregation rather than integration,&quot; as stated in &quot;Theories of Social Order&quot;, edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne.

==Social honor==
Social honor can also be referred to as social status. It is considered the distribution of prestige or &quot;the approval, respect, admiration, or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances&quot;. The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power. Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable, they respect or envy people that have more than they do. When social honor is referred to as social status, it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system. Status can be achieved, which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed, which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, such as race, sex, or parental social standing. An example of ascribed status is Kate Middleton who married a prince. An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey, an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire.

==Attainment==
Two different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order. The first theory is &quot;order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property, as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes,&quot; as stated in &quot;Theories of Social Order&quot; by Hechter and Horne. The next theory is that &quot;the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize.&quot; also stated in &quot;Theories of Social Order&quot; by Hechter and Horne. Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different. One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control, and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized. Weber&#x27;s insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea of social orders, ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields.

<doc id="396423" wikidata="Q816148" url="?curid=396423" title="Below-the-line (filmmaking)">
<text>&quot;Below-the-line&quot; is a term derived from the top sheet of a film budget for motion pictures, television programs, industrial films, independent films, student films and documentaries as well as commercials. The &quot;line&quot; in &quot;below-the-line&quot; refers to the separation of production costs between script and story writers, producers, directors, actors, and casting (&quot;above the-line&quot;) and the rest of the crew, or production team.

The top sheet of any creative project&#x27;s budget serves only as an at-a-glance reference to a fully detailed and attached main budget document, which features total expenses including federal, state and local taxes, as well as insurance within the entire production, and/or production incentives. This painstaking task is usually assigned to the Production Manager or UPM of a production and should be completed before principal photography begins for any project.

==Below-the-line crew==

Some below-the-line film and television film crews operate in pre-production, production, or post-production stages of filmmaking. For example, the film editor may work solely in the post-production stage of filming but might also work throughout the production, editing the film as it is shot and advising the director if and when additional shots or scenes are needed. The boom operator, on the other hand, is mostly on set during filming because they have to pick up the dialogue of the actors as well as ambient noise when the scene is being recorded.

This particular type of film crew usually belongs to a guild or union. Some of the unions and/or guilds that represent below-the-line crew include: I.A.T.S.E., The International Cinematographer&#x27;s Guild (an IATSE organization), The Teamsters, Motion Picture Editors Guild, Animation Guild, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors.

It is usually the case for the &quot;below-the-line&quot; crew to work for hourly wages, as opposed to a set wage, or negotiated contractual wage on the front, or back end of any given project. 
These set workers are responsible for a number of many other unsung, and demanding tasks that must be completed to achieve the common goal of creating a film, or television program. These positions could be considered &quot;less glamorous&quot;, and the unmentionable part of filmmaking. However, many dedicated and hard working individuals have made a good living with &quot;below-the-line&quot; job positions, whether it&#x27;s in independent filmmaking, and or for a major film studio. 

Within the many entry-level positions available to gain knowledge of the industry, such as Lighting technicians, grips, wranglers, stunt performers, property masters, ADR, Foley, set painters or any stagehand etc., one could gain knowledge and skill of these, and many other key positions within the film industry.
Many schools and or nonprofit organizations are set up to train the youth and other interested individuals to better prepare and teach a trade that may not otherwise be available within the traditional school system. These organizations teach about film and video terminology, equipment, and life skills, a must for today&#x27;s highly competitive entertainment market.

Below-the-line crew refers to everybody else including:
*Assistant director
*Art director
*Best boy electric and grip
*Boom operator
*Camera operator
*Carpenter (theatre)
*Character generator (CG) operator (television)
*Director of photography
*Costume designer
*Composer
*Dolly grip
*Film editor
*Gaffer
*Graphic artist
*Grip
*Hair stylist
*Key grip
*Line producer
*Location manager
*Make-up artist
*Production assistant
*Production coordinator
*Rigging Grip
*Script supervisor (continuity)
*Set construction
*Set Medic
*Sound engineer
*Stage manager (television)
*Technical director (TD) (television)
*Truck driver
*Unit production manager
*Video control broadcast engineering (television)
*Visual effects editor
Most of these crafts people are considered variable cost in the budget. Meaning, if you cut a scene from the script, potentially, you don&#x27;t have to build that set, or paint it or dress it, etc.

<doc id="396431" wikidata="Q463934" url="?curid=396431" title="Athaliah">
<text>Athaliah ( &quot;Gotholía&quot;; ) was the daughter of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel of Israel; she was queen consort of Judah as the wife of King Jehoram, a descendant of King David, and was later queen regnant c. 841–835 BCE.

==Biblical narrative==

Accounts of Athaliah’s life are found in 2 Kings 8:16–11:16 and 2 Chronicles 22:10–23:15 in the Hebrew Bible. According to the Deuteronomist, she was the daughter of king Omri of Israel; however, she is usually considered to have been the daughter of King Ahab – the son of Omri – and his wife, Queen Jezebel. Some scholars believe Athaliah was the daughter of Omri, but that she grew up as an orphan in the court of Ahab.

Athaliah was married to Jehoram of Judah to seal a treaty between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and to secure his position Jehoram killed his six brothers. Jehoram became king of Judah in the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel&#x27;s reign (). Jehoram of Israel was either Athaliah&#x27;s brother or her nephew, depending on her paternity.

Jehoram of Judah reigned for eight years. His father Jehoshaphat and grandfather Asa had been devout kings who worshiped Yahweh, the one true God, and &quot;walked in His ways&quot;. However, Jehoram chose not to follow their example and rejected Yahweh, and his rule over Judah was subsequently cursed. Edom revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge their independence. A raid by Philistines, Arabs and Ethiopians looted the king&#x27;s house, and carried off all of his family except for Jehoram and Athalia&#x27;s youngest son, Ahaziah.

After Jehoram&#x27;s death, Ahaziah became king of Judah, and Athaliah became gebirah (queen mother). One year after taking the throne (), Ahaziah and Jehoram of Israel were killed by Jehu, a general in Jehoram&#x27;s army acting on Yahweh&#x27;s secret command to take vengeance against the impious kings. Afterwards, Jehu killed Jezebel and the rest of Athaliah’s extended family. Ahab already died in battle before Jehu’s massacre. 

Upon hearing of Ahaziah’s death, Athaliah seized the throne of Judah and killed all possible claimants to the throne, which included Ahaziah&#x27;s sons and his relatives and, possibly, Jehoram&#x27;s children from his other wife. Some believe that the killings were to prevent David&#x27;s descendants from outliving Athaliah&#x27;s kin, most of whom were already killed by Jehu. Others believe they were divine judgment against Jehoshaphat&#x27;s decision to marry his son to Athaliah. 

However, Jehosheba, Ahaziah&#x27;s sister, managed to rescue an infant from the purge: Jehoash of Judah, the son of Ahaziah and his wife Zibiah. Jehoash was raised in secret by Jehosheba&#x27;s husband, the priest Jehoiada.

As &quot;usurper queen&quot;, Athaliah used her power to establish the Baalist cult in Judah. Six years later, Athaliah was astonished when Jehoiada crowned Jehoash king in Solomon&#x27;s Temple. She rushed to stop the rebellion but, under Jehoiada’s orders, was killed by the captains outside the Temple since her blood “would defile it”.

==Dating of reigns==
William F. Albright has dated her reign to 842–837 BCE, while Edwin R. Thiele in the third edition of his &quot;magnum opus&quot; dates her reign from 842/841 to 836/835 BCE. However, a starting date of 842/841 for Athaliah is one year before the date of 841/840 that Thiele gave for the death of her son, Ahaziah, a conflict which Thiele never resolved.

==In literature==
Athaliah is discussed in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; (&quot;On Famous Women&quot;), as well as &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies,&quot; by Christine de Pizan. 

In 1691, French tragedian Jean Racine wrote a play about this biblical queen, entitled &quot;Athalie.&quot; The German composer Felix Mendelssohn, among others, wrote incidental music (his op. 74) to Racine&#x27;s play, first performed in Berlin in 1845. One of the most frequently heard excerpts from the Mendelssohn music is titled &quot;War March of the Priests&quot; (&quot;Kriegsmarsch der Priester&quot;).

In 1733, the musician and composer Handel composed an oratorio based on her life, called &quot;Athalia,&quot; calling her a &quot;Baalite Queen of Judah Daughter of Jezebel&quot;. Baal was the fertility god of the Canaanites, whom the ancient Israelites often fell into worshipping in the Tanakh/Old Testament.

<doc id="396436" wikidata="Q1187243" url="?curid=396436" title="United States Golf Association">
<text>The United States Golf Association (USGA) is the United States national association of golf courses, clubs and facilities and the governing body of golf for the U.S. and Mexico. Together with The R&amp;A, the USGA produces and interprets the rules of golf. The USGA also provides a national handicap system for golfers, conducts 14 national championships, including the U.S. Open, U.S. Women&#x27;s Open and U.S. Senior Open, and tests golf equipment for conformity with regulations. The USGA and the USGA Museum are located in Liberty Corner, New Jersey. In 2024, the USGA moved its Testing Center from Liberty Corner, New Jersey to Pinehurst, North Carolina. The Testing Center is where all golf clubs and golf balls manufactured in the United States and Mexico are tested for conformance to the Rules of Golf.   

==History==
The USGA was originally formed in 1894 to resolve the question of a national amateur championship. Earlier that year, the Newport Country Club and Saint Andrew&#x27;s Golf Club, Yonkers, New York, both declared the winners of their tournaments the &quot;national amateur champion.&quot; That autumn, delegates from Newport, St. Andrew&#x27;s, The Country Club, Chicago Golf Club, and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club met in New York City to form a national governing body, which would administer the championship and also the Rules of Golf for the country. On December 22, 1894, the Amateur Golf Association of the United States was officially formed, and was shortly thereafter renamed the &quot;United States Golf Association&quot;. Theodore Havemeyer was the first president, and the U.S. Amateur trophy is named in his honor.

The first U.S. Amateur was held in 1895 at the Newport Country Club, with Charles B. Macdonald (who was runner-up at both of the previous year&#x27;s tournaments) winning the championship. The first U.S. Open was held the following day, almost as an afterthought. It was not until 1898 that the two events were held at separate clubs. Today, the USGA administers 14 separate national championships, ten of which are expressly for amateurs.

The USGA gradually expanded its membership from the original five clubs. There were 267 club members in 1910, and 1,138 clubs by 1932. Membership fell off during the Great Depression and World War II, but recovered by 1947. By 1980 there were over 5,000 clubs, and today membership exceeds 9,700.

On September 17, 1956, Ann Gregory began competing in the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Championship, thus becoming the first African-American woman to play in a national championship conducted by the USGA.

In 2011, Sarah Hirshland became the senior managing director of business affairs for the USGA. In April 2018, she was promoted to chief commercial officer. She brought the USGA partnerships with major corporations and negotiated a billion-dollar deal with the Fox TV network. In August 2018, she left to become the 20th chief executive officer of the United States Olympic Committee.

==Competitions organized by the USGA==
The USGA organizes or co-organizes the following competitions:

===Open championships===
An &quot;open&quot; golf championship is one that both professionals and amateurs may enter. In practice, such events are always won by professionals nowadays. The two leading opens in the U.S. are:

* U.S. Open – no age or gender restrictions, Handicap Index requirement of 1.4 or less. Established in 1895, it is the second-oldest of the four major championships.
* U.S. Women&#x27;s Open – females, no age restrictions, Handicap Index requirement of 2.4 or less. Established in 1946 and administered by the USGA since 1953, it is the oldest of the five women&#x27;s majors.

The last win by an amateur at the U.S. Open was in 1933 and an amateur has won the women&#x27;s event only once, in 1967.

The USGA also conducts the U.S. Senior Open for competitors 50 and over. This is one of the five majors recognized by the world&#x27;s dominant tour for golfers 50 and over, PGA Tour Champions. The overwhelming majority of the competitors play regularly on this tour. Many of the remaining players compete on the European counterpart of PGA Tour Champions, the European Senior Tour, which recognizes the U.S. Senior Open as one of its three majors. The USGA added a women&#x27;s counterpart in 2018.

* U.S. Senior Open – no gender restriction, players age 50 &amp; older, handicap index requirement of 3.4 or less, established in 1980.
* U.S. Senior Women&#x27;s Open – women&#x27;s players age 50 &amp; older with a handicap index of 7.4 or less, established in 2018.

===Individual amateur championships===
Professional golf in the US is mainly run by the PGA Tour, the LPGA, and the PGA of America. However, the USGA organizes the 10 national amateur championships. The leading events are open to all age groups, but are usually won by golfers in their early twenties:

* U.S. Amateur – no age or gender restrictions, handicap index of 2.4 or less, established in 1895.
* U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur – no age restrictions, females with a handicap index of 5.4 or less, established in 1895.

There are two championships for players under age 19:

* U.S. Junior Amateur – no gender restriction, handicap index of 4.4 or less, established in 1948
* U.S. Girls&#x27; Junior – girls with a handicap index of 9.4 or less, established in 1949

And two for senior golfers:

* U.S. Senior Amateur – no gender restriction, players age 55 &amp; older, handicap index of 7.4 or less, established in 1955
* U.S. Senior Women&#x27;s Amateur – women age 50 &amp; older with a handicap index of 18.4 or less, established in 1962

Because the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur became increasingly dominated by future tournament professionals, two national championships were added in the 1980s for &quot;career amateurs&quot; who were 25 years of age &amp; older:

* U.S. Mid-Amateur – no gender restriction, players age 25 &amp; older, handicap index of 3.4 or less, established in 1981
* U.S. Women&#x27;s Mid-Amateur – women age 25 &amp; older with a handicap index of 9.4 or less, established in 1987

===Team amateur championships===
These team events were announced by the USGA in 2013 as the replacements for the discontinued Public Links championships and played for the first time in 2015. Both are contested by two-member teams in four-ball matches. Partners are not required to be from the same club, political subdivision, or country.
* U.S. Amateur Four-Ball – no age or gender restrictions; handicap index of 5.4 or less
* U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Four-Ball – no age restrictions, females with a handicap index of 14.4 or less

===State team championships===
The USGA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s state team championships were first conducted in 1995 as a part of the USGA&#x27;s Centennial celebration. The two championships were conducted biennially in odd-numbered years through 2009. Since 2010, the men&#x27;s championship has been conducted in even-numbered years and the women&#x27;s championship in odd-numbered years. According to NCAA rules, college golfers are not eligible.

*USGA Men&#x27;s State Team Championship
*USGA Women&#x27;s State Team Championship

===International team competitions===
The USGA, in cooperation with The R&amp;A, co-organizes two biennial amateur team competitions between the United States and a joint team representing Great Britain and Ireland (in political terms, Ireland and the United Kingdom).

*Curtis Cup – 8-woman teams, played in even-numbered years. The 2018 edition was the first in which The R&amp;A was directly involved. Previously, the Ladies&#x27; Golf Union was the co-organizer, but that body merged with The R&amp;A in late 2016 (after that year&#x27;s Curtis Cup had been played).
*Walker Cup – 10-man male teams, played in odd-numbered years.

Through its membership of the International Golf Federation the USGA is involved in the administration of the two &quot;World Amateur Team Championships&quot;, which are played biennially in even-numbered years.

*Eisenhower Trophy – for men
*Espirito Santo Trophy – for women

===Discontinued championships===
There had been two events for &quot;public-course&quot; golfers, but the USGA announced in 2013 that both would be discontinued after their 2014 editions. Members of private golf clubs were excluded from these championships.

* U.S. Amateur Public Links – popularly known as the &quot;Publinx&quot;; no gender restriction, handicap index of 4.4 or less, established in 1922 and discontinued in 2014
* U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Public Links – popularly known as the &quot;Women&#x27;s Publinx&quot;; women with a handicap index of 18.4 or less, established in 1977 and discontinued in 2014

===Multiple event winners===
