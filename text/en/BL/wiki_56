<text>Ferit Orhan Pamuk (born 7 June 1952; ) is a Turkish novelist, screenwriter, academic, and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature. One of Turkey&#x27;s most prominent novelists, he has sold over 13 million books in 63 languages, making him the country&#x27;s best-selling writer.

Pamuk&#x27;s novels include &quot;Silent House&quot;, &quot;The White Castle&quot;, &quot;The Black Book&quot;, &quot;The New Life&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Red&quot; and &quot;Snow&quot;. He is the Robert Yik-Fong Tam Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University, where he teaches writing and comparative literature. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018.

Born in Istanbul, Pamuk is the first Turkish Nobel laureate. He has also received many other literary awards. &quot;My Name Is Red&quot; won the 2002 Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger, the 2002 Premio Grinzane Cavour, and the 2003 International Dublin Literary Award.

The European Writers&#x27; Parliament came about as a result of a joint proposal by Pamuk and José Saramago. Pamuk&#x27;s willingness to write books about contentious historical and political events put him at risk of censure in his homeland. In 2005, a lawyer sued him over a statement acknowledging the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire. Pamuk said his intention had been to highlight issues of freedom of speech in Turkey. The court initially declined to hear the case, but in 2011 Pamuk was ordered to pay 6,000 liras in compensation for having insulted the plaintiffs&#x27; honor.

==Early life==
Pamuk was born in Istanbul, in 1952, and grew up in a wealthy but declining upper-class family, an experience he describes in passing in his novels &quot;The Black Book&quot; and &quot;Cevdet Bey and His Sons&quot;, as well as more thoroughly in his personal memoir &quot;Istanbul: Memories and the City&quot;. Pamuk&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Circassian. He was educated at Robert College secondary school in Istanbul and studied architecture at the Istanbul Technical University, a subject related to his dream career, painting. He left architecture school after three years to become a full-time writer, and graduated from the Institute of Journalism at the University of Istanbul in 1976. From ages 22 to 30, Pamuk lived with his mother, writing his first novel and attempting to find a publisher. He describes himself as a Cultural Muslim who identifies with Islam historically and culturally while not believing in a personal connection to God.

==Work==

Pamuk started writing regularly in 1974. His first novel, &quot;Karanlık ve Işık&quot; (&quot;Darkness and Light&quot;) was a co-winner of the 1979 Milliyet Press Novel Contest (Mehmet Eroğlu was the other winner). This novel was published with the title &quot;Cevdet Bey ve Oğulları&quot; (&quot;Mr. Cevdet and His Sons&quot;) in 1982 and won the Orhan Kemal Novel Prize in 1983. It tells the story of three generations of a wealthy Istanbul family living in Nişantaşı, the district of Istanbul where Pamuk grew up.

Pamuk won a number of critical prizes for his early work, including the 1984 Madarali Novel Prize for his second novel &quot;Sessiz Ev&quot; (&quot;Silent House&quot;) and the 1991 Prix de la Découverte Européenne for its French translation. His historical novel &quot;Beyaz Kale&quot; (&quot;The White Castle&quot;), published in Turkish in 1985, won the 1990 Independent Award for Foreign Fiction and extended his reputation abroad. On 19 May 1991, &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review wrote, &quot;A new star has risen in the east—Orhan Pamuk.&quot; He started experimenting with postmodern techniques in his novels, a change from his early works&#x27; strict naturalism.

Popular success took a bit longer, but his 1990 novel &quot;Kara Kitap&quot; (&quot;The Black Book&quot;) became one of the most controversial and popular books in Turkish literature, due to its complexity and richness. In 1992, he wrote the screenplay for the movie &quot;Gizli Yüz&quot; (&quot;Secret Face&quot;), based on &quot;Kara Kitap&quot; and directed by a prominent Turkish director, Ömer Kavur. Pamuk&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;Yeni Hayat&quot; (&quot;New Life&quot;), caused a sensation in Turkey upon its 1994 publication and became the fastest-selling book in Turkish history. By this time, Pamuk had also become a high-profile figure in Turkey due to his support for Kurdish political rights. In 1995, he was among a group of authors tried for writing essays that criticized Turkey&#x27;s treatment of the Kurds. In 1999, Pamuk published his book of essays &quot;Öteki Renkler&quot; (&quot;Other Colors&quot;).

In 2019, the 66-year-old Nobel laureate held an exhibition of his photographs of Istanbul taken from his own balcony, &quot;Balkon: Photos by Orhan Pamuk&quot;. It captured the &quot;subtle and ever-changing view of Istanbul&quot; photographed by Pamuk from his balcony using a telephoto lens. Curated by Gerhard Steidl, the German publisher of his photo book &quot;Balkon&quot;, the exhibition ran for three months at the Yapı Kredi Culture and Arts building on Istanbul&#x27;s Istiklal Street. It featured more than 600 colour photos selected from over 8,500 Pamuk took over a five-month period in late 2012 and early 2013, in what the gallery called &quot;a period of intense creativity&quot;.

===&quot;My Name Is Red&quot;===

Pamuk&#x27;s international reputation continued to increase when he published &quot;Benim Adım Kırmızı&quot; (&quot;My Name is Red&quot;) in 1998. The novel blends mystery, romance, and philosophical puzzles in a setting of 16th-century Istanbul. It opens a window into the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat III in nine snowy winter days of 1591, inviting the reader to experience the tension between East and West from a breathlessly urgent perspective. &quot;My Name Is Red&quot; has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the International Dublin Literary Award, one of the world&#x27;s most lucrative literary prizes.

Asked what impact winning this last award (currently $127,000) had on his life and work, Pamuk replied:

Nothing changed in my life since I work all the time. I&#x27;ve spent 30 years writing fiction. For the first 10 years, I worried about money and no one asked how much money I made. The second decade I spent money and no one was asking about that. And I&#x27;ve spent the last 10 years with everyone expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.
===&quot;Snow&quot;===

Pamuk followed this with the novel &quot;Kar&quot;, published in 2002 (English translation: &quot;Snow&quot;, 2004). Set in the border city of Kars, it explores the conflict between Islamism and Westernism in modern Turkey. Snow follows Ka, an expatriate Turkish poet, as he wanders around the snowy Kars and gets caught up in the muddle of aimless Islamists, MPs, headscarf advocates, secularists, and a number of factions who die and kill in the name of highly contradictory ideals. &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed &quot;Snow&quot; as one of its Ten Best Books of 2004.

In a conversation with Carol Becker in the Brooklyn Rail about creating sympathetic characters in the political novel, Pamuk said:

I strongly feel that the art of the novel is based on the human capacity, though it’s a limited capacity, to be able to identify with &quot;the other&quot;. Only human beings can do this. It requires imagination, a sort of morality, a self-imposed goal of understanding this person who is different from us, which is a rarity. 
===&quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;===

In May 2007, Pamuk was among the jury members at the Cannes Film Festival headed by British director Stephen Frears. He completed his next novel, &quot;Masumiyet Müzesi&quot; (&quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;) in the summer of 2008 - the first novel he published after receiving the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Pamuk created an actual Museum of Innocence, consisting of everyday objects tied to the narrative, and housed them at an Istanbul house he purchased. Pamuk collaborated on a documentary &quot;The Innocence of Memories&quot; that expanded on his Museum of Innocence. Pamuk stated that &quot;(Museum of Dreams will) tell a different version of the love story set in Istanbul through objects and Grant Gee’s wonderful new film&quot;. In both &quot;Snow&quot; and the &quot;Museum of Innocence&quot; Pamuk describes tragic love-stories, where men fall in love with beautiful women at first sight. Pamuk&#x27;s heroes tend to be educated men who fall tragically in love with beauties, but who seem doomed to a decrepit loneliness.

In 2013, Pamuk invited Grazia Toderi, whose work he admired, to design a work for the Museum of Innocence in Istanbul. Their collaboration culminated in the exhibition &quot;Words and Stars&quot;. &quot;Words and Stars&quot; opened on 2 April 2017, at the MART (Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto), and which explores &quot;the inclination of man to explore space and innate vocation to question the stars.&quot; The show was curated by Gianfranco Maraniello. It also showed from 4 November 2016 to 29 March 2017 from 5–6 November 2016 at the Palazzo Madama, Piazza Castello, Turin, and at &quot;Infini-to, the Planetarium of Turin (Infini.to - Planetario di Torino, Museo dell&#x27;Astronomia e dello Spazio)&quot; by invitation.

===Non-fiction===
Pamuk published a memoir/travelogue &quot;Istanbul—Hatıralar ve Şehir&quot; in 2003 (English version, &quot;Istanbul—Memories and the City&quot;, 2005). Pamuk&#x27;s &quot;Other Colours&quot; – a collection of non-fiction and a story — was published in the UK in September 2007.

Asked how personal his book &quot;Istanbul: Memories and the City&quot; was, Pamuk replied:

I thought I would write &quot;Memories and the City&quot; in six months, but it took me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t want to go into those details: divorce, father dying, professional problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.
==Style==
Pamuk&#x27;s books are characterized by a confusion or loss of identity brought on in part by the conflict between Western and Eastern values. They are often disturbing or unsettling, and include complex plots and characters. His works are also redolent with discussion of and fascination with the creative arts, such as literature and painting. Pamuk&#x27;s work often touches on the deep-rooted tensions between East and West and tradition and modernism/secularism.

Pamuk speaks about &quot;the angel of inspiration&quot; when he discusses his creativity:
&quot;I am just listening to an inner music, the mystery of which I don&#x27;t completely know. And I don&#x27;t want to know.&quot;

&quot;I am most surprised by those moments when I have felt as if the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination – that another power has found them and generously presented them to me.&quot;
A group of writers assert that some parts of Pamuk&#x27;s works are heavily influenced by the works of other writers, and some chapters are almost totally quoted from other books. Pamuk himself said that his works have been inspired by the writings of rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. One of the writers, nationalist popular historian Murat Bardakçı, accused him of counterfeiting and plagiarism in the &quot;Hurriyet&quot;, a Turkish newspaper. Another accusation is that Pamuk&#x27;s novel &quot;The White Castle&quot; contains exact paragraphs from Fuad Carim&#x27;s &quot;Kanuni Devrinde İstanbul&quot; (&quot;Istanbul in the Time of the Kanuni&quot;) novel. After a question raised at the 2009 Boston Book Festival as to whether he wanted to respond to these accusations, Pamuk responded, &quot;No I do not. Next question?&quot;. However, many attributed such accusations to their ignorance about postmodern literature, and the literary technique of intertextuality which Pamuk almost always uses in his novels in full disclosure.

==Personal life==
Pamuk&#x27;s elder brother Şevket Pamuk, who sometimes appears as a fictionalized character in his works, is a professor of economics internationally recognised for his work in economic history of the Ottoman Empire, working at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul. Pamuk also has a younger half-sister, Hümeyra Pamuk, who is a journalist.

On 1 March 1982, Pamuk married historian Aylin Türegün. From 1985 to 1988, while she was a graduate student at Columbia University, Pamuk assumed the position of visiting scholar there, using the time to conduct research and write his novel &quot;The Black Book&quot; at the university&#x27;s Butler Library. This period also included a visiting fellowship at the University of Iowa. Pamuk returned to Istanbul, a city to which he is strongly attached. In 1991 he and his wife had a daughter, Rüya, whose name means &quot;dream&quot; in Turkish, and to whom his novel &quot;My Name is Red&quot; is dedicated. In 2002, they were divorced.

In 2006, Pamuk returned to the U.S. to take a position as a visiting professor at Columbia, where he was a Fellow with Columbia&#x27;s Committee on Global Thought and held an appointment in Columbia&#x27;s Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department and at its School of the Arts. In the 2007–08 academic year Pamuk returned to Columbia to jointly teach comparative literature classes with Andreas Huyssen and David Damrosch. Pamuk was also a writer-in-residence at Bard College. In 2009, he was Harvard&#x27;s Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer, delivering a series of lectures titled &quot;The Naive and Sentimental Novelist&quot;.

Orhan publicly acknowledged his relationship with the writer Kiran Desai. In January 2011, Turkish-Armenian artist Karolin Fişekçi told &quot;Hürriyet Daily News&quot; that Pamuk had a two-and-a-half-year relationship with her during the same time (2010–12), which Pamuk expressly denied.

Since 2011 he has been in a relationship with Aslı Akyavaş, whom he married in 2022.

==Trial==

In 2005, after Pamuk made a statement about the Armenian genocide and mass killings of Kurds, a criminal case was opened against him based on a complaint filed by lawyer Kemal Kerinçsiz. The charges were dropped on 22 January 2006. In Bilecik, his books were burned in a nationalist rally. Pamuk subsequently said his intent was to draw attention to freedom of speech issues. Kerinçsiz appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which ordered the court in Şişli to reopen the case. On 27 March 2011, Pamuk was found guilty and ordered to pay 6,000 liras in compensation to five people for, among other things, having insulted their honour.

===Pamuk&#x27;s statements===
The criminal charges against Pamuk resulted from remarks he made during an interview in February 2005 with the Swiss publication &quot;Das Magazin&quot;, a weekly supplement to a number of Swiss daily newspapers: the &quot;Tages-Anzeiger&quot;, the &quot;Basler Zeitung&quot;, the &quot;Berner Zeitung&quot; and the &quot;Solothurner Tagblatt.&quot; In the interview, Pamuk said, &quot;Thirty thousand Kurds have been killed here, and a million Armenians. And almost nobody dares to mention that. So I do.&quot; Turkish historians were divided over the remarks.

Pamuk said he was consequently subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country. He returned later in 2005 to face the charges against him. In an interview with &quot;BBC News&quot;, he said that he wanted to defend freedom of speech, which was Turkey&#x27;s only hope for coming to terms with its history: &quot;What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to be able to talk about the past.&quot; But when CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that &quot;Armenians were killed&quot; but he denied that he said &quot;Turks killed Armenians&quot;, and estimated the number of deaths as 1 million in that speech.

===Prosecution===
At the time, Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code stated: &quot;A person who publicly insults the Republic or Turkish Grand National Assembly, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months to three years.&quot; Pamuk was charged with violating this law in the interview. In October, after the prosecution had begun, Pamuk reiterated his views in a speech given during an award ceremony in Germany: &quot;I repeat, I said loud and clear that one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey.&quot;

Article 301&#x27;s old form before 2005 (and also the new form after the amendments in 2008) required that prosecution under the article needs to be approved by the Ministry of Justice. A few minutes after Pamuk&#x27;s trial started on 16 December, the judge found that this approval had not yet been received and suspended the proceedings. In an interview published in the &quot;Akşam&quot; newspaper the same day, then Justice Minister Cemil Çiçek said he had not yet received Pamuk&#x27;s file but would study it thoroughly once it came.

On 29 December 2005, Turkish state prosecutors dropped the charge that Pamuk insulted Turkey&#x27;s armed forces, although the charge of &quot;insulting Turkishness&quot; remained.

===International reaction===
The charges against Pamuk caused an international outcry and led to questions in some circles about Turkey&#x27;s proposed entry into the European Union. On 30 November, the European Parliament announced that it would send a delegation of five MEPs led by Camiel Eurlings, to observe the trial. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn subsequently stated that the Pamuk case would be a &quot;litmus test&quot; of Turkey&#x27;s commitment to the EU&#x27;s membership criteria.

On 1 December, Amnesty International released a statement calling for Article 301 to be repealed and for Pamuk and six other people awaiting trial under the act to be freed. PEN American Center also denounced the charges against Pamuk, stating: &quot;PEN finds it extraordinary that a state that has ratified both the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights, both of which see freedom of expression as central, should have a Penal Code that includes a clause that is so clearly contrary to these very same principles.&quot;

On 13 December, eight world-renowned authors—José Saramago, Gabriel García Márquez, Günter Grass, Umberto Eco, Carlos Fuentes, Juan Goytisolo, John Updike and Mario Vargas Llosa—issued a joint statement supporting Pamuk and decrying the charges against him as a violation of human rights.

In 2008, in an open online poll, Pamuk was voted as the fourth most intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by &quot;Prospect Magazine&quot; (United Kingdom) and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (United States).

===Charges dropped===
On 22 January 2006, Turkey&#x27;s Justice Ministry refused to issue an approval of the prosecution, saying that they had no authority to open a case against Pamuk under the new penal code. With the trial in the local court, it was ruled the next day that the case could not continue without Justice Ministry approval. Pamuk&#x27;s lawyer, Haluk İnanıcı, subsequently confirmed that the charges had been dropped.

The announcement occurred in a week when the EU was scheduled to begin a review of the Turkish justice system.

===Interplay===
EU enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn welcomed the dropping of charges, saying, &quot;This is obviously good news for Mr. Pamuk, but it&#x27;s also good news for freedom of expression in Turkey&quot;. But some EU representatives expressed disappointment that the justice ministry had rejected the prosecution on a technicality rather than on principle. An Ankara-based EU diplomat reportedly said, &quot;It is good the case has apparently been dropped, but the justice ministry never took a clear position or gave any sign of trying to defend Pamuk&quot;. Meanwhile, the lawyer who had led the effort to try Pamuk, Kemal Kerinçsiz, said he would appeal the decision, saying, &quot;Orhan Pamuk must be punished for insulting Turkey and Turkishness, it is a grave crime and it should not be left unpunished.&quot;

In 2006, the magazine &quot;Time&quot; listed Pamuk in the cover article &quot;TIME 100: The People Who Shape Our World&quot;, in the category &quot;Heroes &amp; Pioneers&quot;, for speaking up.

In April 2006, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;HARDtalk&quot; program, Pamuk stated that his remarks regarding the Armenian genocide were meant to draw attention to freedom of expression issues in Turkey rather than to the massacres themselves.

On 19–20 December 2006, a symposium on &quot;Orhan Pamuk and His Work&quot; was held at Sabancı University, Istanbul. Pamuk himself gave the closing address.

In January 2008, Turkish authorities arrested 13 ultranationalists, including Kerinçsiz, for participating in a Turkish nationalist underground organisation, &quot;Ergenekon&quot;, allegedly conspiring to assassinate political figures, including several Christian missionaries and Armenian intellectual Hrant Dink. Several reports suggest that Pamuk was among the figures this group plotted to kill. The police informed Pamuk about the assassination plans eight months before the Ergenekon investigation.

<text>Marie of Korikos (1321 – before 1405) served as the queen consort of Armenia from 1344–1363 and 1365–1373 through marriage to the kings Constantine III and Constantine IV, respectively.

After her second husband&#x27;s death in 1373, she served as the penultimate ruler of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, governing what little remained of the kingdom as regent from April 1373 to the election and coronation of Constantine&#x27;s successor Leo V on 14 September 1374.

== Life ==
Marie&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Philip I, Prince of Taranto and his first wife Thamar Angelina Komnene. Philip was son of Charles II of Naples and his wife Maria of Hungary.

Marie&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Hayton of Corycus and Isabella of Ibelin, daughter of Guy of Ibelin and Maria of Armenia, herself daughter of Isabella, Queen of Armenia and her second husband Hethum I, King of Armenia.

Marie&#x27;s father had previously been married to Margaret of Ibelin and had a daughter, her half-sister Alice of Korikos, who married Leo IV, King of Armenia but was murdered by him in 1329 along with Marie&#x27;s father who had acted as regent but had killed various members of the Armenian royal family.

=== Queen of Armenia ===

==== Queen consort, 1344–1373 ====
Marie married her first husband in 1340, Constantine III, King of Armenia. From this marriage she became Queen consort.

Both sons died in childhood and neither succeeded their father. They are named by their father in a contemporary manuscript which records a donation to the convent of Sis in memory of his sons Oshin and Lewon.

After her husband&#x27;s death on December 21, 1362, he was eventually succeeded by his cousin Constantine IV, King of Armenia. Maria married the new King of Armenia but they had no children. Maria died before 1405.

Constantine IV was a weak and unpopular ruler. His reign saw the dwindling of Armenian domains in Cilicia to consist of little more than a narrow coastal stretch around the city of Sis. By the end of his reign, the Armenians retained control of only the city&#x27;s citadel. The Armenians hoped to find a possible successor to the throne that would connect them to Cyprus and Western Europe, thus securing support and aid. They first sent a delegation to the Cypriote prince Leo de Lusignan, nephew of the former king Constantine II, though he rejected the proposal. When the delegation returned in April 1373, Constantine IV was assassinated.

==== Queen regent, 1373–1374 ====
Upon the death of Constantine IV, an heir not yet having been chosen, Marie became regent of what remained of the kingdom.

Further delegations continued to be sent in search for a possible king. The Armenian nobles still desired to make Leo their king and sent a delegation to Peter II of Cyprus to ask for his approval of Leo&#x27;s succession to the throne. Peter refused since he desired the Armenian throne for himself. Shortly thereafter, Leo nevertheless arrived in Armenia, accompanied by a tiny army to Sis. He reached the capital on 26 July 1374 and was crowned on 14 September, ending Marie&#x27;s regency.

==Issue==
With Constantine III, King of Armenia:
*Oshin (d. 1356), died young
*Lewon (1338 – before 1357), died young

<doc id="403537" wikidata="Q122577093" url="?curid=403537" title="Thor (comic book)">
<text>Thor, or The Mighty Thor, is the name of several comic book titles featuring the character Thor and published by Marvel Comics, beginning with the original &quot;Thor&quot; comic book series which debuted in 1966.

==Publication history==
The Marvel Comics superhero Thor debuted in the science fiction/fantasy anthology title &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #83 (cover-date August 1962), and was created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller-plotter Jack Kirby.

Subsequent stories of the 13-page feature &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; continued to be plotted by Lee, and were variously scripted by Lieber or by Robert Bernstein, working under the pseudonym &quot;R. Berns&quot;. Various artists penciled the feature, including Jack Kirby, Joe Sinnott, Don Heck, and Al Hartley. With &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and definitive run by writer and co-plotter Lee and penciler and co-plotter Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled &quot;Thor&quot; #179 (Aug. 1970).

The five-page featurette &quot;Tales of Asgard&quot; was added in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #97 (Oct. 1963), followed by &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;the adventures of Thor were gradually transformed from stories about a strange-looking superhero into a spectacular saga.&quot; Artist Chic Stone, who inked several early Thor stories, observed that &quot;Kirby could just lead you through all these different worlds. The readers would follow him anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; was retitled &quot;Thor&quot; (per the indicia, or &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; per most covers) with issue #126 (March 1966). &quot;Tales of Asgard&quot; was replaced by a five-page featurette starring the Inhumans from #146–152 (Nov. 1967–May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories expanded to Marvel&#x27;s then-standard 20-page length. Marvel filed for a trademark for &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; in 1967 and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.

After Kirby left the title, Neal Adams penciled issues #180–181 (Sept.-Oct. 1970). John Buscema then became the regular artist the following issue. Buscema continued to draw the book almost without interruption until #278 (Dec. 1978). Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left, and during Buscema&#x27;s long stint on the book, the stories were mostly written by Gerry Conway, Len Wein, or Roy Thomas. Thomas continued to write the title after Buscema&#x27;s departure, working much of the time with the artist Keith Pollard; during this period Thomas integrated many elements of traditional Norse mythology into the title, with specific stories translated into comics form. Following Thomas&#x27;s tenure, &quot;Thor&quot; had a changing creative team.

In the mid-1970s, Marvel considered giving the character a second series as part of parent company Magazine Management&#x27;s line of black-and-white comics magazines. A story written by Steve Englehart for the aborted project appeared in &quot;Thor&quot; Annual #5 (1976). A black-and-white Thor story appeared in &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #10 (Winter 1977).

Walt Simonson took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). His stories placed a greater emphasis on the character&#x27;s mythological origins. Simonson&#x27;s run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson&#x27;s run, which introduced the character Beta Ray Bill, was regarded as a popular and critical success. Simonson&#x27;s later stories were drawn by Sal Buscema, who describes Simonson&#x27;s stories as &quot;very stimulating. It was a pleasure working on his plots, because they were a lot of fun to illustrate. He had a lot of great ideas, and he took &quot;Thor&quot; in a totally new direction.&quot; Asked why he was leaving &quot;Thor&quot;, Simonson said that he felt the series was due for a change in creative direction, and that he wanted to reduce his work load for a time. After Simonson&#x27;s departure, Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief at the time, Tom DeFalco, became the writer. Working primarily with artist Ron Frenz, DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

As a consequence of the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; crossover story arc of the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and with other Marvel characters re-imagined in an alternate universe for one year. The &quot;Thor&quot; title reverted to &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; with issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features (&quot;The Lost Gods&quot;; &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;; &quot;Black Widow&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal King&quot;) before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

When the character was returned to the mainstream Marvel Universe, Thor was relaunched with &quot;Thor&quot; vol. 2, #1 (July 1998). As of issue #36, the title used dual numbering in a tribute to the original Thor series, and the caption box for said issue became #36 / #538 (June 2001). The title ran until issue #85 / #587, dated December 2004. Dan Jurgens wrote the first 79 issues, with Daniel Berman and Michael Avon Oeming completing the series.

The third volume debuted as &quot;Thor&quot; #1 (Sept. 2007), initially written by J. Michael Straczynski and penciled by Olivier Coipel. Beginning with what would have been vol. 3, #13 (Jan. 2009), the third volume reverted to issue #600, reflecting the total number of published issues from all three volumes. Kieron Gillen took over from Straczynski in &quot;Thor&quot; #604 with artists Billy Tan, Richard Elson and Dougie Braithwaite, with his final storyline finishing in issue #614. Matt Fraction took over the series with issue #615, after having been announced as starting in &quot;Thor&quot; #610 and #611.

In April 2011, &quot;Thor&quot; once again reverted to its original title of &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; with issue #622, reuniting writer Gillen and artist Braithwaite in a series of stories starring Thor&#x27;s adopted brother, Loki.

In October 2014, a fourth volume of &quot;Thor&quot; by Jason Aaron and artist Russell Dauterman debuted that featured a female character (later revealed to be Jane Foster) in the role of Thor after the classic hero is no longer able to wield Mjolnir. Aaron stated that &quot;this is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is Thor. This is the Thor of the Marvel Universe. But it&#x27;s unlike any Thor we&#x27;ve ever seen before.&quot; The following October, Aaron and Dauterman signed an exclusive agreement with Marvel to continue their work together in a second volume of &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;, also starring Foster.

In January 2020, Thor volume #6 debuted, written by Donny Cates. This story follows Thor, as he becomes the new king of Asgard and tries to fulfill his duties as a king while fighting his destiny in an attempt to save the multiverse from an unknown threat. After Cates had to depart &quot;Thor&quot; due to suffering a car accident in early 2023, Torunn Grønbekk was brought on to write the remaining issues of the series.

<text>Cubs or Wolf Cubs are programs associated with some Scout organizations, for children generally aged between 8 and 10 or 12. A participant in the program is called a Cub and a group of Cubs is called a &quot;Pack&quot;.

The Wolf Cub program was originated by The Scout Association in the United Kingdom in 1916 to provide a program for boys who were too young to be Boy Scouts. It was adopted by many other Scout organizations. Many Scout organizations, including The Scout Association, no longer use the Wolf Cub program and have replaced it with other program but have retained the name Cubs. Others, including some Traditional Scouting organizations, maintain the original Wolf Cubs program.

Originally, cubs program were open only to boys, while young girls could join the Brownies. Some Cub organizations are open to both girls and boys, although not necessarily in the same unit. A few organizations also operate a Sea Cub version of Cubs.

==Foundation==

Wolf Cubs was started by The Scout Association in 1916, nine years after the establishment of the Boy Scout Movement, to cater to younger boys who were too young to be Boy Scouts. During these first years, many troops had either allowed younger boys to join or had set up an informal junior or cadet Scout troops. In 1916, articles in a Scout leaders&#x27; journal, &quot;Headquarters Gazette&quot; outlined &quot;Junior Scout&quot; and then &quot;Wolf Cub&quot; schemes. However, Robert Baden-Powell wanted something quite different from a watered-down Boy Scout program and recognised that too close of an association between the junior program and the Boy Scouts would detract from both. Baden-Powell wanted a junior scheme with a name, uniform and other identity and program distinct from the Scouts.

In 1916, Baden-Powell published his outlines for such a scheme, it was to be called Wolf Cubs. Baden-Powell asked his friend Rudyard Kipling for the use of his &quot;Jungle Book&quot; history and universe as a motivational frame for the Wolf Cub scheme. The scheme was given a publicity launch at The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Imperial Headquarters in Buckingham Palace Road, Westminster, on Saturday 24 June 1916. Baden-Powell wrote a new book, &quot;The Wolf Cub&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, the first edition of which was published in December 1916. He collaborated with Vera Barclay in devising the Wolf Cub training program and badges, which were published in the second edition. On 16 December 1916, a public display of the Wolf Cubs was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, to which Kipling was invited; he was unable to attend but sent Baden-Powell a letter of apology, praising his work with the Scout Movement. Vera Barclay co-founded Wolf Cubs with Baden-Powell in 1916.

From the 1960s, many organizations varied or abandoned the Wolf Cub &quot;Jungle Book&quot; theme. Some organizations changed the name to Cubs, Cub Scouts or similar but retained the Jungle Stories and Cub ceremony as tradition—such as the use of &quot;Jungle Book&quot; names (as described below); and the Grand Howl which signals the start and end of Cub Meetings. Other organizations kept the name but dropped the &quot;Jungle Book&quot; theme.

Originally, Cubs was open only to boys while the Brownies were set up as a parallel for young girls in Girl Guides organizations. This remains the situation in some places. Most World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) member organizations admitted girls to Cubs while others have separate co-ed units with a different theme. Most member Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d&#x27;Europe (UIGSE) member organizations have two single-sex units both named Wolf Cubs and both in the jungle theme.

Cubs has ideals of spiritual and character growth, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Cubs provides a positive, encouraging peer group, carefully selected leaders who provide good role models and a group setting where values are taught to reinforce positive qualities of character.

==Organization==
Cubs are organized in packs, which are sometimes linked to a Scout group, providing all the age programs known as a &quot;Scouting family&quot;. Adult leaders of Cub packs take the names of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;″s main characters. In many countries the &quot;leader&quot; of the Pack is called Akela; subordinate leaders are named Bagheera, Baloo, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, etc., by how many sub-leaders the pack has. A few very big packs need so many sub-leaders that their names must extend to include Tabaqui and Shere Khan, but that tends to be the cue for the pack to split into two packs. Cubs have a distinctive two-finger salute according to the Jungle theme, in contrast to the three-finger salute of the Boy Scouts. However, in The Scout Association of the United Kingdom (UK) and some of its overseas branches, the two-finger salute was later replaced by the three-finger salute. Historically, Cubs wear a distinctive headdress, which is a tight-fitting green felt cap with green felt visor, yellow pipings, and an emblem at the front—although in some countries this has been replaced by more contemporary headgear or dispensed with entirely.

Just as Scout troops are subdivided into patrols, Cub packs are divided into small teams. Baden-Powell named the team a Six, which refers to the six Cubs in each team. In most countries Sixes are mixed-age groups with the oldest as sixer (&quot;leader&quot;). In the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the teams are called dens, with each den serving either boys or girls in the same school grade.

Youths from older age programs are actively encouraged to assist as Cub leaders. In The Scout Association in the UK and in its branches such as in Australia, these were originally called Cub Instructors. Scouts Australia now uses the term Youth Helper for such persons, whilst in the United Kingdom they are called Young Leaders. In Canada, a Scout who assists in the Cub program is designated as a Kim. In the United States, the term Den Chief is used.

In many European countries (especially where the Jungle theme still has a strong part in the program), St. Francis of Assisi is the patron saint of Cubs, because of his relationship with wolves.

==Cubs in national organizations==

===Australia===

====Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association====
The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association in Australia operate a &quot;Wolf Cub&quot; program between its Koalas&#x27; program and Boy Scout. Wolf Cub packs are themed on &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, a friend of Baden-Powell. Wolf Cub packs are divided into Sixes, with each six being identified by a coloured triangular patch on the shoulder of the Cub&#x27;s shirt. Each Six is led by a &quot;Sixer&quot; and a &quot;Seconder&quot;, who have their rank indicated by horizontal yellow stripes sewn onto their left arm.

====Scouts Australia====
In Scouts Australia, the Cubs program is open to all children (girls and boys) ages 8–11. The uniform is a navy blue, button-up or polo-style, short-sleeved shirt with a yellow collar, sleeves and shoulders. Patrols are identified by a coloured band/ring (red, yellow, green, orange, blue, black, white, grey, tan, purple) worn around their scarf, above their woggle. Patrol Leaders wear a second band/ring on the other side of their scarf which is white with two blue stripes. They are supported by their Assistant Patrol Leader, who will step into the leadership role if the Patrol Leader is away, and will help at Unit Councils. They wear a white band/ring with one blue stripe.

Together, the Patrol Leaders and Assistant Patrol Leaders from every patrol make up the Unit Council. They take a leading role in planning and running activities.

===Austria===
In Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs Cubs is the program for children between the ages of 7 and 10. The jungle theme is the symbolic framework. The first pack was started in the autumn of 1920 in Vienna. In the beginning, there were different symbolic frameworks: red Indians (taken from &quot;Kibbo Kift&quot; written by John Hargrave) and Robinson Crusoe. In the 1930s the Jungle theme was introduced.

===Canada===
In 1916, the Wolf Cubs program was introduced as part of Scouts Canada with a program following that of its UK parent organization, The Scout Association. Cubs is open to youth of both sexes, ages 8 to 10 inclusive. Sixes wear a coloured triangular patch, rather than a distinctive woggle. (If brown, for example, the six is known as Brown Six.) The Cub motto is &quot;Do Your Best&quot; and the promise, the vow recited in opening ceremonies is: 
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;I promise to do my best, 
to do my duty to God and the King, 
to keep the law of the Wolfcub pack, 
and do a good turn every day.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The tradition of Cubs in Hong Kong was inherited from the Hong Kong branch of The Scout Association of the United Kingdom. It is the largest program of the Scout Movement in Hong Kong. A Pack is headed by a Cub Leader (團長), with several Assistant Cub Leaders (副團長) and Instructors (教練員). The division within a Pack is called a Six (小隊). Each Six has a Sixer (隊長) and a Seconder (隊副 or 副隊長). Each Six is distinguished by a colour and is named after it. Each Cub of the Six wears a woggle with the colour of his Six. The Promise and Law for Cubs are simplified. Traditionally, the logo of the Wolf Cub denotes the Cub but it is rarely used.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the program is known as both Cubs and Macaoimh, depending on the tradition from which the particular Scout troop comes.

=== Italy ===

===Netherlands===

The jungle theme is the symbolic framework of the &quot;Welpen&quot; (Cubs). Welpen wear green uniforms. Among a &quot;horde&quot; (&quot;pack&quot;) of Cubs, the cubs are divided into &quot;nesten&quot; (&quot;nests&quot;). Each nest has a &quot;Gids&quot; (Guide) and a &quot;Helper&quot;. Like all age programs, &quot;Welpen&quot; is open to both boys and girls, but Scout Groups can have single-sex units. Starting in 2010, the symbolic framework of the Welpen will be based on a modified version of the Jungle Book with two main characters: the boy Mowgli and the girl Shanti. The new &quot;Welpen&quot; program will gradually replace the four programs in the age group Scouting Nederland had before &quot;Welpen&quot;, &quot;Kabouters&quot; (Brownies), &quot;Dolfijnen&quot; (&quot;Dolphins&quot;) and &quot;Esta&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Dolfijnen&quot; has a water-based symbolic framework, and &quot;Esta&#x27;s&quot; has a specially developed co-ed symbolic framework. The new Welpen contains elements from all four previous age programs.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, the Cubs program largely follows that of the United Kingdom, though it is administered under the main Scouts New Zealand association. The Cubs program is for children aged 8 to 11 years. They meet weekly at their Scout Hall and take part in all sorts of activities. There are approximately 410 scout groups in New Zealand, all of which have a cub program, typically along with other programs for younger kids (Keas) and older Scouts, Venturers and Rovers. Scouts New Zealand Sections .

===Poland===

In the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, Cubs and Brownies&#x27; program is called &quot;zuchy&quot; and is open to children ages 6–10. Cubs are organized into packs where they learn to integrate into a collective of friends. Any kind of learning is accomplished by playing games. They can earn three Cub Stars &quot;Gwiazdki zuchowe&quot; and a lot of individual and group merit badges.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the junior program of the Singapore Scout Association was known as the Cadet Scouts (from a junior program pre-dating Cubs) until 2005 when it was renamed to Cubs in line with international practice.

The Cubs&#x27; age range is from 7–12 and they use the Jungle Book Theme. Each Cub Pack is led by a Cub Leader assisted by Asst. Cub Leaders. Packs are subdivided into small groups of six cubs, called Sixes. Sixes are led by the Sixer and the Asst. Sixer. Most Cub Packs in Singapore are affiliated with schools and the teachers are the Cub Leaders and Asst. Cub Leaders. Some parents are also involved and actively serve as Volunteer Adult Leaders (VAL).

The highest Award for a Cub is the Akela Award. It is awarded to Cubs who complete the badge scheme and assessment criteria.

===United Kingdom===

====Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association====

The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association operate a &quot;Wolf Cub&quot; program between Beavers and Scouts. Wolf Cub packs are themed on &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, a friend of Baden-Powell. Wolf Cub packs are divided into Sixes, with each six being identified by a coloured triangular patch on the shoulder of the Cub&#x27;s sleeve. Each Six is led by a &quot;Sixer&quot; and a &quot;Seconder&quot;, who have their rank indicated by horizontal yellow stripes sewn onto their left arm.

====British Boy Scouts====
The British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association allows the use of the Wolf Cubs program as an alternative to its Junior Scout program.

====The Scout Association====

In the Scout Association, Sixes are led by a &quot;Sixer&quot; and have a &quot;Seconder&quot; (or &quot;Second&quot;) as a backup. The Sixer wears two stripes on his/her uniform and the Seconder one stripe. When a Cub is made a Sixer, the Second&#x27;s badge (with one stripe) should be removed and replaced with the Sixer&#x27;s badge. The Cubs of a six are distinguished by the colour of the woggle they wear on their Group neckerchief (known elsewhere as a Group scarf).

The three points of the fleur-de-lys, Scout salute and Scout sign remind the Cub of the three points of the Cub&#x27;s Promise: &quot;Duty to God and King, Helpfulness to other people, and Obedience to the Cub Law.&quot;
===United States===
====Boy Scouts of America====

Cub Scouting is a division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Starting in 1918, several experiments operated until 1930, when the first official Cub packs were registered. Today, it is a family program for children in kindergarten through fifth grade, with each den admitting boys, girls or coed through 4th grade and single gender for 5th grade. Parents, leaders, and organizations work together to achieve the purposes of Cubs. Families are a core part of Cubs and are included in many activities. Currently, Cubs is the largest of the BSA&#x27;s three divisions.

====Baden-Powell Service Association====
In the Baden-Powell Service Association, the corresponding program for this age group is called Timberwolves. As with the Scout Association, each pack is divided into Sixes led by a &quot;Sixer&quot; with a &quot;Seconder&quot; assisting. The Pack retains Baden-Powell&#x27;s original &quot;Jungle Book&quot; theme, with its leader called Akela and assistant leaders using names like Raksha, Bagheera, or Baloo.

<doc id="403545" wikidata="Q110267513" url="?curid=403545" title="Great Officers of State">
<text>Government in medieval monarchies generally comprised the king&#x27;s companions, later becoming the royal household, from which the officers of state arose, initially having household and government duties. Later some of these officers became two: one serving state and one serving household. They were superseded by new officers, or were absorbed by existing officers. Many of the officers became hereditary and thus removed from practical operation of either the state or the household.

Especially in the Norman kingdoms these offices will have common characteristics. In the United Kingdom, the Great Officers of State are traditional ministers of The Crown who either inherit their positions or are appointed to exercise certain largely ceremonial functions or to operate as members of the government. Separate Great Officers of State exist for England and for Scotland, as well as formerly for Ireland. It was the same in the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples. Many of the Great Officers became largely ceremonial because historically they were so influential that their powers had to be resumed by the Crown or dissipated.

==England==
==France==
==Holy Roman Empire==

Princes elector held a &quot;High Office of the Empire&quot; () analogous to a modern Cabinet office and were members of the ceremonial Imperial Household. The three spiritual electors were Arch-Chancellors (, ): the Archbishop of Mainz was Arch-Chancellor of Germany, the Archbishop of Cologne was Arch-Chancellor of Italy, and the Archbishop of Trier was Arch-Chancellor of Burgundy. The six remaining were secular electors, who were granted augmentations to their arms reflecting their position in the Household. These augments were displayed either as an inset badge, as in the case of the Arch Steward, Treasurer, and Chamberlain—or dexter, as in the case of the Arch Marshal and Arch Bannerbearer. Or, as in the case of the Arch Cupbearer, the augment was integrated into the escutcheon, held in the royal Bohemian lion&#x27;s right paw.

==Hungary==

In the Kingdom of Hungary the Great Officers of State were non-hereditary court officials originally appointed by the king, later some of them were elected by the Diet. They were also called the barons of the kingdom () and lords banneret because they were obliged to lead their own &quot;Banderium&quot; (military unit) under their own banner in times of war. The offices gradually got separated from the role they originally fulfilled and their deputies took over the responsibilities. 

==Ireland==
==Poland==
The following dignitaries were permanent members of the council in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland:
* 

==Scotland==

As of 2023, the Scottish Great Officers of State are as follows:

==Sicily==

===History===
In the Kingdom of Sicily, which existed from 1130 to 1816, the Great Officers were officials of the Crown who inherited an office or were appointed to perform some mainly ceremonial functions or to act as members of the government. In particular, it was a Norman king, Roger II, who once he became King of Sicily and conquered the territories of Southern Italy was concerned with organizing the Kingdom politically. For this reason, in 1140, King Roger convened a Parliament in Palermo where the seven most important offices of the Kingdom of Sicily were established, to which the title of &quot;archons&quot; was given.

The system has notable similarities with the English one, being both derived from Norman rulers, in which four of them had a certain correspondence with the officers of the court of the Franks, where there was a &quot;senescalk&quot;, a &quot;marchäl&quot;, a &quot;kämmerer&quot;, a &quot;kanzlèr&quot;; later reverted with the Great Officers of the Kingdom of France.

With the &quot;pragmatic&quot; of November 6, 1569, on the reforms of the Courts, three Great Offices of the Kingdom are made the prerogative of the judiciary: the Great Chancellor by President of the Tribunal of the Sacred Royal Conscience; the Great Justiciar, whose functions had already been absorbed by President of the Tribunal of the Royal grand Court; and the Great Chamberlain by the President of the Tribunal of Royal Patrimony.

===Officers of State===
The Great Officers of State of the former Kingdom of Sicily, consisting of Sicily and Malta, were:

<text>Oshin of Korikos (or Corycos) (died 1329) served as regent of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia from 1320 to 1329. He was the son of the historian Hayton of Korikos. He became regent for Leo IV on the death of King Oshin in 1320, whom he was rumoured to have poisoned. Oshin was also probably responsible for the deaths of King Oshin&#x27;s sister Princess Isabella of Armenia and two of her sons, in order to remove rival claimants.

Oshin married twice:

*First, Margaret d&#x27;Ibelin, who bore him one daughter, Alice, who married King Leo IV of Armenia.
*Second, King Oshin&#x27;s widow, Jeanne of Anjou. Oshin of Korikos and Jeanne had a daughter, Marie, who consecutively married two Armenian Kings of Cilicia, Constantine V and Constantine VI.

Oshin and his daughter Alice (Leo&#x27;s wife) were assassinated in 1329 at the behest of Leo IV.

<text>&quot;Fat Butt and Pancake Head&quot; (also known as &quot;Jennifer-Lopez-Mania&quot;) is the fifth episode of the seventh season and the 101st overall episode of the Comedy Central series &quot;South Park&quot;. It was originally broadcast on April 16, 2003.

In the episode, Jennifer Lopez is enraged to learn that a new Latina singer also named Jennifer Lopez (but in actuality is just Cartman&#x27;s hand) has stolen her record deal and her boyfriend Ben Affleck.

==Plot==

South Park Elementary holds a cultural diversity event in which Kyle Broflovski gives a report on the role of Latinos in American technology. A board of Latino community leaders (who are the judges) seem pleased with Kyle&#x27;s report. Eric Cartman goes on stage to report on the effect of Latino culture on the arts in America. He says he has a special guest, Jennifer Lopez. However, it turns out to merely be a ventriloquist act with Cartman&#x27;s hand acting as the head of &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; (reminiscent of Señor Wences) who is a Hispanic stereotype in every way. Despite this offensive display, the judges inexplicably give him first place for having the best report, and he wins a $20 gift certificate at the mall. This angers Kyle, as he thinks Cartman&#x27;s speech is racist and immature, and while Kyle had spent weeks laboring over his speech, it is implied that Cartman spent very little time in preparation.

Cartman further angers Kyle by insisting that &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; has a mind of her own. When the children go to the mall, Cartman—at the apparent behest of &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot;—pays ten dollars to record a music video at a recording store. The video gets sent to the record company, proving a success and propelling &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; to stardom. However, the executives agree that &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; has too many similarities to the &quot;actual&quot; Jennifer Lopez and decide to replace the more difficult human performer with the puppet because they cannot have two Jennifer Lopezes.

When the actual Jennifer Lopez is directly told by the executives in a meeting that &quot;we&#x27;re firing you&quot;, she is infuriated, especially when she learns that her job has been replaced by a literal puppet. Jennifer Lopez and her husband-to-be, Ben Affleck, show up at South Park Elementary in a limousine. Lopez starts to beat up Cartman&#x27;s hand until he pleads that he will stop his ventriloquist act. As the two celebrities leave, Affleck catches sight of &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; and falls in love with her. The tension between Cartman and the hand-puppet escalates as &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; forces him to do things her way. As the episode progresses, the relationship between Cartman and &quot;Miss Lopez&quot; begins to grow more surreal, with Cartman and &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; arguing (with both their voices being heard simultaneously) and &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; acting independently while Cartman is asleep.

Affleck invites &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; for a ride in his car. Cartman reluctantly agrees. Later &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; lets Ben make out with her, then she performs oral sex on him. Cartman looks down, sees what &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; (his hand) is doing, and, infuriated, departs the car quickly. The next morning Cartman awakes to find in his bed a naked Affleck, with &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; announcing that they had made love all night and are getting married.

The news of the wedding again angers the actual Jennifer Lopez as she attempts to kill &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot;. Cartman runs. On a bridge, Jennifer Lopez, the police, Ben Affleck, the people from the recording company, Kyle, Kenny and Stan catch up with Cartman and &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot;. Everyone (except the boys) starts to argue about &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot;. &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot; screams for everyone to be quiet. Cartman removes her hair and &quot;Ms. Lopez&quot;, in a male voice, makes the confession that her real name is Mitch Conner, a con man who has been moving around from town to town. Conner apologizes to Ben for playing with his heart and states that he will die because he has recently consumed a cyanide pill. Conner then &quot;dies&quot; (Cartman makes it look like he &quot;flutters away&quot; into the wind), and everyone goes away except for the boys.

Kyle then asks Cartman to explain Mitch Conner. Cartman says, &quot;Look, I don&#x27;t care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn&#x27;t it possible, just possible, that something I don&#x27;t understand happened here?&quot; When Kyle admits that it&#x27;s possible, Cartman starts singing, &quot;Ha ha ha ha haa haa! I got you guys, kinda! I got you guys, kinda!&quot;, much to Kyle&#x27;s dismay. The episode ends with Jennifer Lopez working at a La Taco restaurant while on probation. She complains she had six platinum records and starred in five Hollywood movies. The Mexican worker next to her responds, &quot;Yeah, me too.&quot;

==Legacy==
* Cartman&#x27;s ventriloquist act of Mitch Conner/Jennifer Lopez returned in the season 14 episodes &quot;200&quot; and &quot;201&quot;. It also returned in the video game &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot;, with both Cartman and later Kyle in control of Mitch Connor. It is revealed here that Cartman is, in fact, in total control of Mitch.
* In the commentary, Trey Parker has stated that this episode has his favorite ending because it is so surreal and &quot;you don&#x27;t even know if Cartman is lying or not&quot;.
* In &quot;South Park&quot;″s season 7 commentary, Parker recalls that five months after the episode aired, he &quot;heard from some friends that were on a set of a Jennifer Lopez movie she was doing and they said that when she would walk by, some of the lower people like the PAs would say, &#x27;Oooh tacos, I love tacos…&#x27;. And that she got so mad and had to fire people… But she kept hearing it in the distance&quot;.

<doc id="403557" wikidata="Q2662467" url="?curid=403557" title="Naranjo">
<text>Naranjo (Wak Kab&#x27;nal in Mayan) is a Pre-Columbian Maya city in the Petén Basin region of Guatemala. It was occupied from about 500 BC to 950 AD, with its height in the Late Classic Period. The site is part of Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park. The city lies along the Mopan and Holmul rivers, and is about 50 km east of the site of Tikal. Naranjo has been the victim of severe looting. The site is known for its polychrome ceramic style.

&quot;Naranjo&quot; in Spanish means &quot;orange tree&quot;, which is a Spanish translation of the Mayan name Wak Kab&#x27;nal. The emblem glyph of the Naranjo is transliterated as Sa&#x27;aal “the place where (maize) gruel abounds.” The Naranjo dynastic rulers are said to be the &quot;Holy Lords of Sa&#x27;aal.&quot;

== Layout of site ==
The area of Naranjo covers at least 8 km2 with the urban center covering about 2.25 km2. There are currently 389 recorded buildings in the central area and over 900 around the center.

The epicenter consists of six triadic complexes, two ballcourts, two palace compounds, and one E-group. C-9 is the largest triadic complex in the city. Structure C-9 is the complexes main pyramid, and the Largest at the site. Because it occupies the top of a natural hill with a cave located inside, it is a perfect place to be categorized as a ‘sacred mountain’.

A hieroglyphic stairway, that is believed to have been taken from Caracol, was added to structure B-18 sometime in the seventh century AD.

== Archaeological preservation work ==

The site was first mapped and photographed by Teoberto Maler in 1905, who was sent by The Peabody Museum of Harvard University. In 1908 Maler excavated the hieroglyphic stairway from structure B-18, parts of which are now housed in the British Museum in London. In the 1910s, further investigations of the site were made by Sylvanus G. Morley and Oliver Ricketson.

Investigations of the site of Xunantunich suggests that it was part of Naranjo&#x27;s realm.

By the 1920s, many of the ancient sculptures had already disappeared. The problem worsened in the 1960s, when many of the site&#x27;s large sculptures were smashed into fragments by looters in order to sneak them out of the country.

In 1972-1973, 19 stela were taken from Naranjo by the Department of Prehispanic Monuments of the IDAEH to be protected from looters.

From 1997 to 2001 the site was controlled by looters. From 2002 to 2004, a project was undertaken to evaluate the extent of the looting which found about 270 tunnels and trenches. Archaeologist Vilma Fialko has been instrumental in this project.

A conservation project by the Ministry of Culture and Sport began in 2002. In 2006 Naranjo was added to the World Monuments Watch.

In 2013, a building from about 600 AD was found at nearby Holmul with a giant stucco frieze showing a central ruler and two flanking ones in repose. The frieze is very well preserved. Below it runs a long inscription from which it appears that the construction was commissioned by Aj Wosal of Naranjo. At the time, Naranjo was subordinated to the Kaanul dynasty of Dzibanche and Calakmul.

== History ==

The history of Naranjo includes several major disturbances in the dynastic rule when allegiances and identities of local kings were subject to change. Texts at the site record a mythical founding of the city by its patron god.

Not much is known about the site before the ruler Ah Wosaaj Chan Kʼinich who came to power in 546 AD. The sites of La Sufricaya and Holmul to the north of Naranjo were involved in the establishment of the new political order in Peten after the arrival of Sihyaj K’ahk&#x27; in AD 378. It is plausible to assume that Naranjo might also be under the sway of Sihyaj Kʼahk&#x27;s hegemony and later Tikal rulers. If there were any monuments from that time, they were destroyed and/or cached.

In 546 AD Naranjo came under the control of Calakmul whose ruler Tuun Kab Hix appointed Ah Wosaaj Chan Kʼinich. This was a deliberate move by Calakmul to take allies away from Tikal. Ah Wosaaj was involved in infrastructure improvements to the city such as the paving of a road in July 559, according to Altar 2. 

In 626 two attacks were made on Naranjo by Caracol. Naranjo was then retaken by Calakmul in 631. During the administration of K&#x27;ahk&#x27; Xiiw Chan Chaahk, Naranjo defeated Caracol in a &quot;star war&quot; sending Caracol into a hiatus period, but by 680 Caracol had apparently recovered and eliminated K&#x27;ahk&#x27; Xiiw.

In 682 AD, Calakmul sent Wak Chanil Ajaw (Lady Six Sky}, possibly Ix Wak Chan Jalam Lem in ancient Maya, to reestablish the Naranjo dynasty. Her arrival is written on Stela 24 found in front of Structure C-7. Lady Six Sky was the daughter of the Dos Pilas ruler Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil. While never officially made a ruler, Lady Six Sky performed as a ruler, possibly as regent for her son Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Chaak who acceded in 693 AD at the age of five. This relationship is made explicit on Naranjo Stela 46. Between 693 and 698 AD Naranjo carried out a series of at least eight attacks, likely under the auspices of Lady Six Sky, defeating Tikal in 695 AD and Ucanal in 698 AD. K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Chaak began another series of attacks in 706 AD including the defeat of Yaxha in 710 AD. Lady Six Sky died in 741 AD. She is depicted on stelae including 3, 18, 24, 29, and 31.

Naranjo was defeated by Tikal in 744 AD and the ruler, Yax Mayuy Chan Chaak, was taken captive and likely sacrificed during Tikal&#x27;s victory celebrations. However, this wasn&#x27;t the end of the city&#x27;s written history. Later kings include Itzamnaaj? K&#x27;awiil, who fought against Yaxha and, in 790, repaved the road established by Ah Wosaaj, according to Altar 2. 

Naranjo&#x27;s final abandonment may have been the result of political turmoil and a severe drought dated to 810 AD.

<doc id="403558" wikidata="Q11084057" url="?curid=403558" title="Daf">
<text>Daf (), also known as dâyere and riq, is a Middle Eastern (mainly Iranian) frame drum musical instrument, used in popular and classical music in South and Central Asia. It is also used in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, many regions of Georgia, Armenia, Pakistan as well as in parts of India and Russian polar regions. It is also popular among Balkans, Caucasians, Bukharan Jews, Kurds, and Macedonians.

Daf is the national musical instrument of Pakistan and is also depicted on the reverse and obverse of the Azerbaijani 1 qəpik coin and 1 manat banknote respectively, since 2006.

It traditionally has a round wooden frame (although in the modern era it may also be made of metal), jingles, and a thin, translucent head made of fish- or goat-skin (or, more recently, a synthetic material). 

The sound is produced by hitting the membrane with either hand – the left hand, which also holds the daf, strikes the edges, and the right hand strikes the center. The right-hand fingers are fastened about their neighbours and suddenly released, like the action of finger-snapping, to produce loud, rapid, sharp sounds.

==History ==

The Pahlavi (Middle Persian) name of the daf is dap. 

Some pictures of daf have been found in paintings that date before the Common Era. The presence of the Iranian daf in the 6th–5th century BCE Behistun Inscription suggests that it existed before the rise of Islam and Sufism. 

Iranian music has always been a spiritual tool. 

It shows that daf played an important role in Mazdean Iran emerging as an important element during the Sassanian period, during the Kâvusakân dynasty. 

Also, there is a kind of square frame drum in the stonecutting of Taq-e Bostan (another famous monument located 5km northeast of Kermanshah city). These frame drums were played in the ancient Middle East, Greece, and Rome and reached medieval Europe through Islamic culture.
Nowruz (the first day of the Iranian New Year and the national festival of the Iranian people) and other festive occasions have been accompanied by daf in the Sassanid periods (224 AD–651 AD). In this period the daf was played in order to accompany Iranian classical music. 

Dafs were likely used in the court to be played in the modes and melodies of traditional music. This traditional or classical music was created by Barbod the Great and was named the &quot;khosravani&quot; after the mythical king Khosrow II.

Recent research reveals that these modes were used in the recitation of Mazdean (Zoroastrian) prayers. The modes were passed down from master to student and are today known as the &quot;radif&quot; and &quot;dastgāh&quot; system. 

Many of the melodies were lost, but most of those that remain date to the Sassanid period. Dafs can be played to produce highly complex and intense rhythms, causing one to go under a trance and reach an ecstatic and spiritually-high state. For this reason, they have always been connected with religion in Iran.
An engraved bronze cup from Lorestan at the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, portrays a double ney (end-blown reed pipes), chang (harp), and a daf in a shrine or court processional, as similarly documented in Egypt, Elam, and the Persian province of Babylonia, where music was arranged for performance by large orchestral ensembles.

The Arabs introduced the daf and other Middle Eastern musical instruments to Spain, and the Spanish adapted and promoted the daf and other musical instruments (such as the guitar) in medieval Europe. In the 15th century, the daf was only used in Sufi ceremonies; the Ottomans reintroduced it to Europe in the 17th century.

The daf still functions as an important part of Iranian music (both traditional and classical) as it did in ancient times. It successfully encourages many young Iranians to take up learning this ancient instrument.

Daf, and its smaller version called &quot;dafli&quot;, is also used across India. It is believed to have arrived along with other Persian influences in the medieval era, and is a popular folk instrument. In southern India, its use became mainstream, especially in protests, during the early half of the 20th century. Since the 1950s, it has also been used prominently in Bollywood.

=== In Islam ===
In some forms of Islam, daf holds special importance because some Muslims believe that it is the only musical instrument which is permitted to be used. Other Muslims believe musical instruments in general are allowed, not exclusively the daf. 

The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, did not impose a total prohibition on using the daf, stating that it is permissible during Eid, a wedding Walima, or to greet a government official after they arrive from a journey. 

It has always been an important part of Islamic Sufi music.

==Structure and construction==
The jingles, which are thin metal plates or rings, are attached to hooks in three or four rectangular holes in the circular wooden frame. 

The drumhead is made of fish or goat skin. The width of the frame is and the depth, . In order to bend the frame, the wood (&quot;buka&quot;, &quot;orev&quot;) may be softened in water before being bent around a hot metal cylinder. The frame is closed by gluing the ends together. Finally, the skin is attached to the frame by fixing it with another wooden frame or by using nails. 

Another variation is to have the ring-style jingles arranged around the edge of the inside of the drum the whole way around or to have several tiers half way around the inside edge.

<doc id="403561" wikidata="Q4261519" url="?curid=403561" title="MGM Grand fire">
<text>The MGM Grand fire occurred on Friday, November 21, 1980, at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (later Bally’s, now Horseshoe Las Vegas, and unrelated to the current MGM Grand Las Vegas), located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The fire killed 85 people, most through smoke inhalation. The fire began from a refrigerated pastry display case in one of the restaurants, located on the first floor. Fire engulfed the resort&#x27;s casino, and smoke travelled into the hotel tower.

The tragedy remains the deadliest disaster in Nevada history, and the third-deadliest hotel fire in modern U.S. history, after the 1946 Winecoff Hotel fire in Atlanta that killed 119 people and the 1986 Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto Rico that killed 97. The incident led to the reformation of fire safety guidelines and codes in the state.

==Fire==

At the time of the fire, about 5,000 people were in the MGM Grand, a casino and 26-story hotel with more than 2,000 hotel rooms that had opened in 1973. At approximately 7:07 a.m. on Friday, November 21, 1980, a fire began in a restaurant known as The Deli. The fire was discovered during an inspection of the restaurant by a tile crew. A crew supervisor noticed a flickering light, which turned out to be a wall of flames. An employee of the hotel&#x27;s bakery recounted how just after 7 a.m. he saw smoke coming from the ceiling vents just before the lights went out. MGM security was immediately advised of the situation, and alerted the Clark County Fire Department (CCFD) which was the first agency to respond. CCFD received a call reporting the fire at 7:17 a.m., with the first engine arriving on site from across the street at 7:19 a.m. A third alarm was called at 7:22 am, and a Metro Police helicopter pilot requested all available helicopters at 7:30 a.m.

Other agencies included the North Las Vegas Fire Department, Las Vegas Fire &amp; Rescue, and the Henderson Fire Department. A massive helicopter rescue effort from Nellis Air Force Base pulled 1,000 people from the roof of the MGM Grand, involving both U.S. Air Force UH-1N (Hueys) from the 57th Wing based in Indian Springs and CH-3E (Jolly Green Giants) from the 1st Special Operations Wing based in Hurlburt Field, Florida (which were in Nevada to participate in Red Flag &#x27;80).

The fire spread to the lobby, fed by wallpaper, PVC piping, glue, and plastic mirrors, racing west through the casino floor at a speed of until a massive fireball blew out the main entrance, facing the Las Vegas Strip. From the time the fire was noticed, it took six minutes for the entire casino floor to be fully engulfed. It spread across the areas of the casino in which no fire sprinklers were installed. Eighteen people died in the casino level of the hotel.
The fire was limited to the first floor, but the burning material created toxic fumes and smoke, which ascended throughout the hotel tower via vertical shafts (elevators and stairwells) and seismic joints, causing the majority of the deaths. Approximately 350 firefighters responded to the fire, and some reported having to crawl through the dark and over &quot;mounds of stuff&quot; trying to extinguish the fire. It was later determined that the &quot;mounds&quot; were deceased guests and staff near an elevator bank. The Las Vegas fire department operated separately from the county fire department; the latter served the Las Vegas Strip, so city firefighters were unfamiliar with the MGM&#x27;s layout, including fire escape routes. This hindered the rescue effort.

Proper evacuation of the hotel guests was also hindered as there was no automatic means of returning elevators to the main floor during a fire, causing 10 deceased victims to be found in an elevator. Some hotel guests tied bedsheets together and hung them on balconies to alert first responders. Some tried using the bedsheets to descend the hotel&#x27;s exterior. Fire ladders were only able to reach the ninth-floor exterior. One man escaped the hotel tower by lowering himself down a rope.

Some people, trapped in their hotel rooms, broke open their windows to get fresh air, although this allowed thicker smoke from outside to come into the rooms. People below had to dodge shards of glass falling from the broken hotel windows. An expansion of the MGM was underway at the time of the fire, and a construction worker used a scaffolding platform to lower guests to the ground, after they had escaped through their hotel room windows. The Barbary Coast casino across the street was set up as an evacuation center for MGM guests.

=== Victims ===
Survivors include Donn Arden and Margaret Kelly.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1988-07-15-li-7069&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 85 people were killed, including 78 guests and 7 employees. Seventy-five people died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning; four from smoke inhalation alone; three from burns and smoke inhalation; one from burns alone; one of myocarditis; and one from massive skull trauma caused by a fall while attempting to escape the fire.

While the fire primarily damaged the casino floor, approximately 64 deaths occurred on the upper levels of the hotel (mostly from the 20th to 25th floors), where the smoke concentration was the highest. One young couple died in their sleep. Two refrigerated semi-trailers were set up as temporary morgues to hold the bodies of victims until they could be identified.

The number of injuries was reported as being around 600 or more than 700. Approximately 35 firefighters sought medical care, and 15 of them were hospitalized for periods ranging from one day to two weeks. Between 200 and 300 firefighters also experienced dizziness, headaches, and rhinitis in the days after the fire, but did not seek medical attention.

==Cause==
The fire was confined to the casino and restaurant areas. The hotel was not equipped with a fire sprinkler system. The area with the most fire prevention was in the money counting area, not in individual rooms or on the casino floor. The county&#x27;s fire chief had been concerned that such a fire could occur, as older hotels built prior to 1979 were not required to have certain fire safety features. Nevada governor Robert List said, &quot;You can&#x27;t force people to bring hotels up to codes that didn&#x27;t exist when they were built.&quot; For years after its opening, the resort had declined orders to install a second fire hose in one of its showrooms. As of June 1980, only 20 percent of fire safety violations – discovered two months earlier by inspectors – had been corrected.

=== Electric fire ===
The fire was caused by an electrical ground fault inside a wall-mounted electrical receptacle.

A refrigerated pastry display case was added, after original construction of the hotel, to one of its restaurants (known as The Deli). Unlike a modern display case, which would be totally self-contained (compressor installed in bottom of display case), this unit functioned like a walk-in cooler or central air conditioning system, with a pair of copper refrigerant lines connecting its evaporator to a condensing unit located outside the building. When this set-up was installed, the copper lineset was run through the same wall soffit as a pre-existing electrical conduit and in physical contact with the conduit.

The fan-forced evaporator unit in the display case was not properly secured, and thus was able to vibrate constantly while in operation; these vibrations were carried along the copper refrigerant lines, causing the pipes to rub against the electrical conduit in the wall soffit and make them vibrate as well. Galvanic corrosion occurred, in which the copper refrigerant pipes were in physical contact with the aluminum electrical conduit, causing the conduit to erode over time. Galvanic corrosion and vibration – as well as jagged edges and stretched wires resulting from poor workmanship during the installation – eventually resulted in the electrical wires inside the conduit missing chunks of their plastic insulation. The conduit was rendered un-grounded (there was no separate ground wire; the metal conduit itself was designed to function as the ground, so the disintegration of the conduit rendered the system un-grounded).

These now-bare electrical conductors inside the un-grounded metal conduit glowed red-hot and began arcing, which ignited the fire. The fire reportedly smoldered for hours until it found fresh oxygen and burst into a fireball that spread into the casino, and was fed by other combustibles.

=== Spread of smoke ===
Due to faulty smoke dampers within the ventilation duct network, the toxic fumes circulated throughout the hotel&#x27;s air conditioning system, accelerating the spread of the poisonous gases. The continued operation of the resort&#x27;s ventilation system contributed to the fire&#x27;s harmful effect. On the casino floor, there was no outlet for the smoke, which was spread into the hotel tower by the ventilation system. Smoke rapidly filled the resort&#x27;s telephone switchboard room, and operators there only had enough time to warn people on the casino floor. Hotel guests were not notified of the fire, as the switchboard operators had to evacuate. The elevator shafts were located above the restaurant and casino, which also helped the smoke to spread. Guests, who earlier had found that the fire doors in some stairwells locked automatically, had propped them open for convenience. However, this allowed more smoke to spread.

==Sprinkler rule exceptions==
Sprinklers were located on the first two floors and the top floor of the resort. The casino and restaurants were not protected by a fire sprinkler system because they were exempt from rules requiring sprinklers in areas occupied 24 hours a day. A Clark County building inspector granted the exemption—despite the opposition of fire marshals—reasoning that a fire would be quickly noticed by occupants and contained with portable fire extinguishers. When the fire started in The Deli restaurant, it was no longer open 24 hours per day; it was closed at the time of the fire. Although some sprinklers were in the resort, they were not located anywhere near the fire. A full sprinkler system would have cost $192,000. Because of the cost, MGM installed only the minimum number of sprinklers required by the building code at the time of the resort&#x27;s construction.

==Aftermath==
The resort was temporarily closed because of the fire. Much of the damage occurred in the casino, which was charred by the fire. The hotel hallways and stairwells were stained by soot and smoke. Shortly after the fire, some people looted jewelry and blackened money from the resort. State gaming revenues were hurt by the MGM&#x27;s closure, as the resort was one of the largest tax contributors to the local gaming industry. The county lost an estimated $1.7 million ($5.75 million in 2023) because of the closure, and it was estimated that MGM Grand Hotels could face a $1 billion loss because of the fire.

After the fire, the MGM Grand was rebuilt over the next eight months, at a cost of $50 million. It reopened in July 1981, with numerous fire safety features now in place, including the addition of fire sprinklers and an automatic fire alarm system throughout the property. A two-unit computer – one of them a backup – was provided by Johnson Controls to monitor hundreds of locations throughout the MGM, helping to prevent another fire. A similar computer had also been installed at another MGM Grand hotel in Reno, Nevada. The Las Vegas MGM now had more than 30,000 sprinklers, including four in most hotel rooms. The hotel also had 8,000 speakers, including one in each room, allowing for fire safety instructions to be provided to guests in the event of a fire.
The air-conditioning system was heavily modified to prevent smoke from entering hotel rooms, and large exhaust fans were installed, with the capability to rid the hotel of fumes in 10 minutes. Plastic pipes and wires, which contributed to the fire, were removed. A five-minute fire safety program, hosted by Gene Kelly in both English and Spanish, was played on televisions in hotel rooms. Resort officials believed that the MGM was now the safest hotel in the world. A minor incident occurred two weeks after the reopening, and the new safety features worked as planned. Insulation material had begun to smolder because of a welder&#x27;s torch, and this set off automatic alarms.

The original hotel tower, where most of the deaths occurred, continues to operate. A second tower opened in 1981. The MGM Grand was sold in 1986 to Bally Manufacturing, which changed the name to Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas. A new MGM Grand was opened in Las Vegas in 1993, at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue, south of the original MGM. Bally&#x27;s was again renamed in 2022, as Horseshoe Las Vegas.

=== Code changes ===
Within a week of the fire, Governor List formed a commission to determine whether older hotels in the state should be required to adopt newer fire safety rules. On February 10, 1981, just 81 days after the MGM fire, another fire broke out at the Las Vegas Hilton, killing eight people. Due to the two incidents, there was a major reformation of fire safety guidelines and codes. All buildings open to the public in Nevada were required to have fire sprinklers, smoke detectors in rooms and elevators, and exit maps in all hotel rooms. This law went into effect in 1981 and made Nevada a leader in fire safety regulation. It took several years for all buildings to be in compliance.

===Lawsuits===
More than 1,350 legal claims were filed as a result of the fire, and most law firms in the Las Vegas Valley were occupied with these cases. Hundreds of lawsuits were filed against MGM, seeking more than $2 billion in damages. One attorney, representing three local couples against MGM, expressed concern about the reopening, saying that the resort still had defects which could prove harmful in the event of another fire. MGM made numerous settlement deals with the victims in 1983, and a $76 million settlement between MGM and insurance companies was made in 1985. In 1998, there was $440,000 left over in the MGM victim settlement. The remaining money was donated to Clark County victims of fires and burns.

<doc id="403563" wikidata="Q777333" url="?curid=403563" title="Leo IV of Armenia">
<text>Leo IV or Leon IV (, &quot;Levon IV&quot;) (also numbered Leo V; ) (1309 – August 28, 1341) was the last Hethumid king of Cilicia, ruling from 1320 until his death. He was the son of Oshin of Armenia and Isabel of Korikos, and came to the throne on the death of his father. His name is sometimes spelled as Leo or Leon.

He spent his minority under the regency of Oshin of Korikos. During this period, the kingdom was much harassed by Mamluks and Mongols. In 1320, the Egyptian sultan Naser Mohammed ibn Kelaoun invaded and ravaged Christian Armenian Cilicia. In a letter dated July 1, 1322, and sent from Avignon, Pope John XXII reminded Mongol ruler Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan of the alliance of his ancestors with Christians, asking him to intervene in Cilicia. At the same time he advocated that he abandon Islam in favor of Christianity. Mongol troops were sent to Cilicia to support the Armenians, but only arrived after a ceasefire had been negotiated for 15 years between Constantin, patriarch of the Armenians, and the sultan of Egypt.

The regent Oshin had married his stepmother, Joan of Taranto, and Leo was forced to marry Alice Oshin&#x27;s daughter by his first wife, Margaret d&#x27;Ibelin, on August 10, 1321. Oshin murdered a number of members of the royal family to consolidate his own power, and Leo&#x27;s reaction upon reaching his majority in 1329 was violent. Oshin, his brother Constantine, Constable of Armenia and Lord of Lampron, and Leo&#x27;s wife Alice were all murdered on the king&#x27;s orders, Oshin&#x27;s head being sent to the Il-Khan and Constantine&#x27;s head to Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt. Leo had his aunt Isabella, wife of the late Amalric, Lord of Tyre, and two of her sons imprisoned and then executed.

Leo was strongly pro-Western and favored a union of the Armenian and Roman Churches, which deeply displeased the native barons. His second marriage on December 29, 1331 to Constance, daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou, widow of Henry II of Cyprus, further aroused anti-Western sentiment.

In 1337, Al-Nasir Muhammad invaded again, taking the city of Ayas, and Leo was forced to conclude a humiliating truce, surrendering territory and a large indemnity and promising to have no dealings with the West. He spent the last years of his reign holed up in the citadel at Sis, hoping for Western aid which never came. On August 28, 1341 he was murdered by his own barons. His only son by Alice, Hethum, had died before 1331; the barons elected his cousin Constantine II to succeed him.

<text>The Kızılırmak (, Turkish for &quot;Red River&quot;), once known as the Halys River () and Alis River, is the longest river flowing entirely within Turkey. It is a source of hydroelectric power and is not used for navigation.

== Description ==
The Kızılırmak flows for a total of , rising in Eastern Anatolia around , flowing first to the west and southwest until , then forming a wide arch, the &quot;Halys bend&quot;, flowing first to the west, then to the northwest, passing to the northeast of Lake Tuz (&quot;Tuz Gölü&quot; in Turkish), then to the north and northeast, where it is joined by its major tributary, the Delice River (once known in Greek as the Cappadox river) at . After zigzagging to the northwest to the confluence with the Devrez River at , and back to the northeast, it joins the Gökırmak (Sky &quot;River&quot; in Turkish) before finally flowing via a wide delta into the Black Sea northwest of Samsun at . 

The Hittites called the river the Maraššantiya, and it formed the western boundary of Hatti, the core land of the Hittite empire. Until the Roman conquest of Anatolia the Halys River (later renamed the &quot;Kızılırmak&quot; by the Turkish conquerors) served as a natural political boundary in central Asia Minor, first between the kingdom of Lydia and the Persian Empire, and later between the Pontic Kingdom and the Kingdom of Cappadocia. As the site of the Battle of Halys, or the Battle of the Eclipse, on May 28, 585 BC, the river formed the border between Lydia to the west and Media to the east until Croesus of Lydia crossed it to attack Cyrus the Great in 547 BC. He was defeated and Persia expanded to the Aegean Sea.

In the 1st century AD Vespasian combined several provinces, including Cappadocia, to create one large province with its eastern boundary marked by the Euphrates River. This province once again splintered during Trajan″s reign - the newly created province of Cappadocia, bounded by the Euphrates to the East, included Pontus and Lesser Armenia. The Halys River became an interior river and never regained its significance as a political border. In the 130s a governor of Cappadocia wrote: &quot;long ago the Halys River was the boundary between the kingdom of Croesus and the Persian Empire; now it flows under Roman dominion.&quot;

The river&#x27;s water is used to grow rice and in a few areas water buffalo are kept. There are dams on the river at Boyabat, Altınkaya and Derbent. Dams have reduced the flow of sediment to the delta, allowing coastal erosion.

<text>Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam (), is a superhero in American comic books originally published by Fawcett Comics and currently published by DC Comics. Artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. Captain Marvel is the alter-ego of William Joseph &quot;Billy&quot; Batson, a young boy who is granted magical powers by the Wizard by speaking the magic word &quot;SHAZAM!&quot;, an acronym of six &quot;immortal elders&quot;: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury, and transforms into a costumed adult superhero with various superpowers derived from specific attributes of the aforementioned elders. The character battles evil in the form of an extensive rogues&#x27; gallery, most of them working in tandem as the Monster Society of Evil, including primary archenemies Black Adam, Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind. Billy often shares his powers with other children, primarily his sister Mary Batson and their best friend/foster brother Freddy Freeman, who also transform into superheroes and fight crime with Billy as members of the Marvel Family (also known as the Shazam Family or Shazamily). The character also serves as a notable member of several teams, including the Justice League and various other derivatives, Justice Society of America, and the Teen Titans.

Since the character&#x27;s inception, Captain Marvel was once the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even Superman. Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted to film, in a 1941 Republic Pictures serial, &quot;Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot;, with Tom Tyler as Captain Marvel and Frank Coghlan, Jr. as Billy Batson. Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel-related comics in 1953, partly because of a copyright infringement suit from DC Comics alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman. In 1972, Fawcett licensed the character rights to DC, which by 1991 acquired all rights to the entire family of characters. DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their DC Universe and has attempted to revive the property several times, with mixed success. Owing to trademark conflicts over other characters named &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; owned by Marvel Comics, DC has branded and marketed the character using the trademark &quot;Shazam!&quot; since his 1972 reintroduction. DC later renamed the mainline version of the character &quot;Shazam&quot; when relaunching its comic book properties in 2011, and his associates became the &quot;Shazam Family&quot; at this time as well.

DC&#x27;s revival of &quot;Shazam!&quot; has been adapted twice for television by Filmation: as a live-action 1970s series with Jackson Bostwick and John Davey as Captain Marvel and Michael Gray as Billy Batson, and as an animated 1980s series. The 2019 New Line Cinema/Warner Bros. film &quot;Shazam!&quot;, an entry in the DC Extended Universe, stars Zachary Levi as Shazam and Asher Angel as Billy Batson. Levi and Angel return in the sequel, &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods.&quot;

==Publication history==
===Development and inspirations===

After the success of National Comics&#x27; new superhero characters Superman and Batman, Fawcett Publications started its own comics division in 1939, recruiting staff writer Bill Parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled &quot;Flash Comics&quot;. Besides penning stories featuring his creations Ibis the Invincible, the Spy Smasher, the Golden Arrow, Lance O&#x27;Casey, Scoop Smith, and Dan Dare for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes. Each superhero in this team possessed a special power granted to them by a mythological figure.

Fawcett Comics&#x27; executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called &quot;Captain Thunder&quot;. Staff artist Charles Clarence &quot;C. C.&quot; Beck was recruited to design and illustrate Parker&#x27;s story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat cartoony style that became his trademark. &quot;When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett&#x27;s first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were,&quot; Beck told an interviewer. &quot;We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times.&quot;

The first issue of the comic book, printed as both &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 and &quot;Thrill Comics&quot; #1, had a low print run in the fall of 1939 as an ashcan copy created for advertising and trademark purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark &quot;Captain Thunder&quot;, &quot;Flash Comics&quot;, or &quot;Thrill Comics&quot;, because all three names were already in use. Consequently, the book was renamed &quot;Whiz Comics&quot;, and Fawcett artist Pete Costanza suggested changing Captain Thunder&#x27;s name to &quot;Captain Marvelous&quot;, which the editors shortened to &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;. The word balloons in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;.

====Introduction====

&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939. &quot;Captain Marvel,&quot; the comic&#x27;s lead feature, introduced audiences to Billy Batson, an orphaned 12-year-old boy who, by speaking the name of the ancient wizard Shazam, is struck by a magic lightning bolt and transformed into the adult superhero Captain Marvel. Shazam&#x27;s name was an acronym derived from the six immortal elders who grant Captain Marvel his superpowers: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury.

In addition to introducing the main character, his alter ego, and his mentor, Captain Marvel&#x27;s first adventure in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil Doctor Sivana, and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter with station WHIZ. &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; was an instant success, with &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 selling over 500,000 copies. By 1941, he had his own solo series, &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot;, the premiere issue of which (cover-dated March 1941) was written and drawn by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Captain Marvel continued to appear in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot;, as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including &quot;Master Comics&quot;.

Captain Marvel&#x27;s first appearance, &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2, did not have any copyright registration or renewal.

====Inspiration and success at Fawcett====

Inspiration for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources. His visual appearance was modeled after that of Fred MacMurray, a popular American actor of the period, though comparisons with both Cary Grant and Jack Oakie were made as well. Fawcett Publications&#x27; founder, Wilford H. Fawcett, was nicknamed &quot;Captain Billy&quot;, which inspired the name &quot;Billy Batson&quot; as well as Marvel&#x27;s title. Fawcett&#x27;s earliest magazine was titled &quot;Captain Billy&#x27;s Whiz Bang&quot;, which inspired the title &quot;Whiz Comics&quot;. In addition, Fawcett took several of the elements that had made Superman the first popular comic book superhero (super-strength and speed, science-fiction stories, a mild-mannered reporter alter ego) and incorporated them into Captain Marvel. Fawcett&#x27;s circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, &quot;Give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10- or 12-year-old boy rather than a man.&quot;

Through much of the Golden Age of Comic Books, Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium, and his comics outsold all others. &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; sold fourteen million copies in 1944, and was at one point being published bi-weekly with a circulation of 1.3 million copies an issue. Several issues of &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; included a blurb on their covers proclaiming the series the &quot;Largest Circulation of Any Comic Magazine&quot;.

The franchise was expanded to introduce spin-off characters to Captain Marvel between 1941 and 1942. &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #21 (1941) introduced the Lieutenant Marvels: three other boys named &quot;Billy Batson&quot; who could also become adult superheroes. Captain Marvel Jr., the alter-ego of disabled newsboy Freddy Freeman, debuted in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #25 (1941). Mary Marvel, alter-ego of Billy&#x27;s twin sister Mary Batson, first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #18 (1942). In contrast to Captain Marvel and the Lieutenants, both Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. remained kids in superhero form, and were given their own eponymous books in addition to appearing as the lead features in &quot;Master Comics&quot; and &quot;Wow Comics&quot;, respectively. Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel appeared together as a team in another Fawcett publication, &quot;The Marvel Family&quot;. In addition, there was a talking animal spin-off character, Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, which was created in 1942 for Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Funny Animals&quot; comic book and later given an eponymous series as well.

With Bill Parker having been drafted into World War II, chief writing duties on the Captain Marvel-related comics stories went to Otto Binder by 1942. C.C. Beck remained as lead artist, and he and Binder steered the Captain Marvel stories towards a whimsical tone that emphasized comedy and fantasy elements alongside the superhero action. Other artists associated with the Marvel Family at Fawcett included Pete Costanza, Mac Raboy, Marc Swayze, and Kurt Schaffenberger. Otto Binder would write over 900 of the approximately 1,790 Captain Marvel-related stories published by Fawcett. Several of Captain Marvel&#x27;s enduring supporting characters and enemies—including the non-powered Uncle Marvel, Tawky Tawny the talking tiger, and the villains Mister Mind and Black Adam—were created by Binder during the mid-to-late 1940s.

===Copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation===
Detective Comics (later known as National Comics Publications, National Periodical Publications, and today known as DC Comics) sued both Fawcett Comics and Republic Pictures for copyright infringement in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman. After seven years of litigation, &quot;National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.&quot; went to trial in 1948. Although the presiding judge decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their &quot;Superman&quot; daily newspaper strips, and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright. As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, went in Fawcett&#x27;s favor.

National appealed this decision, and Judge Learned Hand declared in 1952 that National&#x27;s Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and this would have to be determined in a retrial. He therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination.

Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett settled with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regard to Captain Marvel. While &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; had been the top-selling comic series during World War II, it suffered declining sales every year after 1945, and, by 1949, it was selling only half its wartime rate. Fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its Captain Marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that had gained popularity at the time.

Feeling that this decline in the popularity of superhero comics meant that it was no longer worth continuing the fight, Fawcett agreed on August 14, 1953, to permanently cease publication of comics with the Captain Marvel-related characters and to pay National $400,000 in damages. Fawcett shut down its comics division in the autumn of 1953 and fired its comic book staff. Otto Binder and Kurt Schaffenberger ended up at DC, becoming prominent members of the creative team for the Superman-related comics from 1954 through the 1960s. Schaffenberger snuck an unauthorized cameo by Captain Marvel into a story in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #42 in 1963.

&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; had ended with issue #155 in June 1953, &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; was canceled with #150 in November 1953, and &quot;The Marvel Family&quot; ended its run with #89 in January 1954. Hoppy the Marvel Bunny was sold to Charlton Comics, where a few Fawcett-era stories from that strip were reprinted as &quot;Hoppy the Magic Bunny&quot;, with all references to &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and &quot;Shazam&quot; removed.

===&quot;Marvelman&quot;/&quot;Miracleman&quot;===

In the 1950s, a small British publisher, L. Miller and Son, published a number of black-and-white reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series. With the outcome of the &quot;National v. Fawcett&quot; lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer, Mick Anglo, who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called Marvelman. Captain Marvel Jr. was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her sex changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word &quot;Shazam!&quot; was replaced with &quot;Kimota&quot; (&quot;Atomik&quot; spelled backwards). The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel&#x27;s United Kingdom series with issue number #25.

&quot;Marvelman&quot; ceased publication in 1963, but the character was revived in 1982 by writer Alan Moore in the pages of &quot;Warrior Magazine&quot;. Beginning in 1985, Moore&#x27;s black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by Eclipse Comics under the new title &quot;Miracleman&quot; (as Marvel Comics objected to the use of &quot;Marvel&quot; in the title), and continued publication in the United States after &quot;Warrior&quot;″s demise. Within the metatextual story line of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman&#x27;s creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Moore and later &quot;Marvelman/Miracleman&quot; writer Neil Gaiman. In 2009, Marvel Comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s &quot;Marvelman&quot; characters and stories, and later purchased the rights to the 1980s version and those reprints in 2013.

===M. F. Enterprises===

In 1966, M. F. Enterprises produced their own Captain Marvel: an android superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts, each of which could move on its own. He triggered the separation by shouting &quot;Split!&quot; and reassembled himself by shouting &quot;Xam!&quot; He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton. This short-lived Captain Marvel was credited in the comic as being &quot;based on a character created by Carl Burgos&quot;. Marvel Comics subsequently created their own character named Captain Marvel in 1967, and Myron Fass sued Marvel for trademark infringement. Fass accepted a $4,500 settlement from Marvel, and Marvel secured the trademark of the name.

===Bill Black&#x27;s attempted revival===

Bill Black attempted to revive Captain Marvel in 1969, but written and drawn in a more realistic Marvel Comics style for his fanzine &quot;Paragon Golden Age Greats, Vol. 1, #2&quot;. However, on the legal advice of his friend and publishing mentor Martin L. Greim, he decided that rather than risk legal trouble with Fawcett Publications it would be better to destroy the entire print run except for two copies that he saved for his personal files. Black then rewrote the story using his own newly created hero Captain Paragon.

===C.C. Beck and Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector===
In 1970, fanzine Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector (RBCC) staffed C.C. Beck, Don Newton, Robert Kline, and Gene Arnold for a special issue called &quot;The Rocket&#x27;s Blast Special 8&quot;. The comic book focuses on Captain Marvel&#x27;s origins and creation through a series of columns by the group where they also discussed their history with Fawcett Publications. Along with new and exclusive art by Beck and Newton, the issue included an opinion piece by the staff strongly criticizing the copyright infringement lawsuit by Detective Comics. The opinion piece was titled &quot;THE DEMISE OF CAPTAIN MARVEL&quot; and is found on the very last page above where the staff still credits the copyright of Captain Marvel to Fawcett Publications.

===DC Comics revival: &quot;Shazam!&quot; (1972–1978)===
When superhero comics became popular again in the mid-1960s in what is now called the &quot;Silver Age of Comic Books&quot;, Fawcett was unable to revive Captain Marvel, having agreed to never publish the character again as part of their 1953 settlement. Looking for new properties to introduce to the DC Comics line, at the urging of Jack Kirby who recently defected from Marvel Comics, DC publisher Carmine Infantino decided to bring the Captain Marvel property back into print. On June 16, 1972, DC entered into an agreement with Fawcett to license the Captain Marvel and Marvel Family characters. Because Marvel Comics had by this time established &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; as a comic book trademark for their own character, created and first published in 1967, DC published their book under the name &quot;Shazam!&quot;. Infantino attempted to give the &quot;Shazam!&quot; book the subtitle &quot;The Original Captain Marvel&quot;, but a cease and desist letter from Marvel Comics forced them to change the subtitle to &quot;The World&#x27;s Mightiest Mortal&quot;, starting with &quot;Shazam!&quot; #15 (December 1974). As all subsequent toys and other merchandise featuring the character have also been required to use the &quot;Shazam!&quot; label with little to no mention of the name &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, the title became so linked to Captain Marvel that many people took to identifying the character as &quot;Shazam&quot; instead of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;.

The &quot;Shazam!&quot; comic series began with &quot;Shazam!&quot; #1 (Feb. 1973). It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s. Dennis O&#x27;Neil was the primary writer of the book. His role was later taken over by writers Elliot S. Maggin and E. Nelson Bridwell. C. C. Beck drew stories for the first 10 issues of the book before quitting because of creative differences. Bob Oksner and Fawcett alumnus Kurt Schaffenberger were among the later artists of the title. As per DC&#x27;s agreement with Fawcett, DC paid Fawcett—and after 1977, its successor CBS Publications—a licensing fee per issue, per page for each of the Fawcett characters who appeared, either in &quot;Shazam!&quot; or crossovers in other comic series.

With DC&#x27;s Multiverse concept in effect during this time, the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of &quot;Earth-S&quot;. The Fawcett material was still considered canon, with the Marvel Family&#x27;s 20-year layoff explained in the comic as time spent in suspended animation due to Doctor Sivana. While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception. The creators themselves had misgivings. Beck said, &quot;As an illustrator, I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings. But I couldn&#x27;t bring the new [Captain Marvel] stories to life no matter how hard I tried&quot;.

&quot;Shazam!&quot; was heavily rewritten as of issue #34 (April 1978), and Bridwell provided more realistic stories, accompanied by similar art; the first issue was drawn by Alan Weiss and Joe Rubinstein, and thereafter by Don Newton, a longtime fan of the character, and Schaffenberger. Nevertheless, the next issue was the last one, though the feature was kept alive in a back-up position in the Dollar Comics-formatted run of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; (from #253, October/November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271, which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story). Schaffenberger left the feature after #259, and the inking credit subsequently varied. When &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; reverted to the standard 36 pages, leftover &quot;Shazam!&quot; material saw publication in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (#491–492, September–October 1982). The remaining 11 issues of that run contained reprints, with &quot;Shazam!&quot; represented by mostly Fawcett-era stories (left out of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #500 and the final #503, where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs).

Outside of their regular series and features, the Marvel Family characters also appeared as guest stars in the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; series, in particular issues #135–137 (vol. 1) for the &quot;Crisis on Earth-S&quot; story arc in 1976. &quot;Limited Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-58 (April 1978) featured a &quot;Superman vs. Shazam!&quot; story by writer Gerry Conway and artists Rich Buckler and Dick Giordano.

Captain Marvel, and often the Marvel Family, also co-starred with Superman in several issues of &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; written by Roy Thomas. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of &quot;Shazam!&quot; and the Justice Society of America characters. The Marvels also guest-starred in several issues of &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, a series centered on the Justice Society and the other Earth-2 characters written by Roy Thomas and his wife Dann. As &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; was set during World War II, several events of the comic fell concurrent with and referenced the events of the original early-1940s Fawcett stories. With their 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries, DC fully integrated the characters into the DC Universe.

===Captain Marvel in the late 1980s===
The first Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 &quot;Legends&quot; miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen&#x27;s and J. M. DeMatteis&#x27; relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from &quot;Legends&quot;), he was given his own miniseries titled &quot;Shazam!: The New Beginning&quot;. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story.

The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.

This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story arc featured in the short-lived anthology &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; #623–626 (October 25, 1988 – November 15, 1988), in which a Neo-Nazi version of Captain Marvel was introduced. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new &quot;Shazam!&quot; ongoing series. Though &quot;New Beginning&quot; had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication owing to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. As a result, Thomas&#x27;s intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new punk-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (a.k.a. &quot;Spike&quot;) who was not Billy&#x27;s sister, and an African-American take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the &quot;Shazam!&quot; project.

Other attempts at reviving &quot;Shazam!&quot; were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by John Byrne, illustrator of &quot;Legends&quot; and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; (1986). None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC&#x27;s &quot;War of the Gods&quot; miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had ended the fee-per-use licensing agreement with CBS Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters.

===&quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; (1994; 1995–1999) ===

In 1991, Jerry Ordway was given the &quot;Shazam!&quot; assignment, which he pitched as a painted graphic novel that would lead into a series, rather than starting the series outright. Ordway both wrote and illustrated the graphic novel, titled &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot;, which was released in 1994. &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; retconned Captain Marvel again and gave him a revised origin, rendering &quot;Shazam! The New Beginning&quot; and the &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; story apocryphal while Marvel&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Legends&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot; still counted as part of the continuity.

Ordway&#x27;s story more closely followed Captain Marvel&#x27;s Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes. The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999. That series reintroduced the Marvel Family and many of their allies and enemies into the modern-day DC Universe.

===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and &quot;Shazam! Power of Hope&quot;===
Captain Marvel also appeared in Mark Waid and Alex Ross&#x27;s critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe &quot;Elseworlds&quot; miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. Set 20 years in the future, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly Lex Luthor. In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel, &quot;Shazam! Power of Hope&quot;, written by Paul Dini and painted by Alex Ross.

===Early to mid-2000s: &quot;JSA&quot; and &quot;52&quot;===
Since the cancellation of the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; title in 1999, the Marvel Family has made appearances in a number of other DC comic books. Black Adam became a main character in Geoff Johns&#x27; and David S. Goyer&#x27;s &quot;JSA&quot; series, which depicted the latest adventures of the world&#x27;s first superhero team, the Justice Society of America, with Captain Marvel also briefly joining the team to keep an eye on his old nemesis. Captain Marvel also appeared in Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;&quot;, the sequel to Miller&#x27;s highly acclaimed graphic novel &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, which culminated in his death. The &quot;Superman/Shazam: First Thunder&quot; miniseries, written by Judd Winick with art by Josh Middleton, and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post-&quot;Crisis&quot; meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.
The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC&#x27;s 2005/2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover, which began DC&#x27;s efforts to retool the &quot;Shazam!&quot; franchise. In the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; miniseries, which preceded the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the Spectre, and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard&#x27;s place in the Rock of Eternity. The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series &quot;52&quot;, which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters. &quot;52&quot; introduced Adam&#x27;s &quot;Black Marvel Family,&quot; which included Adam&#x27;s wife Isis, her brother Osiris, and Sobek. The series chronicled Adam&#x27;s attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into World War III after she and Osiris are killed. The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted &quot;Justice&quot; maxi-series by Alex Ross, Jim Krueger, and Doug Braithwaite, published from 2005 to 2007.

===&quot;The Trials of Shazam!&quot; (2006–2008)===

&quot;The Trials of Shazam!&quot;, a 12-issue maxiseries written by Judd Winick and illustrated by Howard Porter for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008. The series redefined the &quot;Shazam!&quot; property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism. &quot;Trials of Shazam!&quot; featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name &quot;Marvel&quot;, while the former Captain Marvel Jr., Freddy Freeman, attempts to prove himself worthy to become Marvel&#x27;s champion under the name &quot;Shazam&quot;.

In the pages of the 2007–2008 &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless Mary Batson his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel. By the end of the series, as well as in DC&#x27;s 2008–2009 &quot;Final Crisis&quot; limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God DeSaad, becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain Darkseid and fighting both Supergirl and Freddy Freeman/Shazam.

A three-issue arc in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) undid many of the &quot;Trials of Shazam!&quot; changes. Issues #23-25 of &quot;Justice Society&quot; featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis defeating Marvel and taking over the Rock of Eternity. Adam and Isis recruit the now-evil Mary Marvel to help them in the ensuing fight against a now-powerless Billy Batson and the Justice Society.

Billy and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC&#x27;s 2009–2010 &quot;Blackest Night&quot; saga in a one-shot special, &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; #48. In 2011, DC published a one-shot &quot;Shazam!&quot; story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness Blaze. Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in &quot;Titans&quot; (vol. 2) #32 the same year.

===The &quot;New 52&quot; relaunch===

In 2011, DC Comics relaunched their entire comic book lineup, creating &quot;The New 52&quot; lineup of comics. The revamp began with a seven-issue miniseries, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, which features an alternate timeline in which Billy Batson, Mary Batson, and Freddy Freeman are joined by three new kids, Eugene Choi, Pedro Peña, and Darla Dudley, as the &quot;S! H! A! Z! A! M! Family.&quot; In this concept, all six kids say &quot;Shazam!&quot; in unison to become an alternate version of Captain Marvel named Captain Thunder. While the continuity would be altered again by the conclusion of the story, creating the &quot;New 52&quot; multiverse, the three new Shazam! kids would be reintroduced for later appearances.

One of these relaunched series, &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2), began featuring a &quot;Shazam!&quot; backup story with issue #7 in March 2012. The feature, written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Gary Frank, introduces Billy Batson and his supporting cast into the new DC Universe. As part of the redesign, Captain Marvel received a new costume designed by Frank with a long cloak and hood, and a metallic belt instead of a sash. His lightning bolt appears as an opening into his body with magical energy visibly inside of him. Johns noted that the character&#x27;s place in the world will be &quot;far more rooted in fantasy and magic than it ever was before&quot;. The character also was officially renamed &quot;Shazam&quot; at this time. The &quot;Shazam!&quot; origin story, which included two full issues in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #0 (2012) and 21 (2013), reintroduced Billy Batson/Shazam, the Wizard, Black Adam, Tawny the tiger, and the Shazam Family (Freddy, Mary, Darla, Eugene, and Pedro) to continuity. The &quot;Shazam!&quot; feature concluded with &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #21, preceding DC&#x27;s crossover storyline &quot;Trinity War&quot; which heavily features the Shazam mythos.

Johns and Frank&#x27;s reboot was met with both acclaim and criticism, and the renaming of the hero as Shazam brought mixed reactions. Johns noted that the change was made &quot;because that&#x27;s what everyone thinks his name is anyway,&quot; owing to the inability to use the &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; moniker on comic book covers and merchandise. In updating &quot;Shazam!&quot;, Johns and Frank skirted some controversy among long-time fans by introducing Billy Batson as a cynical foster child who comes to appreciate his potential as a hero and the concept of family, rather than starting him from that point as with earlier retellings.

Following his appearances in the &quot;Trinity War&quot; and &quot;Forever Evil&quot; crossover storylines, Shazam appeared as a member of the Justice League from &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #30–50 from 2014 through 2016, and also in a one-shot spinoff titled &quot;Justice League: The Darkseid War - Shazam&quot; (cover-dated January 2016). He also appeared as a supporting character in the &quot;Cyborg&quot; series as the friend of Victor Stone/Cyborg. New takes on the classic Fawcett versions of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family appeared in Grant Morrison&#x27;s 2014 miniseries &quot;The Multiversity&quot; (which takes place on the parallel world of Earth-5) and in a 2015 spin-off to the &quot;Convergence&quot; crossover event, &quot;Convergence: Shazam!&quot; (which takes place on the parallel world of Earth-S).

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; and beyond===
Following DC&#x27;s 2016 &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; soft-relaunch event, the &quot;Shazam!&quot; characters were largely absent from new DC continuity, though Mary Marvel of Earth-5 appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 4) #14–16 (2016), and Black Adam appeared in &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; #4–5 (2017) to battle Wonder Woman. In late 2018, with the &quot;Shazam!&quot; movie in production at New Line Cinema, DC began publishing a new ongoing &quot;Shazam!&quot; series, written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Dale Eaglesham, Marco Santucci, and Scott Kolins. The series features an older and wiser Billy Batson and his foster siblings Mary, Freddy, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla exploring their powers as the Shazam Family. As the six kids venture beyond the nexus of the Rock of Eternity to explore the mysterious Seven Magic Realms, Doctor Sivana teams up with Mister Mind and a reluctant Black Adam to form the Monster Society of Evil, and Billy&#x27;s long-missing father C.C. Batson returns to attempt to re-connect with his son.

The first issue, featuring a manga backup story focused on Mary and her pet rabbit Hoppy by Johns and &quot;Shazam!&quot; fan Mayo &quot;SEN&quot; Naito, was published on December 5, 2018. Thirteen issues from Johns, Eaglesham, and others - along with two guest issues, #12 and 15, from writer Jeff Loveness and artist Brandon Peterson - were published between 2018 and 2020. Despite initial positive reviews, the third volume of &quot;Shazam!&quot; fell victim to several publishing delays. The book was cancelled with issue #15 (November 2020); Johns cited the COVID-19 pandemic and Eaglesham&#x27;s desire to take a break as reasons for discontinuing the book.

In November 2022, it was announced that a new &quot;Shazam!&quot; ongoing would begin publication in May 2023, with Mark Waid writing and Dan Mora serving as artist. During this series, Billy becomes known as &quot;The Captain&quot; and his foster siblings lose their powers.

==Fictional character biography==
===Fawcett/Early DC origin===

&quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 (Feb. 1940) introduces William Joseph &quot;Billy&quot; Batson, a homeless 12-year-old (later 14-year-old) newsboy who sleeps in the subway station of his home city (originally New York City; later referred to in DC publications as Fawcett City). A mysterious man in a green cloak asks Billy to follow him into the subway station. A magic subway car painted in unusual shapes and colors escorts them to an underground throne room, which is inhabited by a very old man with a long beard and a white robe. As the man in green disappears, the old man on the throne explains to Billy that he is the wizard Shazam, and has used the powers of &quot;the gods&quot;—Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury, hence the name &quot;Shazam&quot;—to fight evil for over 3,000 years. However, he has now grown too old to continue and is in need of a successor. The wizard explains that Billy was chosen because of his misfortune: he had been thrown out by a greedy uncle who stole his inheritance following the deaths of his parents (later retellings of the origin would also note that Billy was chosen for being &quot;pure of heart&quot;). Ordered by the wizard to speak the name &quot;Shazam,&quot; Billy is struck by a sudden bolt of lightning and transformed into a superpowered adult in a red costume with gold trim.
The wizard Shazam declares the new hero &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and orders him to carry on his work, as a stone block suspended above his throne falls upon him, killing him as prophesied. The wizard would return—in later retellings of the origin story, immediately—as a spirit to serve as a mentor to Billy and Captain Marvel, summoned by lighting a torch on the wall of his lair. As a spirit, the wizard Shazam lives at the Rock of Eternity, a bicone-shaped rock formation situated at the nexus of time and space. Later retellings of the Captain Marvel origin place Shazam&#x27;s underground lair within the Rock. Saying the word &quot;Shazam&quot; allows Billy to summon the magic lightning and become Captain Marvel, while Captain Marvel can say the magic word himself to become Billy again.

Captain Marvel&#x27;s first battle was with the mad scientist Doctor Sivana, who becomes Captain Marvel&#x27;s arch-enemy. Billy Batson becomes a reporter and host for WHIZ Radio, his career allowing him to travel and investigate criminal activity. An adult daughter of Sivana&#x27;s, Beautia, becomes an unwitting love interest for the shy Captain Marvel, despite her wavering allegiance to her evil father.

While the majority of Billy&#x27;s adventures feature him as a solo hero, he also fought evil on a regular basis accompanied by several other kids who share his powers to make up a superhero team called the Marvel Family (later referred to as the &quot;Shazam Family&quot; owing to the issues DC Comics faced over the &quot;Marvel&quot; and &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; trademarks). The first members of the family, introduced in &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #21 (Sept. 1941) and used sparingly afterwards, were the Lieutenant Marvels: three other boys from various parts of the United States who are also named &quot;Billy Batson&quot; and discover that, if they all say &quot;Shazam!&quot; in unison, they can become adult superheroes as well.

In &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #25 (Dec. 1941), Captain Marvel saves Freddy Freeman, a boy who had been left for dead by the evil Captain Nazi, and does for Freddy what the wizard did for him. By speaking the name &quot;Captain Marvel,&quot; Freddy can become the superpowered Captain Marvel Jr. Unlike Billy, Freddy retains his 14-year-old appearance as a superhero. &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #18 (Dec. 1942) introduced Billy and Freddy to Mary Bromfield, a rich girl who turns out to be Billy&#x27;s long-lost twin sister. By saying the magic word &quot;Shazam,&quot; Mary Bromfield becomes Mary Marvel. In the Fawcett and pre-1986 DC stories, Mary remained a teenager as Freddy did in Marvel form; Ordway&#x27;s 1990s &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; series made her superpowered form an adult like Billy&#x27;s. The Marvel Family also included non-powered honorary members such as Uncle Marvel, an old con man who pretended to be Mary&#x27;s uncle, and Freckles Marvel, an honorary cousin.

===Later DC origins===
The basic elements of Billy Batson&#x27;s and Captain Marvel&#x27;s origin story remained more or less intact through 2012, with minor alterations over the years. Roy &amp; Dann Thomas&#x27;s 1987 miniseries &quot;Shazam! The New Beginning&quot; had a 15-year-old Billy being forced to move in with Doctor Sivana, who in this version is the cruel uncle who throws Billy out into the street. Jerry Ordway&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; graphic novel, which became the character&#x27;s definite origin through 2011, featured a ten-year-old Billy being chosen as the Wizard Shazam&#x27;s champion, because of the influence of his archaeologist parents; the mysterious stranger from magic subway car is the ghost of Billy&#x27;s father in this version. Both the Thomases&#x27; and Ordway&#x27;s retellings of the origin directly tie the need for the Wizard Shazam to draft a younger replacement to the coming re-emergence of Black Adam, the wizard&#x27;s first champion from the days of ancient Egypt who became evil and was due to escape thousands of years of banishment.

Ordway&#x27;s origin added the extra element of Black Adam&#x27;s alter ego/descendant Theo Adam being the murderer of Billy&#x27;s parents. The subsequent &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; ongoing series features Billy, now 14, meeting his long-lost sister Mary and best friend Freddy Freeman and establishing the Marvel Family as in the Fawcett comics. The Marvels&#x27; home base of Fawcett City is depicted as a city full of old-fashioned traditions and architecture, later establishing that the Wizard Shazam placed a spell on the city (broken in later issues) that slowed time to a crawl in 1955. This phenomenon was used to explain the Marvel Family&#x27;s sometimes anachronistic approaches to life and heroism compared to many of their contemporary heroes in the DC Universe.

==== New 52 onward ====
In 2012, writer and then-DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns revised Billy Batson&#x27;s origin for DC&#x27;s &quot;New 52&quot; universe, also renaming the character&#x27;s alter-ego as &quot;Shazam&quot; at this time. In his new origin story, Billy Batson is a moody and troubled 15-year-old foster child living in Philadelphia who has gone through several foster homes. At his newest foster home under Victor and Rosa Vázquez, Billy gains five foster siblings: &quot;den mother&quot; Mary Bromfield, trickster and pick-pocket Freddy Freeman, shy and quiet Pedro Peña, brainy Eugene Choi, and energetic Darla Dudley. When Dr. Sivana resurrects the ancient warrior Black Adam from his tomb, the dying Wizard Shazam selected several candidates to inherit his power, all unsuitable until his spell summons Billy to the Rock of Eternity. Although Billy&#x27;s argues the wizard&#x27;s prerequisite for good people with a pre heart doesn&#x27;t exist, the ancient entity senses the potential of goodness in him and, with no other viable candidate, chooses him. Blessing him the Powers of Shazam, the wizard passes away and transport Billy back to Earth. Billy reveals his powers to Freddy and scheme to make money and engage in juvenile fun but Billy finds himself acting as a hero and is attacked by Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Sins. A timely intervention from his foster siblings their empowerment from him tips the situation in his favor and Billy goads Adam into transforming into his human form, where he becomes dust due to being thousands of years old. Billy decides to stay with his new family, having learned to be a more positive and emotionally open.

During the &quot;Trinity War&quot; story line, Billy flies to Black Adam&#x27;s home nation of Kahndaq to bury Adam&#x27;s remains. Shazam&#x27;s entry into the country is interpreted by the locals as illegal US entry into their territory. This leads to run-ins with both the independent Justice League and the US-sponsored Justice League of America (JLA), and a series of events that see the opening of Pandora&#x27;s Box, a portal to Earth-3 which brings the evil Justice League analogues of the Crime Syndicate to Earth-0. Following the successful defeat of the Crime Syndicate, Shazam is inducted into the League. While still a newcomer to the league, Billy has a number of new adventures while under the mentorship of Cyborg, who becomes one of his best friends.

==== DC Rebirth ====
After a year of living in the Vázquez home, Billy and his foster siblings have taken to having fun fighting crime around Philadelphia as the Shazam Family. While exploring the Rock of Eternity, Eugene finds a formerly sealed-off area of the Rock: an abandoned train station leading to the seven realms of an unexplored world known as the Magic Lands.

== Characterization ==

=== Description and themes ===
The secret identity of Captain Marvel (now currently Shazam) is William &quot;Billy&quot; Batson, a young superhero whose blessed abilities includes him being able to transform into an appearance befitting an adult at will. The character&#x27;s background differs depending on continuity; prior to Flashpoint, the character was an orphan who is granted the power due to his innocent nature despite his hardships. More recent stories casts Billy as instead a more jaded and troubled youth abandoned by his parents to the foster care whom was chosen as a champion of the Wizard Shazam due to his potential for goodness.

During the character&#x27;s publication history, various sources established the character&#x27;s age: The character&#x27;s origin and early adventures portray the character being ten or eleven years old. In &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot;, Billy notes he has been Captain Marvel for four years, making him either fourteen or fifteen. During the character&#x27;s appearances within the &quot;Justice Society of America,&quot; he is officially sixteen years old. In 2011, the &quot;Shazam&quot;! one-shot depicts Billy and Mary owning a apartment legitimately, implying the character of being eighteen. After the New 52 reboot, Billy&#x27;s age was first officially stated to be fifteen. In the 2018 &quot;Shazam&quot; series, although Billy would be sixteen years old due to the series taking place a year after the events of Geoff John&#x27;s &quot;Shazam!&quot; backup in &quot;Justice League&quot;, he was remarked to also be fifteen.

==== Identities and role ====

* Captain Marvel / Shazam: The character&#x27;s primary identity and role. Within the DC Universe, Billy first served as a &quot;champion&quot; that battled evil with the support of the Wizard Shazam, a ancient entity that has battled evil for centuries. In earlier versions, the role of champion was a legacy role first held by the Wizard himself when he was younger and empowered by a different pantheon of god. He would select Black Adam as his initial successor but is forced to seal him away and eventually selects Billy as his successor, who then empowers his friends and family. In his super-powered identity, he is considered among Earth&#x27;s greatest and most powerful superheroes on par with the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman, respected among other heroes as a stalwart and virtuous character. Following the character&#x27;s re-introduction in the New 52, a new creative direction for the character additionally empowers him as the Champion of Magic, a role that designates him as a mystic defender of all magic, specially overlooking the Rock of Eternity and the Seven Magiclands (which includes Earth).
* Marvel: Following the Wizard Shazam&#x27;s death during the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; storyline, Billy assumes his position as the caretaker of the Rock of Eternity to prevent its prisoners from escaping, gaining a new appearance and powers. In this role, Freddy Freeman served as the new &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and Marvel being empowered by him similar to his prior arrangement. This direction was undone following the New 52 reboot.

=== Familial connections ===

==== Biological family ====
Billy&#x27;s familial connections plays an important role in the character&#x27;s background and has been subjected to changes throughout the character&#x27;s publication history. Within Fawcett Comics, Billy&#x27;s parents were originally Merril and Jocelyn Batson, with Mary Batson as his twin sister whom was separated during birth from a nurse who sought to hide the Bromfield family&#x27;s deceased child. Upon his parents&#x27; death due to a car accident, Billy&#x27;s legal guardian was his paternal uncle, Ebenezer Batson, portrayed as a cruel and vain caretaker who abandons Billy upon being granted his trust fund, making him homeless. In later stories within DC Comics, the dynamics of his lineage is similar although his parents are renamed Clarence Charles (C.C) Batson V and Marilyn Batson, archeologist killed by Theo Adam. Nora and Nicholas Bromfield, Mary&#x27;s adoptive parents, are revealed to be relatives&#x27; with Nora being Marilyn&#x27;s cousin. Biily also had a cousin, Sinclair Batson, Ebenezer&#x27;s affluent and businessman son who also held his cousins in low regard although he was revealed to be a animated creation made by Lady Blaze to fulfill Ebenezer&#x27;s wish for a son in exchange for his soul. 

In current continuity, C.C and Marilyn Batson remains his parents although his extensive side of his family and Mary Batson as his twin sister was omitted. C.C is characterized as a criminal whom, alongside Marilyn, gave up Billy to the foster care system, finding themselves unfit parents who soon split shortly and was then sentenced to prison. Marilyn reappears in the 2024 &quot;Shazam!&quot; series, revealing to Billy a half-brother and intents to reclaim custody of him. 

==== Foster and adoptive family ====
In current continuities, the character&#x27;s background and dynamics was altered, with Billy&#x27;s abandonment to foster care a source of strife for the character. The character is taken into a foster family household by Victor and Rosa Vasquez. Billy&#x27;s relationship with them was depicted as difficult due to Billy&#x27;s previous experiences with foster families. Alongside the married Vasquez couple, Billy&#x27;s other foster siblings include: Mary Bromfield (his sister in past continuities, now older), Freddy Freeman (now both best friend and sibling), Eugene Choi, Pedro Peña, and Darla Dudley. Billy&#x27;s relationship with his foster family eventually improves over time. Later, both Rosa and Victor officially adopted them all. 

==== Wizard Shazam ====
Due to Billy&#x27;s evolving relationship with the Wizard Shazam, the character also serves in a parental role. During the character&#x27;s depiction in the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; onward, the character would serve as Billy&#x27;s legal guardian under the identity &quot;Jebediah O&#x27;Keenan&quot; (based upon his real name, Jebediah of Canaan), claiming to be his maternal grandfather. In the character&#x27;s portrayal as Mamaragan, Steve Orlando described their dynamic during the Darkseid War storyline, wherein the pair become more connected when he represents the &quot;M&quot; in the &quot;SHAZAM&quot; acronym and grants him a portion of his own power, as beginning as &quot;somewhat antagonistic pairing&quot; in earlier stories but evolved into a &quot;pseudo father and son&quot; relationship who has faith in Billy&#x27;s capabilities.

==Powers and abilities==

=== Magical abilities ===
While possessing no special abilities as ordinary human Billy Batson, he is capable of endowing himself with a host of magical-based super powers by saying the magic word (:Shazam!&quot;) due to being empowered by the Wizard Shazam. The source of his power, although consistently derived from the Wizard Shazam, varies from continuity; earlier stories express the magical abilities Billy possessed were facilitated from the Wizard&#x27;s general magical power while the New 52 onward instead attributes his power from a connection to the Living Lightning, the magical power and essence of the Wizard Shazam. 

==== Powers of Shazam ====
==== Living Lightning ====
In the current continuity, the mystical abilities the character possess originates from the Living Lightning, a unique form of magic connected to the Wizard Shazam&#x27;s being and lifeforce often in the form of lightning. The Living Lightning grants additional, separate powers of its own; it allows for lightning control, usage of certain spells in circumstances, and can enhance the power of magic spells, healing abilities, and strength. This power is also among the only known supernatural forces capable of directly countering energies originating from the Great Darkness. 

==== Spell-casting &amp; magic manipulation ====
Both aspects of the Powers of Shazam (&quot;Power of Zeus&quot;) and the Living Lightning from the New 52 onward similarly grant Billy the power to cast spells and manipulate forms of magic. With the magical and spell-casting aspect requiring focus, discipline, and study to be used properly, this aspect is considered the most difficult to master and is remarked to not be the character&#x27;s forte. 

When the character adopted the &quot;Marvel&quot; codename and Wizard&#x27;s magical power, while he no longer possessed the Powers of Shazam, he had the capacity to manipulate and command magical energies, transform between his mortal and older form at will, and possessed a deep understanding of the supernatural, particularly during a period of shifting magical rules. However, due to the immense accumulation of magic within the Rock of Eternity, he was required to remain within its confines to maintain control over the abundance of magic. Billy could only venture outside the Rock of Eternity for a maximum of 24 hours at a time.

After the character&#x27;s re-introduction from New 52 onward, he displayed Latin-based spell-casting abilities that can achieved various effects such as fire manipulation and the ability to alter his size. In the &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot; storyline, Billy becomes tethered to the Rock of Eternity, gaining access to its vast magical energies. Thus far, he has shown to generate duplicates of his empowered form, each possessing his abilities, and can summon Mamaragan, the ancient being associated with his powers, at his own volition. A future version of the character also showcases potential to utilize magical methods from others, such as Raven or Johnny Thunder&#x27;s.

=== Weaknesses ===
Captain Marvel is not completely invulnerable. In several stories, he is shown to be susceptible to high-powered magic, which can weaken or de-power him, and, in some older stories, to significantly high voltages of lightning or electricity, which would make him revert to Billy Batson form. Despite possessing the courage of Achilles, the Fawcett Captain Marvel was extremely bashful and shy around attractive women, a weakness some villains came to exploit. 

In classic stories, simply saying the word &quot;Shazam!&quot; transformed Billy into Captain Marvel and back again; this extended to accidental utterances, recorded playbacks, and so forth. When Captain Marvel shared his powers with his Marvel Family teammates in 1990s and 2000s DC publications (from &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; in 1995 through 2011&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoint&quot;), the Shazam power was depicted as a finite source which would be divided into halves, thirds, or further depending upon how many Marvels were super-powered at one time, and weakening them accordingly. The 2011 reboot changed the rules so that Captain Marvel could speak the magic word &quot;Shazam&quot; without causing a transformation. This lasted until the 2023 comic event &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot;, when the rule once again became that speaking the word in any fashion would trigger the lightning.

==Other versions==
A significant number of &quot;alternate&quot; depictions of Shazam/Captain Marvel have appeared in DC publications since the 1970s.

=== Alternate versions of Billy Batson ===

==== Captain Thunder (1974) ====
In &quot;Make Way for Captain Thunder&quot; from &quot;Superman&quot; #276 (June 1974), Superman found himself at odds with &quot;Captain Thunder&quot;, a superhero displaced from another Earth and another time. Thunder had been magically tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into committing evil himself, which led to his doing battle with Superman. Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel&#x27;s original moniker, was a thinly veiled pastiche of Marvel—down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named &quot;Willie Fawcett&quot; (a reference to Fawcett Comics), and a magic word (&quot;Thunder!&quot;), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying &quot;Thunder&quot;. His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed), Uncas (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity). Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.

&quot;Make Way for Captain Thunder&quot; was written by Elliot S! Maggin and illustrated by Curt Swan and Bob Oskner. At the time of its publication, DC had been printing &quot;Shazam!&quot; comics for 18 months, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #137, two years later (although he met Lex Luthor in &quot;Shazam!&quot; #15, November/December 1974).

==== Captain Thunder (1982) ====
In 1983, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway. This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC&#x27;s main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson named &quot;Willie Fawcett&quot; (as in the 1974 story), who spoke the magic word &quot;Shazam!&quot; to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One&#x27;s Mightiest Mortal. This alternate version of the character was never used.

==== &quot;Superman: Distant Fires&quot; (1998) ====
In the dark alternate future of the Elseworlds comic &quot;Superman: Distant Fires&quot; (1998) by Howard Chaykin, Gil Kane, Kevin Nowlan, and Matt Hollingsworth, most of humanity has been destroyed in nuclear war. An adult Billy Batson becomes obsessed with Wonder Woman when they become part of a small community of survivors of the holocaust, with most of the surviving superhumans having lost their powers or dealing with altered abilities. When the now-powerless Clark Kent joins their community, starting a relationship with Wonder Woman that includes them having a child together, Batson&#x27;s resentment of Superman becomes insanity, as he provokes his transformation into Captain Marvel despite use of this power causing damage to Earth.

==== &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot; (2001–2002) ====
In the dark alternate future shown in Frank Miller&#x27;s 2001–2002 comic miniseries &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;, Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses. Lex Luthor, who has captured Mary Marvel, coerces him into working for him by threatening to kill her. During an alien attack on Metropolis, Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson—here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him—died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist like any dream when there is nobody left to remember it. His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.

==== &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; ====
The 1996 miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, written by Mark Waid with painted art by Alex Ross, depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is an adult who now matches the appearance of his superhero identity. The human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Batson has become the brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind&#x27;s mind-controlling worm offspring to keep him in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson&#x27;s potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, believing it is a non-costumed Captain Marvel that serves Luthor.

Events finally cause him to transform into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel sacrifices himself to intercept it. The nuclear blast kills a large number of heroes, but cools the war-like attitudes of the survivors. Superman uses Marvel&#x27;s cape as the symbol of a new world order in which humans and superhumans will now live in harmony.

==== Earth-5 ====
In &quot;52&quot; #52 (May 2, 2007), a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities, one of which is designated Earth-5. As a result of Marvel Family foe Mister Mind &quot;eating&quot; aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters.

The Earth-5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared, assisting Superman, in the &quot;Final Crisis: Superman Beyond&quot; miniseries. The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are separate beings, and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media rather than a radio broadcaster. The Earth-5 Captain Marvel reappeared in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7, along with an army of Supermen from across the Multiverse to prevent its destruction by Darkseid. Following The New 52 Multiverse reboot, Earth-5 remains a Fawcett Comics–inspired setting, and is spotlighted in the comic book &quot;The Multiversity: Thunderworld #1&quot; (Feb 2015), a modernized take on the classic Fawcett &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; stories from writer Grant Morrison and artist Cameron Stewart.

==== &quot;Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil&quot; (2007) ====
A Captain Marvel miniseries, &quot;Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil&quot;, written and illustrated by Jeff Smith, was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Shazam!&quot; miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel&#x27;s origin. Smith&#x27;s story features a younger-looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities, as they were in the pre-1985 stories, and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel&#x27;s sidekick, instead of the traditional teen-aged or adult versions. Dr. Sivana is Attorney General of the United States, and Mister Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar.

==== &quot;Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!&quot; (2008–2010) ====
An all-ages Captain Marvel comic, &quot;Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!&quot;, debuted in July 2008 under DC&#x27;s Johnny DC youth-oriented imprint, and was published monthly through December 2010. Following the lead and continuity of Smith&#x27;s &quot;Monster Society of Evil&quot; miniseries, it was initially written and drawn by Mike Kunkel, creator of &quot;Herobear&quot;. Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani, of &quot;Tiny Titans&quot;, took over as writers with issue #5, with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue #13, when Mike Norton assumed his place for the remainder of the series. Kunkel&#x27;s version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy&#x27;s personality, and also introduces new versions of Black Adam (whose alter ego, Theo Adam, is a child like Billy Batson in this version), King Kull, the Arson Fiend, and Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr.

==== &quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot; (2013–2016) ====
In the prequel comic to the 2013 video game &quot;&quot;, Shazam joins Superman&#x27;s Regime in establishing a new approach to ending crime. Similar to the Golden Age version, this Shazam is suggested to have two personalities: Billy Batson is a separate person from Shazam. In Year One he, like the Flash, is somewhat skeptical of Superman&#x27;s intentions, as his actions are often immoral. Ultimately, Shazam decides to stay and support the Regime, devoted to its cause. He becomes the object of Harley Quinn&#x27;s affection, being bound and gagged by her in Year Four. He is freed by Ares to join the Regime in combating the Amazon army and Greek gods, but just when they seem to be winning Zeus strips him of his powers, reverting him to Billy permanently. He, Harley (for trying to help him), and Wonder Woman&#x27;s mother Hippolyta are sent to the abyss of Tartarus as punishment, though they escape and Billy is left out of the conflict without his powers. Eventually, Zeus is forced to return Billy&#x27;s power after the Highfather of New Genesis intervenes in the conflict. In Year Five, Shazam&#x27;s relationship with Harley is complicated when she confronts him about being in the Regime despite their growing tyranny. &quot;(See the video games section for the continuation of his story in this universe.)&quot;

==== &quot;Future State&quot; (2021) ====
A potential future incarnation of Billy Batson is introduced during the &quot;Future State&quot; event. This iteration of the character shares a similar background to their DC Rebirth counterpart, following a similar history until a point of divergence during their time as a student at the Teen Titans Academy in the Infinite Frontier era. In this version, the character demonstrates enhanced magical abilities, having acquired the sorcerous skills from tutelage under Raven. He also displayed the power to manipulate the powers other prominent mystics within the DC Universe such as Johnny and Jakeem Thunder.

Billy is among the various heroes who assists the Titans in confronting Red X and the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse. Raven succeeds in absorbing the Horsemen but become corrupted under their influence. Shazam then uses his power to seal her in the Rock of Eternity at her behest to contain her power. Becoming known as the Unkindness, she uses her limited influence to create an alliance with Neron, who uses his power to split Shazam and Billy into independent beings. As Billy maintains his position, his innocence used to ward off demons on account the Rock of Eternity has been displaced within Hell, Shazam works to fight external threats.

Shazam assumes the role of leader within the Justice League of America, based in Detroit. However, in the absence of Billy&#x27;s inherent influence, Shazam&#x27;s morality becomes increasingly corrupted. He engages in secret killings of both super-villains and heroes who oppose his views, including the Question, who is the successor to Renee Montoya and Vic Sage, known as Drake. Shazam is also responsible for the deaths of Jakeem Thunder, Johnny Thunder, and the Creeper. Eventually, the identity of the Question is revealed to be Deadman, who has taken possession of Drake&#x27;s body and acted as another successor to the Question in the JLA. The Spectre intervenes upon discovering Shazam&#x27;s actions. Though aware of Shazam&#x27;s past heroism, the Spectre is shocked to learn that his recent behavior is partly influenced by events in Hell, of which the Spectre had no prior knowledge. In a surprising turn of events, Shazam strikes and kills the Spectre using the remaining material from the Spear of Destiny. Deadman, as the Question, reveals himself to Shazam and temporarily uses the magic word to strip him of his powers. This entire sequence of events is later uncovered as a ploy orchestrated by Raven and Neron, with the goal of redirecting Shazam&#x27;s powers back to the Rock of Eternity, which Raven absorbs. Empowered by her natural abilities, the Powers of Shazam, and the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse, Raven confidently escapes her confinement, believing that with the Spectre&#x27;s demise, there will be no one to oppose her. Meanwhile, Billy mysteriously disappears, and his fate remains unknown.

==== &quot;Shazam! Thundercrack&quot; ====
On May 27, 2021, it was announced that cartoonist Yehudi Mercado would write and draw a middle-grade graphic novel titled &quot;Shazam! Thundercrack&quot;, which will take place within the storyline of the 2019 &quot;Shazam!&quot; movie. It is set for both online and print release on June 7, 2022.

=== Other versions of Captain Marvel/Shazam ===

==== Captain Thunder (Flashpoint) ====
The 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; comics miniseries, written by Geoff Johns with art by Andy Kubert, featured an alternate timeline accidentally created by the Flash, who then helped the heroes of this timeline to restore history. One of those heroes is Captain Thunder—an alternative version of Captain Marvel who has six alter-egos, rather than one, and a scarred face as the result of a fight with Wonder Woman, who in this timeline is a villain.

The six children, collectively known as &quot;S.H.A.Z.A.M.&quot;, each possess one of the six attributes of the power of Shazam, and must say the magic word together to become Captain Thunder. They are: Eugene Choi, who possesses the wisdom of Solomon; Pedro Peña, who possesses the strength of Hercules; Mary Batson, Freddy Freeman and Billy Batson, who possess the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, and the courage of Achilles, respectively; and Darla Dudley who possesses the speed of Mercury. Pedro&#x27;s pet tiger Tawny also transforms into a more powerful version of himself via the magic lightning.

The six children later transform into Captain Thunder to help Flash and his allies stop the war between Aquaman&#x27;s Atlantean army and Wonder Woman&#x27;s Amazonian forces. Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash&#x27;s accomplice Enchantress, who is revealed to be a traitor. Before the kids can re-form Captain Thunder, Billy is stabbed by the Amazon Penthesileia and killed.

After the conclusion of the miniseries, the three new children from the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timeline—Eugene, Pedro, and Darla—were incorporated into the DC Universe via the &quot;Shazam!&quot; backup strip in &quot;Justice League&quot;, appearing as Billy, Mary, and Freddy&#x27;s foster siblings.

==== Captain Marvel &quot;(Elseworld&#x27;s Finest)&quot; ====
In the alternate universe &quot;Elseworlds&quot; one-shot comic &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl&quot; (1998) by Tom Simmons, Matt Haley and Barbara Kesel, the current Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African-American man. A flashback to the older Justice Society features the traditional Caucasian Captain Marvel, leading to the conclusion that there were two Captain Marvels.

==== Captain Marvel (Robert Rodgers) ====
A one-shot alternate take on &quot;Shazam!&quot; was published as part of the &quot;Just Imagine...&quot; comics line in 2001, which saw Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee reimagining various DC characters.

Lee reimagined the original &quot;Shazam!&quot; premise by having the hero be a mild mannered Interpol agent, Robert Rogers. Teamed with the beautiful, and much tougher, fellow agent, Carla Noral, the two of them are in India searching for the megalomaniac master criminal Gunga Kahn. Rogers is given the ability to transform into a large, winged being by saying the magic word &quot;Shazam!&quot; This version is co-created with Gary Frank, and is based on the Bill Parker–C. C. Beck character.

In a backup story plotted by Michael Uslan, scripted by Lee and Uslan, and drawn by Kano, an orphaned American boy in India at the same time as the adventures of Shazam heroically saves a village from starvation with the help of a local boy named Zubin Navotny. The boy&#x27;s name is Billy Marvel, and he and Zubin are made honorary captains in the U.S. Peace Corps by an Ambassador named Batson, making the boy &quot;Captain Marvel.&quot;

==== Captain Marvel (Sahar Shazeen) ====
A female version of Captain Marvel is shown as a member of an alternate-future Justice League in &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, a 2010 comics maxiseries written by Judd Winick and Keith Giffen. Little is revealed about her, other than the fact that her civilian name is Sahar Shazeen, and she is shown wielding a pair of swords during battle. She and her teammates are ultimately killed by an army of OMACs.

==== Mazahs ====
Mazahs is a corrupted alternate-universe version of Shazam, introduced in the 2013–14 &quot;Forever Evil&quot; DC Comics crossover event series written by Geoff Johns. He is the super-powered alter-ego of Alexander Luthor of Earth-3. In the story, the Crime Syndicate (evil Earth-3 analogues of the Justice League) have brought Alexander Luthor, their prisoner, with them to the Prime Earth where the Justice League and other heroes reside. Prime Earth&#x27;s Lex Luthor and his team sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape over his mouth, allowing Alexander to speak the magic word &quot;Mazahs!&quot; and transform into his muscular, highly powerful alter-ego. While Prime Earth&#x27;s Shazam is known for sharing his powers with others, Mazahs kills other superbeings and takes their powers for his own, as when he kills the Syndicate&#x27;s speedster Johnny Quick. It is implied that the power of Mazahs previously belonged to Earth-3&#x27;s Will Batson, before he was killed by Alexander. In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Earth-3&#x27;s Wonder Woman analogue, Superwoman, is in a relationship with Alexander and tricked her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor&#x27;s team, but Prime Earth Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning, using a lightning-rod that Batman had retrieved to try and use against Johnny Quick based on his planned defense against the Flash, and transform Mazahs into his human form. Sealing Alexander&#x27;s mouth, Lex stabs him with a knife, killing him.

Superwoman later gives birth to Mazahs&#x27;s child in &quot;Justice League&quot; #50, and uses the baby&#x27;s power-stealing abilities, inherited from his father and activated when she says the magic word, to remove abilities the members the Prime-Earth Justice League had inherited from their time on Apokolips after the death of Darkseid. The story ends with the orphaned baby having absorbed both the Omega Effect from Lex Luthor as well as the Anti-Life Equation from Justice League associate Steve Trevor, transforming him into a resurrected—yet still infantile—Darkseid.

==Supporting cast==

In the traditional &quot;Shazam!&quot; stories, Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes empowered by the wizard Shazam. The main core of the Marvel Family were Captain Marvel&#x27;s sister Mary Marvel, the alter-ego of Billy Batson&#x27;s twin sister Mary Batson (adopted as Mary Bromfield), and Marvel&#x27;s protégé, Captain Marvel Jr., who was the alter-ego of Billy and Mary&#x27;s best friend, the disabled newsboy Freddy Freeman. Before DC&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; comic book miniseries in 1985, the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary&#x27;s non-powered friend &quot;Uncle&quot; Dudley (Uncle Marvel) and three other protégés (all of whose alter egos are named &quot;Billy Batson&quot;) known as the Lieutenant Marvels. A pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel, Hoppy the Marvel Bunny, appeared in his own stories.

Among the key supporting characters was Sterling Morris, president of Amalgamated Broadcasting, owners of Station WHIZ, the radio (and later TV) station for which Billy worked as a reporter. Billy also had his own love interest, Cissie Sommerly, who was also Sterling Morris&#x27; niece and had a recurring role in the comics. In the early Fawcett stories, Billy Batson and Captain Marvel had a sidekick named Steamboat, an African-American valet character who was removed from the comics by 1945 because of protests over racial stereotyping. From 1947 forward, Billy/Marvel&#x27;s sidekick was Mr. Tawky Tawny, an anthropomorphic talking tiger who works as a museum curator and seeks integration into human society.

JSA member Captain Marvel briefly dates Courtney Whitmore aka Stargirl, and both her and Billy Batson are the same age, although she was attracted to Billy in his older form in the first place, without knowing his secret identity, and even kissed him. To outsiders, however, Captain Marvel is by all appearances a fully grown-up adult, and the relationship between Marvel and Stargirl draws criticism from Jakeem Thunder and Jay Garrick (despite these opposing views and even inappropriate ageist and neo-puritanical comments from fans and readers in real life, however, even if Billy was actually older in his original form like in his &quot;Shazam&quot; one, the relationship between the two would have been legally possible). After Garrick confronts them, Marvel decides to leave the JSA and Courtney, instead of revealing his secret to the team. Marvel later returns to the JSA and explains that the Wisdom of Solomon prevents him from revealing his secret identity.

The current-continuity version of Shazam has a Shazam Family made up of his five foster siblings, with whom he shares his powers: Mary Bromfield, Freddy Freeman, Pedro Peña, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley. The latter three children were introduced in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; miniseries as three of the six children sharing the powers of &quot;Captain Thunder&quot;, and introduced into regular DC continuity with &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #8 in 2012. Tawny was initially depicted as a magically-charged zoo tiger in the &quot;Justice League&quot; backup stories. In the 2018–present ongoing &quot;Shazam!&quot; series, a more traditional version of Tawny is a resident of The Wildlands, a magical realm inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.

The Marvel Family&#x27;s other non-powered allies have traditionally included Dr. Sivana&#x27;s good-natured adult offspring, Beautia and Magnificus Sivana. The 1970s &quot;Shazam!&quot; series also included Sunny Sparkle, the &quot;nicest boy in the world.&quot; Jerry Ordway&#x27;s 1990s &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; series also introduced Billy&#x27;s school principal, Miss Wormwood, and Mary&#x27;s adoptive parents, Nick and Nora Bromfield. The &quot;New 52&quot; reboot of &quot;Shazam!&quot; introduced the Shazam kids&#x27; foster parents, Victor and Rosa Vázquez.

===Television===
====1970s–1990s====
Captain Marvel first came to television in 1974. Filmation produced &quot;Shazam!&quot;, a live-action series, which ran from 1974 to 1976 on CBS. From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of &quot;The Shazam!/Isis Hour&quot; alongside &quot;The Secrets of Isis&quot;.

Instead of directly following the lead of the comics, &quot;Shazam!&quot; took a more indirect approach to the character: Billy Batson/Captain Marvel, accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor (Les Tremayne), traveled in a motor home across the U.S., interacting with people in different towns in which they stopped to save the citizens from some form of danger or to help them combat some form of evil. With the wizard Shazam absent from this series, Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six &quot;immortal elders&quot; represented in the &quot;Shazam&quot; name, who were depicted via animation: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. &quot;Shazam!&quot; starred Michael Gray as Billy Batson, with both Jackson Bostwick (season 1) and John Davey (seasons 2 and 3) as Captain Marvel. An adapted version of Isis, the heroine of &quot;The Secrets of Isis&quot;, was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam&#x27;s wife.

Shortly after the &quot;Shazam!&quot; show ended its network run, Captain Marvel (played by Garrett Craig) appeared as a character in a pair of low-budget, live-action comedy specials, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions under the name &quot;Legends of the Superheroes&quot; in 1979. The specials also featured Howard Morris as Doctor Sivana, and Ruth Buzzi as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of the characters in film or television. Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s long-running concurrent Saturday morning cartoon series &quot;Super Friends&quot; (which featured many of the other DC superheroes), he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show.

Filmation revisited the character three years later in &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot;, which aired alongside &quot;Hero High&quot;. Captain Marvel and Billy Batson were both voiced by Burr Middleton. The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show. Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies.

Captain Marvel or Billy Batson made brief &quot;cameo&quot; appearances in two 1990s TV series. An unnamed reporter resembling Billy appears in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Obsession&quot;, while live actors portraying Captain Marvel make &quot;cameo&quot; appearances in both a dream-sequence within an episode of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and in the Beastie Boys&#x27; music video for &quot;Alive&quot;.

===Radio===
In about 1943, a radio serial of Captain Marvel was briefly broadcast (possibly by either Mutual or NBC) initially with Burt Boyar as Billy Batson. According to Boyar&#x27;s faint memories in a 2011 interview, the show was initially produced in New York but after about a month relocated to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcripts of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian Jim Harmon via recollections of old-time radio fans who recalled hearing it during original broadcasts, plus locating period program listings.

===Comic strips===
In 1943, C. C. Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip, but syndicates expressed no interest in it. Reed suspected that the DC lawsuit was the syndicates&#x27; reason, for fear of becoming parties in the ongoing litigation.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
=== Critical response ===

The character was ranked as the 55th-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. IGN also ranked Shazam as the 50th-greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that the character will always be an enduring reminder of a simpler time. UGO Networks ranked him as one of the top heroes of entertainment, saying, &quot;At his best, Shazam has always been compared to Superman with a sense of crazy, goofy fun.&quot;

===Captain Marvel vs. Superman in fiction===
Captain Marvel&#x27;s adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and pop culture in general. The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in Modern Age comic book stories. The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman&#x27;s heat vision, X-ray vision or superhuman breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.

The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in &quot;Superduperman&quot;, a satirical comic book story by Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood in the fourth issue of &quot;Mad&quot; (April/May 1953). Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature. Marbles&#x27; magic word is &quot;SHAZOOM&quot;, which stands for Strength, Health, Aptitude, Zeal, Ox (power of), Ox (power of another), and Money. In contrast to Captain Marvel&#x27;s perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal. Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.

While publishing its &quot;Shazam!&quot; revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in &quot;Superman&quot; #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character&#x27;s original name. He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free. Two years later, &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #135–137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies. It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly. King Kull has caused Superman to go mad using red kryptonite, compelling Marvel to battle him at first and subsequently restore Superman&#x27;s mind with the help of lightning.

In &quot;Shazam!&quot; #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh&#x27;s steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of &quot;Action Comics&quot;. He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.

Notable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include &quot;All-New Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-58 (1978), &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #36–37 (1984), and &quot;Superman&quot; vol. 2, #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes. The &quot;Clash&quot; episode of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece, Lex Luthor manipulating events so that Captain Marvel will perceive Superman as being prejudiced against Luthor&#x27;s criminal past and attacking him without provokation or evidence that Luthor has actually done anything wrong. By contrast, the depiction of the pair&#x27;s first meeting in the &quot;Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder&quot; miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy&#x27;s mentor when he learns the boy&#x27;s true age.

===In popular culture===
The television character Gomer Pyle is known for uttering the catchphrase &quot;Shazam!&quot; on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;.

Al McCoy, longtime radio and TV voice of the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns, would shout &quot;Shazam!&quot; every time the Suns made a three-point shot.

In &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), Peter Parker yells &quot;Shazam!&quot; while trying to get his powers working.

In &quot;Dear Becky&quot; (2020), the Boys are depicted as kidnapping their universe&#x27;s version of Billy Batson/Shazam and cutting out his tongue to prevent him from ever using his powers again.

=== Accolades ===
* Shazam was included in &quot;CBR&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top 50 DC Characters&quot;.

<text>Waterloo is the name of a former town at the upriver juncture of the False River oxbow on the west bank of the Mississippi River in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, United States. Founded &quot;circa&quot; 1820, the community grew as a bustling export center for cotton and sugar cane produced in Pointe Coupee Parish.

== History ==
For protection against the frequent floods of the Mississippi River, Waterloo was surrounded by levees, the large state-maintained levee in the rear and a small levee maintained by the community itself at the river&#x27;s edge. Both of these levees broke during the flood of 1884, seriously damaging Waterloo and the smaller communities of Anchor and Cook&#x27;s Landing immediately downriver. What the river did not destroy, arsonists did during the mid-1890s and there is nothing left to indicate that the town once existed. Most of the families who lived at Waterloo moved to the parish seat of New Roads, just a few miles to the west on False River.

The names Waterloo, Anchor, and Cook&#x27;s Landing are perpetuated, however, in the street names of nearby subdivisions of new homes developed between 1968 and 2007. It is also not uncommon for residents of these subdivisions to uncover remnants of the communities while performing any sort of excavation upon their properties. There are 144 households, in which there is an estimated population of 332. The racial makeup of the neighborhood is 93.05% White non-Hispanic, 6.25% African American, and 0.6% Latino. The median income is estimated at $71,232. The median house age is 19 years.

<doc id="403594" wikidata="Q89657" url="?curid=403594" title="Cheval de frise">
<text>The cheval de frise (plural: chevaux de frise , &quot;Frisian horses&quot;) was a defensive obstacle, existing in a number of forms, principally as a static anti-cavalry obstacle but also quickly movable to close breaches. The term was also applied to underwater constructions used to prevent the passage of ships or other vessels on rivers. In the anti-cavalry role the &quot;cheval de frise&quot; typically comprised a portable frame (sometimes just a simple log) with many projecting spikes. Wire obstacles ultimately made this type of device obsolete. 

The invention of the cheval de frise is attributed to ancient China. The concept of using a defensive obstacle made of wooden or metal stakes predates its use in Europe. Historical records suggest that similar types of defensive barriers, known as &quot;teng pai&quot; or &quot;mó pai&quot;, were used in China as early as the 4th century BC. These early versions of the cheval de frise were employed to protect cities, forts, and other strategic locations from enemy attacks. In Ming dynasty military treatises, it was known as the &quot;juma&quot; (拒馬, lit. &#x27;Horse repeller&#x27;) or &quot;lujiao&quot; (鹿角, deer horn). 

The use of chevaux de frise spread to Europe during the Middle Ages and became a common feature of medieval fortifications. They were used extensively in castle defenses and military campaigns, particularly during the Renaissance and early modern periods.

During the American Civil War the Confederates used them more than the Union forces. During World War I, armies used &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; to temporarily plug gaps in barbed wire. Barbed wire &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; were used in jungle fighting on the South Pacific islands during World War II.

The term is also applied to defensive works on buildings. This includes a series of closely set upright stones found outside the ramparts of Iron Age hillforts in northern Europe, or iron spikes outside homes in Charleston, South Carolina.

==Etymology==
In French, &quot;cheval de frise&quot; means &quot;Frisian horse&quot;. The Frisians fought predominantly using cavalry; they were known for being formidable horsemen, and Frisian horses were renowned for their strength and agility. Therefore, for defense they relied heavily on anti-cavalry obstacles. The Dutch also adopted the use of these defensive devices when at war with Spain. The term &quot;cheval de frise&quot; came to be used for any spiked obstacle, such as broken glass embedded in mortar at the top of a wall.

The &quot;cheval de frise&quot; was adopted in New York and Pennsylvania during the American Revolutionary War as a defensive measure installed on rivers to prevent upriver movement by enemy ships. During the Peninsular War, at the Siege of Badajoz (1812), a &quot;cheval de frise&quot; was used to fill a breach in the town wall, allowing the French to inflict heavy casualties on the British storm troops.

==American Revolutionary War==
During the American Revolutionary War both Thaddeus Kosciuszko and Robert Erskine designed an anti-ship version of the cheval-de-frise to prevent British warships from proceeding up the Delaware River and Hudson River, respectively. A &quot;cheval de frise&quot; by Erskine&#x27;s design was placed between Fort Washington at northern Manhattan and Fort Lee in New Jersey in 1776. The following year construction began on one to the north of West Point at Pollepel Island, but it was overshadowed by the completion of the Great Chain across the Hudson in 1778, which was used through 1782.

Similar devices planned by Ben Franklin and designed by Robert Smith were used in the Delaware River near Philadelphia, between Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer. Two other lines of chevaux-de-frise were also placed across the Delaware River at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania and Fort Billingsport, New Jersey as a first line of defense for Philadelphia against the British naval forces.

A &quot;cheval de frise&quot; was retrieved from the Delaware River in Philadelphia on November 13, 2007, in excellent condition, after more than two centuries in the river. In November 2012, a spike from a cheval-de-frise was recovered from Delaware off Bristol Township; it was also believed to be from the Revolutionary era installation at Philadelphia and freed up by Hurricane Sandy earlier that fall.

==Legacy==
A small promontory on the north-east Essex coast in the United Kingdom (UK), between Holland Haven and Frinton-on-Sea, was named Chevaux de Frise Point.

<doc id="403602" wikidata="Q1221006" url="?curid=403602" title="Ceiling (aeronautics)">
<text>With respect to aircraft performance, a ceiling is the maximum density altitude an aircraft can reach under a set of conditions, as determined by its flight envelope.

==Service ceiling==
Service ceiling is the density altitude at which the rate of climb drops below a prescribed value.

The service ceiling is the maximum altitude of an aircraft during normal operations. Specifically, it is the density altitude at which flying in a clean configuration, at the best rate of climb airspeed for that altitude and with all engines operating and producing maximum continuous power, will produce a given rate of climb. A typical value might be climb, or on the order of climb for jet aircraft.

The one-engine inoperative (OEI) service ceiling of a twin-engine, fixed-wing aircraft is the density altitude at which flying in a clean configuration, at the best rate of climb airspeed for that altitude with one engine producing maximum continuous power and the other engine shut down (and if it has a propeller, the propeller is feathered), will produce a given rate of climb, usually .

However, some performance charts will define the service ceiling as the pressure altitude at which the aircraft will have the capability of climbing at with one propeller feathered.

Most commercial jetliners have a service (or certified) ceiling of under 45,000 ft (13,700 m) and some business jets about . Before its retirement, the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) (as well as the Tupolev Tu-144 before it was retired) routinely flew at .

==Absolute ceiling==
The absolute ceiling is the highest altitude at which an aircraft can sustain level flight. Due to the thin air at higher altitudes, a much higher true airspeed (TAS) is required to generate sufficient lift on the wings. The absolute ceiling is therefore the altitude at which the engines are operating at maximum thrust, yet can only generate enough lift to match the weight of the aircraft. Hence, the aircraft will not have any excess capacity to climb further. Stated technically, it is the altitude where the maximum sustained (with no decreasing airspeed) rate of climb is zero.

Compared to service ceiling, the absolute ceiling of commercial aircraft is much higher than for standard operational purposes. In the Concorde&#x27;s case, it was tested to be . It is impossible to reach for most (because of the vertical speed asymptotically approaching zero) without afterburners or other devices temporarily increasing thrust. Another factor that makes it impossible for some aircraft to reach their absolute ceiling, even with temporary increases in thrust, is the aircraft reaching the &quot;coffin corner&quot;. Flight at the absolute ceiling is also not economically advantageous due to the low indicated airspeed which can be sustained: although the true airspeed at an altitude is typically greater than indicated airspeed (IAS), the difference is not enough to compensate for the fact that IAS at which minimum drag is achieved is usually low, so a flight at an absolute ceiling altitude results in a low TAS as well, and therefore in a high fuel burn rate per distance traveled. The absolute ceiling varies with the air temperature and, overall, the aircraft weight (usually calculated at MTOW).

<doc id="403617" wikidata="Q2602165" url="?curid=403617" title="Marion Zioncheck">
<text>Marion Anthony Zioncheck (born Marjan Antoni Zajaczek; December 5, 1900 – August 7, 1936) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1933 until his death. He represented as a Democrat.

Having struggled with his mental health during his term in Congress, Zioncheck killed himself by autodefenestration in August 1936.

==Early life==
Zioncheck was born Marjan Antoni Zajaczek in Kęty, Austria-Hungary (now in Poland), the son of Clemens and Frances (née Wlodiga) Zajaccek (later Zioncheck). His family immigrated to the United States in 1904, and they settled in Seattle, Washington. He attended the University of Washington where in 1927 he became president of the student government (ASUW).

He also earned a law degree from the University of Washington while earning recognition as a left-wing leader in the Democratic Party and the Washington Commonwealth Federation. The Washington Commonwealth Federation would support his election to Congress in the 1932 election.

== Congress ==
As a U.S. Representative, Zioncheck was known mostly for ardently championing Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies. But his tireless work on behalf of the New Deal often was overshadowed by his many personal escapades, which included dancing in fountains and driving on the White House lawn. Beset by the press and by critics of Roosevelt&#x27;s policies, Zioncheck became depressed and stated that he would not seek reelection to a third term in 1936. In his diary entry for April 30, 1936, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes recounted how Zioncheck had asked him to officiate at a wedding with his fiancée, Rubye Louise Nix. Ickes demurred, saying that he had no authority to do so; he was aware of Zioncheck&#x27;s reputation and simply did not want to get involved. Ultimately, Zioncheck went to Annapolis, Maryland for the wedding and San Juan, Puerto Rico for his honeymoon. On August 1, Zioncheck&#x27;s friend and ally, King County Prosecutor Warren Magnuson, took him at his word regarding his retirement plans and filed to run for Zioncheck&#x27;s House seat.

Zioncheck&#x27;s antics attracted attention. The United Press later described him as having become a &quot;national joke&quot;.

===Stay at mental hospital===

On May 30, 1936, Zioncheck&#x27;s wife left him after an argument during a party at their apartment. On June 1, he became frantic and searched Washington, D.C. for her. He was arrested later that day on a lunacy warrant. He was confined in Gallinger Municipal Hospital Psychopathic Ward, during which his wife returned to him. Doctors blamed overwork and his hectic lifestyle.

He was later transferred to a private facility in Towson, Maryland, but escaped and fled to Washington, where he received congressional immunity.

===Suicide===
Zioncheck died after plummeting to the sidewalk from a window of his office on the fifth floor of the Arctic Building, at 3rd Avenue and Cherry Street in downtown Seattle, on August 7, 1936. He struck the pavement directly in front of a car occupied by his wife. A note was found; it read, &quot;My only hope in life was to improve the condition of an unfair economic system that held no promise to those that all the wealth of even a decent chance to survive let alone live.&quot; This was an instance of suicide by autodefenestration.

Zioncheck was mourned at his early death; both the University of Washington and Boeing closed down for half a day in his honor. He is buried in Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in Seattle.

His widow, as Rubye Nix Wilson, would later become a well-known artist, and was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and the Kennedy Center.

== Legacy ==
Zioncheck is the subject of an unpublished book-length poem by Grant Cogswell, entitled &quot;Ode to Congressman Marion Zioncheck&quot;. The story of Zioncheck, and Cogswell&#x27;s obsession with him, is detailed in Phil Campbell&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Zioncheck for President: A True Story of Idealism and Madness in American Politics&quot; (Nation Books; ). The option to make Campbell&#x27;s book into a feature film was purchased in 2007 by producer/director Stephen Gyllenhaal.

&quot;The Ballad of Marion Zioncheck&quot;, released by indie musician Left at London on her 2021 album &quot;T.I.A.P.F.Y.H.&quot;, recounts the story of Zioncheck&#x27;s life.

<text>The Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO; (OJI); ) was a Lebanese Shia militia known for its activities in the 1980s during the Lebanese Civil War.

The organization, advocating for the withdrawal of all Americans from Lebanon, claimed responsibility for a number of kidnappings, assassinations, and bombings of embassies and peacekeeping troops which killed several hundred people. Their deadliest attacks were in 1983, when they carried out the bombing of the barracks of French and U.S. MNF peacekeeping troops, and that of the United States embassy in Beirut. 

Adam Shatz described Islamic Jihad as &quot;a precursor to Hezbollah, which did not yet officially exist&quot; at the time of the bombing it took credit for.

==Origins==
Possibly formed in early 1983 and reportedly led by Imad Mughniyah, a former Lebanese Shi&#x27;ite member of Palestinian Fatah&#x27;s Force 17, the IJO was not a militia but rather a typical underground urban guerrilla organization. Based at Baalbek in the Beqaa valley, the group aligned 200 Lebanese Shi&#x27;ite militants financed by Iran and trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards&#x27; contingent previously sent by Ayatollah Khomeini to fight the June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. However, senior Iranian officials denied the alleged connections. For instance, Mehdi Karroubi claimed that Iran had not been related to the group.

==Existence==
Initially the group was described as &quot;a mysterious group about which virtually nothing was known,&quot; one whose &quot;only members&quot; seemed to be the &quot;anonymous callers&quot; taking credit for the bombings, or one that simply didn&#x27;t exist. After the MNF bombing, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Lebanese police sources, Western intelligence sources, Israeli Government sources and leading Shi&#x27;ite Muslim religious leaders in Beirut are all convinced that there is no such thing as Islamic Jihad,&quot; as an organization, no membership, no writings, etc. 

Lebanese journalist Hala Jaber compared it to &quot;a phony company which rents office space for a month and then vanishes,&quot; existing &quot;only when it was committing an atrocity against its targets ...&quot; Journalist Robin Wright has described it as &quot;more of an information network for a variety of cells of movements&quot;, rather than a centralized organization. Not all of IJ&#x27;s claims of responsibility were credible, as &quot;in some cases, the callers seemed to be exploiting the activities of groups that had no apparent ties to Islamic Jihad,&quot; while working with some success to create &quot;an aura of a single omnipotent force in the region.&quot; Wright has compared Islamic Jihad to the Black September wing of the Palestinian Fatah, serving the function of providing its controlling organization, in this case Hezbollah, with some distance and plausible deniability from acts that might provoke retaliation or other problems.

Adam Shatz of The Nation magazine has described Islamic Jihad as &quot;a precursor to Hezbollah, which did not yet officially exist&quot; at the time of the bombings Islamic Jihad took credit for. Jeffrey Goldberg states &quot;Using various names, including the Islamic Jihad Organization and the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, Hezbollah remained underground until 1985, when it published a manifesto condemning the West, and proclaiming, &#x27;... Allah is behind us supporting and protecting us while instilling fear in the hearts of our enemies.&#x27;&quot;

According to investigative journalist Ronen Bergman, &quot;Islamic Jihad&quot; was one of many aliases used by Hezbollah. A 2003 decision by an American court named Islamic Jihad as the name used by Hezbollah for its attacks in Lebanon, and parts of the Middle East, and Europe. Hezbollah itself uses the name &quot;Islamic Resistance&quot; (&quot;al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya&quot;) in its attacks against Israel.

According to Marius Deeb, by the mid-1980s Hezbollah leaders are reported to have admitted their involvement in the attacks and the nominal nature of &quot;Islamic Jihad&quot;, that it was merely a &quot;telephone organisation,&quot; and
whose name was &quot;used by those involved to disguise their true identity.&quot;

Former CIA operative and author Robert Baer describes it as the cover name used by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Baer claims the order for 1983 US embassy bombing is widely believed to have originated high up in the Iranian leadership hierarchy. According to Baer it is &quot;a very distinct organization, which was separate from Hezbollah because you had the [Hezbollah] consultative council which only had a vague idea of what the hostage-takers were doing.&quot;

Hala Jaber calls it a name &quot;deliberately contrived by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and their recruits to cast confusion.&quot; However, Wright is more circumspect saying: &quot;Islamic Jihad was clearly pro-Iranian in ideology, but some doubts existed among both Muslim moderates and Western diplomats about whether it was actually directed by Iran rather than home-grown.&quot;

More recently authors such as researcher Robert A. Pape and journalist Lawrence Wright have made no mention of Islamic Jihad and simply name Hezbollah as the author of Lebanese terror attacks claimed or attributed to Islamic Jihad: &quot;From 1982 to 1986, Hezbollah conducted 36 suicide terrorist attacks involving a total of 41 attackers against American, French, and Israeli political and military targets in Lebanon ... Altogether, these attacks killed 659 people ...&quot;

==Actions==
===Bombings and assassinations===
* 24 May 1982. Car bomb attack on French Embassy in Beirut killing 12 and wounding 27. Islamic Jihad is one of several groups taking responsibility. Anger over France&#x27;s providing of arms to Iran&#x27;s enemy Iraq is thought to be the motivating factor.
* 18 April 1983. Bombing of U.S. Embassy in Beirut. Detonated in a delivery van driven by a suicide bomber, carrying about 2000 pounds of explosives. The bomb killed 63 people, 17 of them Americans, including 9 CIA agents in Beirut for a meeting.
* 23 October 1983. MNF barracks bombing in Beirut. Two truck bombs struck buildings in Beirut housing U.S. and French members of the Multinational Force in Lebanon, killing 241 American servicemen and 58 French paratroopers. Islamic Jihad claims responsibility in a statement to Agence France Presse: &quot;We are the soldiers of God, ... We are neither Iranians, Syrian nor Palestinians, but Muslims who follow the precepts of the Koran ... We said after that [April embassy bombing] that we would strike more violently still. Now they understand with what they are dealing. Violence will remain our only way.&quot;
* 12 December 1983. 1983 Kuwait bombings. Two months after the Beirut barracks bombing. The 90-minute coordinated attack of six key foreign and Kuwaiti installations including two embassies, the airport and the country&#x27;s main petro-chemical plant, was more notable for the damage it might have caused than what was actually destroyed. What might have been &quot;the worst terrorist episode of the twentieth century in the Middle East,&quot; succeeding in killing only six people because of the bombs faulty rigging.
* 18 January 1984. Malcolm H. Kerr, president of the American University in Beirut (AUB), was assassinated near his office. He had replaced AUB president David Dodge, who was kidnapped six months earlier. A telephone message claiming to represent Islamic Jihad proclaimed: &quot;We are responsible of the assassination of the president of AUB ... We also vow that not a single American or French will remain on this soil. We shall take no different course. And we shall not waver.&quot;
* 7 February 1984. Gholam Ali Oveisi, former military governor of Tehran, and his brother were assassinated in Paris where they were in exile. An anonymous person called and told the UPI in London that the group perpetrated the assassination, stating &quot;...we shall do this wherever our opposition is abroad.&quot;
* 20 September 1984. &quot;1984 U.S. embassy annex bombing&quot;. In Christian East Beirut the US embassy was bombed by a suicide van bomber with 3000 pounds of explosives. 14 were killed, including two Americans, and dozens were injured. They had moved to a &quot;quiet residential suburb of hillside villas and luxury apartments&quot; after the 1983 bombing. Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew and visiting British Ambassador David Miers were buried under rubble but rescued with only minor injuries. Islamic Jihad took credit in an anonymous phone call vowing, &quot;The operation comes to prove that we will carry out our previous promise not to allow a single American to remain on Lebanese soil. ... we mean every inch of Lebanese territory. ...&quot;
* 12 April 1985. 1985 El Descanso bombing. The IJO claims a bombing of a Spanish restaurant aimed at American military personnel. The bomb killed 18 Spaniards and injured 82 others, including 11 American servicemen.
* 25 May 1985. Attempted assassination of Kuwaiti ruler (Emir) Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, by suicide car bomber attack of the Emir&#x27;s motorcade. Two bodyguards and a passerby are killed. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility and again demands the terrorists release.
* 22 July 1985. 1985 Copenhagen bombings. Two bombs exploded in a terrorist attack in Copenhagen, Denmark. One of the bombs exploded near the Great Synagogue and a Jewish nursing home and kindergarten, and another at the offices of Northwest Orient Airlines.
* 17 March 1992. 1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires. A suicide truck bomber smashes into the front of the Israeli Embassy destroying the embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building. 29 are killed and 242 wounded, mostly Argentinian civilians, many of them children. As of 2006 it remains the deadliest attack on an Israeli diplomatic mission. Islamic Jihad, claims responsibility, stating the attack was in retaliation for Israel&#x27;s assassination of Hezbollah leader Sayed Abbas al-Musawi.

===Unverified claims===
* 12 December 1985. Arrow Air Flight 1285 taking off from Gander, Newfoundland, crashes and burns about half a mile from the runway, killing all 256 passengers and crew on board. An anonymous caller to a French news agency in Beirut claimed that Islamic Jihad destroyed the plane to prove &quot;our ability to strike at the Americans anywhere.&quot; An investigation by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB) found that the crash was most likely an accident. However, the minority report speculated that the in-flight fire &quot;may have resulted from detonations of undetermined origin&quot;.

===Kidnappings===

* 16 March 1984. William Francis Buckley, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Beirut chief of station, was abducted on this date. Islamic Jihad claims to have killed him on 3 October 1985, and later released to a Beirut newspaper a photograph purporting to depict his corpse. Press reports stated that Buckley had been transferred to Iran, where he was tortured and killed.
* May 1984. Presbyterian minister Benjamin Weir is kidnapped by three armed men. Weir may have thought he was safe from harm from Muslims because he had lived in Lebanon since 1958. He lived in Shiite West Beirut working &quot;closely with various Muslim-oriented charity and relief groups&quot;. Two days after his abduction, a telephone message allegedly from Islamic Jihad, claiming responsibility for the abduction &quot;in order to renew our acceptance of Reagan&#x27;s challenge and to confirm our commitment of the statement ... that we will not leave any American on Lebanese soil.&quot; Weir was freed sixteen months later.
* 10 February 1986. Islamic Jihad released a photograph that claimed to show the (dead) body of French citizen Michel Seurat, who had been kidnapped earlier.
* In January 1987, Terry Waite traveled to Beirut with the intention of negotiating with Islamic Jihad to release hostages. The group violated an agreement of safe passage and kidnapped him. He was kept as a hostage until 1991.

==Decline and demise, 1986–1992==
The IJO suffered a setback in 1986 when their temporary abduction of four Soviet diplomats carried out previously in September 1985 ended up in the assassination of one hostage. The KGB promptly retaliated with intimidation and by pressuring Syria to stop its operations in northern Lebanon in exchange for release of the remaining three hostages. This fiasco, coupled by the pressure resulting from tighter security measures and joint anti-militia sweeps implemented by the Syrian Army, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) and the Shi&#x27;ite Amal militia at the Shia quarters of West Beirut in 1987–88, brought a steady decline in the organization&#x27;s activities in Lebanon for the rest of the civil war.

The last recorded attack claimed by the IJO as an independent group took place outside the Middle East in March 1992, when the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was blown up in retaliation for Israel&#x27;s assassination of Hezbollah&#x27;s secretary-general Abbas al-Musawi in February that year.

This organization is no longer active. Some reports indicate that they merged with Hezbollah afterwards, with their leader Imad Mughniyeh appointed head of that party&#x27;s overseas security apparatus. In 2008 Mughniyeh was killed by a car bomb in Damascus, Syria as a part of a CIA and Mossad combined operation.

<text>The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth is a group that claimed responsibility for kidnappings, bombings, and executions in Lebanon in the 1980s. It was considered a precursor to, or another name for, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.

== Connection to Hezbollah == 

The US, Israel, and Canada consider the names &quot;Islamic Jihad Organization&quot;, &quot;Organization of the Oppressed on Earth&quot; and the &quot;Revolutionary Justice Organization&quot; to be synonymous with Hezbollah.

Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in the &quot;New York Post&quot;:

Using various names, including the Islamic Jihad Organization and the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, Hezbollah remained underground until 1985, when it published a manifesto condemning the West, and proclaiming, &quot;Allah is behind us supporting and protecting us while instilling fear in the hearts of our enemies.&quot;

== Activities == 
=== Bombings === 

The group claimed responsibility for a 1985 bombing attack against the Madrid offices of British Airways and Trans World Airlines.

=== Kidnappings ===

The group kidnapped 4 Jews in 1985, including Isaac Sasson, leader of the Jewish community in Lebanon, and Dr. Ellie Hallaq, the community doctor. Sasson () was taken at gunpoint March 31, 1985, on his way from the Beirut International Airport, after a trip to Abu Dhabi. The group killed the abductees one-by-one.

In 1987, the group kidnapped British citizen Terry Waite who was in Lebanon as a hostage negotiator. Waite was retained in captivity for 1,763 days, the first four years of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was finally released on 18 November 1991.

In 1989, the group kidnapped and then later hung United States Lieutenant Colonel Richard Higgins. Higgins was a member of the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization observer unit and was accused of spying by his captors. A videotape was released July 31, showing his body hanging from a gallows.

<text>His Majesty the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques (abbreviation &quot;CTHM&quot;; ), or Protector of the Two Holy Cities, is a royal style that has been used officially by the monarchs of Saudi Arabia since 1986. The title has historically been used by many Muslim rulers in the past, including the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans and the Sharifain rulers of Hejaz. The title was sometimes regarded to denote the &quot;de facto&quot; Caliph of Islam, but it mainly refers to the ruler taking the responsibility of guarding and maintaining the two holiest mosques in Islam: Al-Haram Mosque (, &quot;The Sacred Mosque&quot;) in Mecca and the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque () in Medina, both of which are in the Hejazi region of Saudi Arabia. The Custodian has been named the most powerful and influential person in Islam and the Sunni branch of Islam by The Muslim 500, as well as the most powerful Muslim and Arab ruler in the world.

== History ==

It is believed that the first person to use the title was Saladin.

After defeating the Mamluks and gaining control of the Mecca and Medina in 1517, the Ottoman sultan Selim I adopted the title. Rather than style himself the &quot;Ḥākimü&#x27;l-Ḥaremeyn&quot; (, &quot;Ruler of the Two Sanctuaries&quot;), he accepted the title &quot;Ḫādimü&#x27;l-Ḥaremeyn&quot; (, &quot;Servant of the Two Sanctuaries&quot;).

The first King of Saudi Arabia to assume the title was Faisal bin Abdul Aziz (1906–1975). His successor Khalid did not use the title, but the latter&#x27;s successor Fahd did, replacing the term &quot;His Majesty&quot; with it. The current king, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, took the same title after the death of King Abdullah, his half brother, on 23 January 2015.

<doc id="403626" wikidata="Q548990" url="?curid=403626" title="Poco (band)">
<text>Poco was an American country rock band originally formed in 1968 after the demise of Buffalo Springfield. Guitarists Richie Furay and Jim Messina, former members of Buffalo Springfield, were joined by multi-instrumentalist Rusty Young, bassist Randy Meisner and drummer George Grantham. Meisner quit the band while they were recording their first album, &quot;Pickin&#x27; Up the Pieces&quot;, though his bass and backing vocal parts were kept in the final mix. He was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit in 1969, and Messina left in 1970 to be replaced by Paul Cotton. The line-up would change numerous times over the next several decades, with Rusty Young being the only constant member. A reunion of the founding members occurred in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and the band continued in some form through 2021, though they retired from active touring in 2013, with Young citing health concerns as the primary cause of his retirement. Young died from a heart attack in April 2021.

To date, the band has released 19 studio albums, the most successful of which was 1978&#x27;s &quot;Legend&quot;, which featured the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 #17 and Adult Contemporary #1 hit &quot;Crazy Love&quot;. The band&#x27;s last album was &quot;All Fired Up&quot; in 2013.

Poco are considered one of the founders of the Southern California country rock sound, and three of the members of the band have been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as members of other bands (Furay with Buffalo Springfield, Meisner and Schmit with the Eagles). However, the band has yet to receive a nomination since entering eligibility in 1995.

==History==

===Inception===
During recording of Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s third and final album, &quot;Last Time Around&quot;, lead singers Stephen Stills, Neil Young and Richie Furay each recorded songs without the other members present. One of Furay&#x27;s solo efforts was the country-influenced ballad &quot;Kind Woman&quot;, which he recorded with the help of producer/engineer/bassist Jim Messina and pedal steel guitarist Rusty Young.

When Buffalo Springfield split up, Furay, Messina and Rusty Young decided to start their own group oriented toward such songs. Its original line-up was Furay (vocals and rhythm guitar), Messina (lead guitar, vocals, producer), Rusty Young (pedal steel guitar, banjo, dobro, guitar, mandolin and vocals), George Grantham (drums and vocals) and Randy Meisner (bass and vocals). The group was signed to a recording contract with Epic Records, which acquired the rights to Furay from the Springfield&#x27;s Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco label in return for those to Graham Nash of The Hollies (who was moving to Atlantic as part of forming Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash). Originally, the new group was named &quot;Pogo&quot;, after the Pogo comic strip character, but was changed when its creator, Walt Kelly, objected and threatened to sue.

===Furay era (1969–1973)===
Their debut, &quot;Pickin&#x27; Up the Pieces&quot; (1969), is considered a pioneering album of the country rock genre. The first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by Dave Marsh and John Swenson, gave the release 5 stars, its highest rating, as an essential album. However, the album performed weakly, peaking at No. 63 on &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

The band&#x27;s line-up proved to be a problem throughout its career. During the recording of the debut album, Meisner left the group as a result of a conflict with Furay (reportedly, Meisner had objected after Furay barred all but himself and Messina from the first album&#x27;s final mix playback sessions). After a stint playing with Ricky Nelson&#x27;s Stone Canyon Band, Meisner later became a founding member of the Eagles. Messina briefly took over on bass until Timothy B. Schmit joined the band in September 1969.

Their second studio album &quot;Poco&quot; (1970) again resulted in low sales, peaking at No. 58. However, the band&#x27;s next album, the live set &quot;Deliverin&#x27;&quot; (or &quot;DeLIVErin&quot;&#x27; as it is sometimes represented), picked up moderate airplay, Furay&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;mon&quot; hitting No. 69. &quot;Deliverin’&quot; became Poco&#x27;s first album to reach the Top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 26.

Messina chose to leave the band in October 1970, feeling Furay exerted too much control over the group&#x27;s sound. He also was anxious to get off the road and return to his career in studio production. This would lead him ultimately on to Loggins &amp; Messina. At the recommendation of Peter Cetera of Chicago, Messina selected guitarist/singer Paul Cotton, a one-time member of the Illinois Speed Press, to replace him.

The realigned Poco, now on its third line-up on just its fourth album, hired Steve Cropper as producer and released &quot;From the Inside&quot; (1971). Again, poor sales were the result as the release landed at No. 52.

The band and its management were dissatisfied with Cropper&#x27;s production and hired Canadian Jack Richardson, who&#x27;d had big success with The Guess Who and oversaw the next three albums, beginning with &quot;A Good Feelin&#x27; to Know&quot; (1972). The band built the LP around the title track, a popular concert tune, but the single failed to chart. The album itself peaked at No. 69. As a result, Furay became increasingly discouraged with Poco&#x27;s prospects, especially since ex-bandmates Stills, Young, Meisner and Messina were so successful with their respective groups. In an April 26, 1973 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview with Cameron Crowe, he vented that Poco was still a second-billed act and had not increased its audience.

The next album, &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot; (1973), reached No. 38 but Furay departed at its release and joined with JD Souther and Chris Hillman to create the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band on Asylum Records. Poco decided not to replace Furay and continued as a quartet.

===Post-Furay era (1973–1977)===
After Furay&#x27;s departure, the band released their last two albums with Epic; &quot;Seven&quot; (1974) and &quot;Cantamos&quot; (1974). The albums charted at No. 68 and No. 76 respectively. Poco left Epic after &quot;Cantamos&quot; and signed with ABC-Dunhill Records.

&quot;Head Over Heels&quot; was their first ABC release, featuring Schmit&#x27;s acoustic &quot;Keep On Tryin&quot; which became the group&#x27;s most successful single to date, charting at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Around the time of the release of &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, &quot;The Very Best of Poco&quot; was released as a compilation album that documented the group&#x27;s years with Epic. Epic&#x27;s release fought with &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; for attention though neither charted very well, hitting No. 43 and No. 90, respectively.

The group&#x27;s next ABC album was &quot;Rose Of Cimarron&quot; which also failed to generate much enthusiasm and peaked at No. 89. Another Epic release also came out in 1976, the live album &quot;Live&quot;.

Al Garth (ex-Loggins and Messina), who guested on &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; and &quot;Rose of Cimarron&quot;, was added to the group&#x27;s 1976 touring line up on sax and violin, but was gone by the end of that year.

In the summer of 1976, the group was on the bill with the Stills-Young Band teaming but was left high and dry when Neil Young pulled out of the tour, which was then canceled.

&quot;Indian Summer&quot; was released the following spring, peaking at No. 57, while the title track reached No. 50. The appearance of Steely Dan&#x27;s Donald Fagen playing synthesizer on two of the album&#x27;s tracks marked a move away from the country rock sound the band had primarily been known for.

===Success (1977–1980)===
In August 1977 Schmit quit to join the Eagles, coincidentally replacing former Poco member Meisner yet again. As a result, a fully produced live album recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in July 1977 was shelved by ABC. After languishing in storage for many years, the album was eventually released by John Thaler and Futuredge Music in partnership with Universal Special Projects as &quot;The Last Roundup&quot; in 2004.

After Schmit&#x27;s departure, Poco decided to take a break. Grantham took some time off, while Young and Cotton decided to continue as the Cotton-Young Band and redoubled their efforts to succeed. They selected the Britons Steve Chapman (drums) and Charlie Harrison (bass, backing vocals; formerly of Judas Jump), both of whom had played together with Leo Sayer and Al Stewart, to round out their new quartet. However, ABC decided to pick up the Cotton-Young album — as long as they continued under the Poco name. Thus, although Grantham had never quit Poco, he found himself bought out of the group after he was not happy with the changes in its business setup, including the group&#x27;s publishing no longer being divided evenly. After a stint with McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman, he subsequently landed a job as drummer for Ricky Skaggs.

&quot;Legend&quot; (1978), the Cotton-Young album with cover art by graphic artist (and later comedy actor) Phil Hartman, subsequently became the group&#x27;s most commercially successful LP, containing two Top 20 hits, &quot;Crazy Love&quot; written and sung by Rusty Young (which also had a seven-week run at Number 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart in early 1979, the biggest hit on the AC chart that year) and Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Heart of the Night&quot;. The album was certified gold, Poco&#x27;s first album to achieve this distinction in original distribution.

Kim Bullard (keyboards, backing vocals) joined the band in December 1978 just after &quot;Legend&quot; was released. While &quot;Crazy Love&quot; was riding up the charts in early 1979, ABC Records was sold to MCA Records. Poco was retained by MCA and the &quot;Legend&quot; album was reissued on the MCA label.

With the momentum built up from &quot;Legend&quot;&#x27;s success, Poco were invited by the Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) collective to play during their concerts at Madison Square Garden in September 1979. And their new hit &quot;Heart of the Night&quot; appeared on the resulting live album &quot;No Nukes&quot;, the concerts and album all being in support of nuclear-free energy. Both the concerts and the album also featured several other big artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Jackson Browne.

===1980–1999===

During the first half of the 1980s, the group released five more albums: &quot;Under the Gun&quot; (1980), &quot;Blue And Gray&quot; (1981), &quot;Cowboys &amp; Englishmen&quot; (1982) on MCA and, moving over to Atlantic Records, &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (1982) and &quot;Inamorata&quot; (1984). Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by &quot;Legend&quot;, with each album performing more poorly than its predecessor.

Poco also contributed the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Leave it Up to You&quot; to &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack in 1982.

On &quot;Inamorata&quot; the band mostly played down their &quot;Country rock&quot; sound to adopt more of an &quot;80s style&quot; with more keyboards and glossy synth sounds as well as electronic drums. The album also featured guest spots by former members Timothy B. Schmit, Richie Furay and George Grantham.

The group lost its recording contract with Atlantic due to the slow sales of &quot;Inamorata&quot; but continued to tour, mostly in small clubs. Bullard left to rejoin Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash in 1983 (but still appeared on the sessions for &quot;Inamorata&quot;) and Harrison (who had not played on &quot;Inamorata&quot;) departed in mid-1984. New members Jeff Steele (bass) and Rick Seratte (keyboards, backing vocals) came in for Poco&#x27;s 1984 tour dates, but they departed, along with drummer Chapman, to be replaced in 1985 by future Great Plains front man Jack Sundrud (vocals, bass, guitar) and the returning Grantham. Grantham&#x27;s reunion with Poco was brief, though; In late 1985, Steve Wariner asked him to join his band. Chapman came back to take over drums again. During this period, the band relocated to Nashville and recorded some demos, though no record deal resulted. And after a few scattered live dates for the group in 1986 and 1987, Paul Cotton pursued a solo career and did not perform with Poco again until 1992, while Young played in Vince Gill&#x27;s band.

After a lengthy recording hiatus, at the urging of Richard Marx and his manager Allen Kovac who took on Poco, the band re-emerged on the RCA label with the successful &quot;Legacy&quot; (1989), reuniting original members Young, Furay, Messina, Grantham and Meisner twenty years after Poco&#x27;s debut. Though Timothy B. Schmit and Paul Cotton were also approached to appear on the project, Schmit declined and Cotton, who was busy with his solo career, was bought out of the group and it ended up being only the five originals. The album produced a Top 20 hit, &quot;Call It Love,&quot; in the fall of 1989 and another Top 40 hit, &quot;Nothing to Hide,&quot; in early 1990, earning Poco its second gold album (in its 19th release).

The group (having added a keyboardist, Dave Vanacore) toured in early 1990 opening for Marx and appeared at Farm Aid IV on April 7, 1990, at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana. But Furay, now a church minister in Colorado, then had to bow out due to his commitments and Poco toured as a headliner in the summer of 1990 with Sundrud returning to take over rhythm guitar from Furay.

Despite &quot;Legacy&quot;&#x27;s gold status and the two hit singles, the band did not make much money on their 1990 tour, one of the problems being their booking into military bases that turned out to be mostly empty, as the troops were all deployed for the Desert Shield operation in the Persian Gulf. RCA ended up dropping them from their roster and recordings for a proposed follow up to &quot;Legacy&quot; were abandoned.

In 1991 Poco toured as an acoustic trio with Young, Messina and Meisner (drummer Gary Mallaber joined them for dates in Japan that July), mostly to make up dates that were missed the previous year. But by the end of 1991, Messina and Meisner had returned to their individual careers.

After Messina and Meisner left, Young formed a side project, Four Wheel Drive, with John Cowan (from New Grass Revival), Bill Lloyd (from Foster &amp; Lloyd) and Patrick Simmons (of Doobie Brothers). They were signed to a recording deal with RCA Nashville and completed an album which was never released. Warner Bros. Records then picked up the group in 1993, but when they were threatened with lawsuits from bands who had already copyrighted the name Four Wheel Drive, they changed the band&#x27;s name to The Sky Kings. But their one and only album (minus Simmons who left when the Doobies schedule got too busy), completed in 1997, was not released until 2000, three years after the group disbanded.

In the meantime, Rusty Young was the sole owner of the Poco name by early 1992 and, though they had not officially disbanded, the band seemed to be quietly fading away. Despite this, Young once again teamed with Cotton, brought in new members Richard Neville (vocals, bass) and Tim Smith (drums) and toured through the end of the decade, although on a very limited schedule. Young and Cotton also occasionally appeared as Poco as an acoustic duo.

On September 16, 1995, Poco appeared at Deadwood Jam in Deadwood, South Dakota, where former Loggins &amp; Messina drummer Merel Bregante filled in for Tim Smith.

===2000–2013===
Poco again became more active as a touring unit after they signed with Nashville manager Rick Alter and brought back Grantham and Sundrud in June 2000, reuniting the group&#x27;s 1985 line-up.

&quot;Running Horse&quot; (2002) found the band in the studio for the first time in thirteen years. The CD was released through the band&#x27;s website. Furay, who had continued to make guest appearances at their shows over the years when they played in his adopted home-state of Colorado, reunited with the band again for a sold-out show in Nashville in May 2004, resulting in the CD–DVD release &quot;Keeping the Legend Alive&quot; (2004).

On July 29 of that same year, during a show at Stearns Square in Springfield, Massachusetts, Grantham suffered a stroke during the performance. For their gig the following night at Barnstable County Fair in East Falmouth, MA, Poco brought in local drummer Chuck Woodhams, then called Young&#x27;s Nashville neighbor, Muscle Shoals Sound Studio drummer George Lawrence (who had earlier stood in for Tim Smith at some Poco concerts in June 1999) to sub on drums for Grantham for the rest of 2004. He became a permanent member in 2005. Grantham&#x27;s recovery was slow and expensive and the group created a donor fund on its official website, Poconut.org, to offset some of his considerable medical expenses.

Poco continued to write and record while performing at festivals, performing arts centers, theaters and clubs. In 2005 they played a short tour in Europe, but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour. Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd, of duo Foster &amp; Lloyd, substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US.

Cotton returned in 2006, stabilizing the line-up of Young, Cotton, Sundrud and drummer George Lawrence. Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums and Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band. Poco alumni continued to periodically reunite in concert with this line-up.

Beginning in 2009, Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only. Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in Steelville, Missouri, a tour of California in 2009 ending at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio (where they were joined by Grantham and Timothy B. Schmit) and several dates opening for Loggins and Messina featuring Furay, Messina and Grantham.

&quot;Bareback at Big Sky&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Wildwood Sessions&quot; (2006) captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40-plus year career. &quot;Live at Columbia Studios, Hollywood 9/30/71&quot; (2010) unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay, Young, Schmit, Grantham and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends.

In early 2010, Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly, publicly citing a financial dispute with Young. On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts, stating &quot;It was not all that shocking when Rusty told me on February 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years and that this was goodbye...&quot; On March 12, 2010, Young responded on Poco&#x27;s official website: &quot;It was a sad day when I read on Paul&#x27;s website that he wasn&#x27;t coming to Wildwood and I guess that means he&#x27;s leaving the band.&quot; Poco immediately reformed with Young, Sundrud, Lawrence and new keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist/singer Michael Webb of Nashville, Tennessee.

The band&#x27;s new incarnation continued to tour and record. In early 2012, a live video of a new song, &quot;Neil Young&quot;, was released on YouTube as a teaser for a new studio album, &quot;All Fired Up&quot;, that was recorded in Nashville and released in March 2013. Selling on iTunes, the band&#x27;s website and through a distributor in Europe, Young, Sundrud and Webb penned all the songs on the self-produced album.

In its 45th year, Rusty Young was the only original member in the band and remained the leader and front man on stage. He has been the only member of Poco to have performed at every gig and played on every recording since the band&#x27;s inception in 1968.

===Retirement===
At the end of 2013, Rusty Young announced his retirement. At the age of 68, he said he had spent 45 years on the road in the same band and needed a break. A few shows were booked into 2014, including three farewell shows in Florida. One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD documentary of the band&#x27;s live show. Young said there could be some one-offs in the future after that, but the band would not be actively touring as before. Young was finishing his memoirs for a book to be published. He and Sundrud wrote and recorded music for children&#x27;s story videos as the &quot;Session Cats&quot;. Lawrence, Sundrud and Webb continued to write, record and play in their own projects, and to do freelance work with other artists in Nashville, where they live. Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists.

Poco was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame (CMHOF) with the CMHOF induction ceremony which took place at the Paramount Theatre (Denver, Colorado) on January 9, 2015, and included a performance by the following line-up of band members: Paul Cotton, Richie Furay, Timothy B. Schmit, and Rusty Young. Also inducted into the CMHOF along with Poco were Firefall, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Stephen Stills and Manassas.

From 2015 through 2021, though not touring full-time, Poco continued to play isolated dates around the US. In 2016 drummer Lawrence was replaced by Rick Lonow (formerly of The Flying Burrito Brothers). Lex Browning, Jack Sundrud&#x27;s former bandmate in Great Plains, replaced Michael Webb on guitar in the fall of 2018.

In early 2020, Poco friend and fan Tom Hampton was brought in by Sundrud to replace Browning for tour dates, but touring was suddenly halted in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rusty Young died on April 14, 2021, at his home in Davisville, Missouri, from a heart attack. He was 75. His death marked the end for Poco.

Three and a half months after Rusty Young&#x27;s April 2021 death, his former partner in the band, Paul Cotton, died at his summer home in Eugene, Oregon, at age 78 on August 1, 2021.

Fans and surviving band members have released the tribute album &quot;My Friend: A Tribute To Rusty Young&quot;, in March 2022 and there was a reunion/tribute &quot;Poconut&quot; concert on October 8, 2022, in Steelville, Missouri, near Young&#x27;s home, where the surviving members of the band&#x27;s final lineup, Jack Sundrud, Tom Hampton and Rick Lonow, were joined by original drummer George Grantham, who guested on harmony vocals, and Michael Kelsh. It is unclear if this performance can be considered the final performance by Poco or if that technically occurred prior to Rusty Young&#x27;s death in 2021.

===Selected studio reissues===
In 1997 &quot;From the Inside&quot; and &quot;A Good Feelin&#x27; to Know&quot; were reissued on CD by BGO, a British label. However, the reissue had some problems, as it appeared the tape used to remaster &quot;From the Inside&quot; had significant damage to it. &quot;Pickin&#x27; Up the Pieces&quot; and &quot;Poco&quot;, the band&#x27;s first and second albums, were also reissued during this time, with no noticeable damage to the master tapes. The notes give a brief history of the band and the recording of each album.

In 2006 BGO reissued four more albums, with two albums on each CD: &quot;Seven&quot; with &quot;Cantamos&quot;, the band&#x27;s seventh and eighth albums, and &quot;Deliverin&#x27;&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live album, with &quot;Crazy Eyes&quot;. Neither set had any bonus tracks as part of the reissue, although there are extensive sleeve notes about Poco&#x27;s history and the making of the album. The reissues were remastered by Jack Thompson, although it does not note whether or not these were remastered from the original master tapes or the safety masters as previous CDs were.

In 2011 BGO licensed and reissued remastered editions of four of Poco&#x27;s ABC/MCA titles, again remastered by Thompson, putting two albums on each CD, with extensive liner notes written by John Tobler. The pairings were &quot;Head over Heels&quot; with &quot;Rose of Cimarron&quot;, and &quot;Under the Gun&quot; with &quot;Blue and Gray&quot;. No bonus tracks or outtakes were included.

<text>Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. It ranges widely, from the number of species to differences within species, and can be correlated to the span of survival for a species. It is distinguished from &quot;genetic variability&quot;, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary.

Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The population will continue for more generations because of the success of these individuals.

The academic field of population genetics includes several hypotheses and theories regarding genetic diversity. The neutral theory of evolution proposes that diversity is the result of the accumulation of neutral substitutions. Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in different environments that select for different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a large range relative to the mobility of individuals within it. Frequency-dependent selection is the hypothesis that as alleles become more common, they become more vulnerable. This occurs in host–pathogen interactions, where a high frequency of a defensive allele among the host means that it is more likely that a pathogen will spread if it is able to overcome that allele.
==Within-species diversity==
A study conducted by the National Science Foundation in 2007 found that genetic diversity (within-species diversity) and biodiversity are dependent upon each other — i.e. that diversity within a species is necessary to maintain diversity among species, and vice versa. According to the lead researcher in the study, Dr. Richard Lankau, &quot;If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down, and the community becomes dominated by a single species.&quot; Genotypic and phenotypic diversity have been found in all species at the protein, DNA, and organismal levels; in nature, this diversity is nonrandom, heavily structured, and correlated with environmental variation and stress.

The interdependence between genetic and species diversity is delicate. Changes in species diversity lead to changes in the environment, leading to adaptation of the remaining species. Changes in genetic diversity, such as in loss of species, leads to a loss of biological diversity. Loss of genetic diversity in domestic animal populations has also been studied and attributed to the extension of markets and economic globalization.

== Neutral and adaptive genetic diversity ==

Neutral genetic diversity consists of genes that do not increase fitness and are not responsible for adaptability. Natural selection does not act on these neutral genes. Adaptive genetic diversity consists of genes that increase fitness and are responsible for adaptability to changes in the environment. Adaptive genes are responsible for ecological, morphological, and behavioral traits. Natural selection acts on adaptive genes which allows the organisms to evolve. The rate of evolution on adaptive genes is greater than on neutral genes due to the influence of selection. However, it has been difficult to identify alleles for adaptive genes and thus adaptive genetic diversity is most often measured indirectly. For example, heritability can be measured as formula_1 or adaptive population differentiation can be measured as formula_2. It may be possible to identify adaptive genes through genome-wide association studies by analyzing genomic data at the population level. 

Identifying adaptive genetic diversity is important for conservation because the adaptive potential of a species may dictate whether it survives or becomes extinct, especially as the climate changes. This is magnified by a lack of understanding whether low neutral genetic diversity is correlated with high genetic drift and high mutation load. In a review of current research, Teixeira and Huber (2021), discovered some species, such as those in the genus &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, appear to have high adaptive potential despite suffering from low genetic diversity overall due to severe bottlenecks. Therefore species with low neutral genetic diversity may possess high adaptive genetic diversity, but since it is difficult to identify adaptive genes, a measurement of overall genetic diversity is important for planning conservation efforts and a species that has experienced a rapid decline in genetic diversity may be highly susceptible to extinction. 

==Evolutionary importance of genetic diversity==

=== Adaptation ===
Variation in the populations gene pool allows natural selection to act upon traits that allow the population to adapt to changing environments. Selection for or against a trait can occur with changing environment – resulting in an increase in genetic diversity (if a new mutation is selected for and maintained) or a decrease in genetic diversity (if a disadvantageous allele is selected against). Hence, genetic diversity plays an important role in the survival and adaptability of a species. The capability of the population to adapt to the changing environment will depend on the presence of the necessary genetic diversity. The more genetic diversity a population has, the more likelihood the population will be able to adapt and survive. Conversely, the vulnerability of a population to changes, such as climate change or novel diseases will increase with reduction in genetic diversity. For example, the inability of koalas to adapt to fight Chlamydia and the koala retrovirus (KoRV) has been linked to the koala&#x27;s low genetic diversity. This low genetic diversity also has geneticists concerned for the koalas&#x27; ability to adapt to climate change and human-induced environmental changes in the future.

=== Small populations ===
Large populations are more likely to maintain genetic material and thus generally have higher genetic diversity. Small populations are more likely to experience the loss of diversity over time by random chance, which is an example of genetic drift. When an allele (variant of a gene) drifts to fixation, the other allele at the same locus is lost, resulting in a loss in genetic diversity. In small population sizes, inbreeding, or mating between individuals with similar genetic makeup, is more likely to occur, thus perpetuating more common alleles to the point of fixation, thus decreasing genetic diversity. Concerns about genetic diversity are therefore especially important with large mammals due to their small population size and high levels of human-caused population effects.[16]

A genetic bottleneck can occur when a population goes through a period of low number of individuals, resulting in a rapid decrease in genetic diversity. Even with an increase in population size, the genetic diversity often continues to be low if the entire species began with a small population, since beneficial mutations (see below) are rare, and the gene pool is limited by the small starting population. This is an important consideration in the area of conservation genetics, when working toward a rescued population or species that is genetically healthy.

=== Mutation ===
Random mutations consistently generate genetic variation. A mutation will increase genetic diversity in the short term, as a new gene is introduced to the gene pool. However, the persistence of this gene is dependent of drift and selection (see above). Most new mutations either have a neutral or negative effect on fitness, while some have a positive effect. A beneficial mutation is more likely to persist and thus have a long-term positive effect on genetic diversity. Mutation rates differ across the genome, and larger populations have greater mutation rates. In smaller populations a mutation is less likely to persist because it is more likely to be eliminated by drift. 

=== Gene flow ===
Gene flow, often by migration, is the movement of genetic material (for example by pollen in the wind, or the migration of a bird). Gene flow can introduce novel alleles to a population. These alleles can be integrated into the population, thus increasing genetic diversity.

For example, an insecticide-resistant mutation arose in &quot;Anopheles gambiae&quot; African mosquitoes. Migration of some &quot;A. gambiae&quot; mosquitoes to a population of &quot;Anopheles coluzziin&quot; mosquitoes resulted in a transfer of the beneficial resistance gene from one species to the other. The genetic diversity was increased in &quot;A. gambiae&quot; by mutation and in &quot;A. coluzziin&quot; by gene flow.

==In agriculture==
===In crops===
When humans initially started farming, they used selective breeding to pass on desirable traits of the crops while omitting the undesirable ones. Selective breeding leads to monocultures: entire farms of nearly genetically identical plants. Little to no genetic diversity makes crops extremely susceptible to widespread disease; bacteria morph and change constantly and when a disease-causing bacterium changes to attack a specific genetic variation, it can easily wipe out vast quantities of the species. If the genetic variation that the bacterium is best at attacking happens to be that which humans have selectively bred to use for harvest, the entire crop will be wiped out.

The nineteenth-century Great Famine in Ireland was caused in part by a lack of biodiversity. Since new potato plants do not come as a result of reproduction, but rather from pieces of the parent plant, no genetic diversity is developed, and the entire crop is essentially a clone of one potato, it is especially susceptible to an epidemic. In the 1840s, much of Ireland&#x27;s population depended on potatoes for food. They planted namely the &quot;lumper&quot; variety of potato, which was susceptible to a rot-causing oomycete called &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;. The fungus destroyed the vast majority of the potato crop, and left one million people to starve to death.

Genetic diversity in agriculture does not only relate to disease, but also herbivores. Similarly, to the above example, monoculture agriculture selects for traits that are uniform throughout the plot. If this genotype is susceptible to certain herbivores, this could result in the loss of a large portion of the crop. One way farmers get around this is through inter-cropping. By planting rows of unrelated, or genetically distinct crops as barriers between herbivores and their preferred host plant, the farmer effectively reduces the ability of the herbivore to spread throughout the entire plot.

===In livestock===

The genetic diversity of livestock species permits animal husbandry in a range of environments and with a range of different objectives. It provides the raw material for selective breeding programmes and allows livestock populations to adapt as environmental conditions change.

Livestock biodiversity can be lost as a result of breed extinctions and other forms of genetic erosion. As of June 2014, among the 8,774 breeds recorded in the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS), operated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 17 percent were classified as being at risk of extinction and 7 percent already extinct. There is now a Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources that was developed under the auspices of the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in 2007, that provides a framework and guidelines for the management of animal genetic resources.

Awareness of the importance of maintaining animal genetic resources has increased over time. FAO has published two reports on the state of the world&#x27;s animal genetic resources for food and agriculture, which cover detailed analyses of our global livestock diversity and ability to manage and conserve them.

== Viral implications ==
High genetic diversity in viruses must be considered when designing vaccinations. High genetic diversity results in difficulty in designing targeted vaccines, and allows for viruses to quickly evolve to resist vaccination lethality. For example, malaria vaccinations are impacted by high levels of genetic diversity in the protein antigens. In addition, HIV-1 genetic diversity limits the use of currently available viral load and resistance tests.

Coronavirus populations have considerable evolutionary diversity due to mutation and homologous recombination. For example, the sequencing of 86 SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus samples obtained from infected patients revealed 93 mutations indicating the presence of considerable genetic diversity. Replication of the coronavirus RNA genome is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. During replication this polymerase may undergo template switching, a form of homologous recombination. This process which also generates genetic diversity appears to be an adaptation for coping with RNA genome damage.

== Coping with low genetic diversity ==
=== Natural ===

The natural world has several ways of preserving or increasing genetic diversity. Among oceanic plankton, viruses aid in the genetic shifting process. Ocean viruses, which infect the plankton, carry genes of other organisms in addition to their own. When a virus containing the genes of one cell infects another, the genetic makeup of the latter changes. This constant shift of genetic makeup helps to maintain a healthy population of plankton despite complex and unpredictable environmental changes.

Cheetahs are a threatened species. Low genetic diversity and resulting poor sperm quality has made breeding and survivorship difficult for cheetahs. Moreover, only about 5% of cheetahs survive to adulthood. However, it has been recently discovered that female cheetahs can mate with more than one male per litter of cubs. They undergo induced ovulation, which means that a new egg is produced every time a female mates. By mating with multiple males, the mother increases the genetic diversity within a single litter of cubs.

=== Human intervention ===
Attempts to increase the viability of a species by increasing genetic diversity is called genetic rescue. For example, eight panthers from Texas were introduced to the Florida panther population, which was declining and suffering from inbreeding depression. Genetic variation was thus increased and resulted in a significant increase in population growth of the Florida Panther. Creating or maintaining high genetic diversity is an important consideration in species rescue efforts, in order to ensure the longevity of a population.

==Measures==
Genetic diversity of a population can be assessed by some simple measures.
*Gene diversity is the proportion of polymorphic loci across the genome.
*Heterozygosity is the fraction of individuals in a population that are heterozygous for a particular locus.
*Alleles per locus is also used to demonstrate variability.
*Nucleotide diversity is the extent of nucleotide polymorphisms within a population, and is commonly measured through molecular markers such as micro- and minisatellite sequences, mitochondrial DNA, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Furthermore, stochastic simulation software is commonly used to predict the future of a population given measures such as allele frequency and population size.

Genetic diversity can also be measured. The various recorded ways of measuring genetic diversity include:

* Species richness is a measure of the number of species
* Species abundance a relative measure of the abundance of species
* Species density an evaluation of the total number of species per unit area

<text>The Parable of the Prodigal Son (also known as the parable of the Two Brothers, Lost Son, Loving Father, or of the Forgiving Father; ) is one of the parables of Jesus in the Bible, appearing in Luke 15:11–32. In Luke 15, Jesus tells this story, along with those of a man with 100 sheep and a woman with ten coins, to a group of Pharisees and religious leaders who criticized him for welcoming and eating with tax collectors and others seen as sinners.

The Prodigal Son is the third and final parable of a cycle on redemption, following the parables of the Lost Sheep and the Lost Coin. In the Revised Common Lectionary and Roman Rite Catholic Lectionary, this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of Lent (in Year C); in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the Sunday of the Prodigal Son.

==Narrative==
The parable begins with a wealthy man who has two sons, the younger of whom asks for his share of the man&#x27;s estate. The implication is that the son did not want to wait for his father&#x27;s death to receive his inheritance but instead wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between the two sons.

Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country, where he squanders his wealth through reckless living. He runs out of money just before a severe famine strikes the land, leaving him desperately poor and forced to take a filthy and low-paying job as a swineherd. He reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is feeding. At this time, he finally comes to his senses:

This implies that the father was watching hopefully for the son&#x27;s return. The son starts his rehearsed speech, admitting his sins, and declaring himself unworthy of being his father&#x27;s son but does not even finish before his father accepts him back without hesitation. The father calls for his servants to dress the son in the finest robe and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet and to slaughter the &quot;fatted calf&quot; for a celebratory meal.

The older son, who was at work in the fields, hears the sound of celebration and is told by a slave about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed and becomes angry. He also has a speech for his father:

The parable stops with the father explaining that while the older son has always been present and that everything the father owns also belongs to the older son, because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary:


==Interpretation==
The opening, &quot;A man had two sons&quot; is a storyteller&#x27;s trope and would immediately bring to mind Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, and Jacob and Esau. Jesus then confounds the listeners&#x27; expectations when the younger son is shown to be foolish.

While a number of commentators see the request of the younger son for his share of the inheritance as &quot;brash, even insolent&quot; and &quot;tantamount to wishing that the father was dead,&quot; Jewish legal scholar Bernard Jackson says &quot;Jewish sources give no support to [the idea] that the prodigal, in seeking the advance, wishes his father dead.&quot;

The young man&#x27;s actions do not lead to success; he squanders his inheritance and he eventually becomes an indentured servant, with the degrading job of looking after pigs, and even envying them for the carob pods they eat. This recalls Proverbs 29:3: &quot;Whoever loves wisdom gives joy to his father, but whoever consorts with harlots squanders his wealth.&quot;

Upon his return, his father treats the young man with a generosity far more than he has a right to expect. He is given the best robe, a ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet. Jewish philosopher Philo observes:

The Pesikta Rabbati has a similar story:

The older son, in contrast, seems to think in terms of &quot;law, merit, and reward,&quot; rather than &quot;love and graciousness.&quot; He may represent the Pharisees who were criticizing Jesus.

Leviticus Rabbah 13:4 also contains a short saying that matches the character of the parable:

The last few verses of the parable summarize the tale in accordance with the Jewish teaching of the two ways of acting: the way of life (obedience) and the way of death (sin). God, according to Judaism, rejoices over and grants more graces to repentant sinners than righteous souls who do not need repentance.

Following the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin, this is the last of three parables about loss and redemption that Jesus tells after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with &quot;sinners.&quot; The father&#x27;s joy described in the parable reflects divine love: the &quot;boundless mercy of God,&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s refusal to limit the measure of his grace.&quot;

===Catholic===
Justus Knecht, like others, breaks this parable into three parts, noting that, &quot;The father in the parable signifies God; the elder son, the just; and the younger son, the sinner.&quot; In the first part:

Roger Baxter in his &quot;Meditations&quot; describes the second part:

===Orthodox===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the parable of the Prodigal Son is central to the Christian understanding emphasizing God&#x27;s boundless love for humanity. Archpriest Victor Potapov encapsulates this as &quot;a multitude of themes...difficult to enumerate&quot;, including the historical contrast between God&#x27;s chosen people and the pagans, the nature of sin (one reason why the parable is read on the third Sunday before Great Lent, also including the subsequent fasting time to encourage spiritual discipline and refreshment), and the process and blessings of repentance. The Father&#x27;s forgiving embrace represents God&#x27;s joy in receiving sinners who return to Him with humility and remorse. It is as an allegory of the Church, with elements like baptism and the Eucharist symbolized through the Father&#x27;s gifts to his son.

As Fr. Potapov cites, Saint Theophan the Recluse compares the sinner with a man sunk into a deep sleep, and in his turning to God he notes three psychological moments that correspond to the parable&#x27;s events: 1. Awakening from the sleep of sin (); 2. The ripening of resolve to forsake sin and dedicate himself to pleasing God (); 3. Investing the sinner with divine power for this in the &quot;Mysteries of Repentance and Communion&quot;.

Fr. James Guirguis puts the message in both plainspoken terms, yet also quoting Saint Tikhon of Zadonsk:
==Commemoration and use==
===Orthodox===
The Eastern Orthodox Church traditionally reads this story on the Sunday of the Prodigal Son, which in their liturgical year is the Sunday before Meatfare Sunday and about two weeks before the beginning of Great Lent. One common hymn of the occasion reads:

===Roman Catholic===
In his 1984 apostolic exhortation titled, in Latin, (&#x27;Reconciliation and Penance&#x27;), Pope John Paul II used this parable to explain the process of conversion and reconciliation. Emphasizing that God the Father is &quot;rich in mercy&quot; and always ready to forgive, he stated that reconciliation is a &quot;gift on his part&quot;. He stated that for the Church her &quot;mission of reconciliation is the initiative, full of compassionate love and mercy, of that God who is love.&quot; He also explored the issues raised by this parable in his second encyclical, (&#x27;Rich in Mercy&#x27;), issued in 1980.

==In the arts==
===Visual art===
Of the roughly 30 parables in the canonical Gospels, the Parable of the Prodigal Son was one of four that were shown in medieval art—along with that of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, the Dives and Lazarus, and the Good Samaritan—almost to the exclusion of the others, though not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;. (The Laborers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works.)

Scenes of the prodigal son were a popular subject in Northern Renaissance art. Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s 1496 engraving is a famous example. In the seventeenth-century, Rembrandt depicted several scenes from the parable, especially the final episode, which he etched, drew, or painted on several occasions during his career. At least one of Rembrandt&#x27;s works—&quot;The Prodigal Son in the Tavern&quot;, is a portrait of himself as the son reveling with his wife.

&quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; is a sculpture in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, by George Grey Barnard that depicts the loving reunion of the father and son from the &quot;Parable of the Prodigal Son.&quot;

===Theater===
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the theme was such a sufficiently popular subject that the &#x27;Prodigal Son play&#x27; can be seen as a subgenre of the English morality play. Examples include &quot;The Rare Triumphs of Love and Fortune&quot;, &quot;The Disobedient Child&quot;, and &quot;Acolastus&quot;.

===Notable adaptations for performance===

*Many of these adaptations added to the original Biblical material to lengthen the story. For example, &quot;The Prodigal&quot; (1955) film took considerable liberties, such as adding a temptress priestess of Astarte to the tale.

===Literature===

Another literary tribute to this parable is Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming&quot;, in which he describes his own spiritual journey infused with understanding, based on an encounter with Rembrandt&#x27;s painting that depicts the son&#x27;s return. The book deals with three personages: the younger, prodigal son; the self-righteous, resentful older son; and the compassionate father—all of whom the author identifies with personally. An earlier work with similarities to the parable is &quot;Le retour de l&#x27;enfant prodigue&quot; (&#x27;The Return of the Prodigal Son&#x27;), a short story by André Gide.

Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem giving an interpretation of the younger brother&#x27;s perspective. The poem appears as the heading to the fifth chapter, titled &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, of his 1901 novel &quot;Kim&quot;.

The Parable is a recurring theme in the works of Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted it in a different way to the conventional reading. Rilke&#x27;s version is not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family: the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned.

The theme of the Prodigal Son plays a major role in Anne Tyler&#x27;s novel &quot;A Spool of Blue Thread&quot;.

The parable is also referred to in two comedies by William Shakespeare, specifically &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;, as well as in Shakespeare&#x27;s romance, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

In one of his clemency petitions to the Bombay Presidency in 1913, the Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar described himself as a &quot;prodigal son&quot; longing to return to the &quot;parental doors of the government&quot;.

==Similar parable in Mahayana Buddhism==
A parable of a lost son can also be found in the Mahayana Buddhist &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. The two parables share the premise of a father and son being reunited after a time apart, and several scholars have assumed that one version has influenced the other or that both texts share a common origin. However, an influence of the biblical story on the Lotus sutra is very unlikely given the early dating of the stratum of the sutra containing the Buddhist parable.

Both parables document a son who leaves a father. In the Lotus sutra, there is a lapse of decades after which the poor son no longer recognises his wealthy father and is terrified of his father&#x27;s accumulated power and wealth. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship, providing him with a heap of straw to sleep on and employment clearing a pile of dirt. 

As the decades pass, the father gradually conditions the son to his company and gets him accustomed to special honors. Close to death, the wealthy man reveals his kinship with a public announcement to the whole community. The sutra applies the story to the human quest for omniscience which is unexpectedly received. In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has Buddha nature. The concealment of the kinship of the father to his son is regarded as a skillful means (Sanskrit: &quot;upāya&quot;).

<text>Lisa Germaine Gerrard ( ; born 12 April 1961) is an Australian musician, singer and composer and member of the group Dead Can Dance with music partner Brendan Perry. She is known for her unique singing style technique (glossolalia). She has a dramatic contralto voice and has a vocal range of three octaves.

Born and raised in Melbourne, Gerrard played a pivotal role in the city&#x27;s Little Band scene and fronted post-punk group Microfilm before co-founding Dead Can Dance in 1981. With Perry, she explored numerous traditional and modern styles, laying the foundations for what became known as neoclassical dark wave. She sings sometimes in English and often in a unique language that she invented. In addition to singing, she is an instrumentalist for much of her work, most prolifically using the yangqin (a Chinese hammered dulcimer). Gerrard&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Mirror Pool&quot;, was released in 1995. She has been involved in a wide range of projects, starting her first collaborative album in 1998 with Pieter Bourke, and then with various artists throughout her career, who comprised Patrick Cassidy, Klaus Schulze, Hans Zimmer, Ennio Morricone, Zbigniew Preisner among others. She has scored numerous award-winning motion picture soundtracks.

As of 2020, Gerrard has released four solo albums and collaborated on sixteen albums. She has composed or contributed to the scores of more than 48 films. She received a Golden Globe Award for the music score to the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;, on which she collaborated with Hans Zimmer. She wrote the score of &quot;Balibo&quot; which went on to win an ARIA award for Best Original Soundtrack and an APRA Screen music award for Best feature film score. Overall she has won 11 awards receiving 23 nominations. Gerrard has been nominated for a Grammy Award twice. Gerrard is often affiliated with the &quot;wailing woman&quot; music phenomenon, popularized in &quot;Gladiator&quot;.
==Early life==
Lisa Gerrard was born in Melbourne to Irish immigrant parents, and grew up in Prahran, an inner suburb with a substantial Greek population. She recalled growing up with &quot;Mediterranean music blaring out of the houses&quot; and said that this influenced her music, particularly on later Dead Can Dance albums and in her solo and collaborative works.

Gerrard first began forming bands and creating original music as a member of Melbourne&#x27;s Little Band scene, an experimental post-punk scene which flourished from 1978 until 1981. It was in this scene that she first met Dead Can Dance co-founder Brendan Perry. Perry recalls, &quot;It never occurred to me that we would one day collaborate musically together because at the time I thought her music was too &quot;avant-garde&quot;. I particularly remember one song that she sang about finding a man in the park and asking her mother if she could bring him home to keep in her wardrobe as she attacked this chinese dulcimer with two bamboo sticks&quot;. Around this time, Gerrard became the lead vocalist of Microfilm, which released &quot;Window&quot;, and one single, &quot;Centrefold&quot;, in 1980, via Unforgettable Music label. The group issued a third song, &quot;Summer House&quot;, on Ron Rude&#x27;s &quot;From Belgrave With Love&quot; compilation, which was released by Cleopatra Records in 1981.

==Career==
===Dead Can Dance===

Dead Can Dance originally formed as a quartet in 1981 in Melbourne, with members Gerrard, Perry, bassist Paul Erikson, and drummer Simon Monroe. By 1982, Gerrard, Perry and Erikson decided to relocate to London, but Monroe decided to stay in Australia, leaving the band as a trio.

The band split in 1998, but reunited in 2005 for a world tour. 

In 2012, the band announced a new world tour to coincide with the release of their new album, &quot;Anastasis&quot;. Dead Can Dance&#x27;s albums &quot;Spiritchaser&quot; (1996) and &quot;Anastasis&quot; (2012) both reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top World Music Albums Chart. 

Dead Can Dance recorded seven studio albums on the 4AD Records recording label—beginning with the self-titled &quot;Dead Can Dance&quot; LP in 1984, and two studio albums released by PIAS Recordings.

===Solo and collaborative career===
In 1995, Gerrard recorded and released her first solo album, &quot;The Mirror Pool&quot;, accompanied by the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra. The album peaked at No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums Chart on 9 September 1995, and was on that chart for one week.

In 1998 she recorded &quot;Duality&quot; in collaboration with composer Pieter Bourke. The album went to No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums Chart on 2 May 1998; it was present on the chart for two weeks. &quot;Duality&quot; would mark the beginning of an extensive collaboration for a number of film scores, including &quot;The Insider&quot; and &quot;Ali&quot;.

Gerrard began a new collaboration with composer Patrick Cassidy in 2004 with the release of &quot;Immortal Memory&quot;. Again, this collaboration was furthered in film work, including &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;.

The following year in 2005, Gerrard contributed to the &quot;Ashes and Snow Soundtrack&quot;. For the songs &quot;Womb&quot; and &quot;Wisdom&quot;, she and Patrick Cassidy wrote and performed together. Her collaboration with Cassidy extended to include work with conductor Julie Rogers on the songs &quot;Devota&quot; and &quot;Vespers&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, a documentary about the life and work of Gerrard, was recorded and released in September. It is the work of producer and director Clive Collier and features extensive interviews with Gerrard and various people who have collaborated with her in the past, including Michael Mann, Russell Crowe, Hans Zimmer and Niki Caro. The documentary was released on DVD by Milan Entertainment on 24 April 2007. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; debuted at the Raindance Film Festival in London, on 27 September 2006. On 20 November 2006, Gerrard released her second solo album, &quot;The Silver Tree&quot;. The album climbed to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums Chart on 26 May 2007, spending nine weeks on the chart. This album was markedly different from her previous work and was also her first album released outside 4AD Records. &quot;The Silver Tree&quot; was first released on iTunes, with a wider physical release planned at a future date. The album was nominated for the Australian Music Prize for 2006.

In 2007 a retrospective album, &quot;The Best of Lisa Gerrard&quot;, a compilation of fifteen songs, was released covering her career in Dead Can Dance, solo work and film work. It was released on 12 February 2007 in the UK and 7 November 2007 in the US. The album peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age albums chart on 16 February 2008 and stayed in the chart for ten weeks. A world tour was undertaken in 2007 beginning in April in Melbourne, Australia. The tour marked the first time that Gerrard toured in Australia, with a performance in three cities. The tour was followed by performances in Europe and North America. More performances took place in Europe and Russia from 30 October to 22 November 2007. In November 2007, Gerrard collaborated with German electronic musician Klaus Schulze on the double-album &quot;Farscape&quot;. The album was released on 4 July 2008, followed by a European tour, and the release of a DVD, &quot;Klaus Schulze featuring Lisa Gerrard: Rheingold, Live at Loreley&quot;, recorded during the Night Of The Prog Festival III in Loreley, Germany on the 18 July 2008.

In 2009, Gerrard completed work on the documentary by Australian adventurer Tim Cope called &quot;On the Trail of Genghis Khan&quot; and contributed her voice to the soundtrack, which began airing in 2010, of the Japanese NHK taiga drama &quot;Ryōmaden&quot;, a story based on the life of Sakamoto Ryōma. Furthermore, in 2009, Gerrard created her own record label, Gerrard Records, which, aside from being a conduit for the release of Gerrard&#x27;s future works, will also act to promote and support unrecognised artists of all genres. This tour coincided with the release of &quot;Come Quietly&quot;, a joint project between Gerrard and Schulze that was released exclusively during the tour. In September 2009, Gerrard and Schulze performed another tour in six European cities – Warsaw, Berlin, Amsterdam, Essen, Paris, and Brussels. In October 2009, Gerrard released her third solo album, &quot;The Black Opal&quot;. The album included collaborations with Patrick Cassidy, Michael Edwards, Pieter Bourke and James Orr and was the first release to come from Gerrard Records.

In 2010, Gerrard released a new album entitled &quot;Departum&quot; from Gerrard Records, with composer Marcello De Francisci, which was followed by the singles &quot;Coming Home&quot; (as featured in &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#x27;Hoole&quot;), &quot;Come This Way&quot; and &quot;Entry&quot;. Gerrard also collaborated with multi-instrumentalist Prash Mistry, from UK based live dubstep collective Engine Earz Experiment, on a track titled &quot;Spirit Guide&quot;, which appeared on his 2011 album. On 1 December 2010, Gerrard released the soundtrack album with Cye Wood titled &quot;The Trail of Genghis Khan&quot; which contains music from the Gerrard and Wood score to the documentary TV series by Tim Cope.

In July 2014, Gerrard released a new solo album entitled &quot;Twilight Kingdom&quot; through her own record label, Gerrard Records. The album was recorded in collaboration with Daniel Johns, Astrid Williamson, Patrick Cassidy, and words by Russell Crowe. The album was on the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums Chart for one week, peaking at No. 5 on 6 September 2014. In 2014, Gerrard collaborated with British composer, songwriter and producer, Chicane, on the album &quot;The Sum of Its Parts&quot;, released on 25 January 2015 by Modena Records.

Gerrard&#x27;s vocals are featured in the video game &quot;Armello&quot; launched on 1 September 2015, titled &quot;Wyld&#x27;s Call&quot;; her vocals feature towards a Celtic theme of the soundtracks, released on 2 September 2015, on the music composed by Michael Allen and Gerrard.

On 14 March 2018, Gerrard performed a concert at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia with Genesis Orchestra, conducted by Yordan Kamdzhalov, entitled Symphony of Sorrowful Songs by Henryk Górecki. During the concert, she also sang her own songs from both her solo career and those of Dead Can Dance. Kamdzhalov said of the event, &quot;for me personally, this is more than a dream come true. I cannot think of a better combination than Gerrard-Gorecki-Kamdzhalov in Gorecki&#x27;s Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot;. In 2018, she appeared on &quot;BooCheeMish&quot;, a collaborative album with the Mystery of Bulgarian Voices, with whom she co-wrote some of the songs. Gerrard emphasized that she—and her collaborators—had striven not to impair the women&#x27;s essential sound, she said &quot;we&#x27;re walking toward them, not the other way around&quot;—adding, &quot;if anybody is changed by this, it&#x27;s me&#x27;. The album, that combines the choir&#x27;s folkloric harmonies and a multitude of instruments, was arranged and produced by Petar Dundakov. Also in 2018, Gerrard teamed with solo percussionist David Kuckhermann to compose and record an album, &quot;Hiraeth&quot;, released on 6 August 2018. 

&quot;Hiraeth&quot; was nominated in the Best New Age Album category during the 61st Annual Grammy Awards at Staples Center, held on 10 February 2019. Gerrard toured as a special guest with the eighteen choir members of the Mystery of Bulgarian Voices, performing fifteen select dates across Europe from 12 March to 20 October 2019. In 2019, she collaborated again with Yordan Kamdzhalov and Genesis Orchestra, for a reworked and rearranged recording of Henryk Górecki&#x27;s Symphony No. 3: Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, captured in Sofia at the Bulgarian National Radio Studio, which was released on 17 January 2020.

===Film career===
Gerrard&#x27;s first experience in composing music for a film came with the 1989 Spanish film &quot;El Niño de la Luna&quot;, directed by Agustí Villaronga. The film score was composed by Dead Can Dance and the film featured Lisa Gerrard in her first acting role. &quot;El Niño de la Luna&quot; describes the story of David, a young orphan with special powers, escaping an institution with the help of a fellow institute inmate, Georgina, played by Lisa Gerrard.

Gerrard participated in a number of musical scores but came to fame as a film composer after recording &quot;The Insider&quot; in 1999, with Pieter Bourke, and &quot;Gladiator&quot; in 2000, with Hans Zimmer, which received an Academy Award nomination for best music score, although only Zimmer was nominated. It did, however, win a Golden Globe Award for both composers. Gerrard&#x27;s score for the New Zealand independent film &quot;Whale Rider&quot; consisted entirely of solo material; a soundtrack album was released by 4AD.

In 2005, Gerrard collaborated with Ennio Morricone for &quot;Fateless&quot;, followed by a collaboration with Jeff Rona on the score for the feature film &quot;A Thousand Roads&quot; and the song &#x27;&quot;On an Ocean&quot; for the &quot;Henry Poole Is Here&quot; score. With Dead Can Dance, she provided several contributions to the soundtrack of &quot;Baraka&quot;, a visual journey showcasing mankind&#x27;s impact on the planet. She was invited by Denez Prigent to collaborate with him on his piece &quot;Gortoz a ran – J&#x27;attends&quot; (meaning &quot;I await&quot;), a piece that was later used in the soundtrack of Ridley Scott&#x27;s film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;.

In 2009, Gerrard wrote the score for &quot;Balibo&quot;, for which she won a Best Feature Film Score award at the 2009 APRA Screen Music Awards and an Aria Award for Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album at the 2009 Aria Awards. She finished 2009 by contributing her voice to the theme song for the Japanese NHK taiga drama &quot;Ryōmaden&quot;, which began airing in 2010.

In 2010, Gerrard completed the score for &quot;Tears of Gaza&quot; with Marcello De Francisci which was well received despite its controversial theme. She scored the Jim Loach-directed &quot;Oranges and Sunshine&quot;, starring Emily Watson and Hugo Weaving, released in April 2011, which gained her another nomination at the 2011 IF Awards for Best Music Score.

In November 2010, Gerrard provided vocals and additional music for the post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller &quot;Priest&quot;, scored by Christopher Young, which was released in 2011.

On 28 May 2011, the song &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;, part of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; original soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer and Gerrard, peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained in the chart for 460 weeks. In November 2011 Gerrard completed the score for &quot;Burning Man&quot;, which won her Best Music Score at the 2012 Film Critics Circle of Australia awards, beating scores for &quot;Snowtown&quot;, &quot;The Hunter&quot; and &quot;Red Dog&quot;.

==Vocal ability==
Gerrard possesses the vocal range of a contralto but can also reach upward into the dramatic mezzo-soprano range. She has a vocal range from A2 to F♯5. Her vocal timbre has been described as &quot;rich, deep&quot; which creates a &quot;mournful sound&quot;, and her voice is regarded by critics as &quot;simply not of this world&quot;. More predominantly, Gerrard&#x27;s vocal range spans from contralto to dramatic contralto, displayed for examples in &quot;Sanvean&quot;, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Largo&quot;, and &quot;Not Yet&quot;; — to the dramatic mezzo-soprano voice in her other songs, such as &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot;, &quot;Elegy&quot;, &quot;Space Weaver&quot;, and &quot;Come this Way&quot;. 

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that she uses &quot;distinct voices that drew on far-flung traditions: an opalescent tone from Baroque opera, a reedy hint of Celtic folk style, the sharp and quavering approach of Balkan women&#x27;s music, blue notes bent like Billie Holiday&#x27;s...&quot;.

Gerrard sings some lyrics in English, but performs many of her songs in a self-created idioglossia, such as &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;, &quot;Come Tenderness&quot;, &quot;Serenity&quot;, &quot;The Valley of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Tempest&quot;, &quot;Pilgrimage of Lost Children&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot; and &quot;Sanvean&quot;. With respect to such work she has said, &quot;I sing in the language of the Heart. [...] It&#x27;s an invented language that I&#x27;ve had for a very long time. I believe I started singing in it when I was about 12. Roughly that time. And I believed that I was speaking to God when I sang in that language.&quot; 

Gerrard&#x27;s early and formative singing experience was influenced by the Bulgarian choir&#x27;s technique. Gerrard&#x27;s influences on the language she sings since her youth has been exerted mainly by the conversations and the music she heard in the Melbourne area where she had grown up, where a large Greco-Turkish community lived. Gerrard&#x27;s first musical influences came from her father, as she grew up listening to sean-nós songs in an Irish family, and also the &quot;abstract forms&quot; with which Antonin Artaud worked that she heard on radio documentaries.

Gerrard commented in a 2012 interview:

<text>Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine (IJLP) was a Lebanese Shia group that claimed credit for the January 24, 1987 abduction of three American and one Indian professors – Alann Steen, Jesse Turner, Robert Polhill, Mithaleshwar Singh – from Beirut University College in West Beirut. They were eventually released.

==Kidnapping of american catedratics==
On January 24, 1987, the Alann Steen, Jesse Turner, Robert Polhill, Mithal Eshwar Singh was kidnapped by unknown militants dressed as lebanese police, later identified as &quot;Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine&quot; The abducted were staff of the university, who stopped living in the campus apartments for security reasons, but were stalked by their captors.
The JILP militiamen demanded the release of 100 Arab prisoners in Israel in exchange for the release of the professors, to which Israeli authorities refused to accept the exchange.

During the first weeks of the kidnapping, Professor Alann Steen began to have complications in his health, with some of the kidnapped people reporting that his state of health was deplorable. After a few weeks, the professor began to improve his health, thanking his captors for their care in the tapes published by the terrorists.

===Release of the hostages===
It wasn&#x27;t until October 4, 1988, when Mithileshwar Singh is released after ten months of captivity, handed over to Syrian authorities who handed over members of the US forces. US authorities stressed that Singh&#x27;s release occurred without the need for agreements or negotiations with the kidnappers.

It was not until April 23, 1990, when Robert Polhill was finally released after 39 months of captivity. Polhill would end up passing away at the age of 65 at Georgetown University Teaching Hospital on July 3, 1999 due to complications with cancer.

Months later, on October 21, 1991, the YILP released Jesse Turner after holding him for nearly four years. Six days later, Turner return to the United States. Weeks later, on December 3, the last American hostage Alann Steen was released, officially the penultimate American hostage on Lebanese soil.

<doc id="403653" wikidata="Q3490562" url="?curid=403653" title="Sexual stimulation">
<text>Sexual stimulation is anything that leads to sexual arousal or orgasm. This thing can be physical or of other senses, and is known as a stimulus.

Sexual stimulation is a broad term, usually understood to mean physical touching of the genitals or other body parts. The term can, however, include stimuli affecting the mind (sexual fantasy), or senses other than touch sight, smell, or hearing). Sufficient physical stimulation of the genitals usually results in an orgasm. Stimulation can be by oneself (masturbation or sexual fantasy) or by a sexual partner (sexual intercourse or other sexual activity), by use of objects or tools, or by some combination of these methods.

Some people practice orgasm control, whereby a person or their partner controls the level of stimulation to prolong the experience leading up to orgasm.

==Physical sexual stimulation==
Physical sexual stimulation consists of touching the genitals or other erogenous zones.

===Genital===

Masturbation, erotic massage, and manual sex are types of physical stimulation involving the genitals. This stimulation is usually from sensitive touch receptors in the skin or other erogenous zones, which detect when they&#x27;re being touched. Arousal is triggered through these receptors in these body parts, which cause the release of pleasure-causing chemicals (endorphins) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. Someone may become aroused by simply touching another person, though the bulbocavernosus reflex only occurs when a sexual organ (penis or clitoris) is stimulated.

One study found that women benefit more from pleasurable sex with a committed partner, while gender did not impact the relationship with masturbation. 

The purpose of sex toys is to provide pleasure and stimulation through an alternative route than just using people&#x27;s bodies. They can be used by someone on their own, with partnered sex, or group sex. They can be exciting and provide new types of stimulation that the body cannot produce, such as vibrations.

Sex toys have been used as a source of sexual stimulation for thousands of years. There have been dildos found from the Palaeolithic era, made of siltstone and polished to a high gloss. Dildos were also made of camel dung and coated with resin. Historians are uncertain whether these have been used for religious rituals or for personal pleasure. It is known that dildos were used for fertility rituals, however. The ancient Greeks created their dildos from a carved penis covered in leather or animal intestines to create a more natural feel. The Romans created double-ended dildos for use with a partner. Ancient Chinese dildos were made of bronze or other metals and some were hollow allowing them to be filled with liquid to simulate an ejaculation. These were used because wealthy Chinese men would often have too many wives to please. In Persia, it was thought that the blood of the hymen was unclean, and should be avoided by husbands. On the night before a woman&#x27;s wedding, a local holy man would come and break her hymen with a large stone dildo, a ritual also used to confirm the virginity of the bride.

===Non-genital===
There are many areas through which a person can be sexually stimulated, other than the genitals. For example, the nipples, thighs, lips, and neck can all provide sexual stimulation when touched. 

; Nipples
: One study administered a questionnaire about sexual activity to 301 participants and found that 81.5% of women reported that stimulating their nipples caused or enhanced sexual arousal and that 59.1% of them asked to have their nipples stimulated during sex. Furthermore, 51.7% of men reported that nipple stimulation caused sexual arousal, and 39% said that it enhanced their existing arousal. Research using brain-scanning technology found that stimulating nipples in women resulted in the activation of the genital area of the sensory cortex. The research suggests the sensations are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may also be directly linked to &quot;the genital area of the brain&quot;. In women, one study indicated that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.
; Thighs
: In 2012, the California Institute of Technology measured brain responses in heterosexual males as they were having their inner thighs touched whilst being MRI scanned. They were either watching a video of a woman touching their thigh or a man touching their thigh. They reported more sexual pleasure when they thought it was the woman touching them than the man, and this was reflected in their MRI scans with greater arousal of their somatosensory cortex. It can be therefore concluded that the thighs are an area that can cause sexual stimulation when touched.
; Lips
: Lips contain a huge number of nerve endings and are considered to be an erogenous zone. Women report experiencing more pleasure from the stimulation of their lips than men do (see below for sex differences in stimulation). In addition to stimulation of the lips by touching, men can be visually stimulated by looking at a woman&#x27;s lips. It has also been reported that men prefer women with fuller lips because they are an indicator of youth.
; Neck
: A sample of 800 participants rated 41 different body parts on their erogenous intensity on a scale of 1–10 (10 being the most arousing). Females reported neck stimulation as being more arousing than men did.

===Sex differences in erogenous zones===
This table shows the sex differences in erogenous zones and includes the top ten most arousing areas for both sexes. Each body part was rated out of ten for how arousing it is when touched. Apart from body parts exclusive to one gender such as the penis or clitoris, many of the erogenous zones are similar and contain many nerve endings. 
===Internal stimulation===
The excitation-transfer theory states that existing arousal in the body can be transformed into another type of arousal. For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study participants performed some physical exercise and at different stages of recovery had to watch an erotic film and rate how aroused it made them feel. They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.

==Alternative routes==
The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are fantasy or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.

===Visual===
Perhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation. An apparent example is the act of voyeurisma practice where an individual covertly watches another undress or engage in sexual behaviour. Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of &#x27;sexual deviation&#x27;, it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar porn industry is another example. A common presumption is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the Kinsey hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than are women. Nonetheless, both sexes can be sexually aroused through visual stimulation. In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes. Their physiological responses to the video also showed characteristics of sexual arousal, such as increased urinary excretions of adrenaline. A subsequent study investigating male arousal showed that men were able to achieve rigid erections through visual stimulation of an erotic film alone.

Studies that use visual stimulation as a means for sexual stimulation find that sexual arousal is predominantly correlated with an activation in limbic and paralimbic cortex and in subcortical structures, along with a deactivation in several parts of the temporal cortex. These same areas are activated during physical sexual stimulation, highlighting how powerful visual stimulation can be as a means of sexual arousal.

===Olfactory===
Olfactory information is critical to human sexual behavior. One study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found that heterosexual men experience sexual arousal in response to a female perfume. Individuals rated odourant stimulation and perceived sexual arousal. They also had functional MRI scans taken during the experiment. The results showed that olfactory stimulation with women&#x27;s perfume produces activation of specific brain areas associated with sexual arousal in men. Another study found that homosexual men displayed similar hypothalamic activation to that of heterosexual women when smelling a testosterone derivate present in male sweat, suggesting that sexual orientation plays a role in how humans experience olfactory sexual stimulation.

Evolutionary analysis of sex differences in reproductive strategies can help explain the importance of smell in sexual arousal due to its link to immunological profile and offspring viability. This is because olfactory cues may be able to trigger an incest avoidance mechanism by reflecting parts of an individual&#x27;s genetic equipment. In one study, males rated visual and olfactory information as being equally important for selecting a lover, while females considered olfactory information to be the single most important variable in mate choice. Additionally, when considering sexual activity, females singled out body odour from all other sensory experiences as most able to negatively affect desire.

===Auditory===
Auditory stimulants may also serve to intensify sexual arousal and the experience of pleasure. Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to people, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect. Thus, copulatory vocalisations are likely to serve mutual sexual stimulation for mating partners.

Even when not coupled with &quot;touching&quot;, sounds can be highly sexually arousing. Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to &quot;low moans&quot; for erotic effect. Vaudeville Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as Prince&#x27;s &quot;Orgasm&quot; or Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;You Sure Love to Ball&quot; includes sounds of the female orgasm. Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood induction study, exposure to certain music resulted in significantly greater penile tumescence and subjective sexual arousal for men. In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did report higher levels of sexual arousal. Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men, implicating sounds as a means of sexual stimulation. Phone sex is one type of arousal inducer that makes use of this effect.

==Mental stimulation==
Sexual arousal includes feelings, attractions and desires, as well as physiological changes. These can be elicited not only by physical but also mental stimulations, such as fantasy, erotic literature, dreams, role-play, and imagination.

===Fantasy===

Sexual fantasy is a form of mental sexual stimulation which many people engage in. It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they are awake. Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender. It is also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced by another to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.

It is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence. However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas women are more likely to imagine themselves as passive participants. Women&#x27;s fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment, whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail. One explanation of this difference comes from the evolutionary perspective. Women have a higher minimum parental investment than males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring&#x27;s chance of survival.

Fantasies can have benefits, such as increasing arousal more than other forms of sexual stimuli (such as an erotic story) and increasing sexual desire. Individuals who disclose their sexual fantasies to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether people are willing to open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies. A more negative effect of sexual fantasy is that it has been linked with sexual crimes, and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense. However, such fantasies are also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour. Therefore, fantasy alone cannot be used as a sign that someone will become an offender.

===Dreams===
Nocturnal emission orgasms or &quot;wet dreams&quot; or &quot;erotic dreams&quot; are when people ejaculate or orgasm during sleep. These occur during REM (rapid eye movement) phases of sleep, which is the main stage when humans dream. This implies that erotic dreams alone are enough to stimulate men, but erections accompany all REM phases. According to self-report data, as many as 22% of young women may also experience orgasm during sleep, with such dreams being more common in college students in higher school years than younger students. The orgasms experienced were positively correlated with high emotionality, including sexual excitement, but also anxiety.

===Sexual role-play===
Sexual role-play is when people act out characters or scenarios which may sexually stimulate each other. This can include fantasies (discussed above) and fetishes, such as BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) or age-play. It has been described by some as an adult form of L.A.R.P (live action role-play). Role-play can also be carried out online, by typing stories to each other or pretending to be a character, and is therefore a form of mental stimulation you can engage in with another person without them being physically present. Many adolescents find online role-play pleasurable and arousing.

Role-play can also include sexual fan fiction, where characters from well-known stories, that were not sexually or romantically together in the original story, are written into sexual scenes. Slash fiction is a type of fan fiction where the characters of the same sex (originally male-male) engage in romantic or sexual activities. Slash fiction allows people the freedom to share stimulating things that can be counter-cultural.

== Role of sexual dysfunctions in sexual stimulation ==
=== Women ===

==== Physiological factors ====
According to the National Library of Medicine, approximately 80% of middle aged women with heart failure have reported a decrease in vaginal lubrication, leading to challenges in successful intercourse. The reduction in lubrication affects the vaginal moisture during sexual activity. Women with hypoactive sexual desire (HSDD) may also experience a lack of interest in sexual stimuli, thus affecting their psychological responses to sexual cues.  Within the study conducted by Sandra Garcia and her colleagues, suggested that trauma-related changes may impact genital tissues, affecting blood flow and response to sexual stimulation.  As well as when psychologic distress is present it affects the ability to achieve orgasm despite adequate sexual stimulation. This is a result of relationship issues that affect sexual stimulation and sexual response, connecting back to orgasmic difficulties.

==== Hormonal factors ====
The deficiency of estrogen leads to conditions like dyspareunia, which is something important for maintaining adequate lubrication. Therefore there is hormonal treatment that is used which is the addition of in-taking estrogen supplements.  But as well as the supplementation of testosterone, which was shown as beneficial for enhancing desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction.  There could also be some hormonal changes when it comes to going through the phases of aging. A review in &#x27;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&#x27;, showed how pre-menopause women showed more sexual dissatisfaction. This was shown due to their hormonal imbalances.

== Responses to sexual stimulation ==

=== Brain ===
When sexual stimulation is perceived, there are systems in the brain that receive the stimuli and respond to it. During physiological sexual arousal, the autonomic nervous system responds to signals from central nervous system and prepares the body for sexual activity. The autonomic nervous system engages the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, which are responsible for blood flow to genital and erectile tissues, and to muscles that participate in sexual responses. This results in responses like increased breathing rate, heart rate, and pupil dilation. The limbic system also plays a part in how sexual stimuli are received. A study done about pleasure and brain activity in men showed that electrical stimulation of the limbic system is highly pleasurable, and can sometimes generate orgasmic responses. During genital stimulation different areas of the brain are activated in men and women. For men, a study saw that genital stimulation caused part of the cerebral cortex and the insula, which is a part of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, to activate. For women, during clitoral stimulation parts of the secondary somatosensory cortex were activated. In both men and women the amygdala was deactivated.

=== Induced ovulation ===
Some mammal species are induced ovulators, requiring stimulation of the genitals during copulation in order to ovulate.

<text>The International Pentecostal Holiness Church (IPHC) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church (PHC) is an international Holiness-Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations. Historically centered in the Southeastern United States, particularly the Carolinas and Georgia, the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence. In 2023, the denomination released a report showing 1,691,750 members outside the United States, Canada and Brazil. Worldwide figures are estimated at around 2 million members.

Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements—the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century—the church&#x27;s theological roots derive from John Wesley&#x27;s teachings on sanctification.

==History==
===Origins===
While certain elements in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South supported the holiness movement in the church, others did not favor it, which led to controversy in 1894. Within a decade about 25 new Holiness Methodist groups, including the Pentecostal Holiness Church, came into existence.

====Fire-Baptized Holiness====
The oldest group that is part of the foundation of the Pentecostal Holiness Church originated in 1895 as the Fire-Baptized Holiness Association in Olmitz, Iowa. The leader, Benjamin H. Irwin of Lincoln, Nebraska, a former Baptist preacher, organized the body into the national Fire-Baptized Holiness Church at Anderson, South Carolina, in August 1898. By this time, Irwin&#x27;s group had organized churches in eight U. S. states and two Canadian provinces. In 1898, the Southeastern Kansas Fire Baptized Holiness Association dissolved its relationship with the rest of the denomination over differences in doctrine (chiefly the rejection of a third work of grace) and this faction is known today as the Bible Holiness Church.

====Pentecostal Holiness of North Carolina====
The first congregation to carry the name Pentecostal Holiness Church was formed in Goldsboro, North Carolina in 1898. This church was founded as a result of the evangelistic ministry of Abner Blackmon Crumpler, a Methodist evangelist. A year earlier, Crumpler had founded the inter-denominational North Carolina Holiness Association. After his trial and acquittal by a Methodist ecclesiastical court for preaching interpretations of holiness doctrines that differed from the rest of the Methodist Church, Crumpler and several of his followers left the Methodist Church and formed a new denomination known as the Pentecostal Holiness Church (&quot;Pentecostal&quot; being a common name for holiness believers at the time).

The first convention was held at Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1900. The convention adopted a denominational discipline, and Crumpler was elected president. In 1901 at a meeting in Magnolia, North Carolina, the word &quot;Pentecostal&quot; was dropped from the name to more fully associate the church with the holiness movement. For the next eight years, the church would be known as &quot;The Holiness Church of North Carolina&quot;. The church had congregations outside of North Carolina as well, principally in South Carolina and Virginia.

Gaston B. Cashwell, a minister of the Methodist Church, joined Crumpler&#x27;s group in 1903. He became a leading figure in the church and the Pentecostal movement on the east coast. In 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, in December 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecost experience in the local holiness church.

The influence of the Pentecostal renewal grew while, at the same time, the leader and founder of the church, Abner Crumpler, though willing to accept speaking in tongues, did not accept the idea that it was the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. At the annual conference of 1908, Crumpler was re-elected president of the body; however, with a majority of the delegates having experienced tongues, he permanently disaffiliated himself from the church. After Crumpler&#x27;s departure, the conference added an article to the statement of faith, recognizing tongues as the initial evidence:


The PHC Foreign Mission Board was formed in 1904, and its members were all women. In 1907, Tom J. McIntosh, a PHC member, traveled to China and may have been the first Pentecostal missionary to reach that nation.

===Mergers and schisms===

The Fire-Baptized Holiness Association also embraced Pentecostalism around the same time, taking the line that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was the &quot;baptism of fire&quot; that it had been seeking. Given the similarities in doctrine and geographic reach with the Pentecostal Holiness Church, the two groups began talks on a merger. The two groups merged on January 30, 1911, at the Falcon Tabernacle in Falcon, North Carolina. The new denomination took the name of the smaller of the two, Pentecostal Holiness Church. S.D. Page was elected the first General Superintendent.

Following the 1911 merger, the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church, originally the Brewerton Presbyterian Church, merged with the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1915. Having Presbyterian roots and located mostly in South Carolina, this group of around 15 congregations was affiliated with Nickles Holmes Bible College in Greenville. After the mergers, the new denomination, which continued to go by the name Pentecostal Holiness Church, had about 200 churches with approximately 5,000 members. Property for the denomination&#x27;s first headquarters was purchased in 1918 for $9,000 in Franklin Springs, Georgia.

In 1918, several PHC members who wanted stricter standards concerning dress, amusements, tobacco, and association between the sexes withdrew to form the Pentecostal Fire-Baptized Holiness Church. In 1920, another schism came into the Pentecostal Holiness Church over divine healing and the use of medicine. Some pastors believed that while divine healing was provided in the atonement, Christians still had the right to turn to medicine and doctors. The majority of the church—as did many Pentecostals of the time—believed in trusting God for healing without turning to earthly means. The minority withdrew and formed the Congregational Holiness Church in 1921.

===Further development===
The Pentecostal Holiness Church was a charter member of the National Association of Evangelicals in 1943 and joined the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America in 1948. At the general conference a year later an attempt at merging with the mostly black United Holy Church failed when the United Holy Church asked if their members could attend the church&#x27;s schools and colleges.

In the 1960s, the Pentecostal Holiness Church began to branch out beyond the United States by affiliating with sister Pentecostal bodies in other parts of the world. In 1967, an affiliation was formed with the Pentecostal Methodist Church of Chile, one of the largest national Pentecostal churches in the world and the largest non-Catholic church in Chile. At the time, the Jotabeche Pentecostal Methodist congregation was the largest church in the world with over 60,000 members. With over 150,000 members, it ranks second to the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea. This denomination claims 1.7 million adherents. A similar affiliation was forged in 1985 with the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Brazil. A Neo-Pentecostal body with roots in the Brazilian Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church numbered some 50,000 members and adherents in 1995. The word &quot;International&quot; was added to the church&#x27;s name in 1975.

===Recent history===
The largest Pentecostal Holiness churches in the United States include The Gate Church in Oklahoma City, pastored by Jordan Roberts (founded by Tony Miller; Northwood Temple in Fayetteville, North Carolina, pastored by John Hedgepeth; SpiritLife Church (formerly known as Evangelistic Temple) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, pastored by Tommy McLaurin; Eastpointe Community Church in Oklahoma City, pastored by Shon and Rachel Burchett; All Nations Church in Tallassee, Florida, pastored by Steve Dow; and Tree of Life Ministries in Lynchburg, VA, pastored by Mike Dodson.

In 2000, the IPHC reported 10,463 churches and over a million members worldwide (over 3.4 million including affiliates). In 2010, membership in the United States was 289,475 in 1,995 churches. There were 28 regional conferences and missionaries in more than 90 nations. International offices were once located in Franklin Springs, Georgia, but are now located in Bethany, Oklahoma, a suburb of Oklahoma City.

In January 2011, the PHC celebrated the 1911 merger centennial with special events at Falcon, North Carolina.
In 2024, the IPHC reported 1,600 churches in the United States. A small decline from the 2000 figures.

==Doctrine==
The doctrine of the Pentecostal Holiness Church is articulated in the Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Articles of Faith. The Articles were placed in their present form in 1945. The first four articles are essentially the same as the first four Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church.

The IPHC believes in common evangelical beliefs, including the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, his crucifixion for the forgiving of sins, his resurrection and ascension to heaven, the inerrancy of the Bible, a literal belief in heaven and hell, and the responsibility of every believer to carry out the Great Commission. The church holds water baptism and communion (open communion observed quarterly) to be divine ordinances. Though not considered an ordinance, some of the churches also engage in the practice of feet washing.

===Cardinal doctrines===
Since the adoption of the article of faith on the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ&#x27;s atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial second coming of Christ.

====Justification by faith====

The Pentecostal Holiness Church believes that no amount of good works can achieve justification or salvation. This is achieved only &quot;on the basis of our faith in the shed blood, the resurrection, and the justifying righteousness&quot; of Christ. Good works, however, are a product of salvation. &quot;When we believe on Jesus Christ as our Savior, our sins are pardoned, we are justified, and we enter a state of righteousness, not our own, but His, both imputed and imparted&quot;.

====Sanctification====

As a holiness church, the PHC believes that for the Christian there is not only justification and forgiveness for actual transgressions but also &quot;complete cleansing of the justified believer from all indwelling sin and from its pollution.&quot; This cleansing is not &quot;maturity&quot; but a &quot;crisis experience&quot; and a &quot;definite, instantaneous work of grace, obtainable by faith.&quot; The church recognizes that there is maturity and growth in the life of the believer, but states that &quot;we must get into this grace before we can grow in it.&quot; The sanctified life is described as &quot;one of separation from the world, a selfless life, a life of devotion to all the will of God, a life of holiness ... a life controlled by &#x27;perfect love&#x27; which &#x27;casteth out fear.&#x27;&quot; The Pentecostal Holiness Church specifically rejects absolute perfection, angelic perfection, and sinless perfection—terms that imply that it is impossible for a sanctified believer to commit sin.

====Baptism with the Holy Spirit====

As a Pentecostal church, the PHC believes the &quot;baptism with the Holy Ghost and fire is obtainable by a definite act of appropriating faith on the part of the fully cleansed believer.&quot; Spirit baptism is available to all believers and provides empowerment to witness for Christ. To receive the baptism, a person must have a &quot;clean heart and life&quot; and to &quot;live in the fullness of the Holy Spirit&#x27;s power and possession, one must continue to live a clean and consecrated life, free from sin, strife, worldliness, and pride, and must avoid attitudes and actions that tend to &#x27;grieve&#x27; or &#x27;quench&#x27; the Holy Spirit.&quot;

The Pentecostal Holiness Church distinguishes the initial evidence of Spirit baptism - which all believers experience when Spirit baptized - from the gift of tongues, which is not given to every Spirit-filled believer. Speaking in tongues is only the first sign of Spirit baptism. Other evidence that will follow Spirit baptism include: the fruit of the Spirit, power to witness for Christ, and power to endure the testings of faith and the oppositions of the world. Besides speaking in tongues, other spiritual gifts recorded in the Bible (specifically in 1 Corinthians 12, 13, and 14) are encouraged to operate in Pentecostal Holiness congregations for the edification of the Body of Christ.

====Divine healing====

The PHC believes that &quot;provision was made in the atonement for the healing of our bodies&quot;. Congregations will pray for the healing of sick people and church elders will lay hands on and anoint the person being prayed over. While in its early years the Pentecostal Holiness were against receiving medical care, emphasizing divine healing, that is not the case today. The church teaches that Christians should believe in divine healing but also teaches that medical knowledge comes to humanity through God&#x27;s grace.

====Second Coming====

The PHC believes in the imminent, personal, premillennial second coming of Jesus Christ. It will occur in two stages: the first stage will be the rapture of the saints before the Tribulation, and the second stage will be at the end of the Tribulation when Christ will return to defeat the Antichrist, judge the nations of the world, and begin his millennial reign.

==Structure==
Reflecting its Methodist heritage, the IPHC is governed under the principles of connectionalism, a mixed system of episcopal and congregational polity. Authority in the church is shared between local churches, quadrennial conferences, and the General Conference.

Pentecostal Holiness congregations are self-governing in local affairs and are led by pastors. The pastor preaches, administers the ordinances, and promotes the &quot;spiritual welfare&quot; of congregants. Furthermore, the pastor is the chairman of the church board. Other than the pastor, the church board consists of deacons and a secretary/treasurer elected by the church members. The board is accountable to the pastor and church members, and pastors are accountable to the quadrennial conferences.

Geographically, churches are organized into conferences led by conference superintendents. In their spiritual roles, superintendents function as bishops, and in their administrative roles they act as chief executive officers of their conference. All conference leaders are elected by their local conference but are accountable to the General Superintendent.

The General Conference is the highest administrative body in the church. Under it are regional, annual, district, and missionary conferences. When the General Conference is out of session, the Council of Bishops acts as the church&#x27;s governing body. In the IPHC, the terms &quot;bishop&quot; and &quot;superintendent&quot; are used interchangeably. The church recognizes the biblical office of bishop but does not believe in an historical episcopate or adhere to the doctrine of apostolic succession. The General Superintendent and Presiding Bishop, Dr. A. Doug Beacham Jr., was elected in 2012.

==Educational institutions==
The IPHC has four affiliated institutions of higher education. The IPHC colleges are Emmanuel University in Franklin Springs, Georgia; Holmes Bible College in Greenville, South Carolina; Southwestern Christian University in Bethany, Oklahoma; and Advantage College in San Jose, California.

==Charitable institutions==
Charitable organizations include the Falcon Children&#x27;s Home, Alternative to Abortion Ministries, New Life Adoption Agency, and Bethany Children&#x27;s Health Center.

==Notable clergy==
*Oral Roberts, an internationally known charismatic evangelist (1936-1947)
*C.M. Ward, a former Assemblies of God radio preacher and supporter of the Washington for Jesus movement.

<text>A gesture is a form of nonverbal communication or non-vocal communication in which visible bodily actions communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Gestures differ from physical non-verbal communication that does not communicate specific messages, such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention. Gestures allow individuals to communicate a variety of feelings and thoughts, from contempt and hostility to approval and affection, often together with body language in addition to words when they speak. Gesticulation and speech work independently of each other, but join to provide emphasis and meaning.

Gesture processing takes place in areas of the brain such as Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas, which are used by speech and sign language. In fact, language is thought by some scholars to have evolved in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from an earlier system consisting of manual gestures. The theory that language evolved from manual gestures, termed Gestural Theory, dates back to the work of 18th-century philosopher and priest Abbé de Condillac, and has been revived by contemporary anthropologist Gordon W. Hewes, in 1973, as part of a discussion on the origin of language.

== Research throughout the ages ==
Gestures have been studied throughout time from different philosophers. Marcus Fabius Quintilianus was a Roman Rhetorician who studied in his Institutio Oratoria on how gesture can be used on rhetorical discourses. One of his greatest works and foundation for communication was the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; where he explains his observations and nature of different oratories.

A study done in 1644, by John Bulwer an English physician and early Baconian natural philosopher wrote five works exploring human communications pertaining to gestures. Bulwer analyzed dozens of gestures and provided a guide under his book named Chirologia which focused on hand gestures. In the 19th century, Andrea De Jorio an Italian antiquarian who considered a lot of research about body language published an extensive account of gesture expressions.

Andrew N. Meltzoff an American psychologist internationally renown for infant and child development conducted a study in 1977 on the imitation of facial and manual gestures by newborns. The study concluded that &quot;infants between 12 and 21 days of age can imitate the facial and manual gestures of parents&quot;. In 1992, David Mcneill, a professor of linguistics and psychology at the University of Chicago, wrote a book based on his ten years of research and concluded that &quot;gestures do not simply form a part of what is said, but have an impact on thought itself.&quot; Meltzoff argues that gestures directly transfer thoughts into visible forms, showing that ideas and language cannot always be express. A peer-reviewed journal Gesture has been published since 2001, and was founded by Adam Kendon and Cornelia Müller. The International Society for Gesture Studies (ISGS) was founded in 2002.

Gesture has frequently been taken up by researchers in the field of dance studies and performance studies in ways that emphasize the ways they are culturally and contextually inflected. Performance scholar Carrie Noland describes gestures as &quot;learned techniques of the body&quot; and stresses the way gestures are embodied corporeal forms of cultural communication. But rather than just residing within one cultural context, she describes how gestures migrate across bodies and locations to create new cultural meanings and associations. She also posits how they might function as a form of &quot;resistance to homogenization&quot; because they are so dependent on the specification of the bodies that perform them.

Gesture has also been taken up within queer theory, ethnic studies and their intersections in performance studies, as a way to think about how the moving body gains social meaning. José Esteban Muñoz uses the idea of gesture to mark a kind of refusal of finitude and certainty and links gesture to his ideas of ephemera. Muñoz specifically draws on the African-American dancer and drag queen performer Kevin Aviance to articulate his interest not in what queer gestures might mean, but what they might perform. Juana María Rodríguez borrows ideas of phenomenology and draws on Noland and Muñoz to investigate how gesture functions in queer sexual practices as a way to rewrite gender and negotiate power relations. She also connects gesture to Giorgio Agamben&#x27;s idea of &quot;means without ends&quot; to think about political projects of social justice that are incomplete, partial, and legibile within culturally and socially defined spheres of meaning.

Within the field of linguistics, the most hotly contested aspect of gesture revolves around the subcategory of Lexical or Iconic Co-Speech Gestures. Adam Kendon was the first to hypothesize on their purpose when he argued that Lexical gestures do work to amplify or modulate the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech with which they co-occur. However, since the late 1990s, most research has revolved around the contrasting hypothesis that Lexical gestures serve a primarily cognitive purpose in aiding the process of speech production. As of 2012, there is research to suggest that Lexical Gesture does indeed serve a primarily communicative purpose and cognitive only secondary, but in the realm of socio-pragmatic communication, rather than lexico-semantic modification.

==Typology (categories)==

Humans have the ability to communicate through language, but they can also express through gestures. In particular, gestures can be transmitted through movements of body parts, face, and body expressions. Researchers Goldin Meadow and Brentari D. conducted research in 2015 and concluded that communicating through sign language is no different from spoken language.

=== Communicative vs. informative ===
The first way to distinguish between categories of gesture is to differentiate between communicative gesture and informative gesture. While most gestures can be defined as possibly happening during the course of spoken utterances, the informative-communicative dichotomy focuses on intentionality of meaning and communication in co-speech gesture.

==== Informative (passive) ====
Informative gestures are passive gestures that provide information about the speaker as a person and not about what the speaker is trying to communicate. Some movements are not purely considered gestures, however a person could perform these adapters in such way like scratching, adjusting clothing, and tapping.

These gestures can occur during speech, but they may also occur independently of communication, as they are not a part of active communication. While informative gestures may communicate information about the person speaking (e.g. itchy, uncomfortable, etc.), this communication is not engaged with any language being produced by the person gesturing.

==== Communicative (active) ====
Communicative gestures are gestures that are produced intentionally and meaningfully by a person as a way of intensifying or modifying speech produced in the vocal tract (or with the hands in the case of sign languages), even though a speaker may not be actively aware that they are producing communicative gestures.

For instance, on the U.S. Army recruitment poster of Uncle Sam, he is pointing and sending a non-verbal form of gesture by implying he wants the viewer to join the U.S. Army. This is a form of symbolic gesture, usually used in the absence of speech.

== Body language relating to gestures ==
Body language is a form of nonverbal communication that allows visual cues that transmit messages without speaking. Gestures are movement that are made with the body: arms, hands, facial, etc. Authors Barbara Pease and Allan Pease, of &quot;The Definitive Book of Body Language&quot; concluded that everyone does a shoulder shrug, a gesture signifying that the person is not comprehending what they are supposed to be understanding. Also, that showing the palms of both hands to show a person is not hiding anything, and raising the eyebrows to indicate a greeting.

Finger gestures are commonly used in a variety of ways, from point at something to indicate that you want to show a person something to indicating a thumbs up to show everything is good.

Some gestures are near universals, i.e., found all over the world with only some exceptions. An example is the head shake to signify &quot;no&quot;. Also, in most cultures nodding your head signifies &quot;Yes&quot;, which the book &quot;The Definitive Book of Body Language&quot; describes as submissive gesture to representing the conversation is going the direction of the person speaking. The book explains that people who are born deaf can show a form of submissive gesture to signify &quot;Yes&quot;.

== Manual vs. non-manual communicative gestures ==
Within the realm of communicative gestures, the first distinction to be made is between gestures made with the hands and arms, and gestures made with other parts of the body. Examples of Non-manual gestures may include head nodding and shaking, shoulder shrugging, and facial expression, among others. Non-manual gestures are attested in languages all around the world, but have not been the primary focus of most research regarding co-speech gesture.

=== Manual gestures ===

A gesture that is a form of communication in which bodily actions communicate particular messages. Manual gestures are most commonly broken down into four distinct categories: Symbolic (Emblematic), Deictic (Indexical), Motor (Beat), and Lexical (Iconic)

Manual gesture in the sense of communicative co-speech gesture does not include the gesture-signs of sign languages, even though sign language is communicative and primarily produced using the hands, because the gestures in sign language are not used to intensify or modify the speech produced by the vocal tract, rather they communicate fully productive language through a method alternative to the vocal tract.

==== Symbolic (emblematic) ====
The most familiar are the so-called emblems or quotable gestures. These are conventional, culture-specific gestures that can be used as replacement for words, such as the handwave used in the US for &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;. A single emblematic gesture can have a very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive. The page List of gestures discusses emblematic gestures made with one hand, two hands, hand and other body parts, and body and facial gestures.

Symbolic gestures can occur either concurrently or independently of vocal speech. Symbolic gestures are iconic gestures that are widely recognized, fixed, and have conventionalized meanings.

==== Deictic (indexical) ====
Deictic gestures can occur simultaneously with vocal speech or in place of it. Deictic gestures are gestures that consist of indicative or pointing motions. These gestures often work in the same way as demonstrative words and pronouns like &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;.

Deictic gestures can refer to concrete or intangible objects or people.

====Motor (beat)====

Motor or beat gestures usually consist of short, repetitive, rhythmic movements that are closely tied with prosody in verbal speech. Unlike symbolic and deictic gestures, beat gestures cannot occur independently of verbal speech and convey no semantic information. For example, some people wave their hands as they speak to emphasize a certain word or phrase.

These gestures are closely coordinated with speech. The so-called beat gestures are used in conjunction with speech and keep time with the rhythm of speech to emphasize certain words or phrases. These types of gestures are integrally connected to speech and thought processes.

====Lexical (iconic)====

Other spontaneous gestures used during speech production known as iconic gestures are more full of content, and may echo, or elaborate, the meaning of the co-occurring speech. They depict aspects of spatial images, actions, people, or objects. For example, a gesture that depicts the act of throwing may be synchronous with the utterance, &quot;He threw the ball right into the window.&quot; Such gestures that are used along with speech tend to be universal. For example, one describing that they are feeling cold due to a lack of proper clothing and/or a cold weather can accompany their verbal description with a visual one. This can be achieved through various gestures such as by demonstrating a shiver and/or by rubbing the hands together. In such cases, the language or verbal description of the person does not necessarily need to be understood as someone could at least take a hint at what&#x27;s being communicated through the observation and interpretation of body language which serves as a gesture equivalent in meaning to what&#x27;s being said through communicative speech.

The elaboration of lexical gestures falls on a spectrum of iconic-metaphorical in how closely tied they are to the lexico-semantic content of the verbal speech they coordinate with. More iconic gesture very obviously mirrors the words being spoken (such as drawing a jagged horizontal line in the air to describe mountains) whereas more metaphorical gestures clearly contain some spatial relation to the semantic content of the co-occurring verbal speech, but the relationship between the gesture and the speech might be more ambiguous.

Lexical gestures, like motor gestures, cannot occur independently of verbal speech. The purpose of lexical gestures is still widely contested in the literature with some linguists arguing that lexical gestures serve to amplify or modulate the semantic content of lexical speech, or that it serves a cognitive purpose in aiding in lexical access and retrieval or verbal working memory. Most recent research suggests that lexical gestures serve a primarily socio-pragmatic role.

==Language development==

Studies affirm a strong link between gesture typology and language development. Young children under the age of two seem to rely on pointing gestures to refer to objects that they do not know the names of. Once the words are learned, they eschewed those referential (pointing) gestures. One would think that the use of gesture would decrease as the child develops spoken language, but results reveal that gesture frequency increased as speaking frequency increased with age. There is, however, a change in gesture typology at different ages, suggesting a connection between gestures and language development. Children most often use pointing and adults rely more on iconic and beat gestures. As children begin producing sentence-like utterances, they also begin producing new kinds of gestures that adults use when speaking (iconics and beats). Evidence of this systematic organization of gesture is indicative of its association to language development.

=== Sign languages ===

Gestural languages such as American Sign Language operate as complete natural languages that are gestural in modality. They should not be confused with finger spelling, in which a set of emblematic gestures are used to represent a written alphabet. Sign languages are different from gesturing in that concepts are modeled by certain hand motions or expressions and has a specific established structure while gesturing is more malleable and has no specific structure rather it supplements speech. 

Before an established sign language was created in Nicaragua after the 1970s, deaf Nicaraguans would use &quot;home signs&quot; in order to communicate with others. These home signs were not part of a unified language but were still used as familiar motions and expressions used within their family—still closely related to language rather than gestures with no specific structure. 

Home signs are similar to the gestural actions of chimpanzees. Gestures are used by these animals in place of verbal language, which is restricted in animals due to their lacking certain physiological and articulation abilities that humans have for speech. Corballis (2010) asserts that &quot;our hominid ancestors were better pre-adapted to acquire language-like competence using manual gestures than using vocal sounds.&quot; This leads to a debate about whether humans, too, looked to gestures first as their modality of language in the early existence of the species. The function of gestures may have been a significant player in the evolution of language.

==Social significance==

Gesturing is probably universal; there has been no report of a community that does not gesture. Gestures are a crucial part of everyday conversation such as chatting, describing a route, negotiating prices on a market; they are ubiquitous. Gestures are learned embodied cultural practices that can function as a way to interpret ethnic, gender, and sexual identity.

Gestures, commonly referred to as &quot;body language&quot;, play an important role in industry. Proper body language etiquette in business dealings can be crucial for success. However, gestures can have different meanings according to the country in which they are expressed. In an age of global business, diplomatic cultural sensitivity has become a necessity. Gestures that we take as innocent may be seen by someone else as deeply insulting.

The following gestures are examples of proper etiquette with respect to different countries&#x27; customs on salutations:
* In the United States, &quot;a firm handshake, accompanied by direct eye contact, is the standard greeting. Direct eye contact in both social and business situations is very important.&quot;
* In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, &quot;the Western custom of shaking a person&#x27;s hand upon introduction has become widespread throughout the country. However, oftentimes a nod of the head or a slight bow will suffice.&quot;
* In Japan, &quot;the act of presenting business cards is very important. When presenting, one holds the business card with both hands, grasping it between the thumbs and forefingers. The presentation is to be accompanied by a slight bow. The print on the card should point towards the person to which one is giving the card.&quot;
* In Germany, &quot;it is impolite to shake someone&#x27;s hand with your other hand in your pocket. This is seen as a sign of disrespect&quot;.
* In France, &quot;a light, quick handshake is common. To offer a strong, pumping handshake would be considered uncultured. When one enters a room, be sure to greet each person present. A woman in France will offer her hand first.&quot;

Gestures are also a means to initiate a mating ritual. This may include elaborate dances and other movements. Gestures play a major role in many aspects of human life.

Additionally, when people use gestures, there is a certain shared background knowledge. Different cultures use similar gestures when talking about a specific action such as how we gesture the idea of drinking out of a cup.

When an individual makes a gesture, another person can understand because of recognition of the actions/shapes.

Gestures have been documented in the arts such as in Greek vase paintings, Indian Miniatures or European paintings.

=== In religion ===
Gestures play a central role in religious or spiritual rituals.
In Hinduism and Buddhism, a &quot;mudra&quot; (Sanskrit, literally &quot;seal&quot;, &quot;gesture&quot; or &quot;attitude&quot;) is a symbolic gesture made with the hand, body or mind. Each mudra has a specific meaning, and is associated with a specific spiritual quality or state. In Yoga Mudras are considered to be higher practices which lead to awakening of the pranas, chakras and kundalini, and which can bestow major siddhis, psychic powers, on the advanced practitioner
In Hindu and Buddhist iconography mudras play a central role. For example, Vitarka Vicara, the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching, is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, while keeping the other fingers straight.

A common Christian religious gesture is crossing oneself as a sign of respect, also known as doing the sign of the cross, often accompanied by kneeling before a sacred object.

==Neurology==

Gestures are processed in the same areas of the brain as speech and sign language such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca&#x27;s area) and the posterior middle temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus and superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke&#x27;s area). It has been suggested that these parts of the brain originally supported the pairing of gesture and meaning and then were adapted in human evolution &quot;for the comparable pairing of sound and meaning as voluntary control over the vocal apparatus was established and spoken language evolved&quot;. As a result, it underlies both symbolic gesture and spoken language in the present human brain. Their common neurological basis also supports the idea that symbolic gesture and spoken language are two parts of a single fundamental semiotic system that underlies human discourse.
The linkage of hand and body gestures in conjunction with speech is further revealed by the nature of gesture use in blind individuals during conversation. This phenomenon uncovers a function of gesture that goes beyond portraying communicative content of language and extends David McNeill&#x27;s view of the gesture-speech system. This suggests that gesture and speech work tightly together, and a disruption of one (speech or gesture) will cause a problem in the other. Studies have found strong evidence that speech and gesture are innately linked in the brain and work in an efficiently wired and choreographed system. McNeill&#x27;s view of this linkage in the brain is just one of three currently up for debate; the others declaring gesture to be a &quot;support system&quot; of spoken language or a physical mechanism for lexical retrieval.

Because of this connection of co-speech gestures—a form of manual action—in language in the brain, Roel Willems and Peter Hagoort conclude that both gestures and language contribute to the understanding and decoding of a speaker&#x27;s encoded message. Willems and Hagoort&#x27;s research suggest that &quot;processing evoked by gestures is qualitatively similar to that of words at the level of semantic processing.&quot; This conclusion is supported through findings from experiments by Skipper where the use of gestures led to &quot;a division of labor between areas related to language or action (Broca&#x27;s area and premotor/primary motor cortex respectively)&quot;, The use of gestures in combination with speech allowed the brain to decrease the need for &quot;semantic control&quot;. Because gestures aided in understanding the relayed message, there was not as great a need for semantic selection or control that would otherwise be required of the listener through Broca&#x27;s area. Gestures are a way to represent the thoughts of an individual, which are prompted in working memory. The results of an experiment revealed that adults have increased accuracy when they used pointing gestures as opposed to simply counting in their heads (without the use of pointing gestures) Furthermore, the results of a study conducted by Marstaller and Burianová suggest that the use of gestures affect working memory. The researchers found that those with low capacity of working memory who were able to use gestures actually recalled more terms than those with low capacity who were not able to use gestures.

Although there is an obvious connection in the aid of gestures in understanding a message, &quot;the understanding of gestures is not the same as understanding spoken language.&quot; These two functions work together and gestures help facilitate understanding, but they only &quot;partly drive the neural language system&quot;.

==Electronic interface==

The movement of gestures can be used to interact with technology like computers, using touch or multi-touch popularised by the iPhone, physical movement detection and visual motion capture, used in video game consoles.

It can be recorded using kinematic methodology.

== Kendon&#x27;s continuum ==
In order to better understand the linguistic values that gestures hold, Adam Kendon, a pioneer in gesture research has proposed to look at it as a continuum from less linguistic to fully linguistic. Using the continuum, speech declines as &quot;the language-like properties of gestural behaviors increase and idiosyncratic gestures are replaced by socially regulated signs&quot;.

Gestures of different kinds fall within this continuum and include spontaneous gesticulations, language-like gestures, pantomime, emblems, and sign language. Spontaneous gesticulations are not evident without the presence of speech, assisting in the process of vocalization, whereas language-like gestures are &quot;iconic and metaphoric, but lack consistency and are context-dependent&quot;. &quot;Language-like gesture&quot; implies that the gesture is assuming something linguistic (Loncke, 2013). Pantomime falls in the middle of the continuum and requires shared conventions. This kind of gesture helps convey information or describe an event.

Following pantomime are emblems, which have specific meanings to denote &quot;feelings, obscenities, and insults&quot; and are not required to be used in conjunction with speech. The most linguistic gesture on Kendon&#x27;s continuum is sign language, where &quot;single manual signs have specific meanings and are combined with other manual signs according to specific rules&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Giorgio Agamben, in the book &quot;Karman&quot;, says gesture is a pure means without purpose, as an intermediate form between the doing of praxis and that of poiesis. In an opposite spirit, Giovanni Maddalena introduced &quot;The philosophy of gesture&quot; where gesture is defined as any performed act with a beginning and an end that carries on a meaning (from the latin gero = to bear, to carry on). According to this philosophy, gesture is our normal procedure to embody vague ideas in singular actions with a general meaning. Gesture is forged by a dense blending of icons, indices, and symbols and by a complexity of phenomenological characteristics, such as feelings, actual actions, general concepts, and habits (firstness, secondness, and thirdness in Charles S. Peirce&#x27;s phenomenology).

<text>The Greens (DG, &quot;De Groenen&quot;) is a political party in the Netherlands. It advocates for Green politics, an unconditional basic income and emphasises its anti-militarism.

==History==

A group of Dutch environmentalists led by Marten Bierman founded The Greens on 17 December 1983. They entered the European elections under the name &quot;European Greens&quot; since the name &quot;The Greens&quot; was controlled by Bas de Gaay Fortman. The party&#x27;s foundation was supported by the Francophone Belgian green party Ecolo, while the German Greens supported the Green Progressive Accord. The party became involved in the formation of the Coordination of European Green Parties. It won 1.3% of vote in the 1984 European parliament election, below the threshold of 4% for a seat.

For the 1986 national elections, the party used now the name &quot;The Greens&quot;, which was abandoned. With Marten Bierman as top-candidate, it won 0.2% of the votes, below the threshold of 0.7% for a seat. The party had a federal structure consisting of provincial parties. In 1987, The Greens participated in the North Holland, South Holland and Gelderland provincial elections. They won one seat on the States of North Holland, partially because of the support of Green Amsterdam led by Roel van Duijn. On March 10, 1989 Green Amsterdam merged with The Greens.

In 1989, GroenLinks was formed by a merger of PPR, PSP, CPN and the Christian left Evangelical People&#x27;s Party. The Greens rejected to join the merger because it emphasised social-economic issues too much and environmental issues too little. Independently, they participated in the 1989 elections with Roel van Duijn as their top candidate. The party won 0.35% of votes, below the threshold. The party abandoned its federal structure in 1992.

For the Dutch general election of 1994, GroenLinks proposed a candidate chosen by The Greens on place 10 on their list, but this was rejected by The Green&#x27;s Congress. The party entered the election with Hein Westerouen van Meeteren as top-candidate and won 0.2% of vote. In the 1994 municipal elections the party expanded its number of seats and won seats in Leiden, Nijmegen, Zwolle and Amsterdam. In 1991, GroenLinks MEP Herman Verbeek left his party and continued as an independent. He became a member of The Greens in 1994 and led their European list in the European Parliament election. The party won 2.36% of vote, below the threshold.

In 1995, the party contested several provincial elections. It won seats in North Holland and South Holland (on a combined GroenLinks/The Greens list). The party cooperated with several provincial parties to form a common list for the indirect elections for the Senate by the States-Provincial. The first seat was taken by the &quot;Federation of Frisian Municipal-interest Parties&quot; and the second by Marten Bierman. Bierman was elected by preference votes. He formed a separate Independent Senate Fraction, a novelty in Dutch politics. Before no group had previously had representation in the Senate without also being present in the House of Representatives. In the 1998 elections the party participated with Jaap Dirkmaat as top-candidate and won 0.2% of the votes. The party did keep its seats in municipal councils and expanded to Haarlem, Zeist, Arnhem, Groningen and Haren.

The Greens have not participated in the Dutch general elections since 1998. The party received 0.19% of the vote in the European elections of 2009 and 0.23% of the vote in the European elections of 2014.

By 2017, the party was split into two conflicting groups both claiming legitimacy with the total party membership being 33. One faction held a congress with 10 attendees which elected Otto ter Haar party leader.

<text>A visual comparison is to compare two or more things by eye. This might be done by placing them side by side; by overlaying them; by alternating an image or by presenting each image to a separate eye.

Such comparisons are the first stage in a child&#x27;s development of an understanding of geometry and measurement, before they move to an understanding of measuring devices such as a ruler.

People with sufficient control over the parallax of their eyeballs (e.g. those who can easily view random-dot stereograms) can hold up two paper printouts and go cross-eyed to superimpose them. This invokes deep, fast, built-in image comparison wetware (the same machinery responsible for depth perception) and differences stand out almost immediately. This technique is good for finding edits in graphical images, or for comparing an image with a compressed version to spot artefacts.

Visual comparison with a standard chart or reference is often used as a means of measuring complex phenomena such as the weather, sea states or the roughness of a river. A colour chart is used for this purpose in many contexts such as chemistry, cosmetics, medical testing and photography.

Comparison by eye may also be used as a source of amusement or intelligence testing, as in the popular puzzle of spot the difference.

In policing, the technique is used for analysis of fingerprints and identity parades.

Visual comparison task can be simplified by using a computer software that automatically aligns a pair of images based on common visual features present in the two images.

==Computer jargon==
A visual diff or vdiff finds differences between two files by eyeball search. The term optical diff has also been reported, and is sometimes more specifically used for the act of superimposing two nearly identical printouts on one another and holding them up to a light to spot differences. Though this method is poor for detecting omissions in the ‘rear’ file, it can also be used with printouts of graphics, a claim few diff programs can make.

<doc id="403681" wikidata="Q91369" url="?curid=403681" title="Trou de loup">
<text>In medieval fortification, a trou de loup (, ; plural trous de loup, also commonly referred to as a tiger pit in the East) was a type of booby trap or defensive obstacle. Each trou de loup consisted of a conical pit about deep and wide at the top. At the bottom of the pit, a sharpened punji stick (wooden stake) would be hammered in. In some cases, the pit was concealed by light cover of wicker and a layer of soil.

Trous de loup might be found singly as a trap (in which case they were always concealed), or in a dense pattern with no gaps between pits, used as an obstacle in front of a defended position.

A field of trous de loup could be made more effective if subsequently flooded to a shallow depth, which would conceal the pits, make their sides slippery, and add the risk of drowning.

Sometimes rotting meat or feces would be smeared onto the points to cause serious infection or death.

==History==
Even though the term has a medieval origin, this kind of device was first described by Julius Caesar, in the seventh book of his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; (Commentaries on the Gallic Wars), who employed the device during the siege of Alesia. Caesar writes they were called &quot;lilies&quot; for their resemblance to the flower of the same name. Later Roman examples can be seen at Rough Castle on the Antonine Wall in Great Britain.

<doc id="403685" wikidata="Q506537" url="?curid=403685" title="Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)">
<text>The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) (), abbreviated CPN (Maoist Centre) or CPN (MC), is the third largest political party in Nepal and a member party of Samajbadi Morcha. It was founded in 1994 after breaking away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre). The party launched an armed struggle in 1996 against the Nepalese government. In 2006, the party formally joined mainstream politics after signing a peace agreement following the 2006 Nepalese revolution.

Pushpa Kamal Dahal has served as the leader of the party since its foundation. The party holds 32 seats in the House of Representatives making them the third largest parliamentary group. Dahal recently served as Prime Minister of Nepal as part of a ruling coalition following the 2022 general election for almost 1.5 years to 2024 July. The party has previously led three previous governments; in 2008 and 2016 under Dahal, and in 2013 under Baburam Bhattarai.

The party was formed in 1994 with same name as its parent party Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre) and was named as the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) in 1996. After the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre–Masal) and its electoral front, Janamorcha Nepal merged with the party in 2009, the unified party came to be known as the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The party emerged in its current state in 2016 following the unification of various splinter groups with the party.

The party was dissolved on 17 May 2018, after merging with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) to create the Nepal Communist Party but was revived on 8 March 2021 following a Supreme Court ruling in favor of Rishi Kattel, who had claimed the Nepal Communist Party name. The party claimed to have 750,000 members as of December 2021, making them the third largest party in Nepal by membership.

== History ==
=== Founding, 1994–1996 ===
The party was formed in 1994 following a split in the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre) into two factions, one led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the other led Nirmal Lama. The electoral front of the party, the United People&#x27;s Front of Nepal, also split and the faction led by Baburam Bhattarai allied with the Pushpa Kamal Dahal led Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre). The two United People&#x27;s Front of Nepal decided to register itself with the Election Commission, but the commission only recognized the Nirmal Lama backed party. Baburam Bhattarai responded by calling for a boycott of the 1994 mid-term elections.

=== Preparations for struggle, 1995–1996 ===
The Unity Centre led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal went completely underground after the split to begin preparations for its next phase of struggle. The party held its Third Plenum in March 1995, where the party renamed itself to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). It also decided that the for &quot;the true liberation of the people, all efforts must be concentrated for the development of a people&#x27;s war that would usher in the new people&#x27;s democratic form of government&quot; and officially decided to give up its policy of taking part in parliamentary elections.

The March meeting was followed by six months of preparations to recast the old organizational structure into a fighting machine, and in September 1995, the &#x27;Plan for the Historic Initiation of the People&#x27;s War&#x27; was adopted by the Central Committee of the party. There then began a series of public meetings all over the country under the aegis of the United People&#x27;s Front of Nepal as part of the final politico-ideological preparation. The party launched the &#x27;Sija campaign&#x27; in Rolpa and Rukum, named after the Sisne and Jaljala mountains in the two districts, to propagate the ideology of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism.

In October 1995, during the Sija campaign, a fight broke out between supporters of the United People&#x27;s Front of Nepal and other parties, mainly the Nepali Congress and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, at a village in the eastern part of Rukum. The newly formed government under Sher Bahadur Deuba moved swiftly to arrest the UPFN supporters, accusing them of creating public disorder. The police then launched &#x27;Operation Romeo&#x27; in November 1995. Officially, Operation Romeo was labeled as an operation to control a rise in criminal activities in Rolpa. Operation Romeo resulted in gross violations of human rights, including the arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds of members of left-of-center parties, rapes, executions and &quot;disappearances&quot;. In the light of this action, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the party met briefly in January 1996 and made the final decision on the historic initiation of the &#x27;People&#x27;s War&#x27; for 13 February 1996.

On 4 February 1996, Baburam Bhattarai led a three-member delegation of the United People&#x27;s Front of Nepal to present a memorandum to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The memorandum warned that unless the government took initiative to fulfill their 40-point demands by 17 February the UFPN would launch an armed revolution.

=== People&#x27;s war, 1996–2001 ===

On 13 February 1996, after Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba had left for a state visit to India two days before, the office of the Small Farmer&#x27;s Development Programme run by the Agricultural Development Bank was overrun in Gorkha district and the loan papers were destroyed. This was followed in the evening by attacks on police posts in Aathbiskot-Rari in Rukum, Holeri in Rolpa and Sindhuligadhi in Sindhuli. The &#x27;People&#x27;s War&#x27; was formally launched.
After the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) came into government in 1997, violence between both sides stopped but the issue could not be resolved. The government formed a taskforce to look into the &#x27;Maoist Activities and a Search for Solutions&#x27; in April 1997 under CPN (UML) MP Prem Singh Dhami but the commission report was ultimately shelved in August of the same year. A local election was called in May 1997, but polls could not be held in 87 village development committees due to intimidation by the Maoists. The government in response attempted to introduce the Terrorist and Destructive Activities (Control and Punishment) Act in July 1997 at the initiative of deputy prime minister and home minister Bam Dev Gautam. The act would give the police wide-ranging powers against perceived &#x27;terrorists&#x27;. But the government was forced to backtrack on the law before it was placed in front of the parliament owing to mass protests from the civil society, the media, and international organizations.

On 13 February 1998, the second anniversary of the &#x27;people&#x27;s war&#x27;, the Maoists announced the existence of a Central Military Commission under Prachanda. By May 1998, 51 village development committees in Rolpa district and western Nepal were under Maoist control and they were operating a parallel administration called the &#x27;People&#x27;s Government&#x27;. When the new Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala went on tour of the Maoist influenced area he realized that the situation was getting out of hand. After an attack on Kalikatar in Tanahun, the home district of the home minister, Govinda Raj Joshi, the state launched a moved swiftly and launched the &#x27;Kilo Serra II&#x27;. The operation was meant to be a &#x27;search and kill&#x27; operation to prevent Maoist movement from gaining strength. Unlike Operation Romeo, which was concentrated on the western hills, &#x27;Kilo Serra Two&#x27; was spread out across all the Maoist controlled regions of the country. From mid-1998 an unprecedented number of Maoists and their supporters—as well as civilians caught in the middle—were killed. Almost five hundred people were killed under &#x27;Kilo Serra Two&#x27;.

During the elections in 1999, the Maoists simply called for a boycott and did not disrupt the polls. In December 1999, the Krishna Prasad Bhattarai government formed the &#x27;High-Level Committee to Provide Suggestions to Solve the Maoist Problem&#x27; under Sher Bahadur Deuba, and two months later authorised it to hold talks with the Maoists. Contact was established with the Maoist leadership, and the response was positive. A letter by Prachanda to a government intermediary stated that three minimum conditions need to fulfilled before any high level negotiations and that they would cease all operations during this time. The conditions were, reveal the whereabouts of a central committee member of the CPN-Maoist along with others who had &#x27;disappeared&#x27;, initiate moves to release arrested workers and sympathizers; and end state terrorism and begin process to investigate the incident of arson and killing in Rukum district. After Krishna Prasad Bhattarai resigned and was replaced by Girija Prasad Koirala, the new prime minister declared: &#x27;The first priority of the government will be to restore law and order in the country to protect lives of the people.&#x27;

Following this an &#x27;Armed Nepal Bandh&#x27; was announced for 6 April 2000 and attacks on the police resumed. In late September, the Maoists overran Dunai, the district headquarters of Dolpa. Following this attack the Royal Nepal Army was mobilized for security duty in 16 districts. The army could not be brought to the fight against the Maoists however due to disagreements between the Prime Minister and the King of Nepal, the supreme commander of the Royal Nepal Army.

Girija Prasad Koirala came in contact with the Maoist leadership during this time and the deputy prime minister, Ram Chandra Paudel, met with a Central Committee member of the CPN-Maoist. The breakthrough came to be a naught in the end as the government released a top Maoist leader after having him renounce his party at a press conference. In February 2001, informal talks with the government and the Maoists almost began but the Maoists backed out, asking for a postponement. Then on February 26, they announced that they had just conducted their second national conference and Pushpa Kamal Dahal was elected chairman. Furthermore, it was announced that the guiding ideology of the party will become Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Prachanda Path.

In March 2001, the government published the names of 294 individuals who were in police custody charged with being sympathizers and members of the CPN-Maoist. Then in early April 2001, without any warnings, the Maoists carried out devastating attacks in police posts in Rukum and Dailekh districts within a week of each other, killing 70 policemen. The Maoists also announced that no negotiations would be held with the government until Girija Prasad Koirala stepped down. On 7 July 2001, the birthday of the new king Gyanendra, 41 policemen were killed by the Maoists in Gulmi, Lamjung and Nuwakot districts. Later that month, they attacked a police post in Rolpa and took 69 policemen hostage. The Koirala government immediately mobilized the army but when the soldiers failed to engage with the Maoists, Koirala resigned as Prime Minister. Sher Bahadur Deuba followed him as prime minister and immediately announced a ceasefire, which was reciprocated by the Maoist side with a ceasefire of their own.

=== People&#x27;s Liberation Army, 2001–2002 ===
In mid-August 2001, a meeting between the mainstream communist parties and the CPN-Maoist was arranged by the Communist Party of Nepal (Masal) near Siliguri, but nothing significant emerged from this meeting since Prachanda&#x27;s request for support on the Maoist call for a republic was turned down. The first official meeting between the government and the Maoists were held on August 30, 2001, led by deputy prime minister Chiranjibi Wagle and Krishna Bahadur Mahara from the Maoist side. Nothing substantial happened during this meeting except for mutual commitment to hold talks again. Two weeks later, the second was held in western Nepal and the Maoists placed a full range of demand on the table. These demands were of three categories. The first was calls for a constituent assembly, an interim government and a republic. The second dealt with treaties with India and policies regarding India. The third was going public with details of arrested Maoists and a rollback of police operations.

The parliament passed the Armed Police Force Act, 2001 in August 2001 for the formation of an Armed Police Force to counter the Maoists as the Royal Nepal Army could only be mobilized by the king, who was the supreme commander of the army. In September 2001, the &#x27;people&#x27;s army&#x27; was restructured into the &#x27;People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27; and was under the supreme command of Prachanda. The PLA consisted of the bulk of the Maoist guerrilla fighting force, which was estimated anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 strong. The Maoists also had a militia, who were assigned guard duty in Maoist-controlled village development committees.

Before the third round of talks were going to held, the government scrapped the Public Security Regulations and freed 68 prisoners, while the Maoist side gave up their calls for a republic and an interim government. The third round of talks were held on 13 November 2001 but was inconclusive as demands for a constituent assembly was rejected by the government, a call backed by other political parties.

The Maoists ended the four month-long ceasefire on 23 November 2001 by attacking government and private installations throughout the country after a statement two days earlier by Prachanda which signaled that talks were about to break down. The Maoists also attacked army barracks for the first time. The Maoists attacked Ghorahi in Dang and briefly took control of the district headquarters. They killed more than two dozen police and army personnel, blew up government offices, freed prisoners from the local jail and stole NPR 64.8 million worth of gold and silver from local banks. This coincided with attacks all over the country the most serious of which was in Syangja where 14 policemen were killed. This was followed two days later by an attack on the headquarters and army barracks in Solukhumbu District. The attack on the headquarters was unsuccessful but they made out with a substantial amount of ammunition and sophisticated weapons from their attack on the army barracks. The party also announced the formation of a 37-member United Revolutionary People&#x27;s Council of Nepal and was headed by Baburam Bhattarai.

Following this the prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, imposed a state of emergency and promulgated an anti-terrorist ordinance that labeled the CPN (Maoist) a terrorist organization. After failure to increase the time period for the state of emergency, King Gyanendra on the recommendation of the prime minister dissolved the parliament in May 2002 and buoyed by the success against the Maoist insurgents, decided to call for elections in November of the same year. But following a surprise attack in Sandhikharka in Arghakhanchi District which killed 65 security personnel, the prime minister asked for more time to conduct the polls. The king promptly removed Deuba in October 2002 for his &#x27;incompetence&#x27; and assumed the country&#x27;s executive authority.

=== King&#x27;s rule, 2002–2006 ===

On 26 January 2003, the Maoists killed the Inspector General of the Armed Police Force, Krishna Mohan Shrestha, his wife and a bodyguard during a morning walk. After the government decided to retract the terrorist label, bounties and a red corner notice against the Maoists, another ceasefire was announced on 29 January 2003. The peace talks between the government and the Maoists resumed on 27 April 2003, led by deputy prime minister Badri Prasad Mandal and Baburam Bhattarai from the Maoists. Another round of talks were held on 10 May 2003, following which the government decided to restrict army movement to five kilometres from their barracks, forming a code of conduct during the ceasefire and releasing some top Maoist leaders. After the government released key members of the Maoist party the third round of talks finally began on 17 August 2003. The ceasefire was broken on 27 August 2003 by Prachanda, after the two groups could not agree on the formation of a constituent assembly.

Although there were intermittent ceasefires, fighting was roughly continuous through 2005. In 2005, the CPN (Maoist) sought a different strategy of seeking permanent peace accords while forming a pro-democratic alliance with several other mainstream political parties in opposition to the monarchical dictatorship of King Gyanendra. Following massive popular uprisings and protests (some involving over a million people), a prolonged general strike in 2006, and several violent clashes between protesters and the Nepalese Army, the monarchy finally capitulated. The CPN (Maoist) gained international legitimacy as they agreed to lay down arms and participate in the new electoral process. In the aftermath of the conflict, several western European powers removed the CPN (Maoist) from their government&#x27;s terrorist lists. In 2012, the US State Department followed suit and delisted the CPN (Maoist) as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;, citing the party&#x27;s &quot;...credible commitment to pursuing peace and reconciliation...&quot;.

=== Comprehensive Peace Accord, 2006–2008 ===
After waging the Civil War for 10 years, the CPN (Maoist) sat down for peace talks after the success of the People&#x27;s Movement in 2002/03. The Twelve-Point Agreement reached between the then seven-party alliance and the Maoist rebels in Delhi created a path for peaceful agitation against the direct rule of the king and to end autocracy in Nepal. The civil war conducted by the CPN (Maoist) created the foundation for the establishment of a republic in Nepal. It also created political consciousness among the people at the grassroots level and, to some extent, awareness of the need for national socio-economic transformation.

After the declaration of the king to reinstate the parliament, the CPN (Maoist) insisted that the declaration was a betrayal to the people. Instead the king should bring down his institution for his deeds. But there was no hearing from the other parties in the alliance. Maoist chairman Prachanda appeared at the prime minister&#x27;s residence, Baluwatar for the peace talk and said that he was there to establish a new kind of democracy in Nepal, although he did not reveal details.

After the peace talks held between the CPN (Maoist) and the Government of Nepal, the Maoist rebels were ready to put an end to the 10-year-long Civil War. Signing the Comprehensive Peace Accord, Maoist chairman Prachanda said that the Civil War had come to an end and a new revolution was to be waged by the reinstated parliament. The peace accord was signed on September 21, 2006, ending the Maoist revolution. However, Prachanda was able to provide legacy to the 19,000-member People&#x27;s Liberation Army that was kept in the cantonment under the supervision of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN).

The interim constitution of Nepal 2063, gave a constitutional position to these Maoist cadres. There was a provision for providing monthly allowance for the Maoist armies staying at the cantonment. The Maoist leaders believe that the revolution has not ended here but only the form of struggle was changed.

=== First Constituent Assembly, 2008–2012 ===
In the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections, the CPN (Maoist) won 220 seats and an additional 9 members were nominated from the party giving them a strength of 229 seats and making them the largest party in the 1st Constituent Assembly. Despite accusations of fraud from older parties like the Nepali Congress and CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist), international observers reported that the elections were held in a peaceful, orderly manner and were satisfying. The Maoists did not have a majority to form the government and had to form a coalition with CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum, Nepal. Chairman of the party, Pushpa Kamal Dahal was elected prime minister after getting 464 out of 577 votes against Nepali Congress candidate Sher Bahadur Deuba. As the first proposal of the first meeting of this Constituent Assembly received full support, it was declared that the monarchy of Nepal has ended forever and the monarchy that has been in power for 240 years has been formally ended and Nepal has become a federal democratic republic.
On 13 January 2009 the party merged with the CPN (Unity Centre–Masal) to form the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The election front of CPN (Unity Centre–Masal), Janamorcha Nepal also merged into the party and with its 8 seats took the Maoists&#x27; total strength to 237 in the Constituent Assembly. The Maoist government fell after its coalition partners withdrew support from the government after Dahal tried to sack the army chief, Rookmangud Katuwal. President Ram Baran Yadav rejected Dahal&#x27;s proposal to sack the army chief and he resigned on 4 May 2009. After the Maoist government fell, a faction under Matrika Prasad Yadav split from the party and reformed the former CPN (Maoist). Matrika Prasad Yadav and Jagat Prasad Yadav also resigned from the Constituent Assembly and were replaced from among the party list.

In February 2011 the Maoists formed a coalition with the CPN (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and formed a government under UML&#x27;s Jhala Nath Khanal. The government could not agree a deal to complete the integration of former Maoist combatants and Khanal resigned on 15 August 2011 to pave the way for a formation of a national consensus government. Almost two weeks later, Baburam Bhattarai was elected prime minister defeating Ram Chandra Paudel from the Nepali Congress 340–235. The government under Bhattarai was able to get finalize a deal to integrate the former Maoist guerrillas and a deal was signed with all major parties on 1 November 2011. Hardliner factions inside the party, like party vice-chairman Mohan Baidya, were however unsatisfied with the decision.

The government however failed to agree a consensus on the drafting of the new constitution and on 28 May 2012, Baburam Bhattarai requested President Ram Baran Yadav to dissolve the Constituent Assembly and call for fresh elections. On 18 June 2012, party vice-chairman Mohan Baidya split the party and formed the Communist Party of Nepal–Maoist. He accused the party of being filled with opportunists and the leadership of destroying the achievements of the People&#x27;s War. He also termed accepting the line of &quot;democratic republic&quot; in 2005 and signing the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006 as major mistakes by the Maoist leadership. Baburam Bhattrai resigned as prime minister and on 14 March 2013, Chief Justice Khil Raj Regmi was appointed as an interim prime minister to hold the elections.

=== Second Constituent Assembly, 2013–2015 ===
In the 2013 Constituent Assembly election, held on 19 November 2013, the UCPN (Maoist) won just 80 seats and an additional 3 seats were nominated from the party to the 2nd Constituent Assembly compared to 237 in the 1st Constituent Assembly. The result meant that the Maoists were dropped to be the third largest party in the Constituent Assembly from first in past. The party rejected the results and blamed it on an &quot;international and national&quot; conspiracy and warned that the party would sit out of the newly elected Constituent Assembly.

The party later agreed to join the new constituent assembly and Onsari Gharti Magar from the party was elected as the vice-chairman of the Constituent Assembly on 26 February 2014. Nepali Congress president Sushil Koirala became the new prime minister of Nepal but the Maoists did not join his government. The new Constituent Assembly was finally able to deliver a constitution and on 17 September 2015, the Constitution of Nepal, 2015 was approved by 507 members. Baburam Bhattarai resigned from the newly formed Legislature Parliament of Nepal and the party following the announcement of the constitution and formed Naya Shakti Party, Nepal.

=== Federal Republic and dissolution, 2016–2018 ===
Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister for the second time on 3 August 2016, before resigning on 25 May 2017 to make way for Sher Bahadur Deuba to become prime minister as per an agreement with Nepali Congress. On 19 May 2016, 10 Maoist parties including pro-unity factions from the Communist Party of Nepal (Revolutionary Maoist) and Communist Party of Nepal and the Matrika Yadav-led Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) merged with the party. The party renamed itself to Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) following the merger.

In the 2017 local elections, the party won 5,411 seats including 106 mayor and chair positions of 753 becoming third largest. The party won the mayoral post in only one metropolitan city, Bharatpur with the support of Nepali Congress and Renu Dahal(Daughter of Puspa Kamal Dahal) became mayor.

The party announced an alliance with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) before the start of the 2017 legislative and provincial elections but did not quit the government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba. The party won 53 seats and again emerged as the third largest party in the House of Representatives. The party also won 108 seats to provincial assemblies and formed coalition governments with the CPN (UML) in six out of the seven provinces. According to the power sharing agreement, Maoist Centre would lead the government in Karnali and Sudurpashchim. The party also formed a coalition government with the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) to lead the federal government. In the National Assembly elections on 6 February 2018, the party won 12 of the 56 elected seats. Nanda Bahadur Pun was also re-elected as vice-president on 19 March 2018.

On 17 May 2018, the Party Unification Coordination Committee decided to dissolve both coalition parties in order to create a merger party, the Nepal Communist Party.

=== Revival, 2021–present ===

On 8 March 2021, Nepal&#x27;s Supreme Court stated that the allocation of the name &quot;Nepal Communist Party&quot; upon the merger of the CPN(UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre), and by extension the merger itself, was void &quot;ab initio&quot;, as the name was already allotted to a party led by Rishiram Kattel, and that the NCP stood &quot;dismissed&quot;. Upon the ruling, the two predecessor parties were revived in their original state immediately prior to the merger, although should the two wish to merge again with proper procedure being followed, it would be fully allowed.

==== 2021 Split ====
The party faced a split when the MPs Prabhu Sah, Gauri Shankar Chaudhary, Lekhraj Bhatta, Deputy prime minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi) and two National Assembly members (including Ram Bhadur Thapa) split from the party and joined the CPN(UML), along with nine provincial assembly members. Two mayors and three rural municipality chairpersons also left the party and joined the CPN(UML).

== Ideology ==

The Maoists launched a ‘People&#x27;s War’ on 13 February 1996, under the slogan: &quot;Let us march ahead on the path of struggle towards establishing the people&#x27;s rule by wrecking the reactionary ruling system of state.&quot; Maoists strongly believe in the philosophy of Mao Zedong who proclaimed, &quot;Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.&quot; Maoists also draw inspiration from the ‘Revolutionary Internationalist Movement’, Peru&#x27;s left wing guerrilla movement—the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), and from radical communist parties in different parts of the world.

The Maoists&#x27; aims in the ‘People&#x27;s War’ were to establish a ‘People&#x27;s Democracy’ in Nepal. The Maoists view it as an &quot;historical revolt against feudalism, imperialism and reformists.&quot; The catalyst for declaring the ‘People&#x27;s War’ was the failure of the Nepalese government to respond to a memorandum presented by its representatives to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on 4 February 1996. The memorandum listed 40 demands related to &quot;nationalism, democracy and livelihood&quot;. These included the abolition of royal privileges, the promulgation of a new constitution, and the abrogation of the Mahakali Treaty with India, which regulated the distribution of water and electricity as well as the delineation of the border between the two countries.
In second conference of the CPN (Maoist), a post for chairman was created for the Maoist chief Prachanda. Until then, the chief of the organization had been its general secretary. A report titled “The great leap forward: An inevitable need of history” was presented by Prachanda. This report was in serious discussion in the central committee and the top leaders of the party. Based on this report, the CPN (Maoist) adopted Prachanda Path as its ideology. After five years of armed struggle, the party realized that none of the proletarian revolutions of the past could be carried out on Nepal&#x27;s context. So having analyzed the serious challenges and growing changes in the global arena, and moving further ahead than Marxism, Leninism and Maoism, the party determined its own ideology, Prachanda Path.

Prachanda Path in essence is a different kind of uprising, which can be described as the fusion of a protracted people&#x27;s war strategy which was adopted by Mao in China and the Russian model of armed revolution. Professor Lok Raj Baral, in his writing about Prachanda Path says that this doctrine doesn&#x27;t apparently make an ideological break with Marxism and Leninism but finds that these doctrines&#x27; strategies aren&#x27;t able to be replicated in Nepal as it was done in the past. Most of the Maoist leaders think that the adoption of Prachanda Path after the second national conference is what nudged the party into moving ahead with a clear vision ahead after five years of &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot;.

Senior Maoist leader Mohan Vaidya alias Kiran says, &quot;Just as Marxism was born in Germany, Leninism in Russia and Maoism in China, Prachanda Path is Nepal&#x27;s identity of revolution. Just as Marxism has three facets – philosophy, political economy and scientific socialism, Prachanda Path is a combination of all three totally in Nepal&#x27;s political context.&quot; The adoption of Prachanda Path was inspired truly from the Shining Path. In fact, the bringing up of new doctrine worked out with the concept of giving a new identity to Nepal&#x27;s revolution. Talking about the party&#x27;s philosophy, Maoist chairman Prachanda says, &quot;The party considers Prachanda path as an enrichment of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism.&quot; After the party brought forward its new doctrine, the government was trying to comprehend the new ideology, Prachanda Path.

== Women in the party ==

Women have been prominent in the recruiting profile. Available reports indicate that one-fifth to one-third of the cadre and the combatants during the Nepalese Civil War may be women. Reportedly, every village under Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) control had a revolutionary women&#x27;s organization. According to a Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review report of October 2001, there were usually two women in each unit of 35–40 men, and they were used to gather intelligence and act as couriers. Baburam Bhattarai was quoted as saying in Spacetime on 18 April 2003, that 50 percent of cadres at the lower level, 30 percent of soldiers and 10 percent of members of central committee of the outfit were women. Durgha Pokhrel, then Chairman of National Women&#x27;s Commission, who visited more than 25 Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) controlled districts, stated on 3 July 2003, during a talk delivered at the Nepal Council of World Affairs that percentage of women cadres could be as high as 40. A women&#x27;s group, the All-Nepal Women&#x27;s Association (Revolutionary), is alleged to be a front outfit of the CPN-M.

== Criticism ==
=== Use of children ===
During the Nepalese Civil War, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) resorted to mass under-age recruitment, particularly of young students, usually between 12 and 16 years old. At the conclusion of the war, an estimated 12,000 Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) soldiers were below 18 years of age, and Human Rights Watch estimates that the majority of the current militia joined as minors. The United Nation Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) has verified that there were nine thousand child soldiers in Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) cantonment training camps.

The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) used children as soldiers, messengers, cooks, porters and suppliers. Regardless of role, all children received rudimentary military training concerning explosives, so they would be able to recognize and avoid land mines. The current Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Centre), however, continues to deny that any of its soldiers during the war were less than 18 years of age. They also claim that they have cared for orphans of adult soldiers killed in the war, and that these children were not placed in danger.

=== Links with fraternal parties ===
According to available information, the Maoists of Nepal have well-established linkages with Indian revolutionary communist organizations, primarily with the Communist Party of India (Maoist), currently leading a protracted &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; throughout the subcontinent. The first signs of contacts were reportedly registered during 1989–1990, when the two groups started collaborating in order to expand their influence. According to Indian government analysis, they began the process of laying a corridor, which is now widely referred to as the Revolutionary Corridor (RC) extending from Nepal to across six Indian States, including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. This entire area has been identified in Maoist literature as the Compact Revolutionary Zone (CRZ). The CRZ was organized by the Nepal and Indian members of the Naxalite movement, in a meeting at Siliguri in the Indian State of West Bengal during August 2001. Indian Maoists are known as Naxalites (or Naxals) in reference to a popular uprising that began decades ago centered in the village of Naxalbari.

Nepalese Maoists had sent their delegates to the March 2001 Congress of PWG held at Abuz Marh in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. The establishment of CRZ gave a wider space and platform for all the proscribed Nepal and Indian Naxalite organizations to strengthen their bases in both the countries.
The CPN (Maoist) is a participating organization of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM), a global association of revolutionary communist parties. In July 2001, 10 regional Maoist groups formed the Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organization of South Asia (CCOMPOSA), in which the Nepalese Maoists, PWG, MCC, Purbo Banglar Sarbahara Party (Bangladesh), Communist Party of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and other Indian communist parties became members. The appearance of graffiti in remote villages in Naxalite-strongholds, in Rayakal and Mallapur mandals (administrative unit) of Karimnagar district in Andhra Pradesh, hailing CCOMPOSA points the spread of the idea of a common front of revolutionary communist groups in South Asia. Moreover, the Central Committee of the Maoists, in late-January 2002, passed a resolution stating that it would work together with the PWG and the MCC in fighting the ban imposed on the latter two organisations in India, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. A year earlier, in 2001, the Maoists had sent a senior leader named Gaurav as a fraternal delegate to attend the 9th Congress of the PWG. Reports indicate that the Maoists and the PWG have also formed the Indo-Nepal Border Region Committee to coordinate their activities in North Bihar and along the India-Nepal border.

During the civil war, the Maoists also gathered a lot of support from organizations in South Asia, which was very important in carrying out the struggle with certain pace. Having visited several districts in India, Maoist chairman Prachanda studied the challenges of launching an armed struggle. Chairman Prachanda drafted war policies and tactics staying in India. Chairman Prachanda says, “First and foremost, there was the RIM Committee. There were important ideological and political exchanges. From the RIM committee we got the experience of the Communist Party of Peru, the two line struggle there, and also the experience in Turkey, the experience in Iran and the experience in the Philippines.” The CPN Maoist also participated in a South Asian Conference where they held discussions with the civil war group and Maoist communist Centre groups. The party believes in achieving a lot from this meet about conducting a civil war.

Having realized the necessity of spreading the party&#x27;s message to the world, the party came up with a decision to host a website which was to spread the knowledge about Nepalese revolution. Thus, www.cpnm.org was hosted with the help of some of the fraternal Maoist organization in Europe. The CPN Maoist currently after the jump into the &quot;mainstream&quot; politics played an initiative role in introducing a Maoist Communist Party in Bhutan as well. The new party in Bhutan is said to have greatly inspired from the Nepalese Civil War and want to have a same practice there.

=== MCC Compact ===
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) entered Nepal during the premiership of Bhattarai while a committee was formed during second premiership of Dahal to rectify MCC&#x27;s compact. During premiership of Bhattarai, Barsaman Pun was the finance minister while Krishna Bahadur Mahara was the finance minister during premiership of Dahal. Maoist leaders Matrika Prasad Yadav, Bina Magar, Shakti Bahadur Basnet, Giriraj Mani Pokharel and Ram Bahadur Thapa were part of Second Oli cabinet which took the MCC&#x27;s Nepal Compact to parliament. At the time, they had given approval to table the MCC compact.

Party president Prachanda publicly maintained that the Millennium Challenge Corporation&#x27;s Nepal Compact could not be ratified without amending certain clauses. It was found that he was in favor of ratification as it was. The MCC later released the letter dated September 29, 2021, in which Prachanda and Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Deuba assured MCC that the compact would be ratified within four to five months. Major national newspapers criticized Prachanda&#x27;s move, saying it would deteriorate Nepal&#x27;s diplomatic strength and virtue.

They reported that it was dual nature of the party to both stay in government and protest at the same time for personal profit and vote swing. This move was highly criticized by people and medias.

The party chairman had given approval to table MCC while several fellow politicians stood in opposition to the chairman&#x27;s decision. They called for protests even on streets. Many police were attacked. Trees were broken, the blocks of footpath were removed to attack police as shown in picture. The branches of trees were broken. The Maoist cadets destroyed a boutique while the owner was saving police. Government had to pay for the loss. Leader of opposition and chairman of Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist), KP Sharma Oli of condemned the decision of Maoists to stay in government while destroying public property at the same time. The Home Minister of Nepal, Bal Krishna Khan&#x27;s and Prime minister asked the protesters to stay calm and not destroy public properties casing loss to the government and economy.

== Splinter groups ==
=== Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha ===

In 2004, a small group split from the CPN (Maoist) to form Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha. This group has subsequently split up into more than five groups and said to have no specific ideological destiny. The group accused the CPN (Maoist) of not guaranteeing the autonomy of the Terai region. The name is in Nepalese which means &quot;Terai Peoples Liberation Front&quot; in English. The Jwala Singh faction of the Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha (JTMM-J) was formed by Nagendra Kumar Paswan a.k.a. Jwala Singh in August 2006 after he broke away from the Jaya Krishna Goit led JTMM. Jwala Singh is a former CPN-Maoist cadre and had joined Goit when he floated the JTMM. Later, he developed differences with Goit over the strategies to be adopted for the liberation of the Terai and establishment of an independent Terai state.

=== Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ===

In 2009, a faction under Matrika Yadav split from UCPN (Maoist) to reorganise the previous Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).

In June 2012 the party suffered a vertical split. The hardliner faction formed a new party named Communist Party of Nepal—Maoist, later called the Communist Party of Nepal (Revolutionary Maoist), headed by Mohan Baidya. The Communist Party of Nepal—Maoist further split to form another &quot;Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)&quot; in 2014, later renamed the Communist Party of Nepal, headed by Netra Bikram Chand, (known as &quot;Biplav Si&quot;).

<text>Cosmotheism is a term for several political or religious concepts.

One conception refers to the idea that the entire universe (&quot;kosmos&quot;) is God (theos). It is thus similar to pantheism and the idea of the anima mundi (world-soul). The term was coined by Lamoignon de Malesherbes (1721–1794) in 1782 to refer to the Stoic worship of the cosmos or mundus as a Supreme Being. Jan Assmann ascribed the doctrine to ancient Egyptian theology as well as various Greek philosophies. According to Assmann, &quot;Malesherbes could not have found a better term for what seems to be the common denominator of Egyptian religion, Alexandrinian (Neoplatonic, Stoic, Hermetic) philosophy, and Spinozism, including the medieval traditions such as alchemy and the cabala that have served as intermediaries.&quot; Assmann also sees cosmotheistic ideas in the German Romanticism of figures like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller.

The term is separately associated with William Luther Pierce, an American white nationalist political activist who founded the National Alliance. His cosmotheist ideology espoused that evolution was on an upward path to oneness with God; Pierce said that whites had a &quot;divine spark&quot; that set them on the best path for this.

<text>The 6th Division () is a former Norwegian military formation.

== History ==
The pinnacle of this division&#x27;s service was during World War II, during the German invasion of Norway. It was commanded by General Carl Gustav Fleischer, who was one of the King of Norway&#x27;s favourite military officers. His division was one of the few Norwegian military commands that was battle ready on 9 April 1940 when the Germans invaded. With help from British, French, and Polish forces, 6th Division were able to recapture the city of Narvik, during what became known as the Battle of Narvik.

The Germans took Narvik at the beginning of the battle, but it was retaken 28 May in what became known as the first major victory for the Allies in World War II. However, the successful German attack on France forced the Allied task force to evacuate, which they did in June. As a result of the withdrawal of allied air and naval support the Norwegians were forced to lay down their arms and demobilize.

In one of the most controversial episodes in history of Norway&#x27;s role in World War II General Fleischer ended his life in 1942, after being sent to Canada as the Norwegian military attaché, a role that was basically a demotion.

After the demobilisation, 6th Division was disbanded. However, when Norway was liberated in 1945, the division was immediately re-established. One long-term consequence of the action at Narvik was the close cooperation between the British military and Norwegian Army, along with close cooperation with France&#x27;s alpine forces. 

During the Cold War the division fought in no conflicts. But by the 1980s the division comprised the North Hammerfest and South Hammerfest land force areas, controlling the 15th and 14th mobilization brigades respectively; Brigade Nord in Tromso, 5,000 strong, with three infantry battalion, an armoured company, and an artillery battalion with four self-propelled artillery batteries; and the two northern garrisons in Finnmark: the Garrison of Porsanger and the Garrison of Sør-Varanger.

After the end of the Cold War the 6th was re-organized in 2002, as part of an overall reform of the Norwegian Armed Forces.

== Final organisation ==
In its peacetime organisation, 6th Division consisted of approximately 1,200 commissioned and non-commissioned officers (COs and NCOs), with approximately 3,000 enlisted soldiers and 200 civilian support staff. In wartime, its numbers could exceed 12,000 in total.

Being the only division in the Norwegian Army, the 6th utilised a wide range of modern combat equipment. Its heaviest weapons included Leopard 2A4NO MBTs, CV9030 IFVs and modernized M109A3GN howitzers. The infantry use Bv206 tracked all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and light off-road vehicles. Their airlifting capabilities were provided by the Tactical Helicopter Group of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, which is stationed at Bardufoss. The division&#x27;s motto is &quot;Styrke for fred, evne til strid&quot;, or &quot;Strength for peace, capability for war&quot;.

== Subsidiary units ==
*Brigade Nord - Mechanised infantry brigade including armoured and artillery battalions.
*6th Brigade - Light infantry reserve brigade.
*Army Ranger Command.
*Border Guard Battalion.
*Intelligence &amp; EW Battalion.
*Home Guard - Although technically a separate branch from the Army, all Home Guard districts are under the 6th Division mobile Command.

The 6th division also included a number of support functions such as engineering and NBC units. The 6th Division was disbanded on 1 August 2009.

<doc id="403707" wikidata="Q118736" url="?curid=403707" title="Independent University of Moscow">
<text>The Independent University of Moscow (IUM) () is an educational organisation with rather informal status located in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1991 by a group of Russian mathematicians that included Vladimir Arnold (chairman) and Sergei Novikov. The IUM consists of the departments of mathematics and theoretical physics and the post-graduate school. Anyone can attend lectures and seminars and become a student after passing three exams.. 

It is a non-governmental educational institution for the training of professional mathematicians, acting by a higher education institution type.

==Location==

The IUM is located in a building in central Moscow. The address is 11 Bol. Vlasievskii per., a small street near the Arbat and within walking distance of the Kremlin, the Bolshoi Theater, the Russian State Library, the Pushkin Museum, and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. In addition to lecture halls and classes, the IUM building has a library, a computer lab, a cafeteria, a small publishing house, and a book shop for math books. 

IUM is the home of the Math in Moscow study abroad program, a one-semester course in mathematics and computer science. Students from the United States and Canada are eligible for the program, and courses are taught in English by Russian mathematicians. The American Mathematical Society offers several scholarships each semester to help cover tuition.

== History ==
The Independent University of Moscow was founded in 1991 by a group of academics, professors and mathematics teaching enthusiasts (V.I. Arnold, S.P. Novikov, Y.G.Sinai, L.D. Faddeev, V.M. Tikhomirov, R.L . Dobrušin, and others). P. Deligne and R. MacPherson also played roles in the creation of the university, along with N.N. Konstantinov, the teacher and organizer of mathematical olympiads. Since 2000, Yulij Ilyashenko has served as the president of the IUM.

Since 2001, the IUM operates a program for foreign students called Math in Moscow. The American and Canadian Mathematical Societies award scholarships for those wishing for a year or a semester to study mathematics at the IUM. The IUM also operates an exchange program with the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris and fifth-year graduate students have the opportunity to IUM for a month to study at Ecole Normale, and French students at IUM. In 2002, it opened a joint French-Russian Laboratory (Laboratoire J.-V. Poncelet).

== Training ==
IUM is a structural subdivision of the Moscow Center for Continuous Mathematical Education. IUM offers a free 5-year course of study (student has the right to reduce or increase the actual period of study, based on your personal needs and interests), and (since 1993), post-graduate courses.

Education in the IUM is based on the following principles:
* There are no entrance exams.
* Any person can freely attend the classes.
* A non-resident student who successfully passes three exams, becomes a resident student of the university. A resident student must pass at least 3k - 3 courses to complete k-th semester.
* To graduate, the student must fulfill all the credits, both for the mandatory and elective courses, and defend a thesis.

Many mathematical organizations around the world recognize the university diploma, including, for example, Steklov Institute of Mathematics and Harvard University.

<doc id="403717" wikidata="Q858145" url="?curid=403717" title="Space Shuttle Challenger disaster">
<text>On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members aboard. The spacecraft disintegrated above the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 16:39:13UTC (11:39:13a.m. EST, local time at the launch site). It was the first fatal accident involving an American spacecraft while in flight.

The mission, designated STS-51-L, was the 10th flight for the orbiter and the 25th flight of the Space Shuttle fleet. The crew was scheduled to deploy a commercial communications satellite and study Halley&#x27;s Comet while they were in orbit, in addition to taking schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe into space under the Teacher in Space Project. The latter task resulted in a higher-than-usual media interest in and coverage of the mission; the launch and subsequent disaster were seen live in many schools across the United States.

The cause of the disaster was the failure of the primary and secondary O-ring seals in a joint in the right Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). The record-low temperatures on the morning of the launch had stiffened the rubber O-rings, reducing their ability to seal the joints. Shortly after liftoff, the seals were breached, and hot pressurized gas from within the SRB leaked through the joint and burned through the aft attachment strut connecting it to the external propellant tank (ET), then into the tank itself. The collapse of the ET&#x27;s internal structures and the rotation of the SRB that followed propelled the shuttle stack, traveling at a speed of Mach 1.92, into a direction that allowed aerodynamic forces to tear the orbiter apart. Both SRBs detached from the now-destroyed ET and continued to fly uncontrollably until the range safety officer destroyed them.

The crew compartment, containing human remains, and many other fragments from the shuttle were recovered from the ocean floor after a three-month search-and-recovery operation. The exact timing of the deaths of the crew is unknown, but several crew members are thought to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The orbiter had no escape system, and the impact of the crew compartment at terminal velocity with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable.

The disaster resulted in a 32-month hiatus in the Space Shuttle program. President Ronald Reagan created the Rogers Commission to investigate the accident. The commission criticized NASA&#x27;s organizational culture and decision-making processes that had contributed to the accident. Test data since 1977 demonstrated a potentially catastrophic flaw in the SRBs&#x27; O-rings, but neither NASA nor SRB manufacturer Morton Thiokol had addressed this known defect. NASA managers also disregarded engineers&#x27; warnings about the dangers of launching in cold temperatures and did not report these technical concerns to their superiors.

As a result of this disaster, NASA established the Office of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance, and arranged for deployment of commercial satellites from expendable launch vehicles rather than from a crewed orbiter. To replace &quot;Challenger&quot;, the construction of a new Space Shuttle orbiter, was approved in 1987, and the new orbiter first flew in 1992. Subsequent missions were launched with redesigned SRBs and their crews wore pressurized suits during ascent and reentry.

== Background ==
=== Space Shuttle ===
The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable spacecraft operated by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It flew for the first time in April 1981, and was used to conduct in-orbit research, and deploy commercial, military, and scientific payloads. At launch, it consisted of the orbiter, which contained the crew and payload, the external tank (ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs). The orbiter was a reusable, winged vehicle that launched vertically and landed as a glider. Five orbiters were built during the Space Shuttle program. &quot;Challenger&quot; (OV-099) was the second orbiter constructed after its conversion from a structural test article. The orbiter contained the crew compartment, where the crew predominantly lived and worked throughout a mission. Three Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were mounted at the aft end of the orbiter and provided thrust during launch. Once in space, the crew maneuvered using the two smaller, aft-mounted Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines.

When it launched, the orbiter was connected to the ET, which held the fuel for the SSMEs. The ET consisted of a larger tank for liquid hydrogen (LH2) and a smaller tank for liquid oxygen (LOX), both of which were required for the SSMEs to operate. After its fuel had been expended, the ET separated from the orbiter and reentered the atmosphere, where it would break apart during reentry and its pieces would land in the Indian or Pacific Ocean.

Two solid rocket boosters (SRBs), built by Morton Thiokol at the time of the disaster, provided the majority of thrust at liftoff. They were connected to the external tank, and burned for the first two minutes of flight. The SRBs separated from the orbiter once they had expended their fuel and fell into the Atlantic Ocean under a parachute. NASA retrieval teams recovered the SRBs and returned them to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where they were disassembled and their components were reused on future flights. Each SRB was constructed in four main sections at the factory in Utah and transported to KSC, then assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at KSC with three tang-and-clevis field joints, each joint consisting of a tang from the upper segment fitting into the clevis of the lower segment. Each field joint was sealed with two ~20 foot (6 meter) diameter Viton-rubber O-rings around the circumference of the SRB and had a cross-section diameter of . The O-rings were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant and allowed for the SRBs to be rated for crewed missions. The two O-rings were configured to create a double bore seal, and the gap between segments was filled with putty. When the motor was running, this configuration was designed to compress air in the gap against the upper O-ring, pressing it against the sealing surfaces of its seat. On the SRB Critical Items List, the O-rings were listed as Criticality 1R, which indicated that an O-ring failure could result in the destruction of the vehicle and loss of life, but it was considered a redundant system due to the secondary O-ring.

=== O-ring concerns ===

Evaluations of the proposed SRB design in the early 1970s and field joint testing showed that the wide tolerances between the mated parts allowed the O-rings to be extruded from their seats rather than compressed. This extrusion was judged to be acceptable by NASA and Morton Thiokol despite concerns of NASA&#x27;s engineers. A 1977 test showed that up to of joint rotation occurred during the simulated internal pressure of a launch. Joint rotation, which occurred when the tang and clevis bent away from each other, reduced the pressure on the O-rings, which weakened their seals and made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. NASA engineers suggested that the field joints should be redesigned to include shims around the O-rings, but they received no response. In 1980, the NASA Verification/Certification Committee requested further tests on joint integrity to include testing in the temperature range of and with only a single O-ring installed. The NASA program managers decided that their current level of testing was sufficient and further testing was not required. In December1982, the Critical Items List was updated to indicate that the secondary O-ring could not provide a backup to the primary O-ring, as it would not necessarily form a seal in the event of joint rotation. The O-rings were redesignated as Criticality1, removing the &quot;R&quot; to indicate it was no longer considered a redundant system.

The first occurrence of in-flight O-ring erosion occurred on the right SRB on in November1981. In August1984, a post-flight inspection of the left SRB on revealed that soot had blown past the primary O-ring and was found in between the O-rings. Although there was no damage to the secondary O-ring, this indicated that the primary O-ring was not creating a reliable seal and was allowing hot gas to pass. The amount of O-ring erosion was insufficient to prevent the O-ring from sealing, and investigators concluded that the soot between the O-rings resulted from non-uniform pressure at the time of ignition. The January1985 launch of was the coldest Space Shuttle launch to date. The air temperature was at the time of launch, and the calculated O-ring temperature was . Post-flight analysis revealed erosion in primary O-rings in both SRBs. Morton Thiokol engineers determined that the cold temperatures caused a loss of flexibility in the O-rings that decreased their ability to seal the field joints, which allowed hot gas and soot to flow past the primary O-ring. O-ring erosion occurred on all but one () of the Space Shuttle flights in 1985, and erosion of both the primary and secondary O-rings occurred on .

To correct the issues with O-ring erosion, engineers at Morton Thiokol, led by Allan McDonald and Roger Boisjoly, proposed a redesigned field joint that introduced a metal lip to limit movement in the joint. They also recommended adding a spacer to provide additional thermal protection and using an O-ring with a larger cross section. In July1985, Morton Thiokol ordered redesigned SRB casings, with the intention of using already-manufactured casings for the upcoming launches until the redesigned cases were available the following year.
=== Mission ===

The Space Shuttle mission, named , was the twenty-fifth Space Shuttle flight and the tenth flight of. The crew was announced on January27,1985, and was commanded by Dick Scobee. Michael Smith was assigned as the pilot, and the mission specialists were Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, and Ronald McNair. The two payload specialists were Gregory Jarvis, who was assigned to conduct research for the Hughes Aircraft Company, and Christa McAuliffe, who flew as part of the Teacher in Space Project.

The primary mission of the &quot;Challenger&quot; crew was to use an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) to deploy a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS), named TDRS-B, that would have been part of a constellation to enable constant communication with orbiting spacecraft. The crew also planned to study Halley&#x27;s Comet as it passed near the Sun, and deploy and retrieve a SPARTAN satellite.

The mission was originally scheduled for July1985, but was delayed to November and then to January1986. The mission was scheduled to launch on January22, but was delayed until January 28.

== Decision to launch ==
The air temperature on January 28 was predicted to be a record low for a Space Shuttle launch. The air temperature was forecast to drop to overnight before rising to at 6:00a.m. and at the scheduled launch time of 9:38a.m. Based upon O-ring erosion that had occurred in warmer launches, Morton Thiokol engineers were concerned over the effect the record-cold temperatures would have on the seal provided by the SRB O-rings for the launch. Cecil Houston, the manager of the KSC office of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, set up a three-way conference call with Morton Thiokol in Utah and the KSC in Florida on the evening of January 27 to discuss the safety of the launch. Morton Thiokol engineers expressed their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings. As the colder temperatures lowered the elasticity of the rubber O-rings, the engineers feared that the O-rings would not be extruded to form a seal at the time of launch. The engineers argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the O-rings would seal at temperatures colder than , the coldest launch of the Space Shuttle to date. During this discussion, Lawrence Mulloy, the NASA SRB project manager, said that he did not accept the analysis behind this decision, and demanded to know if Morton Thiokol expected him to wait until April for warmer temperatures. Morton Thiokol employees Robert Lund, the Vice President of Engineering, and Joe Kilminster, the Vice President of the Space Booster Programs, recommended against launching until the temperature was above .
When the teleconference prepared to hold a recess to allow for private discussion amongst Morton Thiokol management, Allan J. McDonald, Morton Thiokol&#x27;s Director of the Space Shuttle SRM Project who was sitting at the KSC end of the call, reminded his colleagues in Utah to examine the interaction between delays in the primary O-rings sealing relative to the ability of the secondary O-rings to provide redundant backup, believing this would add enough to the engineering analysis to get Mulloy to stop accusing the engineers of using inconclusive evidence to try and delay the launch. When the call resumed, Morton Thiokol leadership had changed their opinion and stated that the evidence presented on the failure of the O-rings was inconclusive and that there was a substantial margin in the event of a failure or erosion. They stated that their decision was to proceed with the launch. When McDonald told Mulloy that, as the onsite representative at KSC he would not sign off on the decision, Mulloy demanded that Morton Thiokol provide a signed recommendation to launch; Kilminster confirmed that he would sign it and fax it from Utah immediately, and the teleconference ended. Mulloy called Arnold Aldrich, the NASA Mission Management Team Leader, to discuss the launch decision and weather concerns, but did not mention the O-ring discussion; the two agreed to proceed with the launch.

An overnight measurement taken by the KSC Ice Team recorded the left SRB was and the right SRB was . These measurements were recorded for engineering data and not reported, because the temperature of the SRBs was not part of the Launch Commit Criteria. In addition to its effect on the O-rings, the cold temperatures caused ice to form on the fixed service structure. To keep pipes from freezing, water was slowly run from the system; it could not be entirely drained because of the upcoming launch. As a result, ice formed from down in the freezing temperatures. Engineers at Rockwell International, which manufactured the orbiter, were concerned that ice would be violently thrown during launch and could potentially damage the orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system or be aspirated into one of the engines. Rocco Petrone, the head of Rockwell&#x27;s space transportation division, and his team determined that the potential damage from ice made the mission unsafe to fly. Arnold Aldrich consulted with engineers at KSC and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) who advised him that ice did not threaten the safety of the orbiter, and he decided to proceed with the launch. The launch was delayed for an additional hour to allow more ice to melt. The ice team performed an inspection at T–20 minutes which indicated that the ice was melting, and &quot;Challenger&quot; was cleared to launch at 11:38 a.m. EST, with an air temperature of .

== Launch and failure ==
=== Liftoff and initial ascent ===

At T+0, &quot;Challenger&quot; launched from the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B (LC-39B) at 11:38:00a.m. Beginning at T+0.678 until T+3.375 seconds, nine puffs of dark gray smoke were recorded escaping from the right-hand SRB near the aft strut that attached the booster to the ET. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by joint rotation in the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB at ignition.

The cold temperature in the joint had prevented the O-rings from creating a seal. Rainfall from the preceding time on the launchpad had likely accumulated within the field joint, further compromising the sealing capability of the O-rings. As a result, hot gas was able to travel past the O-rings and erode them. Molten aluminum oxides from the burned propellant unintentionally resealed the joint and created a temporary barrier against further hot gas and flame escaping through the field joint. The Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were throttled down as scheduled for maximum dynamic pressure (max q). During its ascent, the Space Shuttle encountered wind shear conditions beginning at , but they were within design limits of the vehicle and were countered by the guidance system.

=== Plume ===

At , a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a plume near the aft attach strut on the right SRB, right before the vehicle passed through max q at . The high aerodynamic forces and wind shear likely broke the unintentional aluminum oxide seal that had replaced eroded O-rings, allowing the flame to burn through the joint. Within one second from when it was first recorded, the plume became well-defined, and the enlarging hole caused a drop in internal pressure in the right SRB. A leak had begun in the liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank of the ET at , as indicated by the changing shape of the plume.

The SSMEs pivoted to compensate for the booster burn-through, which was creating an unexpected thrust on the vehicle. The pressure in the external LH2 tank began to drop at indicating that the flame had burned from the SRB into the tank. The crew and flight controllers made no indication they were aware of the vehicle and flight anomalies. At , the CAPCOM, Richard O. Covey, told the crew, &quot;&quot;Challenger&quot;, go at throttle up,&quot; indicating that the SSMEs had throttled up to 104% thrust. In response to Covey, Scobee said, &quot;Roger, go at throttle up&quot;; this was the last communication from &quot;Challenger&quot; on the air-to-ground loop.

=== Vehicle breakup ===
At , the right SRB pulled away from the aft strut that attached it to the ET, causing lateral acceleration that was felt by the crew. At the same time, pressure in the LH2 tank began dropping. Pilot Mike Smith said &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; which was the last crew comment recorded. At , white vapor was seen flowing away from the ET, after which the aft dome of the LH2 tank fell off. The resulting release and ignition of all liquid hydrogen in the tank pushed the LH2 tank forward into the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank with a force equating to roughly , while the right SRB collided with the intertank structure.

These events resulted in an abrupt change to the shuttle stack&#x27;s attitude and direction, which was shrouded from view by the vaporized contents of the now-destroyed ET. As it traveled at Mach 1.92, &quot;Challenger&quot; took aerodynamic forces it was not designed to withstand and broke into several large pieces: a wing, the (still firing) main engines, the crew cabin and hypergolic fuel leaking from the ruptured reaction control system were among the parts identified exiting the vapor cloud. The disaster unfolded at an altitude of . Both SRBs survived the breakup of the shuttle stack and continued flying, now unguided by the attitude and trajectory control of their mothership, until their flight termination systems were activated at .

=== Post-breakup flight controller dialogue ===

At , there was a burst of static on the air-to-ground loop as the vehicle broke up, which was later attributed to ground-based radios searching for a signal from the destroyed spacecraft. NASA Public Affairs Officer Steve Nesbitt was initially unaware of the explosion and continued to read out flight information. At , after video of the explosion was seen in Mission Control, the Ground Control Officer reported &quot;negative contact (and) loss of downlink&quot; as they were no longer receiving transmissions from &quot;Challenger&quot;.
Nesbitt stated, &quot;Flight controllers here are looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction. We have no downlink.&quot; Soon afterwards, he said, &quot;We have a report from the Flight Dynamics Officer that the vehicle has exploded. The flight director confirms that. We are looking at checking with the recovery forces to see what can be done at this point.&quot;

In Mission Control, flight director Jay Greene ordered that contingency procedures be put into effect, which included locking the doors, shutting down telephone communications, and freezing computer terminals to collect data from them.
=== Cause and time of death ===

The crew cabin, which was made of reinforced aluminum, separated in one piece from the rest of the orbiter. It then traveled in a ballistic arc, reaching the apogee of approximately 25 seconds after the explosion. At the time of separation, the maximum acceleration is estimated to have been between 12 and 20 times that of gravity (g). Within two seconds it had dropped below 4g, and within ten seconds the cabin was in free fall. The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury to the crew.

At least some of the crew were alive and conscious after the breakup, as Personal Egress Air Packs (PEAPs) were activated for Smith and two unidentified crewmembers, but not for Scobee. The PEAPs were not intended for in-flight use, and the astronauts never trained with them for an in-flight emergency. The location of Smith&#x27;s activation switch, on the back side of his seat, indicated that either Resnik or Onizuka likely activated it for him. Investigators found their remaining unused air supply consistent with the expected consumption during the post-breakup trajectory.

While analyzing the wreckage, investigators discovered that several electrical system switches on Smith&#x27;s right-hand panel had been moved from their usual launch positions. The switches had lever locks on top of them that must be pulled out before the switch could be moved. Later tests established that neither the force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter.

On July 28, 1986, NASA&#x27;s Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut Richard H. Truly, released a report on the deaths of the crew from physician and Skylab 2 astronaut Joseph P. Kerwin:
Pressurization could have enabled consciousness for the entire fall until impact. The crew cabin hit the ocean surface at approximately two minutes and 45 seconds after breakup. The estimated deceleration was , far exceeding structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels. The mid-deck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, but stowed equipment showed damage consistent with decompression, and debris was embedded between the two forward windows that may have caused a loss of pressure. Impact damage to the crew cabin was severe enough that it could not be determined whether the crew cabin had previously been damaged enough to lose pressurization.

=== Prospect of crew escape ===

Unlike other spacecraft, the Space Shuttle did not allow for crew escape during powered flight. Launch escape systems had been considered during development, but NASA&#x27;s conclusion was that the Space Shuttle&#x27;s expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified SR-71 Blackbird ejection seats and full pressure suits were used for the two-person crews on the first four Space Shuttle orbital test flights, but they were disabled and later removed for the operational flights. Escape options for the operational flights were considered but not implemented due to their complexity, high cost, and heavy weight. After the disaster, a system was implemented to allow the crew to escape in gliding flight, but this system would not have been usable to escape an explosion during ascent.

== Recovery of debris and crew ==
Immediately after the disaster, the NASA Launch Recovery Director launched the two SRB recovery ships, MV &quot;Freedom Star&quot; and MV &quot;Liberty Star&quot;, to proceed to the impact area to recover debris, and requested the support of US military aircraft and ships. Owing to falling debris from the explosion, the RSO kept recovery forces from the impact area until 12:37p.m. The size of the recovery operations increased to 12 aircraft and 8 ships by 7:00p.m. Surface operations recovered debris from the orbiter and external tank. The surface recovery operations ended on February7.

On January31, the US Navy was tasked with submarine recovery operations. The search efforts prioritized the recovery of the right SRB, followed by the crew compartment, and then the remaining payload, orbiter pieces, and ET. The search for debris formally began on February8 with the rescue and salvage ship , and eventually grew to sixteen ships, of which three were managed by NASA, four by the US Navy, one by the US Air Force and eight by independent contractors. The surface ships used side-scan sonar to make the initial search for debris and covered at water depths between and . The sonar operations discovered 881 potential locations for debris, of which 187 pieces were later confirmed to be from the orbiter.
The debris from the SRBs was widely distributed due to the detonation of their linear shaped charges. The identification of SRB material was primarily conducted by crewed submarines and submersibles. The vehicles were dispatched to investigate potential debris located during the search phase. Surface ships lifted the SRB debris with the help of technical divers and underwater remotely operated vehicles to attach the necessary slings to raise the debris with cranes. The solid propellant in the SRBs posed a risk, as it became more volatile after being submerged. Recovered portions of the SRBs were kept wet during recovery, and their unused propellant was ignited once they were brought ashore. The failed joint on the right SRB was first located on sonar on March1. Subsequent dives to by the submarine on April5 and the SEA-LINK I submersible on April12 confirmed that it was the damaged field joint, and it was successfully recovered on April13. Of the of both SRB shells, was recovered, another was found but not recovered, and was never found.

On March 7, Air Force divers identified potential crew compartment debris, which was confirmed the next day by divers from the USS &quot;Preserver&quot;. The damage to the crew compartment indicated that it had remained largely intact during the initial explosion but was extensively damaged when it impacted the ocean. The remains of the crew were badly damaged from impact and submersion, and were not intact bodies. The USS &quot;Preserver&quot; made multiple trips to return debris and remains to port, and continued crew compartment recovery until April4. During the recovery of the remains of the crew, Jarvis&#x27;s body floated away and was not located until April15, several weeks after the other remains had been positively identified. Once remains were brought to port, pathologists from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology worked to identify the human remains, but could not determine the exact cause of death for any of them. Medical examiners in Brevard County disputed the legality of transferring human remains to US military officials to conduct autopsies, and refused to issue the death certificates; NASA officials ultimately released the death certificates of the crew members.

The IUS that would have been used to boost the orbit of the TDRS-B satellite was one of the first pieces of debris recovered. There was no indication that there had been premature ignition of the IUS, which had been one of the suspected causes for the disaster. Debris from the three SSMEs was recovered from February14 to28, and post-recovery analysis produced results consistent with functional engines suddenly losing their LH2 fuel supply. Deepwater recovery operations continued until April29, with smaller scale, shallow recovery operations continuing until August29. On December 17, 1996, two pieces of the orbiter were found at Cocoa Beach. On November 10, 2022, NASA announced that a piece of the shuttle had been found near the site of a destroyed World War II-era aircraft off the coast of Florida. The discovery was aired on the History Channel on November 22, 2022. Almost all recovered non-organic debris from &quot;Challenger&quot; is buried in Cape Canaveral Space Force Station missile silos at LC-31 and LC-32.

=== Funeral ceremonies ===
On April 29, 1986, the astronauts&#x27; remains were transferred on a C-141 Starlifter aircraft from Kennedy Space Center to the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. After the remains arrived at Dover Air Force Base, they were transferred to the families of the crew members. Scobee and Smith were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Onizuka was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. McNair was buried in Rest Lawn Memorial Park in Lake City, South Carolina, but his remains were later moved within the town to the Dr. Ronald E. McNair Memorial Park. Resnik was cremated and her ashes were scattered over the water. McAuliffe was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Jarvis was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean. Unidentified crew remains were buried at the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial in Arlington on May 20, 1986.

== Public response ==

=== White House response ===

President Ronald Reagan had been scheduled to give the 1986 State of the Union Address on January28,1986, the evening of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. After a discussion with his aides, Reagan postponed the State of the Union, and instead addressed the nation about the disaster from the Oval Office. On January31, Ronald and Nancy Reagan traveled to the Johnson Space Center to speak at a memorial service honoring the crew members. During the ceremony, an Air Force band sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; as NASA T-38 Talon jets flew directly over the scene in the traditional missing-man formation.

Soon after the disaster, US politicians expressed concern that White House officials, including Chief of Staff Donald Regan and Communications Director Pat Buchanan, had pressured NASA to launch &quot;Challenger&quot; before the scheduled January 28 State of the Union address, because Reagan had planned to mention the launch in his remarks. In March 1986, the White House released a copy of the original State of the Union speech. In that speech, Reagan had intended to mention an X-ray experiment launched on &quot;Challenger&quot; and designed by a guest he had invited to the address, but he did not further discuss the &quot;Challenger&quot; launch. In the rescheduled State of the Union address on February 4, Reagan mentioned the deceased &quot;Challenger&quot; crew members and modified his remarks about the X-ray experiment as &quot;launched and lost&quot;. In April1986, the White House released a report that concluded there had been no pressure from the White House for NASA to launch &quot;Challenger&quot; prior to the State of the Union.

=== Media coverage ===
Nationally televised live coverage of the launch and explosion was provided by CNN. To promote the Teacher in Space program with McAuliffe as a crewmember, NASA had arranged for many students in the US to view the launch live at school with their teachers. Other networks, such as CBS, soon cut in to their affiliate feeds to broadcast continuous coverage of the disaster and its aftermath. Press interest in the disaster increased in the following days; the number of reporters at KSC increased from 535 on the day of the launch to 1,467 reporters three days later. In the aftermath of the accident, NASA was criticized for not making key personnel available to the press. In the absence of information, the press published articles suggesting the external tank was the cause of the explosion. Until 2010, CNN&#x27;s live broadcast of the launch and disaster was the only known on-location video footage from within range of the launch site. Additional amateur and professional recordings have since become publicly available.

=== Engineering case study ===
The &quot;Challenger&quot; accident has been used as a case study for subjects such as engineering safety, the ethics of whistleblowing, communications and group decision-making, and the dangers of groupthink. Roger Boisjoly and Allan McDonald became speakers who advocated for responsible workplace decision making and engineering ethics. Information designer Edward Tufte has argued that the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident was the result of poor communications and overly complicated explanations on the part of engineers, and stated that showing the correlation of ambient air temperature and O-ring erosion amounts would have been sufficient to communicate the potential dangers of the cold-weather launch. Boisjoly contested this assertion and stated that the data presented by Tufte were not as simple or available as Tufte stated.

== Reports ==
=== Rogers Commission Report ===

The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; Accident, also known as the Rogers Commission after its chairman, was formed on February6. Its members were Chairman William P. Rogers, Vice Chairman Neil Armstrong, David Acheson, Eugene Covert, Richard Feynman, Robert Hotz, Donald Kutyna, Sally Ride, Robert Rummel, Joseph Sutter, Arthur Walker, Albert Wheelon, and Chuck Yeager.

The commission held hearings that discussed the NASA accident investigation, the Space Shuttle program, and the Morton Thiokol recommendation to launch despite O-ring safety issues. On February15, Rogers released a statement that established the commission&#x27;s changing role to investigate the accident independent of NASA due to concerns of the failures of the internal processes at NASA. The commission created four investigative panels to research the different aspects of the mission. The Accident Analysis Panel, chaired by Kutyna, used data from salvage operations and testing to determine the exact cause behind the accident. The Development and Production Panel, chaired by Sutter, investigated the hardware contractors and how they interacted with NASA. The Pre-Launch Activities Panel, chaired by Acheson, focused on the final assembly processes and pre-launch activities conducted at KSC. The Mission Planning and Operations Panel, chaired by Ride, investigated the planning that went into mission development, along with potential concerns over crew safety and pressure to adhere to a schedule. Over a period of four months, the commission interviewed over 160 individuals, held at least 35 investigative sessions, and involved more than 6,000 NASA employees, contractors, and support personnel. The commission published its report on June 6, 1986.
The commission determined that the cause of the accident was hot gas blowing past the O-rings in the field joint on the right SRB, and found no other potential causes for the disaster. It attributed the accident to a faulty design of the field joint that was unacceptably sensitive to changes in temperature, dynamic loading, and the character of its materials. The report was critical of NASA and Morton Thiokol, and emphasized that both organizations had overlooked evidence that indicated the potential danger with the SRB field joints. It noted that NASA accepted the risk of O-ring erosion without evaluating how it could potentially affect the safety of a mission. The commission concluded that the safety culture and management structure at NASA were insufficient to properly report, analyze, and prevent flight issues. It stated that the pressure to increase the rate of flights negatively affected the amount of training, quality control, and repair work that was available for each mission.

The commission published a series of recommendations to improve the safety of the Space Shuttle program. It proposed a redesign of the joints in the SRB that would prevent gas from blowing past the O-rings. It also recommended that the program&#x27;s management be restructured to keep project managers from being pressured to adhere to unsafe organizational deadlines, and should include astronauts to address crew safety concerns better. It proposed that an office for safety be established reporting directly to the NASA administrator to oversee all safety, reliability, and quality assurance functions in NASA programs. Additionally, the commission addressed issues with overall safety and maintenance for the orbiter, and it recommended the addition of the means for the crew to escape during controlled gliding flight.

During a televised hearing on February11, Feynman demonstrated the loss of rubber&#x27;s elasticity in cold temperatures using a glass of cold water and a piece of rubber, for which he received media attention. Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, advocated for harsher criticism towards NASA in the report and repeatedly disagreed with Rogers. He threatened to remove his name from the report unless it included his personal observations on reliability, which appeared as Appendix F. In the appendix, he lauded the engineering and software accomplishments in the program&#x27;s development, but he argued that multiple components, including the avionics and SSMEs in addition to the SRBs, were more dangerous and accident-prone than original NASA estimates had indicated.

=== US House Committee report ===
The US House Committee on Science and Technology conducted an investigation of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster and released a report on October29, 1986. The committee, which had authorized the funding for the Space Shuttle program, reviewed the findings of the Rogers Commission as part of its investigation. The committee agreed with the Rogers Commission that the failed SRB field joint was the cause of the accident, and that NASA and Morton Thiokol failed to act despite numerous warnings of the potential dangers of the SRB. The committee&#x27;s report further emphasized safety considerations of other components and recommended a risk management review for all critical systems.

== NASA response ==
=== SRB redesign ===
In response to the commission&#x27;s recommendation, NASA initiated a redesign of the SRB, later named the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM), which was supervised by an independent oversight group. The redesigned joint included a capture feature on the tang around the interior wall of the clevis to prevent joint rotation. The space between the capture feature and the clevis was sealed with another O-ring. The capture feature reduced the potential of joint rotation to 15% of that which had occurred during the disaster. Should joint rotation occur, any rotation that reduced the O-ring seal on one side of the clevis wall would increase it on the other side. Additionally, heaters were installed to maintain consistent, higher temperatures of the O-rings. The RSRM was first tested on August 30, 1987. In April and August 1988, the RSRM was tested with intentional flaws that allowed hot gas to penetrate the field joint. These tests permitted the engineers to evaluate whether the improved field joint prevented joint rotation. Following the successful tests, the RSRM was certified to fly on the Space Shuttle.

=== Space Shuttle modifications ===
In addition to the SRBs, NASA increased the safety standards on other Space Shuttle program components. The critical items lists and failure modes for the SSMEs were updated, along with 18 hardware changes. The maximum thrust of the SSMEs was limited to 104%, with 109% only allowed in an abort scenario. The landing gear was updated to improve its steering and handling abilities while the Space Shuttle was landing. NASA implemented an escape option in which the astronauts would jettison the side hatch and extend a pole out of the orbiter; they would slide down the pole to avoid hitting the orbiter as they bailed out before they activated their parachutes. The orbiter&#x27;s software was modified to maintain stable flight while all of the flight crew left the controls to escape. This escape method would not have saved the crew in the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, but was added in the event of another emergency.

=== Safety office ===
In 1986 NASA created a new Office of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance, headed by a NASA associate administrator who reported directly to the NASA administrator, as the commission had specified. Former &quot;Challenger&quot; flight director Greene became chief of the Safety Division of the directorate. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in 2003, the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) concluded that NASA had not set up a &quot;truly independent&quot; office for safety oversight. The CAIB concluded that the ineffective safety culture that had resulted in the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident was also responsible for the subsequent disaster.

=== Teacher in Space ===
The Teacher in Space program, which McAuliffe had been selected for, was canceled in 1990 as a result of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. In 1998, NASA replaced Teacher in Space with the Educator Astronaut Project, which differed in that it required the teachers to become professional astronauts trained as mission specialists, rather than short-term payload specialists who would return to their classrooms following their spaceflight. Barbara Morgan, who had been the backup teacher for McAuliffe, was selected to be part of NASA Astronaut Group 17 and flew on STS-118.

=== Return to flight ===

The projected launch schedule of 24 per year was criticized by the Rogers Commission as an unrealistic goal that created unnecessary pressure on NASA to launch missions. In August 1986, President Reagan approved the construction of an orbiter, which would later be named , to replace &quot;Challenger&quot;. Construction of &quot;Endeavour&quot; began in 1987 and was completed in 1990, and it first flew on STS-49 in May 1992. He also announced that the program would no longer carry commercial satellite payloads, and that these would be launched using commercial expendable launch vehicles. These commercial payloads were reallocated from the Space Shuttle program to end the dependence on a single launch vehicle and limit the pressure on NASA to launch crewed missions to satisfy its customers.

The Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for two years and eight months while the program underwent investigation, redesign, and restructuring. On September 29, 1988, &quot;Discovery&quot; launched on STS-26 mission from LC-39B with a crew of five veteran astronauts. Its payload was TDRS-3, which was a substitute for the satellite lost with &quot;Challenger&quot;. The launch tested the redesigned boosters, and the crew wore pressure suits during the ascent and reentry. The mission was a success, and the program resumed flying.

=== Second accident ===

On February 1, 2003, the program had its second accident when Columbia disintegrated during reentry during STS-107, killing all seven crew members on board. The cause was bipod foam from the external tank striking the orbiter&#x27;s left wing during launch. Once again, NASA&#x27;s organizational culture was heavily scrutinized. As with the O-ring erosion, NASA did not consider foam strikes to be a potential risk to the astronauts, despite multiple instances of foam strikes. In addition, scheduling issues had once again risen, as NASA was working on assembling the International Space Station. The CAIB concluded that NASA had failed to learn many lessons from the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, stating: &quot;NASA&#x27;s response to the Rogers Commission did not meet the Commission&#x27;s intent&quot; and &quot;the causes of the institutional failure responsible for &quot;Challenger&quot; have not been fixed.&quot; The Space Shuttle returned to flight in 2005 with STS-114.

== Legacy ==
In 2004, President George W. Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members killed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; accidents. An unpainted decorative oval in the Brumidi Corridors of the United States Capitol was finished with a portrait depicting the crew by Charles Schmidt in 1987. The scene was painted on canvas and then applied to the wall. The &quot;Forever Remembered&quot; exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex opened in July 2015 and includes a display of a section of &quot;Challenger&quot;″s recovered fuselage. The exhibit was opened by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden along with family members of the crew. A tree for each astronaut was planted in NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Memorial Grove at the Johnson Space Center, along with trees for each astronaut from the Apollo 1 and &quot;Columbia&quot; disasters.
Seven asteroids were named after the crew members: , , , , , , and . The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on March 26, 1986 (). In 1988, seven craters on the far side of the Moon, within the Apollo Basin, were named after the astronauts by the IAU. The Soviet Union named two craters on Venus after McAuliffe and Resnik. The landing site of the &quot;Opportunity&quot; Mars rover was named &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial Station.

Several memorials have been established in honor of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. The public Peers Park in Palo Alto, California, features the &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial Grove including redwood trees grown from seeds carried aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1985. Schools and streets have been renamed to include the names of the crew or &quot;Challenger&quot;. In 1990, a 1/10 scale replica of &quot;Challenger&quot; in liftoff position was erected in Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles, California. Challenger Point is a mountain peak of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, a science museum and planetarium in Concord, New Hampshire, is named in honor of McAuliffe, a Concord High School teacher, and Alan Shepard, who was from Derry, New Hampshire.
The crew&#x27;s families established the Challenger Center for Space Science Education as an educational non-profit organization.

An American flag, later named the &quot;Challenger&quot; flag, was carried aboard the &quot;Challenger&quot;. It was sponsored by Boy Scout Troop 514 of Monument, Colorado, and was recovered intact, still sealed in its plastic container. Onizuka had included a soccer ball with his personal effects that was recovered and later flown to the International Space Station aboard Soyuz Expedition 49 by American astronaut Shane Kimbrough. It is on display at Clear Lake High School in Houston, which was attended by Onizuka&#x27;s children.

The 1986 motion picture &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; was dedicated to the crew of the &quot;Challenger&quot; with an opening message which stated &quot;The cast and crew of &quot;Star Trek&quot; wish to dedicate this film to the men and women of the spaceship &quot;Challenger&quot; whose courageous spirit shall live to the 23rd century and beyond...&quot;

==In media==
=== Books ===

In the years immediately after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, several books were published describing the factors and causes of the accident and the subsequent investigation and changes. In 1987, Malcolm McConnell, a journalist and a witness of the disaster, published &quot;Challenger–A Major Malfunction: A True Story of Politics, Greed, and the Wrong Stuff&quot;. McConnell&#x27;s book was criticized for arguing for a conspiracy involving NASA Administrator Fletcher awarding the contract to Morton Thiokol because it was from his home state of Utah. The book &quot;Prescription for Disaster: From the Glory of Apollo to the Betrayal of the Shuttle&quot; by Joseph Trento was also published in 1987, arguing that the Space Shuttle program had been a flawed and politicized program from its inception. In 1988, Feynman&#x27;s memoir, &quot;&quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot;: Further Adventures of a Curious Character&quot;, was published. The latter half of the book discusses his involvement in the Rogers Commission and his relationship with Kutyna.

Books were published long after the disaster. In 1996, Diane Vaughan published &quot;The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA&quot;, which argues that NASA&#x27;s structure and mission, rather than just Space Shuttle program management, created a climate of risk acceptance that resulted in the disaster. Also in 1996, Claus Jensen published &quot;No Downlink: A Dramatic Narrative About the Challenger Accident and Our Time&quot; that primarily discusses the development of rocketry prior to the disaster, and was criticized for its reliance on secondary sources with little original research conducted for the book. In 2009, Allan McDonald published his memoir written with space historian James Hansen, &quot;Truth, Lies, and O-Rings: Inside the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster&quot;, which focuses on his personal involvement in the launch, disaster, investigation, and return to flight, and is critical of NASA and Morton Thiokol leadership for agreeing to launch &quot;Challenger&quot; despite engineers&#x27; warnings about the O-rings.

=== Film and television ===
The ABC television movie titled &quot;Challenger&quot; was broadcast on February 25, 1990. It stars Barry Bostwick as Scobee and Karen Allen as McAuliffe. The movie is critical of NASA and positively portrays the engineers who argued against launching. The movie was criticized by the widows of Smith, McNair, and Onizuka as an inaccurate portrayal of events. A BBC docudrama titled &quot;The Challenger Disaster&quot; was broadcast on March 18, 2013. It starred William Hurt as Feynman and portrayed the investigation into the causes of the disaster. A film directed by Nathan VonMinden, &quot;The Challenger Disaster&quot;, was released on January 25, 2019, depicts fictional characters participating in the decision process to launch.

The four-part docuseries &quot;&quot;, created by Steven Leckart and Glen Zipper, was released by Netflix on September 16, 2020. It uses interviews with NASA and Morton Thiokol personnel to argue against their flawed decision-making which produced a preventable disaster.

The first episode of the Australian television drama &quot;The Newsreader&quot;, broadcast on August 15, 2021, depicts the disaster from the perspective of the television industry, specifically the journalists and crew within, and of, an Australian television newsroom at the time; a co-lead character&#x27;s hosting of a newsflash weaving in with an overarching background storyline about the shift in news presentation from serious to that of allowing emotion into its delivery.

The first episode of Season 6 of the television drama series &quot;This Is Us&quot;, titled &quot;The Challenger&quot; features the incident of the explosion in 1986 in the flashback scenes.

<doc id="403720" wikidata="Q1454322" url="?curid=403720" title="Digraphs and trigraphs (programming)">
<text>In computer programming, digraphs and trigraphs are sequences of two and three characters, respectively, that appear in source code and, according to a programming language&#x27;s specification, should be treated as if they were single characters. 

Various reasons exist for using digraphs and trigraphs: keyboards may not have keys to cover the entire character set of the language, input of special characters may be difficult, text editors may reserve some characters for special use and so on. Trigraphs might also be used for some EBCDIC code pages that lack characters such as codice_1 and codice_2. 

== History ==
The basic character set of the C programming language is a subset of the ASCII character set that includes nine characters which lie outside the ISO 646 invariant character set. This can pose a problem for writing source code when the encoding (and possibly keyboard) being used does not support any of these nine characters. The ANSI C committee invented trigraphs as a way of entering source code using keyboards that support any version of the ISO 646 character set.

With the widespread adoption of ASCII and Unicode/UTF-8, trigraph use is limited today, and trigraph support has been removed from C as of C23. 

== Implementations ==
Trigraphs are not commonly encountered outside compiler test suites. Some compilers support an option to turn recognition of trigraphs off, or disable trigraphs by default and require an option to turn them on. Some can issue warnings when they encounter trigraphs in source files. Borland supplied a separate program, the trigraph preprocessor (codice_3), to be used only when trigraph processing is desired (the rationale was to maximise speed of compilation).

== Language support ==
Different systems define different sets of digraphs and trigraphs, as described below.

=== ALGOL ===
Early versions of ALGOL predated the standardized ASCII and EBCDIC character sets, and were typically implemented using a manufacturer-specific six-bit character code. A number of ALGOL operations either lacked codepoints in the available character set or were not supported by peripherals, leading to a number of substitutions including codice_4 for codice_5 (assignment) and codice_6 for codice_7 (greater than or equal).

=== Pascal ===
The Pascal programming language supports digraphs codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11 for codice_12, codice_13, codice_1 and codice_2 respectively. Unlike all other cases mentioned here, codice_10 and codice_11 were and still are in wide use. However, many compilers treat them as a different type of commenting block rather than as actual digraphs, that is, a comment started with codice_10 cannot be closed with codice_2 and vice versa.

=== J ===
The J programming language is a descendant of APL but uses the ASCII character set rather than APL symbols. Because the printable range of ASCII is smaller than APL&#x27;s specialized set of symbols, codice_20 (dot) and codice_21 (colon) characters are used to inflect ASCII symbols, effectively interpreting unigraphs, digraphs or rarely trigraphs as standalone &quot;symbols&quot;.

Unlike the use of digraphs and trigraphs in C and C++, there are no single-character equivalents to these in J.

=== C ===


The C preprocessor (used for C and with slight differences in C++; see below) replaces all occurrences of the nine trigraph sequences in this table by their single-character equivalents before any other processing (until C23).

A programmer may want to place two question marks together yet not have the compiler treat them as introducing a trigraph. The C grammar does not permit two consecutive codice_22 tokens, so the only places in a C file where two question marks in a row may be used are in multi-character constants, string literals, and comments. This is particularly a problem for the classic Mac OS, where the constant codice_23 may be used as a file type or creator. To safely place two consecutive question marks within a string literal, the programmer can use string concatenation codice_24 or an escape sequence codice_25.

codice_26 is not itself a trigraph sequence, but when followed by a character such as codice_27 it will be interpreted as codice_22 + codice_29, as in the example below which has 16 codice_22s before the codice_31.

The codice_32 trigraph can be used to introduce an escaped newline for line splicing; this must be taken into account for correct and efficient handling of trigraphs within the preprocessor. It can also cause surprises, particularly within comments. For example:

which is a single logical comment line (used in C++ and C99), and

which is a correctly formed block comment. The concept can be used to check for trigraphs as in the following C99 example, where only one return statement will be executed.

In 1994, a normative amendment to the C standard, C95, included in C99, supplied digraphs as more readable alternatives to five of the trigraphs.

Unlike trigraphs, digraphs are handled during tokenization, and any digraph must always represent a full token by itself, or compose the token codice_33 replacing the preprocessor concatenation token codice_34. If a digraph sequence occurs inside another token, for example a quoted string, or a character constant, it will not be replaced.

=== C++ ===
C++ (through C++14, see below) behaves like C, including the C99 additions.

As a note, codice_33 is treated as a single token, rather than two occurrences of codice_36.

In the sequence codice_37 if the subsequent character is neither codice_21 nor codice_39, the codice_40 is treated as a preprocessing token by itself and not as the first character of the alternative token codice_41. This is done so certain uses of templates are not broken by the substitution.

The C++ Standard makes this comment with regards to the term &quot;digraph&quot;:
Trigraphs were proposed for deprecation in C++0x, which was released as C++11. This was opposed by IBM, speaking on behalf of itself and other users of C++, and as a result trigraphs were retained in C++11. Trigraphs were then proposed again for removal (not only deprecation) in C++17. This passed a committee vote, and trigraphs (but not the additional tokens) are removed from C++17 despite the opposition from IBM. Existing code that uses trigraphs can be supported by translating from the source files (parsing trigraphs) to the basic source character set that does not include trigraphs.

=== RPL ===
Hewlett-Packard calculators supporting the RPL language and input method provide support for a large number of trigraphs (also called &quot;TIO codes&quot;) to reliably transcribe non-seven-bit ASCII characters of the calculators&#x27; extended character set on foreign platforms, and to ease keyboard input without using the application. The first character of all TIO codes is a codice_42, followed by two other ASCII characters vaguely resembling the glyph to be substituted. All other characters can be entered using the special codice_43 TIO code syntax with nnn being a three-digit decimal number (with leading zeros if necessary) of the corresponding code point (thereby formally representing a &quot;tetragraph&quot;).

== Application support ==
=== Vim ===
The Vim text editor supports digraphs for actual entry of text characters, following . The entry of digraphs is bound to by default. The list of all possible digraphs in Vim can be displayed by typing .

=== GNU Screen ===
GNU Screen has a digraph command, bound to by default.

=== Lotus ===
Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS uses as compose key to allow easier input of many special characters of the Lotus International Character Set (LICS) and Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set (LMBCS).

<doc id="403722" wikidata="Q2363645" url="?curid=403722" title="Music of Serbia">
<text>Music of Serbia represents the musical heritage of Serbia, both historical and modern. It has a variety of traditional music styles, which are part of the wider Balkan musical tradition, with its own distinctive sound and characteristics.

==Music of the Middle Ages==

Church music was performed throughout medieval Serbia by choirs or individual singers. The songs performed at the time were derived from the &quot;Octoechos&quot; (Osmoglasnik), a collection of religious songs dedicated to Jesus. Composers from this era include nun Jefimija, monks Kir Stefan the Serb, Isaiah the Serb, and Nikola the Serb, who together belong to the &quot;Serbo-Byzantine school&quot;.

Aside from church music, the medieval era in Serbia included traditional music, about which little is known, and court music. During the Nemanjić dynasty era musicians played an important role at the royal court, and were known as &quot;sviralnici&quot;, &quot;glumci&quot; and &quot;praskavnici&quot;. The rulers known for the musical patronage included Emperor Stefan Dušan and Despot Đurađ Branković. Medieval musical instruments included horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries, drums and cymbals. Traditional folk instruments include the gajde, kaval, dajre, diple, tamburitza, gusle, tapan (davul), šargija, ćemane (kemenche), zurla (zurna), and frula among others.

Sung Serbian epic poetry has been an integral part of Serbian and Balkan music for centuries. In the highlands of Serbia and Montenegro these long poems are typically accompanied on a one-string fiddle called the gusle, and concern themselves with themes from history and mythology. After the Ottoman conquest of Serbia, music was enriched with oriental influences at the expense of Serbian folk music. During Ottoman rule, Serbian faith and folk music went underground so to speak since the people were forbidden to own their property, to learn to write and read and were also denied the use of musical instruments. The Serbs however were stubbornly tenacious enough to maintain an oral history through folk poems and songs recited with the accompaniment of the Gusle. These brave defenders of Serbian art and culture in these arduous and treacherous times were the peasants who played the Gusle, a one-stringed instrument in the shape of a lute. As their punishment for playing a musical instrument, many of these musicians were blinded by their oppressors. Denied music or dance, the Serbs invented a silent kolo in which the syncopation of the pounding of the feet became an instantaneous musical accompaniment to the folk dancers. This particular dance is still being performed today. The German poet Goethe so admired Serbian poetry and folklore that he learned to speak Slavonic-Serbian, the common language then spoken by Slavs in the Balkans and northern regions of the Austrian Empire. Goethe and Grimm&#x27;s works were also the major inspiration in encouraging Brahms, Carl Loewe, Tor Aulin, Anton Dvorak, Leos Janacek, Josef Suk, Peter Tchaikovsky and Josef Maria Wolfram (1789–1839) to create compositions based on Serbian folk poetry and literature. Brahms&#x27; famous lullaby is derived from a Serbian folk poem. When the Jews fled Spain the Serbs provided a hospitable environment in which they could resettle and prosper, particularly in Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. The oldest Jewish Choir in the modern world is located in Belgrade. The formation of the Pančevo Church Choral Society in 1838 and the Belgrade Choral Society in 1853 resulted in each becoming centers for nurturing young talent. The first music schools were founded through the efforts of these choral societies.

From the Habsburg rule, Serbia was enriched by Western music.

==Classical music==
Composer and musicologist Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac is considered one of the most important founders of modern Serbian music. Born in 1856, Mokranjac taught music, collected Serbian traditional songs and did the first scholarly research on Serbian music. He was also the director of the first Serbian music school and one of the founders of the Union of Singing Societies. His most famous works are the &quot;Song Wreaths,&quot; also known as &quot;Garlands.&quot;

During the 19th and 20th centuries numerous bands, both military and civilian, contributed to the development of music culture in Belgrade and other Serbian cities and towns. Prior to Mokranjac&#x27;s era, Serbia&#x27;s representatives of the Romantic period were world-renowned violinist Dragomir Krančević, pianist Sidonija Ilić, pianist and composer Jovanka Stojković and opera singer Sofija Sedmakov who achieved success performing in opera houses of Germany in the 1890s. For example, the promenade concert tradition was first established by The Serbian Prince Band founded in 1831, and its first conductor was Joseph Shlezinger, who composed music for the band based on traditional Serbian songs. This was a period when the first choral societies, then mostly sung in German and Italian language, were being organized. Later, the first Serbian language works for choirs were written by Kornelije Stanković.

The Serbian composers Petar Konjović, Stevan Hristić and Miloje Milojević, all born in the 1880s, were the most eminent composers of their generation. They maintained the national expression and modernized romanticism in the direction of impressionism.

The best-known composers born around 1910 studied in Europe, mostly in Prague. Ljubica Marić, Stanojlo Rajičić, Milan Ristić took influence from Schoenberg, Hindemith and Haba, rejecting the &quot;conservative&quot; work of prior Serbian composers, seeing it as outdated and the wish for national expression was outside their interest.

Other famous classical Serbian composers include Isidor Bajić, Stanislav Binički and Josif Marinković.

Several notable composers used motifs from Serbian folk music and composed works inspired by Serbian history or culture, such as: Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, Arthur Rubinstein, Antonín Dvořák, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Franz Schubert, Hans Huber and others. In 1788, just before the start of the Habsburg–Ottoman War, a classical period composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed the &quot;La Bataille&quot; K. 535 (also known as “&quot;Die Belagerung Belgrads&quot;” – “The Siege of Belgrade”), which was most likely inspired by previous sieges of Belgrade, while some scholars state that the composition was used to support the war effort. Thanks to Miloš Obrenović&#x27;s good contacts during his stay in Vienna, Johann Strauss II composed the &quot;Serben-Quadrille&quot; intended for Serbian balls. During the Serbian–Turkish Wars, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed the &quot;Marche slave&quot;, which was based on several Serbian folk songs. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov used some Serbian folk tunes to compose the &quot;Fantasy on Serbian Themes&quot; (1867).

==Serbian folk music==
===Ethno music===

The ethno genre encompasses both vocal and non-vocal (instrumental) music. Instruments include bagpipes, flutes, horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries, drums and cymbals such as: Frula (woodwind), Diple (&quot;dvojanka&quot;, woodwind), Gajde (bagpipe), Zurna (woodwind), Duduk (woodwind), Tambura (lute), Tamburitza (lute), Gusle (lute), Kaval (&quot;šupeljka&quot;, lute), Davul (&quot;tapan&quot;, &quot;goč&quot;, drum), Bouzouki (&quot;šargija&quot;, lute), Tarambuke (drum). Balkanika, Balkanopolis, Dvig, Slobodan Trkulja, Belo Platno, Teodulija, Kulin Ban are known Serbian musical groups that use traditional Balkan musical instruments and perform traditional songs and songs based on traditional music elements.

===Old folk===
The Serbian folk music is both rural (izvorna muzika) and urban (starogradska muzika) and includes a two-beat dance called &quot;kolo&quot;, which is a circle dance with almost no movement above the waist, accompanied by instrumental music made most often with an accordion, but also with other instruments: frula (traditional kind of a recorder), tamburica, or accordion. The Kolos usually last for about 5–13 minutes. Modern accordionists include Mirko Kodić and Ljubiša Pavković. Some kolos are similar to the Hungarian csárdás in that they are slow at the onset and gradually increase their speed until reaching a climax towards the end.

Famous performers of Serbian folk music are Predrag Gojković Cune, Predrag Živković Tozovac, Miroslav Ilić, Lepa Lukić, Vasilija Radojčić, Šaban Bajramović, Staniša Stošić, Toma Zdravković and others. Yugoslav singer, actress and writer, Olivera Katarina, has performed music of various genres, varying from Serbian traditional to pop music, and in numerous languages. She held 72 consecutive concerts in Paris Olympia.

===New folk===
During the 70s Serbian folk music started to use elements from oriental music, distancing from the original sound, style that is titled &quot;novokomponovana muzika&quot; (&quot;newly composed music&quot;). Soon many &quot;neo-folk&quot; singers emerged: Šaban Šaulić, Jašar Ahmedovski, Mitar Mirić, Nada Topčagić, Šeki Turković, Ipče Ahmedovski, Ljuba Aličić, Zorica Brunclik, Marinko Rokvić and others. Serbian folk scene was not homogeneous nor uniform. On one hand, following Western models, Vesna Zmijanac was creating a star-image, being sex-symbol, and gay icon as well. On the other hand, singers like Vera Matović, for example, have created folk subgenre, sort of rural folk, singing about works in field, domestic animals and themes from Serbian village. Louis was combining Serbian folk music with jazz. Their albums were sponsored and songs were broadcast on the Radio Television of Serbia, which led to domination of this genre.

===Balkan brass===
Brass bands, known as &quot;trubači&quot; (, &quot;the trumpeters&quot;) are extremely popular, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass Band originated. The trumpet was initially used as a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles during First Serbian Uprising in the 19th century, but later took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying special occasions such as slavas, baptisms, harvests, births and funerals. In 1831 the first official military band was formed by Prince Miloš Obrenović. Roma people have also adopted the tradition and enhanced the music, and today most of the best performers are Roma. The best known Serbian Brass musicians are Fejat Sejdić, and Boban Marković and are also the biggest names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders. Guča trumpet festival is one of the most popular and biggest music festivals in Serbia is a five-day annual festival with 300 000 visitors.

==Popular music==
===Pop music===


Various sources suggest that pop music existed in Serbia before the Second World War, including the claims of French entertainer Josephine Baker, who stated that she encountered gramophone records of this style of music during her trip to Serbia. Pop music grew in popularity during the following decades, especially during the late 1950s and 1960s with performers of schlager, such as Lola Novaković, Đorđe Marjanović and Dušan Jakšić. Some of the best known songs from this era include &quot;Zvižduk u osam&quot; by Marjanović and &quot;Devojko mala&quot;, which was performed by actor Vlastimir Đuza Stojiljković in the popular movie &quot;Ljubav i moda&quot; (1960). Despite the fact that pop partially lost its popularity in Serbia to rock music during the 1970s and 1980s, it continued to stay relevant with disco-influenced artists such as Zdravko Čolić, who is recognized as one of the most prominent performers from the entire Yugoslavia. The 1980s also saw popularity of new wave music with acts like Zana and Bebi Dol. During the following decades however, pop music was significantly overshadowed by pop-folk. The 1990s pop was also marked by the influence of Europop with groups such as Tap 011 and K2.

Some of the best-known Serbian pop singers who have gained prominence in the 2000s are Vlado Georgiev, Marija Šerifović, Željko Joksimović, Aleksandra Radović, Tijana Dapčević, Jelena Tomašević, Nataša Bekvalac, Emina Jahović, Ana Nikolić and Saša Kovačević. Šerifović is also noted for winning the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest with &quot;Molitva&quot;, making her the only Serbian Eurovision winner.

Most prominent pop artists from the 2010s include: Sara Jo, Nikolija, Edita Aradinović, Teodora Džehverović, Anastasija Ražnatović, Elena Kitić, Angellina, Breskvica and Hurricane (Serbian band).

===Rock music===
As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was a part, was far more open to western influences compared to the other socialist states. The western-influenced pop and rock music was socially accepted, the Yugoslav rock scene was well developed and covered in the media, which included numerous magazines, radio and TV shows. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia due to civil war, its rock scene also ceased to exist, but saw moderate revival in the 2000s. The most notable Serbian rock acts are Bajaga i Instruktori, Đorđe Balašević, Disciplina Kičme, Ekatarina Velika, Električni Orgazam, Galija, Idoli, Kerber, Korni Grupa, Laboratorija Zvuka, Partibrejkers, Pekinška Patka, Piloti, Pop Mašina, Rambo Amadeus, Riblja Čorba, Smak, Šarlo Akrobata, YU Grupa, Van Gogh, and others.

===Popular folk music===
Popular folk music, or simply pop-folk, gained in popularity during the 1980s when elements of Serbian folk music were combined with rock and pop music, as well as with elements of folk music from other Balkan cultures. During this decade two of the arguably biggest performers were Lepa Brena, who has sold over 40 million records and is recognized as one of the greatest symbols of Yugoslavia, and Vesna Zmijanac, who was noted as the sex symbol and fashion icon of the 1980s. In the following decade, pop-folk only grew in popularity as a result of the regime of Slobodan Milošević, Yugoslav wars, inflation and political isolation. Because of it, pop-folk gained a bad reputation, becoming colloquially known as &quot;turbo-folk&quot;, a term that was coined by musician Rambo Amadeus because of the influence electronic dance music had on this crossover genre during the 1990s. It was during this period when some of the best known names in pop-folk music, and Serbian commercial music in general, emerged, including Dragana Mirković, Stoja, Dragan Kojic Keba, Ceca, Aca Lukas and Jelena Karleuša.

Even after the downfall of Milošević, pop-folk continued to stay popular. In the 2000s Serbian record label Grand Production gathered most of the country&#x27;s pop-folk performers, such as Indira Radić, Saša Matić, Seka Aleksić, Đani and Dara Bubamara. Their televised singing contest, called &quot;Zvezde Granda&quot;, also brought a new generation of singers, which includes Tanja Savić, Milica Todorović, Rada Manojlović, Milan Stanković, Milica Pavlović, Aleksandra Prijović and Tea Tairović.

===Jazz===

Jazz in Serbia appears in the 1920s when Markus Blam formed first jazz orchestra &quot;Studentski Micky Jazz&quot;. Jazz music was played mostly in salons and clubs, but it is also known that jazz orchestras toured in spas over Serbia. This style of music has been present on the radio as well as in specialized magazines. Radio Belgrade started to work in 1929, every night after 22:30h Radio Jazz Orchestra played popular songs. First jazz society in Serbia was set up in 1953, but to the development of jazz the most contributed hosting famous musicians, among whom was Louis Armstrong in 1959 and 1960. The first Serbian musicians to rise to international fame were Mladen Guteša who worked for famous musicians such as Lee Konitz, Benny Goodman and others and Duško Gojković. These two entered &quot;The 1956 Encyclopedia Yearbook of Jazz&quot; of Leonard Feather. Other prominent names of Serbian jazz include Bora Roković who composed jazz suite &quot;The Human Piano&quot;, Mihailo Živanović, Branislav Kovačev, Branko Pejaković, Milan Lulić, Boris Jojić, Jovan Miković and others. Among the most popular singers of jazz and blues in Serbia was Šaban Bajramović known as &quot;King of Romani music&quot;, who was included in the &quot;Time&quot; magazines list of top 10 blues singers in the world. Vladan Mijatovic (Jazz pianist) is the young ambassador of the Serbian Jazz music in North America.

===Hip-hop===
Serbian hip hop emerged in the early 80s among the b-boy crews. The first Serbian Hip Hop record release was the &quot;Degout EP&quot; by The Master Scratch Band, which was released by Jugoton in 1984. However, Serbian hip-hop scene wasn&#x27;t developed until the late 90s when hip-hop groups started to break out from the underground. Best known rappers and hip-hop collectives include Gru, Sunshine, Bad Copy, Beogradski sindikat and Marčelo. Artists such as Elitni Odredi, Rasta and Coby reached mainstream success by switching to more commercial sound and appealing to the wider audience. Some of the more prominent female performers include Mimi Mercedez and Sajsi MC. Bassivity and later Bassivity Digital have been the biggest regional hip-hop recording labels.

===Other===

<text>Anna University is a public state university located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The main campus is in Guindy. It was originally established on 4 September 1978 and is named after C. N. Annadurai, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

==History and structure==
Anna University (Chennai) comprises four colleges - the principal seat College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG, Guindy Campus), Alagappa College of Technology (ACT, Guindy Campus), Madras Institute of Technology (MIT, Chromepet Campus) and School of Architecture and Planning (SAP, Guindy Campus).

The first version of Anna University was formed in 1978 and various governments changed the varsity&#x27;s structure and affiliation scope repeatedly. In 2001, under the Anna University Amendment Act of 2001, the erstwhile Anna University became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions, and 426 self-financed colleges. On 1 February 2007, as a result of a Government of Tamil Nadu decision, the university was split into six constituent universities: Anna University, Chennai; Anna University of Technology, Chennai; Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli; Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore; Anna University of Technology Tirunelveli and Anna University of Technology, Madurai. The institutes were formally created in 2010. On 14 September 2011 during period of Ex CM Jayalalitha, a bill was passed to re-merge the universities. The merger was finalized in August 2012.

In 2011 and 2012 the constituents colleges were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional universities continue to function as a regional campus of the university.

==Admissions==
A common entrance test – the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE) – was used as a basis for admission to professional courses in the state until 2006. Starting in the academic year 2007–08, students were admitted to engineering colleges on the basis of their higher secondary marks. Post-graduate admission process is carried out through TANCET and GATE scores.

==Academics==
The university offers courses in engineering and technology through its affiliated colleges and follows a dual semester system. Every year the university conducts examinations for the even semester in May–June and for an odd semester in November–December.

=== Rankings ===
Internationally, Anna University was ranked under 1000 in the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; &amp; &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; in 2023.

In the 2024 National Institutional Ranking Framework, Anna University was ranked 20th overall and 13th among universities in India. Additionally, it secured the 14th position in the Engineering category and the 69th in the Management category.

== Controversies ==
On December 25, 2024, a second-year female engineering student at Anna University was sexually assaulted by two men inside the campus. The incident took place in the early hours of the morning after the survivor and her male friend returned from a Christmas mass at a nearby church. The two students were sitting in a secluded area of the campus when the assailants attacked the male student and then proceeded to sexually assault the woman. The survivor immediately filed a police complaint, and a case was registered under Section 64 of the BNSS (rape). The perpetrator was arrested and detained under the Tamil Nadu Goondas act and was lodged into Puzhal prison.

==Affiliated colleges==
The university&#x27;s campus is in Chennai. The university has satellite campuses in Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai and Tirunelveli. The university also runs engineering colleges at Villupuram, Tindivanam, Arani and Kanchipuram in Chennai region, Erode and Bargur in Coimbatore region, Panruti, Pattukkottai, Thirukkuvalai and Ariyalur in Tiruchirapalli region, Ramanathapuram and Dindigul in Madurai region, Nagercoil and Thoothukudi in Tirunelveli region.

&quot;Unicorn&quot;″s keel was laid down on 25 April 1945 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. The contract to build her was cancelled on 7 January 1946; however, it was reinstated on 26 February 1946 for &quot;completion of specific items,&quot; and she was launched on 1 August 1946 sponsored by Mrs. William A. Rowan, and accepted by the Navy on 3 September 1946.

Towed to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 15 September 1946, &quot;Unicorn&quot; was moved to New London, Connecticut, two months later and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London. She remained out of commission, in reserve, until 29 July 1958, when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap.

<text>The Wurundjeri people are an Aboriginal people of the Woiwurrung language group, in the Kulin nation. They are the traditional owners of the Yarra River Valley, covering much of the present location of Melbourne. They continue to live in this area and throughout Australia. They were called the Yarra tribe by early European colonists.

The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation was established in 1985 by Wurundjeri people.

==Ethnonym==
According to the early Australian ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, the name Wurundjeri, in his transcription &quot;Urunjeri&quot;, refers to a species of eucalypt, &quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot;, otherwise known as the manna or white gum, which is common along the Yarra River. Some modern reports of Wurundjeri traditional lore state that their ethnonym combines a word, &quot;wurun&quot;, meaning &quot;Manna gum&quot;/&quot;white gum tree&quot; and &quot;djeri&quot;, a species of grub found in the tree, and take the word therefore to mean &quot;Witchetty Grub People&quot;.

==Language==
Wurundjeri people speak Woiwurrung, a dialect of Kulin. Kulin is spoken by the five groups in the Kulin nation.

==Country==
In anthropologist Norman Tindale&#x27;s estimation – and his data, drawing on anthropologist R. H. Mathews&#x27;s data which has been challenged – Wurundjeri lands extend over approximately . These took in the areas of the Yarra and Saltwater rivers around Melbourne, and ran north as far as Mount Disappointment, northwest to Macedon, Woodend, and Lancefield. Their eastern borders went as far as Mount Baw Baw and Healesville. Their southern confines approached Mordialloc, Warragul, and Moe.

In June 2021, the boundaries between the land of two of the traditional owner groups in greater Melbourne, the Wurundjeri and Boonwurrung (Bunurong), were agreed between the two groups, after being drawn up by the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council. The new borderline runs across the city from west to east, with the CBD, Richmond and Hawthorn included in Wurundjeri land, and Albert Park, St Kilda and Caulfield on Boonwurrung land. It was agreed that Mount Cottrell, the site of a massacre in 1836 with at least 10 Wathaurong victims, would be jointly managed above the line. The two Registered Aboriginal Parties representing the two groups were the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation and the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation. However, these borders are still in dispute among several prominent figures and Wurundjeri territory has been claimed to spread much further west and south.

== Clans ==
The Wurundjeri &quot;balluk&quot; was composed of two patrilines who resided in two distinct localities. These were respectively the &quot;Wurundjeri-willam&quot; and the &quot;Baluk-willam&quot;, where &quot;willam&quot; means &quot;camping ground&quot;/dwelling.

The Wurundjeri Willum resided throughout the territory on the Yarra running along its sources as far as Mount Baw Baw and to the area where it forms a junction with the Maribyrnong River.

The Balluk-willam&#x27;s territory cover an area from Mt. Baw Baw: Their territory covers the area south from Mount Baw Baw to Dandenong, Cranbourne and the swampland at the head of Western Port bay.

==History==
As colonization began, it was estimated that something of the order of 11,500-15,000 Aborigines, composed of some 38 tribal groups, were living in the area of Victoria. The earliest European settlers came across a park-like landscape extending inland from Melbourne, consisting of large areas of grassy plains to the north and southwest, with little forest cover, something thought to be testimony of indigenous sheet burning practices to expose the massive number of yam daisies which proliferated in the area. These roots and various tuber lilies formed a major source of starch and carbohydrates. Seasonal changes in the weather, availability of foods and other factors would determine where campsites were located, many near the Birrarung and its tributaries.

The Wurundjeri and Gunung Willam Balug clans mined diorite at Mount William stone axe quarry which was a source of the highly valued greenstone hatchet heads, which were traded across a wide area as far as New South Wales and Adelaide. The mine provided a complex network of trading for economic and social exchange among the different Aboriginal nations in Victoria. The quarry had been in use for more than 1,500 years and covered 18 hectares including underground pits of several metres. In February 2008 the site was placed on the Australian National Heritage List for its cultural importance and archeological value.

Settlement and dispossession of the Wurundjeri lands began soon after a ceremony in which Wurundjeri leaders conducted a &quot;tanderrum&quot; ceremony, whose function was to allow outsiders temporary access to the resources of clan lands. John Batman and other whites interpreted this symbolic act, recorded in treaty form, as equivalent to medieval enfeoffment of all Woiwurrong territory. Within a few years settlement began around Pound Bend with Major Charles Newman at Mullum Mullum Creek in 1838, and James Anderson on Beal Yallock, now known as Anderson&#x27;s Creek a year later. Their measures to clear the area of Aboriginals was met with guerrilla skirmishing, led by Jaga Jaga, with the appropriation of cattle and the burning of fields. They were armed with rifles, and esteemed to be excellent marksmen, firing close to Anderson to drive him off as they helped themselves to his potato crop while en route to Yering in 1840. A trap set there by Captain Henry Gibson led to Jaga Jaga&#x27;s capture and a battle as the Wurundjeri fought unsuccessfully to secure his release. Resistance was broken, and settlements throve. One elder, Derrimut, later stated:
You see…all this mine. All along here Derrimut&#x27;s once. No matter now, me soon tumble down…Why me have no lubra? Why me have no piccaninny? You have all this place. No good have children, no good have lubra. Me tumble down and die very soon now.

===Coranderrk===

In 1863 the surviving members of the Wurundjeri tribe were given &quot;permissive occupancy&quot; of Coranderrk Station, near Healesville and forcibly resettled. Despite numerous petitions, letters, and delegations to the Colonial and Federal Government, the grant of this land in compensation for the country lost was refused. Coranderrk was closed in 1924 and its occupants bar five refusing to leave Country were again moved to Lake Tyers in Gippsland.

==Wurundjeri today==
All remaining Wurundjeri people are descendants of Bebejan, through his daughter Annie Borate (Boorat), and in turn, her son Robert Wandin (Wandoon). Bebejan was a Ngurungaeta of the Wurundjeri people and was present at John Batman&#x27;s &quot;treaty&quot; signing in 1835. Joy Murphy Wandin, a Wurundjeri elder, explains the importance of preserving Wurundjeri culture:

In the recent past, Wurundjeri culture was undermined by people being forbidden to &quot;talk culture&quot; and language. Another loss was the loss of children taken from families. Now, some knowledge of the past must be found and collected from documents. By finding and doing this, Wurundjeri will bring their past to the present and recreate a place of belonging. A &quot;keeping place&quot; should be to keep things for future generations of our people, not a showcase for all, not a resource to earn dollars. I work towards maintaining the Wurundjeri culture for Wurundjeri people into the future.

In 1985, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation was established to fulfil statutory roles under Commonwealth and Victorian legislation and to assist in raising awareness of Wurundjeri culture and history within the wider community.

Wurundjeri Elders often attend events with visitors present where they give the traditional welcome to country greeting in the Woiwurrung language:

which means, &quot;Welcome to the land of the Wurundjeri people&quot;.

<text>Jim Hall (James F. Hall) is a computer programmer and advocate of free software, best known for his work on FreeDOS. Hall began writing the free replacement for the MS-DOS operating system in 1994 when he was still a physics student at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. He remains active with FreeDOS, and is currently the coordinator for the project.

Hall has said he created FreeDOS in response to Microsoft announcing end of support for MS-DOS in 1994, a year before Windows 95 was released. As a user and fan of MS-DOS, Hall did not want the functionality of DOS to go away. Prompted by a March 31, 1994 post on comp.os.msdos.misc asking if &quot;anyone, for example GNU et al. ever considered writing a Public Domain DOS&quot;, Hall decided to garner support for a free version of DOS, written under a free or public domain model. In a June 29, 1994 post, Hall announced an effort to create a free DOS, called PD-DOS, writing:

Within a few weeks, other programmers including Pat Villani and Tim Norman joined the project. A kernel, the COMMAND.COM command line interpreter (shell) and core utilities were created by pooling code they had written or found available. Hall wrote over a dozen of the first DOS utilities for the project, mostly file and batch utilities. In a July 26, 1994 post, Hall announced the PD-DOS project had been renamed to &quot;Free-DOS&quot;, having updated the project&#x27;s goals to intend to distribute source code under the GNU General Public License. The project would later be renamed &quot;FreeDOS&quot;, without the hyphen, after the publication of &quot;FreeDOS Kernel&quot;, by Pat Villani. Hall was the project&#x27;s release coordinator from Beta1 until about Beta7, and also released the first alpha distribution of Free-DOS, as announced in a post on comp.os.msdos.misc. He is again the project coordinator since April 2011 after Pat Villani&#x27;s departure, and subsequent death in August of the same year.

Hall is also the original developer of GNU Robots, but he is no longer active on this project and has since handed maintainership over to Tim Northover. It is now being developed by Bradley Smith.

==Seizure of US-based assets==
DAB owned about US$7 billion in assets held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. After the 2021 Taliban seizure of power, a group of about 150 relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks attempted to use a judgement from the SDNY case &quot;Havlish v. Bin Laden&quot; to gain control of these assets, asserting that they were now legally the Taliban&#x27;s and thus could be used to pay damages to 9/11 victims&#x27; families. After a period of deliberation, the Biden administration went along with the request, dividing the assets into two halves, one of which would be allocated to the plaintiffs as potential damages, and the other which would be used to set up a trust fund to &quot;support the needs of the Afghan people&quot; but which the Taliban government would remain barred from accessing. On 26 August 2022, a judge recommended to not award damages as the bank is &quot;immune from jurisdiction&quot; and that it would &quot;acknowledge&quot; the Taliban as the legitimate Afghan government. On 21 February 2023, the request of the relatives was denied, with Judge George Daniels stating that he was &quot;constitutionally restrained&quot; from allowing access to the funds.

<doc id="403752" wikidata="Q363830" url="?curid=403752" title="Tempelhof">
<text>Tempelhof () is a locality of Berlin within the borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg. It is the location of the former Tempelhof Airport, one of the earliest commercial airports in the world. The former airport and surroundings are now a park called Tempelhofer Feld, making it the largest inner city open space in the world.

The Tempelhof locality is located in the south-central part of the city. Before Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform, the area of Tempelhof, together with the localities of Mariendorf, Marienfelde, and Lichtenrade, constituted a borough of its own, also called &quot;Tempelhof&quot;. These localities grew from historic villages on the Teltow plateau founded in the early 13th century in the course of the German Ostsiedlung.

==History==
&quot;Tempelhove&quot; was first mentioned in a 1247 deed issued at the Walkenried Abbey as a &quot;Komturhof&quot; (&quot;commander&#x27;s court&quot;, the smallest holding entity of a military order) of the Knights Templar, whose leadership and many fellow knights had been expelled from the Kingdom of Jerusalem upon its downfall in 1291. The heart of the old settlement, consisting of the church and the original estate, was fortified and originally completely surrounded by water. The Templars were joined by fifteen families of landless farmers&#x27; sons from the Rhine, who could not inherit any estate from their parents because of over-fragmentation of those estates. Legates of the Templars offered them fertile soil and the protection of &quot;Tempelhove&#x27;s&quot; stronghold.

After Pope Clement V officially abolished the Order of the Temple in 1312, the knights of Saint John (the &quot;Johanniter&quot;), backed by Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg, took over the villages of Tempelhof, Mariendorf, and Marienfelde. In 1435, they sold their estates to the city of Berlin.

In the early nineteenth century, Tempelhof was still a village outside Berlin proper and was the site of country excursions for the citizens of Berlin. The northern parts of Tempelhof were incorporated as Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Tempelhofer Vorstadt&quot; in 1861 and in 1920 became part of the Kreuzberg borough.

Today, the former commandery () is a chain of parks, called &quot;Bosepark&quot;, &quot;Kleiner Park&quot;, &quot;Alter Park&quot;, and &quot;Franckepark&quot;. Some of them still have ponds that were part of the artificial moat surrounding the village&#x27;s center. One, the &quot;Krummer Pfuhl&quot;, located in the &quot;Franckepark&quot;, after being turned into public swimming baths in the nineteenth century, has completely dried out and is now an enclosed deer park.

The original church, built from glacial boulders, was destroyed in the Second World War and was replaced with one built of ashlar or dressed stone with a timber-frame tower.

The Tempelhof Studios were established in 1912 and functioned as film and later television studios.

<doc id="403755" wikidata="Q886371" url="?curid=403755" title="Blunt (cigar)">
<text>A blunt is a cigar which is wider than a cigarillo and not quite as wide as a Corona, generally equivalent to a &quot;petit corona&quot; while &quot;short panatellas&quot; are sometimes classified as mini-blunts. These cigars typically consist of two main parts; the inner leaf, which is similar to a cigarette rolling paper, except it is made of thicker paper, and a thicker outer leaf which is rolled around the inner leaf in a spiral. In most commercially available blunts, the &quot;leaves&quot; are not actual tobacco leaves but rather paper made from tobacco pulp.
Blunts originally got their name from their &quot;broad or rounded tip&quot;, and were named as such in the 19th century to differentiate them from other cigars with a tapered, pointed tip. Blunts are a specific size cigar that have been so popular as to have been once sold in specific vending machines. The original blunt cigar was manufactured in Philadelphia out of a single leaf outer tobacco wrapper. At the time this was the only cigar wrapped in one continuous leaf, other cigars used pieces of leaves for their outer wrapper. Tobacco leaves naturally taper at the ends. Since this cigar was rolled in one leaf the end would taper and had a round appearance (thus leading to the Blunt name). Due to the popularity of this style of cigar many other Blunts were launched into the marketplace. Brands of blunts include: Phillies, Dutch Masters, Backwoods, White Owl, Altadis marketing &quot;Antonio Y Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;El Producto&quot;, and &quot;Tampa Nugget&quot; brands, Swedish Match marketing &quot;Game&quot; and &quot;Garcia Y Vega&quot; brands, and Swisher Sweets marketing &quot;King Edward&quot;, &quot;Optimo&quot;, and &quot;Pom Pom&quot; brands. These types of cigars are commonly sold in convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores, in contrast to premium cigars, which are sold in cigar shops. Blunts burn quickly like cigarettes, and some can be smoked in about five minutes, whereas a premium cigar takes an hour or so to burn. Unlike premium cigars, blunts are either already cut or have a hole in the mouth end for the smoke to go through, and so they do not need to be cut at the mouth end. Blunts are also significantly cheaper than premium cigars.

Over time the term Blunt came to describe any cigar wrapped in a single continuous leaf. However, in the 1970s a new manner of producing cigars was invented. This manner is known as spiral binding. No longer did cigars have to be rolled in a continuous single leaf but instead a continuous spiral wrap from base to tip could be employed. The basic shape of a blunt remained unchanged although the burn characteristics of a spiral wrapped cigar is not the same as a single continuous leaf. However, spiral wrapping is much less expensive than using a full single tobacco leaf. Spiral wrapping gives a better seal than a single continuous leaf as overlapping can be done (much like wrapping an arm in a bandage, spiral wrapping is easier to seal than a single continuous bandage).

Individually packaged blunt leaves have been available for many years. These are tobacco leaves that because of their nature and appearance are used to roll a cigar in one continuous sheet (thus the name blunt is used). The United States Tobacco Taxation Board has classified all individual cigar wrappers as &quot;blunts&quot; and taxes them as roll-your-own tobacco. Many US states classify blunt wraps as tobacco and a license is required to sell them and collect tax. Canada defines a blunt wrap as &quot;a sheet or tube made of tobacco used to roll cigarette tobacco in—similar to rolling paper&quot;. Use of these single continuous sheets is closer to the original blunts of the 19th century since it is not a spiral wrap.

<text>Gaston Barnabas Cashwell (April 28, 1862 or 1860 – 1916) was an early Holiness Pentecostal leader in the southern United States. He was born in Sampson County, North Carolina. His importance lies in bringing several denominations aligned with the Wesleyan-Holiness movement into the Pentecostal camp.

==Biography==
G. B. Cashwell first became a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and later joined the Holiness Church of North Carolina in 1903. In November 1906, he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission. In early December, he had an experience that he believed to be the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, on December 31, 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecostal experience in the local Holiness church. Interest in the Pentecostal experience was so great that he rented a local tobacco warehouse and began a month-long crusade. A revival broke out in North Carolina, especially in the holiness movement. Most of the ministers of the Pentecostal Holiness Church, the Fire-Baptized Holiness Church and the Holiness Free Will Baptist Churches were swept into Pentecostalism by this revival. Over the next six months, he toured the south preaching Pentecost. His zeal and influence in spreading Pentecostalism through the south has earned him the title of the &quot;Apostle of Pentecost to the South&quot;.

In the summer of 1907, Cashwell brought the message of Pentecost to evangelists H. G. Rodgers and M. M. Pinson, who carried the message to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. Later they would lead these churches into the Assemblies of God. Through Rodgers and Pinson, A. J. Tomlinson of the Church of God in Cleveland, Tennessee, heard of Cashwell&#x27;s message and invited him to Cleveland. On January 12, 1908, following a sermon by Cashwell, Tomlinson fell to the floor. He professed to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and speaking in at least ten different languages.

In October 1907, Cashwell started a publication in Atlanta, Georgia, called &quot;The Bridegroom&#x27;s Messenger&quot;. The periodical was created to spread the Pentecostal message over the country through a combination of sermons, articles, editorials, and testimonies. He edited it for seven months before turning it over to Elizabeth A. Sexton (who had been the Associate Editor since the second issue) and returned fully to his evangelistic efforts. The periodical was later taken over by Sexton&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law, Hattie and Paul Barth, who organized the International Pentecostal Assemblies (now International Pentecostal Church of Christ).

Although the influence of Cashwell was strong, his time of association with the Pentecostal movement was for a brief period of three years—from his conversion in 1906 until his departure from the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1909. In 1910 and afterward, his name no longer appeared in the roster of ministers belonging to the Pentecostal Holiness Church. Cashwell was instrumental in the development of the Pentecostal Free Will Baptists and was listed as a member of the Baptist church across the street from where he lived when he died.

Cashwell&#x27;s apostleship of Pentecostalism in the south influenced many denominations. About a dozen existing Pentecostal bodies can trace their Pentecostal heritage directly or at least in part to Gaston B. Cashwell, including:

*Assemblies of God USA
*Church of God (Cleveland)
*Church of God of Prophecy
*Congregational Holiness Church
*International Pentecostal Church of Christ
*International Pentecostal Holiness Church
*Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church

<doc id="403758" wikidata="Q3545649" url="?curid=403758" title="Decoy">
<text>A decoy (derived from the Dutch &quot;de&quot; &quot;kooi&quot;, literally &quot;the cage&quot; or possibly &quot;eenden kooi&quot;, &quot;duck cage&quot;) is usually a person, device, or event which resembles what an individual or a group might be looking for, but it is only meant to lure them. Decoys have been used for centuries most notably in game hunting, but also in wartime and in the committing or resolving of crimes.

== Hunting ==
In hunting wildfowl, the term decoy may refer to two distinct devices. One, the duck decoy (structure), is a long cone-shaped wickerwork tunnel installed on a small pond to catch wild ducks. After the ducks settled on the pond, a small, trained dog would herd the birds into the tunnel. The catch was formerly sent to market for food, but now these are used only by ornithologists to catch ducks to be ringed and released. The word &quot;decoy&quot;, also originally found in English as &quot;coy&quot;, derives from the Dutch &quot;de Kooi&quot; (the cage) and dates back to the early 17th century, when this type of duck trap was introduced to England from the Netherlands. As &quot;decoy&quot; came more commonly to signify a person or a device than a pond with a cage-trap, the latter acquired the retronym decoy pool.

The other form, a duck decoy (model), otherwise known as a &#x27;decoy duck&#x27;, &#x27;hunting decoy&#x27; or &#x27;wildfowl decoy&#x27;, is a life-size model of the creature. The hunter places a number about the hunting area as they will encourage wild birds to land nearby, hopefully within the range of the concealed hunter. Originally carved from wood, they are now typically made from plastic.

Wildfowl decoys (primarily ducks, geese, shorebirds, and crows, but including some other species) are considered a form of folk art. Collecting decoys has become a significant hobby both for folk art collectors and hunters. The world record was set in September 2007 when a pintail drake and Canada goose, both by A. Elmer Crowell, sold for 1.13 million dollars apiece.

==Military decoy==
The decoy in war is a low-cost device intended to represent a real item of military equipment.

They may be used in different ways:
* deployed in amongst their real counterparts, to divert part of the enemy fire away from the real items of equipment.
* for military deception, fooling the enemy into believing forces in a particular area are much stronger than they really are. One notable example are Quaker Guns.
* to produce a multitude of false signals to overwhelm a radar or sonar defence system, such as flares for IR-guided missiles or chaff for ICBMs.

===Bomb decoy===
In irregular warfare, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are commonly used as roadside bombs to target military patrols. Some guerrillas also use imitation IEDs to intimidate civilians, to waste bomb disposal resources, or to set up an ambush. Some terrorist groups use fake bombs during a hostage siege, in order to limit hostage rescue efforts.

=== Sonar decoy ===

A sonar decoy is a device designed to create a misleading reading on sonar, such as the appearance of a false target.

==In biochemistry==
In biochemistry, there are decoy receptors, decoy substrates and decoy RNA. In addition, digital decoys are used in protein folding simulations.

===Decoy receptor=== 
Decoy receptors, or sink receptors, are receptors that bind a ligand, inhibiting it from binding to its normal receptor. For instance, the receptor VEGFR-1 can prevent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from binding to the VEGFR-2 The TNF inhibitor etanercept exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by being a decoy receptor that binds to TNF.

===Decoy substrate=== 
A &quot;decoy substrate&quot; or &quot;pseudosubstrate&quot; is a protein that has similar structure to the substrate of an enzyme, in order to make the enzyme bind to the pseudosubstrate rather than to the real substrate, thus blocking the activity of the enzyme. These proteins are therefore enzyme inhibitors.

Examples include K3L produced by vaccinia virus, which prevents the immune system from phosphorylating the substrate eIF-2 by having a similar structure to eIF-2. Thus, the vaccinia virus avoids the immune system.

===Digital decoys===
In protein folding simulations, a decoy is a computer-generated protein structure which is designed so to &quot;compete&quot; with the real structure of the protein. Decoys are used to test the validity of a protein model; the model is considered correct only if it is able to identify the native state configuration of the protein among the decoys.

Decoys are generally used to overcome a main problem in protein folding simulations: the size of the conformational space. For very detailed protein models, it can be practically impossible to explore all the possible configurations to find the native state.
To deal with this problem, one can make use of decoys. The idea behind this is that it is unnecessary to search blindly through all possible conformations for the native conformation; the search can be limited to a relevant sub-set of structures. To start with, all non-compact configurations can be excluded.
A typical decoy set will include globular conformations of various shapes, some having no secondary structures, some having helices and sheets in different proportions.
The computer model being tested will be used to calculate the free energy of the protein in the decoy configurations. The minimum requirement for the model to be correct is that it identifies the native state as the minimum free energy state (see Anfinsen&#x27;s dogma).

<doc id="403761" wikidata="Q503875" url="?curid=403761" title="Joscelin III">
<text>Joscelin III (c. 1139 – after 1190) was the titular count of Edessa, who during his lifetime managed to amass enough land to establish a lordship in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

==Early life==
Joscelin III was the son of Joscelin II and Beatrice of Saone. He inherited the claim to the County of Edessa from his father, Joscelin II. The county had been captured in 1144 and its remnants (including the Lordship of Turbessel) conquered or sold years earlier.

Joscelin lived in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and managed to gather enough land around Acre to set up his own lordship.

==Royal Guardian==
His sister, Agnes, had been the first wife of King Amalric before he succeeded to the throne, and was the mother of Baldwin IV and Sibylla. In 1164 Joscelin was taken captive by Nur ad-Din Zengi at the Battle of Harim. He remained a prisoner until 1176 when Agnes paid his ransom of 50,000 dinars, probably with support from the royal treasury. His nephew Baldwin then made him seneschal of Jerusalem. He faced some rivalry from the king&#x27;s paternal kindred, led by Raymond III, Count of Tripoli.

In 1180 Joscelin went as an ambassador to the Byzantine Empire. After the betrothal of Baldwin&#x27;s half-sister Isabella to Humphrey IV of Toron that year, the Toron estates passed to the crown in exchange for a money fief. Baldwin IV granted part of them, Chastel Neuf, to Joscelin, and awarded Agnes an income from the usufruct, or produce, of Toron. Agnes died in late 1184, a few months before her son.

In 1185, Joscelin became guardian of his young great-nephew, Baldwin V, while Raymond III was regent. Raymond feared that, if he were the child&#x27;s personal guardian, he would be blamed if he died in his care, because he had a claim to the throne himself. Joscelin, as the king&#x27;s maternal grandmother&#x27;s brother, had no claim, but rather had strong family interests in keeping him alive. Additional support came with the arrival of Baldwin&#x27;s paternal grandfather, William V of Montferrat, from Italy. However, Baldwin seems to have been sickly, and died at Acre in 1186. Joscelin and William escorted his coffin to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Raymond went to Nablus to attempt a coup with Balian of Ibelin to install Isabella as queen. This failed, and Sibylla was crowned, also crowning her second husband, Guy of Lusignan.

In 1186, Guy and Sibylla granted Chastel Neuf and Toron, with other territory, to Joscelin. He, in turn, gave them as the dowry of his elder daughter, Beatrice, whom he betrothed to Guy&#x27;s younger brother, William of Valence. Her younger sister, Agnes, was to marry one of Guy&#x27;s nephews, but if Beatrice died while still a minor, William was to marry Agnes instead.

At the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Joscelin commanded the rearguard with Balian of Ibelin. Both escaped the disastrous defeat and fled to Tyre. All his estates were captured by Saladin. Joscelin joined in the siege of Acre in the Third Crusade. He last witnessed a charter on 25 October 1190, after Sibylla&#x27;s death. There is a strong likelihood that he died during the siege. A month later, Isabella, who was now claiming the crown from Guy, restored Humphrey of Toron&#x27;s claim to Chastel Neuf and Toron (should they be reconquered) when she accepted the annulment of their marriage. If Joscelin was still alive, he made no recorded objection. However, this seems to have ended the prospect of his daughters&#x27; Lusignan marriages. He was definitely dead by October 1200.

Joscelin&#x27;s &quot;seigneurie&quot; was acquired by the Teutonic Knights, in 1220.

==Marriage and children==
After his release from captivity in 1176, Joscelin married Agnes of Milly, (de) third daughter of Henry &quot;the Buffalo&quot; of Milly, (de) Lord of Petra, (and a sister of Stephanie of Milly and Helvis de Milly (fr)); by whom he had two daughters:
# Beatrix de Courtenay (d. aft. 1245), betrothed to William of Valence, brother of Guy of Lusignan, in 1186, but married Otto von Botenlauben
# Agnes de Courtenay, betrothed to a nephew of Guy of Lusignan in 1186, but married, by 1200, William of Amandolea, a Norman from Calabria, who became Lord of Scandeleon

<doc id="403766" wikidata="Q1341170" url="?curid=403766" title="Trigraph (orthography)">
<text>A trigraph () is a group of three characters used to represent a single sound or a combination of sounds that does not correspond to the written letters combined.

==Latin-script trigraphs==

For example, in the word &quot;schilling&quot;, the trigraph &quot;sch&quot; represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative , rather than the consonant cluster . In the word &quot;beautiful,&quot; the sequence &quot;eau&quot; is pronounced , and in the French word &quot;château&quot; it is pronounced . It is sometimes difficult to determine whether a sequence of letters in English is a trigraph, because of the complicating role of silent letters. There are however a few productive trigraphs in English such as &quot;tch&quot; as in &quot;watch,&quot; and &quot;igh&quot; as in &quot;high.&quot;

The trigraph &quot;sch&quot; in German is equivalent to the English &quot;sh&quot; and pronounced . In Dutch, which is closely related to German, this same trigraph is pronounced . In Italian, however, &quot;sch&quot; represents the sounds before &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, as in &quot;bruschetta&quot; . In none of these languages is this trigraph regarded as an independent letter of the alphabet. In Hungarian, the trigraph &quot;dzs&quot; is treated as a distinct letter, with its own place in the alphabet, and it is pronounced like the English &quot;j&quot; . The combination &quot;gli&quot; in Italian can also be a trigraph, representing the palatal lateral approximant before vowels other than &quot;i&quot;, as in &quot;aglio&quot;, pronounced .

==Trigraphs in non-Latin scripts==
Although trigraphs are not uncommon in Latin-script alphabets, they are rare elsewhere. There are several in Cyrillic alphabets, which for example uses five trigraphs and a tetragraph in the Kabardian alphabet: &quot;гъу&quot; , &quot;кӏу&quot; , &quot;къу&quot; , &quot;кхъ&quot; , and &quot;хъу&quot; , and also a tetragraph &quot;кхъу&quot; . While most of these can be thought of as consonant + , the letters in &quot;кхъ&quot; cannot be so separated: the &quot;х&quot; has the negative meaning that &quot;кхъ&quot; is not ejective, as &quot;къ&quot; is . (See List of Cyrillic digraphs.)

Tsakonian has &quot;τσχ&quot; .

The orthography used for the Yiddish language by YIVO uses the Hebrew script trigraph דזש (&quot;dalet, zayin, shin&quot;) to refer to .

Hangul has a few vowel trigraphs, ㅙ and ㅞ (from &quot;oai&quot; and &quot;uei&quot;), which are not entirely predictable. However, as ㅐ and ㅔ are considered as single letters in modern Korean, ㅙ and ㅞ are considered as digraphs now.
There is also a single obsolete consonant trigraph, ㅹ, a theoretical form not actually found in any texts. It is composed of digraph ㅃ and a circle-shaped single letter ㅇ, which means the letter &quot;to lighten&quot; sounds, linguistically to change stop consonants to the fricative consonants in cases of bilabial consonants (for ᄛ, ㅇ changes alveolar tap to alveolar lateral approximant or retroflex lateral approximant). Because these letters are created to transcribe consonants of Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca), these are disappeared soon. In modern days, ㅃ is used for different sound, [pʰ].

Japanese kana use trigraphs for &quot;(C)yō&quot; sequences, as in きょう &quot;kyou&quot; (&quot;today&quot;); the う is only pronounced after another .

In Inuktitut syllabics, the digraph ᖕ &quot;ng&quot; cannot be followed by a vowel. For that, it must form a trigraph with &quot;g&quot;:
:ᙰ &quot;ŋai&quot;, ᖏ &quot;ŋi&quot;, ᖑ &quot;ŋu&quot;, ᖓ &quot;ŋa&quot;.
It also forms a trigraph with &quot;n&quot; for &quot;ŋŋ&quot;: ᖖ.

==Discontinuous (split) trigraphs==
The sequence of letters making up a phoneme are not always adjacent. This is the case with English silent e, which has been claimed to modify preceding digraphs as well as preceding single vowel letters. For example, the sequence &quot;ou...e&quot; has the sound in English &quot;joule.&quot; There are twenty-eight combinations in English, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , though it has been argued that a trigraph analysis is unnecessary.

The Indic alphabets are distinctive for their discontinuous vowels, such as Thai แ...ะ , เ...าะ , เ...อะ . Technically, however, these may be considered diacritics, not full letters; whether they are trigraphs is thus a matter of definition, though they can in turn take modifying vowel diacritics, as in เ◌ียะ and เ◌ือะ .
