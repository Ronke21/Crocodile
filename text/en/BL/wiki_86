<doc id="408754" wikidata="Q307182" url="?curid=408754" title="Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi">
<text>Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi (; 23 October 1947 – 17 April 2004) was a Palestinian political leader and co-founder of Hamas, along with Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 1987. He also served as the chairman of the Hamas Shura Council from March 2004 until his assassination in April 2004 and the first deputy chairman of the Hamas Shura Council from December 1987 until March 2004.

Rantisi was born in Yibna, Mandatory Palestine in 1947. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, his family fled or were expelled by Zionist militias to the Gaza Strip. In 1956, when he was nine, Israeli soldiers killed his uncle in front of him in Khan Younis, which he stated had a lifelong impact on him. He studied pediatric medicine and genetics at Alexandria University in Egypt, graduating first in his class; during that time he became a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1976, he returned to Gaza to teach parasitology and genetics at the Islamic University of Gaza.

During the First Intifada against the Israeli occupation in 1988, he became a popular organizer and a leader whose efforts helped the formation of Hamas. Rantisi became Hamas&#x27;s political leader and spokesman in the Gaza Strip following the Israeli killing of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in March 2004. Rantisi opposed compromise with Israel and called for the creation of a Palestinian state (including the whole of the State of Israel) through military action against Israel.

On 17 April 2004, the Israeli Air Force assassinated al-Rantisi by firing Hellfire missiles from an AH-64 Apache helicopter at his car.

==Early life and education==
Rantisi was born in Yibna, near Ramle in Mandatory Palestine on 23 October 1947. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, his family fled or were expelled by Zionist militias to the Gaza Strip. In 1956, when he was eight or nine, he witnessed the Khan Yunis massacre, in which Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. During the massacre, al-Rantisi recalled that Israeli soldiers killed his uncle in front of him — as he explained to Joe Sacco, this fact was very important for his future life. He studied pediatric medicine and genetics at Egypt&#x27;s, Alexandria University, graduating first in his class. He was a certified physician. During his time in Egypt, he became a deeply convicted member of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1976, Rantisi returned to Gaza to teach parasitology and genetics at the Islamic University.

==History with Hamas==
In 1987, four Palestinian civilians of the Jabalya refugee camp were killed in a traffic accident that involved Israeli settlers and soldiers. Rantisi joined Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Salah Shehadeh, among others, encouraging people to protest the occupation, after mosque services. This was the start of the First Intifada, which lasted five years. Rantisi became a popular organizer and leader whose efforts helped the formation of Hamas.

In December 1992, Rantissi was deported to southern Lebanon, as part of the expulsion of 416 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives, and emerged as the general spokesman of the expellees.

On 8 June 2003, he directed a Hamas-led attack in which four Israeli soldiers were killed at the Erez Crossing in the Gaza Strip. On 10 June 2003, Rantisi survived an Israeli helicopter attack on a car in which he was traveling. He was lightly wounded in the attack, which killed one of his bodyguards, a civilian, and wounded at least 25 others. Rantisi also reportedly threatened, while in his bed in Al-Shifa Hospital, &quot;not a single Jew in Palestine is safe&quot; and &quot;kill Israeli political leaders, because all of them are killers&quot;.

On 23 March 2004, Rantisi was named leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, following the killing of Ahmed Yassin by Israeli forces. On 27 March 2004, Rantisi addressed 5,000 supporters in Gaza. He declared the then-US President George W. Bush to be an &quot;enemy of Muslims&quot; and asserted that &quot;America declared war against God. Sharon declared war against God and God declared war against America, Bush and Sharon. The war of God continues against them and I can see the victory coming up from the land of Palestine by the hand of Hamas.&quot;

==Assassination==
On 17 April 2004, Rantisi was assassinated by the Israeli Air Force, when they fired Hellfire missiles from an AH-64 Apache helicopter at his car. Two others, a bodyguard (named Akram Nassar), and Rantisi&#x27;s 27-year-old son Mohammed, were also killed in the attack, and four bystanders wounded. Israeli army radio stated that this was the first opportunity to target Rantisi, without significant collateral damage, since he took the leadership of Hamas, alleging that he had surrounded himself with human shields since the killing of Yassin.

===Reactions===
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Jonathan Peled stated:
: &quot;Israel...today struck a mastermind of terrorism, with blood on his hands. As long as the Palestinian Authority does not lift a finger and fight terrorism, Israel will continue to have to do so itself.&quot;

British Foreign Minister Jack Straw condemned the action:
: &quot;The British government has made it repeatedly clear that so-called &#x27;targeted assassinations&#x27; of this kind are unlawful, unjustified and counter-productive.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rantisi was married to Jamila Abdallah Taha al-Shanti, who was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006, and who was herself assassinated in 2023; they had six children.

== Legacy ==

The Al-Rantisi Pediatric Hospital, in Gaza City, is named after him. It provided treatment for cancer and kidney failure.

<doc id="408760" wikidata="Q1261878" url="?curid=408760" title="Samburu people">
<text>The Samburu are a Nilotic people of north-central Kenya. Traditionally, they are semi-nomadic pastoralists who primarily herd cattle but also keep sheep, goats and camels. They refer to themselves as Lokop or Loikop, a term with varied interpretations among the Samburu. Some believe it means &quot;owners of the land&quot; (&quot;lo&quot; meaning ownership and &quot;nkop&quot; meaning land) while others have different interpretations.

The Samburu speak the Samburu dialect of the Maa language, a Nilotic language which is also spoken by 22 other sub tribes of the Maa community commonly known as the Maasai. Some suggest that the Samburu are a distinct tribe separate from the Maasai, a view that some Samburu people accept today. 

Samburu National Reserve is one of the well known wildlife conservation areas in Kenya. Within the Maa community of Kenya and Tanzania, the Samburu sub-tribe is the third largest, following the Kisonko (Isikirari) of Tanzania and Purko of Kenya and Tanzania.

== History ==
Woto (sometimes Otto, *Do, To and Do) is a location which Samburu consider to be their homeland. Woto means north in Samburu. The exact location is unknown. It has generally been identified as being north of Lake Turkana and has been postulated to be somewhere in southern Ethiopia.

=== Cultural connections ===
The Nandi have a tradition that the first man who practiced circumcision in Nandi is said to have been one Kipkenyo who came from a country called Do (in other accounts To, indicating the intervocalic Kalenjin *d sound – closest pronunciation Tto).

This corresponds with linguistic studies which indicate significant cultural transfer between Southern Nilotes and Eastern Cushites during a time of intensive interaction prior to Southern Nilotic settlement in western Kenya.

==Culture==
===Social organization===
The Samburu are a gerontocracy. The power of elders is linked to the belief in their curse, underpinning their monopoly over arranging marriages and taking on further wives. This is at the expense of unmarried younger men, whose development up to the age of thirty is in a state of social suspension, prolonging their adolescent status.

===Clothing===

Traditionally, Samburu men wear a cloth which is often pink or black and is wrapped around their waist. They adorn themselves with necklaces, bracelets and anklets, like other sub tribes of the Maasai community. Members of the moran age grade (i.e. &quot;warriors&quot;) typically wear their hair in long braids, which they shave off when they become elders. It may be colored using red ochre. Their bodies are sometimes decorated with ochre, as well. Women wear two pieces of blue or purple cloth, one piece wrapped around the waist, the second wrapped over the chest. Women keep their hair shaved and wear numerous necklaces and bracelets. In the past decade, clothing styles have changed. Some men may wear the 1980s-90s style of red tartan cloth or they may wear a dark green/blue plaid cloth around their waists called &#x27;kikoi&#x27;, often with shorts underneath. Marani (Lmuran) (warriors) wear a cloth that may be floral or pastel. Some women still wear two pieces of blue or red cloth, but it has become fashionable to wear cloths with animal or floral patterns in deep colors. Women may also often wear small tank tops with their cloths, and plaid skirts have also become common.

===Food and society===

Traditionally, Samburu relied almost solely on their herds, although trade with their agricultural neighbors and use of wild foods were also important. Before the colonial period, cow, goat, and sheep milk was the daily staple. Oral and documentary evidence suggests that small stock were significant to the diet and economy at least from the eighteenth century forward. In the twenty-first century, cattle and small stock continue to be essential to the Samburu economy and social system. Milk is still a valued part of Samburu contemporary diet when available, and may be drunk either fresh, or fermented; &quot;ripened&quot; milk is often considered superior. Meat from cattle is eaten mainly on ceremonial occasions, or when a cow happens to die. Meat from small stock is eaten more commonly, though still not on a regular basis. Today Samburu rely increasingly on purchased agricultural products— with money acquired mainly from livestock sales— and most commonly maize meal is made into a porridge. Tea is also very common, taken with large quantities of sugar and (when possible) much milk, and is a staple of contemporary Samburu diet. Blood is both taken from living animals, and collected from slaughtered ones. There are at least thirteen ways that blood can be prepared, and may form a whole meal. Some Samburu have turned to agriculture, with varying results.

=== Circumcision ===
Samburu practice both circumsision and female genital mutilation, which is illegal in Kenya. Boys get circumcised in their teenage years, and most girls are subjected to genital cutting before marriage. Girls who have not yet undergone female circumcision are at risk of being raped as part of a practice referred to as &quot;beading&quot;, and are not allowed to have children.

== Religion ==
Samburu religion traditionally focuses on their multi-faceted divinity (&quot;Nkai&quot;). Nkai (a feminine noun), plays an active role in the lives of contemporary Samburu. It is not uncommon for children and young people, especially women, to report visions of Nkai. Some of these children prophesy for some period of time and a few gain a reputation for prophecy throughout their lives. Besides these spontaneous prophets, Samburu have ritual diviners, or shamans, called &quot;&#x27;loibonok&quot;&#x27; who divine the causes of individual illnesses and misfortune, and guide warriors.

Samburu believe that Nkai is the source of all protection from the hazards of their existence. But Nkai also inflicts punishment if an elder curses a junior for some show of disrespect. The elder’s anger is seen as an appeal to Nkai, and it is Nkai who decides if the curse is justified. Faced with misfortune and following some show of disrespect towards an older man, the victim should approach his senior and offer reparation in return for his blessing. This calms the elder&#x27;s anger and restores Nkai’s protection. It is, however, uncommon for an elder to curse a junior. Curses are reserved for cases of extreme disrespect.

Many Samburu have become Christians.

==In Western popular culture==
Samburu have been widely portrayed in popular culture, ranging from Hollywood movies, major television commercials, and mainstream journalism. Such portrayals make use of Samburu’s colorful cultural traditions, but sometimes at the expense of accuracy. One of the earlier film appearances by Samburu was in the 1953 John Ford classic &quot;Mogambo&quot;, in which they served as background for stars such as Clark Gable, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner.

In the 1990s, 300 Samburu traveled to South Africa to play opposite Kevin Bacon in the basketball comedy &quot;The Air Up There&quot;, in which Samburu are portrayed as a group called “The Winabi” whose prince is a potential hoops star who would propel Bacon to a college head coaching job. Samburu extras were used to portray members of the closely related, but better known, Maasai ethnic group as in the film &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, starring Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer. The 2005 film &quot;The White Masai&quot;— about a Swiss woman falling in love with a Samburu man— similarly conflates the two ethnic groups, mainly because the authors and directors believed that no one would have heard of Samburu. 

Dancing Samburu were included in a MasterCard commercial. Samburu runners were famously portrayed in a late 1980s Nike commercial, in which a Samburu man&#x27;s words were translated into English as the Nike slogan “Just Do It.” This was corrected by anthropologist Lee Cronk, who seeing the commercial alerted Nike and the media that the Samburu man was saying “I don’t want these. Give me big shoes.” Nike, in explaining the error, admitted to having improvised the dialogue and stated “we thought nobody in America would know what he said.&quot; 

A tribe in season 3 of the U.S. reality television series &quot;,&quot; which was filmed in Kenya in 2001, was named Samburu.

== Recent conflicts ==
In a 2009 article MSNBC took readers on a tour through places purported to be in Samburu County, while asserting that conflicts between Samburu and the neighboring Pokot people was the result of both sides starving because they had more cattle than the rangelands could support.

Armed conflict between the Samburu and Pokot tribes has escalated since 2010 and it is almost entirely centered upon the declining pastures available for increasing cattle herd sizes, numbering now as many as 1,500 cattle in a single herd. With the recurrent droughts since 2010, and catastrophic drought of 2017, the battles for pasture have led to both sides invading the private ranches and nature conservancies of Laikipia County. The armed conflict was incited by politicians who use it to improve their credentials among pastoralist communities.

<text>John Sherwood de Lancie, Jr. (born March 20, 1948) is an American actor, best known for his role as Q in various &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 1987 and leading up to the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; in 2023.

De Lancie&#x27;s first television role was in &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; in 1976. His other television series roles include Eugene Bradford in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1982–1986; 1989–1990), Frank Simmons in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (2001–2002), Donald Margolis in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; (2009–2010), Agent Allen Shapiro in &quot;&quot; (2011), as well as the voice of Discord in &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; (2011–2019).

De Lancie became an outspoken secular activist and was a featured speaker at the 2016 Reason Rally and at CSICon 2019.

==Early life and education==
De Lancie was born John Sherwood de Lancie, Jr. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 20, 1948, one of two children born to John de Lancie (1921–2002), principal oboist of the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1954 to 1977, and Andrea de Lancie (July 3, 1920 – October 18, 2006). His mother was French. His parents met in Paris. He has a sister, Christina.

As a child, he was diagnosed with dyslexia and struggled to read throughout his school years. He did not learn to read until he was 12. One of his teachers recommended that his parents encourage him to consider a career as an actor. He began to act around the age of 14, performing in a high school production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;. He went on to study acting at Kent State University (he was in attendance during the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970) and won a scholarship to Juilliard. He performed in numerous stage productions, at venues such as the American Shakespeare Festival and the Mark Taper Forum, and established a successful career in film and television.

==Acting career==
===Film and TV career===
====&quot;Star Trek&quot;====

De Lancie portrayed the almost-omnipotent character Q in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994), and in episodes of several subsequent Star Trek series taking place during that era. Q, notable for his chaotic, mischievous personality, is one of the few characters appearing in multiple series of the franchise: Eight episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, &quot;Hide and Q&quot;, &quot;Q Who&quot;, &quot;Deja Q&quot;, &quot;Qpid&quot;, &quot;True Q&quot;, &quot;Tapestry&quot;, &quot;All Good Things...&quot;), one episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;Q-Less&quot;), three episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (&quot;Death Wish,&quot; &quot;The Q and the Grey,&quot; &quot;Q2&quot;), and one episode of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; (&quot;Veritas&quot;). De Lancie&#x27;s son Keegan de Lancie appeared with his father as Q Junior in one episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (&quot;Q2&quot;).

Initially, de Lancie was too busy to audition for the part of Q, but Gene Roddenberry (whom he did not know) arranged a second opportunity. De Lancie recognized that even though &quot;Star Trek&quot; was only a small part of his career, it opened doors for him. In a 2012 interview, he said that he recalled his original audition, after which Roddenberry approached him, touched him on the shoulder, and said, &quot;You make my writing sound better than it is.&quot;

In April 2021, it was announced that de Lancie would reprise his role of Q in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. He subsequently appeared in multiple episodes of seasons two and three.

De Lancie voiced Antonio Malochio in &quot;Interstate &#x27;76&quot;, Trias in &quot;&quot;, Dr. Death in &quot;Outlaws&quot;, William Miles in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations&quot; and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, Fitz Quadwrangle in &quot;Quantum Conundrum&quot;, and Q in both the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; pinball game and the mobile game &quot;Star Trek Timelines&quot;, and portrayed Q in &quot;Star Trek: Borg&quot;. He further voiced the human emperor in &quot;Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars&quot;. He also voiced Alarak in &quot;StarCraft 2: Legacy of the Void&quot; and reprised the role for &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;. More recently, he voiced Geist, the leader of the Templars in the &quot;XCOM 2&quot; expansion &quot;War of the Chosen&quot;. He voiced the narrator wizard of Popup Dungeon. He also voiced the &quot;Dota 2&quot; hero Ringmaster, released in August 2024.

===Stage===

De Lancie is a former member of the American Shakespeare Festival, the Seattle Repertory Company, South Coast Repertory, the Mark Taper Forum, and the Old Globe (where he performed Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Blues&quot;). He performed and directed for Los Angeles Theater Works, the producing arm of KCRW-FM and National Public Radio, where the series &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; originated.

De Lancie co-hosted and appeared in &quot;Star Trek: The Music&quot;, a touring company, with fellow actor Robert Picardo, who portrayed the Doctor in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. De Lancie and Picardo narrate around the orchestral performance, explaining the history of the music in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He performed Pierre Curie in Alan Alda&#x27;s play &quot;Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie&quot; in 2001 at the Geffen Theater in Los Angeles. De Lancie hosted the children&#x27;s concerts at Walt Disney Concert Hall during the 2003–04 season; in 2005, he hosted the children&#x27;s series of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

===Voice acting===
Known for his distinctive speaking style, de Lancie lent his voice to a number of projects. In &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, he voiced Discord, a recurring character. Discord was inspired by Q as an omnipotent being who embodies mischief and chaos, but is genuinely good-hearted and is occasionally helpful to the heroes of the show; another connection to Q is that Discord often uses fewer contractions in his vocabulary. Discord is best described as an anti-hero, also similar to Q. Initially, Lauren Faust wanted to cast someone who could impersonate de Lancie, but Hasbro suggested casting de Lancie himself. Ironically, de Lancie has stated in an interview that, in preparation for his role as Discord, he did not draw from his past experience as Q. De Lancie mentioned during a 2013 convention panel that his voice recordings of Discord are slightly sped up and lose their deep bass sound. Nevertheless, fans still praised de Lancie for his performance. According to Jim Miller in &quot;The Art of Equestria&quot;, de Lancie&#x27;s sessions are always done by phone, but his first session as Discord was videotaped.

His other animated television roles included &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;, &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;, &quot;Max Steel&quot;, &quot;Duckman&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot;, and &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; as Mr. Freeze.

===Writing===
De Lancie co-wrote the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;I, Q&quot; with Peter David, as well as co-writing the novel &quot;Soldier of Light&quot; (with Tom Cool). He wrote the DC comic book story &quot;The Gift&quot;. In 1996, along with Leonard Nimoy and writer-producer Nat Segaloff, de Lancie formed and recorded &quot;Alien Voices&quot;, a collection of audio dramas based on classic science fiction and fantasy stories, such as &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;The Lost World&quot;.

===Music===
De Lancie has performed as narrator with a number of major orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Nova Scotia. He provided the narration for the world premiere of Lorenzo Palomo&#x27;s &quot;The Sneetches and Other Stories&quot; (based on the book by Dr. Seuss) with the Oberlin Conservatory Orchestra. He wrote and directed ten symphonic plays, which were produced with the Milwaukee, St. Paul Chamber, Ravinia, Los Angeles, and Pasadena Orchestras.

De Lancie was the writer, director and host of &quot;First Nights&quot;, an adult concert series at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, based loosely on the book of the same name by Thomas Forrest Kelly, which explored the life and music of Stravinsky, Beethoven, Mahler, Schumann, and Prokofiev. In 2006, de Lancie made his opera directorial debut with the Atlanta Opera performing Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; from May 18–21.

In September 2019, de Lancie narrated as &quot;Forever of the Stars&quot; in the first ever live performances of Ayreon&#x27;s Sci-Fi concept album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;.

===Documentary===
While on stage at the 2012 Ottawa ComicCon, de Lancie announced that he had made plans to co-produce a documentary about &quot;bronies&quot; (older, usually male teenage and adult fans of &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;). He said he was taken aback by how disrespectfully national news media portrayed the brony fandom. He started a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the documentary, since titled &quot;&quot;. The campaign began on May 13, 2012, and by June 10 had reached $322,022, becoming Kickstarter&#x27;s second-highest funded film project of all time.

==Personal life==
De Lancie is married to Marnie Mosiman, with whom he has two sons: Keegan (b. 1984) and a younger son (b. 1987).

De Lancie is an experienced sailor, spending time on the Pacific Ocean, which he said &quot;sometimes involves very terrifying experiences.&quot;

He is long-time friends with fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; alum Kate Mulgrew. He is also good friends with &quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; star Richard Dean Anderson, with whom he has appeared in episodes of both series, and in the 1995 television series &quot;Legend&quot;.

===Secular activism===
Raised by secular parents, de Lancie is an advocate for atheism and humanism. Of his education in a religious school in Philadelphia, he remembers associating religion with manipulation. Rather than developing a religious outlook, he became fascinated by an ever-changing world: &quot;I&#x27;m wondering if one of the things at the core of believing in God, or not, has to do with change. I have grown to embrace change. Personally, I love reading the science section in the paper every morning. I&#x27;m in awe of humankind&#x27;s boundless curiosity.&quot;

On June 4, 2016, he addressed the participants at the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C. Speaking in reference to his &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Q, he said:

On July 14, 2017, de Lancie attended the unveiling of a statue of Clarence Darrow at the Rhea County Courthouse, Dayton, Tennessee, the site of the Scopes Trial in 1925, where Darrow had argued in favor of the teaching of evolution and secular education.
In October 2019, de Lancie was a featured speaker at the annual conference of the Center for Inquiry, CSICon. At the conference he announced two new projects. The first, an animated series, titled &quot;God&#x27;s Goofs&quot;, is meant to point out that intelligent design is absurd. The second project is a play based on the historic 2005 intelligent design trial in Dover, Pennsylvania, the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal courts testing a public school district policy that required the teaching of intelligent design.

<text>The Canadian Arrow was a privately funded, early-2000s rocket and space tourism project concept founded by London, Ontario, Canada entrepreneurs Geoff Sheerin, Dan McKibbon and Chris Corke. The project&#x27;s objective was to take the first civilians into space, on a vertical sub-orbital spaceflight reaching an altitude of 112 km.

Canadian Arrow was considered one of the top three candidates for the X-Prize competition, along with Scaled Composites (Burt Rutan), and Armadillo Aerospace (John Carmack). Scaled Composites won the competition on October 4, 2004.

The Canadian Arrow team&#x27;s motto was &quot;making SPACE for you&quot;. They completed the first series of tests on their 57,000 lbf (254 kN) thrust engine and built a space training centre and a full-scale mock-up of their rocket. After an open nomination process, they also recruited a team of six astronauts from around the world, including several seasoned military pilots and a NASA-trained astronaut from Ukraine. Astronaut candidates – the group &quot;Arrow Six&quot; included David Ballinger, Ted Gow, Terry Wong, Jason Dyer, Larry Clark and Yaroslav &quot;Yarko&quot; Pustovyi, the only member of the team with actual space training.

In November 2010 Geoff Sheerin, the president of Canadian Arrow stated the company was unlikely to fly a Canadian Arrow rocket as a space tourism vehicle.

The Canadian Arrow never flew a crewed or uncrewed flight.

==Design==

The Canadian Arrow was a 16.5 m tall two-stage rocket, where the second stage was a three-person space capsule. The Canadian Arrow team&#x27;s somewhat conservative approach was to base the design of their rocket engine and aerodynamics on the well proven V-2 design from World War II.

===First stage===
The rocket&#x27;s first stage was 10.2 m long and 1.7 m in diameter. It was propelled by a single liquid fuel rocket engine. It produced a thrust of 254 kN. Graphite jet vanes were used for stabilisation before the rocket has reached a velocity high enough for the four fins to be effective. About one minute after ignition, the fuel was depleted and the engine shut off.

===Second stage===
The rocket&#x27;s second stage was 6 m long and 1.7 m in diameter at the base. It carried three astronauts and was propelled by four JATO-type solid rocket engines. These were ignited immediately after stage separation, and carried the capsule to an altitude of ~112 km. Cold gas jets were planned to be used for attitude control.

===Crew Cabin Escape System===
The design proposed four solid rocket engines in the second stage that could be fired at any time, even when the rocket stands on its launch pad. This constituted an escape system, which could, in a case of an emergency, quickly separate the second stage from the rocket and propel it to an altitude of 1.5 km, where its parachutes could be deployed.

===Rocket engine===
The rocket engine was to use alcohol and liquid oxygen as propellants, and produces a maximum thrust of 254 kN, and burns for 55s. It was constructed of low carbon steel, with propellant injectors made out of brass.

===Flight profile===
The Canadian Arrow rocket was to launch vertically from the ground. Initial thrust was ~75.5 kN, but the rocket quickly reached maximum thrust. After 55s, the propellant was depleted and stage separation occurred. The solid fuel rockets in the second stage were ignited and boosted it up to an altitude of ~112 km, where the crew and passengers would have experienced a few minutes of &quot;zero-G&quot;, or weightlessness.

After stage separation the first stage reached an apogee of over 80 km before descent begun. Four parachutes slow the Canadian Arrow&#x27;s first stage down before splashdown occurred at a speed of ~9 m/s, after which recovery of the spacecraft could take place.

During descent, the crew cabin (the second stage) was planned to use a ballute to reduce its speed. When its velocity became subsonic, the second stage&#x27;s ballute was to be released and pull out the three parachutes before splashdown.

===Testing===

*Summer, 2002: Single burner cup engine test.
*October 5, 2002: The rocket test stand complete.
*November 7, 2003: First engine tests conducted.
*August 14, 2004: Canadian Arrow carried out a successful drop test of the crew cabin, to test the parachutes and recovery routines.

==Funding, commercial aspects and the future==
Canadian Arrow started as a team competing in the international X-Prize competition, with the ultimate goal of continuing past the X-Prize into the commercial sector providing private access to space. Funding during the X-Prize was provided by sponsorship and private investment.

In early 2003 the company would receive a major infusion of financial support by Canadian Arrow partner and Director of Spacecraft Development - Lou van Amelsvoort. As a result, during the next two years the company would also proceed to open the world&#x27;s first private Astronaut training facility, continue vehicle development, and test propulsion and recovery systems.

Geoff Sheerin, president and CEO of Canadian Arrow, and Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria announced on May 17, 2005, the creation of PlanetSpace Corporation. It was through this enterprise that Canadian Arrow would complete the construction of their spacecraft, and within 24 months offer suborbital space flight to aspiring space tourists. Planetspace expected to fly about 2,000 new astronauts within five years of operation. The price was expected to be $250,000 for each flight, including fourteen days of training. Cape Breton Island, in Nova Scotia was being considered as a launch site, and a contract was signed with the government of Nova Scotia to provide of land for the project.

A requirement of the X-Prize for each participating company was to propose other possible markets for their spacecraft. Canadian Arrow coined the term &quot;Spacediving&quot;, while investigating the possible use of Canadian Arrow spacecraft for a high altitude version of skydiving.

On November 11, 2005, Canadian Arrow teamed up with former X-Prize competitor Romanian aerospace company, ARCASPACE, to develop privately built spacecraft.

On December 15, 2005 PlanetSpace Corporation unveiled plans for an orbital commercial vehicle capable of carrying eight passengers. This vehicle was to be called the Silver Dart and it was based on the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Flight Dynamics Laboratory-7 lifting body program from the 1970s.
PlanetSpace Corporation became defunct as of 6 February 2013.
On June 21, 2013, Blackburn news reported that the full scale engineering mock-up of the Canadian Arrow rocket was purchased by Sarnia Ontario&#x27;s Preferred Towing. Having spent several years at Chris Hadfield Airport in Sarnia, Ontario, Preferred Towing expressed interest in hopes of restoring the rocket for display in Sarnia. This plan has since been scrapped and the mock-up no longer exists.

<text>This is a list of weapons (aircraft ordnance) carried by aircraft.

==Guns==
In World War I, aircraft were initially intended for aerial reconnaissance, however some pilots began to carry rifles in case they spotted enemy planes. Soon, planes were fitted with machine guns with a variety of mountings; initially the only guns were carried in the rear cockpit supplying defensive fire (this was employed by two-seat aircraft all through the war). Seeing a need for offensive fire, forward-firing weapons were devised. The Airco DH.2 pusher plane had its gun in the front while the engine was in the back, some experimented with mountings on the (side) wing or on the biplane&#x27;s upper wing (above the cockpit), until by 1916 most fighter aircraft mounted their guns in the forward fuselage using a synchronization gear so that the bullets did not strike the propeller.

In World War II, fighter aircraft carried machine guns and cannons mounted in the wings, engine cowlings, nose, or between the banks of the engine, firing through the propeller spinner. Night fighters sometimes utilized guns firing upwards as well. Bombers typically carried from one to 14 flexible machine guns and/or autocannon as defensive armament, while certain types added fixed offensive guns as well.

While missiles have been the primary armament since the early 1960s, the Vietnam War showed that guns still had a role to play and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannons (typically between 20 and 30 mm in caliber) as an adjunct to missiles. Modern European fighter aircraft are usually equipped with the revolver cannon, whereas the United States and to some extent Russia generally favor the Gatling gun. The Gatling gun quickly became the weapon of choice for most air forces.

<doc id="408780" wikidata="Q594590" url="?curid=408780" title="Take a Look in the Mirror">
<text>Take a Look in the Mirror is the sixth studio album by American nu metal band Korn. Released on November 21, 2003, through Epic Records and Immortal Records, it is the last Korn studio album to feature their full original lineup, as their original guitarist Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch left the band in February 2005 until his return in 2013 (with the release of their 2013 album &quot;The Paradigm Shift&quot;). It is the last album to feature the original lineup as drummer David Silveria also left Korn before the end of 2006 after the release of their next album &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;. It was also the last studio album by Korn under the Epic and Immortal labels.

==Background==
The album continued Korn&#x27;s lowering in sales, debuting at number 19 and peaked at number 9 with first-week record sales of about 179,000, due to the release date of the album being pushed up to a Friday, with fewer sales than if it was released on the standard Tuesday. The track &quot;Did My Time&quot; was previously released as a CD single for the film &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life&quot; and the track &quot;Right Now&quot; was accompanied by a provocative cartoon video animated by Spike and Mike. The ending track &quot;When Will This End&quot; is followed by a long silence before a live cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;One&quot; starts playing. The album was also released in a &quot;clean&quot; version which utilized backmasking as well as growling in place of profanity. &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; has sold over 1.2 million copies in the US and over 2 million copies outside of the US according to Nielsen SoundScan as of January 4, 2013 and was certified platinum on December 16, 2003. It has been claimed that the album was rushed, due to the lower than expected sales of &quot;Untouchables&quot; which had left the band in debt. Jonathan Davis has subsequently admitted in interviews that the album was written at somewhat of a rushed pace, due to the lower than expected sales of &quot;Untouchables&quot;, and having to write with the time restraint of being on that summer&#x27;s Ozzfest tour.

===Composition and music===

&quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; marks Korn&#x27;s attempt to return to a more aggressive sound as featured on their earlier albums, with guitarists Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch and James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer mostly utilizing thick, heavy distortion and the occasional clean tones for contrast. The album features strong elements of nu metal and has the aggressive sounds featured on their early work, as well as a reworked and re-recorded version of the track &quot;Alive&quot;, which had previously only been released on the band&#x27;s first demo, &quot;Neidermayer&#x27;s Mind&quot;. Also of note is the song &quot;Play Me&quot; which features rapper Nas.
Around this period, guitarist Head was heavily addicted to drugs such as meth. He said &quot;2003 is when I started using speed every day. I [also] got hooked on meth and in order to get up and function, even play a show, I had to snort lines, you know. And I told myself, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do this tour, I&#x27;ll do this Ozzfest, and I&#x27;ll do meth the whole time and I&#x27;ll go home and check into a rehab.&#x27; And it scared me, you know, &#x27;cause I was like coming every month I would tell myself, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna stop this tour,&#x27; and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it. Like a fear would come over me. I was just trapped.&quot; Regarding the issues facing the band during the recording, guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer recalled &quot;We weren&#x27;t in the best space. The songs weren&#x27;t flowing and the creativity was a bit muted from these personal dramas each of us had.&quot; He also claimed the album was a forced effort.

Jonathan Davis said &quot;[This album] is about us as a band, taking a look in the mirror and remembering where we came from, remembering our roots, going back to basics,&quot; Davis said. &quot;We reflect and look back why we really got into this band to begin with and why we started it. It&#x27;s to make aggressive, heavy music. Over the years … we were just experimenting. It always was Korn, but it was different spins on what we were doing. So this time we wanted to make an aggressive, heavy album and just kill it. And that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve produced it ourselves. Nobody knows Korn better than ourselves.&quot; Davis also stated that he felt a return to basics nu metal album was needed in the music industry of 2003. He said &quot;Nothing coming out is really striking me at all. The whole rock and pop punk scene is just stagnant and boring. Music is not imaginative at the moment. The only record I consider remotely interesting is probably the Outkast album, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;. That&#x27;s really cool and original.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; has received mixed reviews from professional critics but acclaim from fans. Metacritic scores the album 49 based on nine reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, while the user&#x27;s average score is 8.2/10. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier states the album is &quot;a little paradoxical, but that&#x27;s precisely what makes &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; so interesting, especially for longtime fans&quot; and goes on to say that &quot;because of the emphasis on brevity and variety (and especially quality), the album&#x27;s over before you know it and you&#x27;re left feeling hungry for more Korn.&quot; On the contrary, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; scored the album a D, saying &quot;Korn remain[s] technically proficient, but &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; serves only to make the case that the genre has officially screamed itself into caricature.&quot; NME gave the album a negative review, criticizing it for being a &quot;self-parody&quot;, they wrote &quot;this is an exercise in sterile studio-rock. Meticulously Pro-Tooled, and built almost entirely around bassist Fieldy&#x27;s relentless, sludgy mid-range, it&#x27;s an approach that demonstrates little craft and even less actual feeling.&quot; In 2005, the album was ranked number 384 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

In a 2013 interview, guitarist Head cited &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; as &quot;the worst record we did&quot;. In 2015, Jonathan Davis also ranked it as his least favourite album in Korn&#x27;s discography.

<text>Julie Billiart, SNDdeN (12 July 1751 – 8 April 1816) was a French Catholic nun, educator, and cofounder of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. 

She was born in Cuvilly, a village in Picardy, in northern France. She was paralyzed and bedridden for 22 years, but was well known for her prayer, her embroidery skills, and her education of both the poor and the nobility, especially her work with young girls. She had to flee Cuvilly after the start of the French Revolution and escaped to Compiègne, where the stress she experienced resulted in another illness that took away her ability to speak, and where she received a vision foretelling that she would found a new religious congregation that would eventually become the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. In 1794, she met the French noblewoman and nun, Françoise Blin de Bourdon, who became Billiart&#x27;s co-founder and close associate, in Amiens.

In 1804, Billiart and de Bourdon established the Sisters of Notre Dame in Amiens, where they and other nuns dedicated themselves to the care and education of young girls. Billiart, who was called &quot;Mother Julie,&quot; was healed of both her paralysis and her speech and went on to found schools and homes for poor girls in France and Belgium. As of 2020, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur worked in 16 countries on five continents. Billiart died on 8 April 1816 in Namur. She was beatified on 13 May 1906 by Pope Pius X and canonized on 22 June 1969 by Pope Paul VI.

== Early life ==
Julie Billiart was born on 12 July 1751, in Cuvilly, a village in Picardy, in northern France, to farmer and shop owner Jean-François Billiart and Marie-Louise-Antoinette Debraine, who were &quot;strong Christian parents&quot;. Billiart&#x27;s childhood was &quot;remarkable;&quot; she knew the catechism by heart by the age of seven, when she began teaching it to her friends. She received a rudimentary education at the village school run by her uncle and received her First Communion, was confirmed, and took a vow of chastity when she was nine years old. She knew that she wanted to enter the religious life by the time she was 14. Billiart was admired for her &quot;beautiful embroidery and lace&quot;, which she sold in her family&#x27;s store and donated to local churches and to the nearby Carmelite convent. When she was 16, &quot;[m]isfortunes overtook the Billiart family;&quot; their store was robbed and they were never able to recover financially. She found work as a farm worker and would teach her co-workers hymns, lecture about faith and virtue, and share Bible stories. She was &quot;held in such high esteem for her virtue and piety as to be commonly called, &#x27;the saint of Cuvilly&#x27;&quot;.

In 1774, Billiart witnessed the shooting of her father as they worked in the family store; the traumatic experience resulted in a &quot;mysterious illness&quot;. She became paralyzed and by 1784, due to poor medical treatment, was confined to her bed as &quot;a helpless cripple&quot; for 22 years. Despite being bedridden, she &quot;exercised an uncommon gift of prayer&quot;, spending four or five hours a day &quot;in contemplation&quot; and received the Eucharist daily. She also spent her time making linens and laces for the altar, teaching both poor peasants from Cuvilly and noblewomen from Picardy, and preparing village children for their First Communion.

== Life and work ==
In 1789, the French Revolution broke out; Billiart, as Loyola Press put it, &quot;conducted her defiance from her bed&quot;, helped protect a non-juried priest, and refused to cooperate with a priest loyal to the Revolutionary government and persuaded the entire village to boycott him, so with the help of one of her noblewomen students, she was forced to escape Cuvilly. She had to hide from revolutionaries by hiding under a mound of straw in the bed of a wagon; a farmhand helped Billiart, her niece, and caregiver escape to Compiègne. The stress of being so far away from home, the worry for her friends who risked their safety to protect her, and the grief over the loss of her father and her friends, the Martyrs of Compiègne, sixteen Carmelite sisters who were guillotined in 1794, resulted in another paralysis that took away her ability to speak. While in Compiègne, she received a vision about founding a new religious congregation, hearing the words, &quot;These are the daughters that I will give you in an Institute, which will be marked by my cross&quot;, which she believed was a &quot;guide for her future&quot;.

In October 1794, she moved to a small apartment in Amiens, where she met the French noblewoman and nun, Françoise Blin de Bourdon, whom Billiart recognized as one of the nuns in her vision in Compiègne. At first, de Bourdon was &quot;repelled by Julie&#x27;s disabilities and her garbled speech&quot;, but Billiart &quot;immediately admired and enjoyed Francoise, who came with a character that was genuine, spiritual and strong&quot;. Eventually, Billiart and de Bourdon became close and de Bourdon slowly came to &quot;love and admire the invalid for her wonderful gifts of soul&quot; and her &quot;deep faith and loving spirit&quot;. Billiart and de Bourdon&#x27;s friendship was strengthened between 1795 and 1797, through their correspondence while de Bourdon cared for her family in Gézaincourt in northern France.

In 1797, during the Reign of Terror, Billiart, de Bourdon, and the Abbé Thomas, who was also hiding and ministering in Amiens, escaped to Bettencourt in northern France until they were able to return to Amiens in February 1803. They met Father Varin, a local priest, in Bettencourt and Billiart continued teaching girls. When they returned to Amiens, Varin entrusted the care of some young orphan girls to Billiart and de Bourdon. On February 2, 1804, Billiart, de Bourdon, and another woman, Catherine Duchâtel, made vows of chastity, dedicated themselves to the care and education of young girls, and founded the Sisters of Notre Dame in Amiens, which later became the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. Billiart regained the ability to speak with Varin&#x27;s assistance.

A small group of de Bourdon&#x27;s associates, who were &quot;young and high-born ladies&quot;, formed around Billiart, who taught them &quot;how to lead the interior life&quot; while they worked generously for &quot;the cause of God and His poor&quot;. De Bourdon rented a home for them, where they lived, prayed, and worked together in a small community; Varin helped write formal guidelines for them. The foundation was made for what would, under the auspices of the Bishop of Amiens, become the Sisters of Notre Dame, a &quot;society which had for its primary object the salvation of poor children&quot; and was devoted to educating young girls and to &quot;making known God&#x27;s goodness&quot;. By February 1804, Billiart was being called &quot;Mother Julie&quot;. Several young people volunteered to assist Billiart and de Bourdon; their first class consisted of eight orphans.

On June 1, 1804, on the Feast of the Sacred Heart, after her confessor instructed her to pray a novena, she was cured of paralysis. After her cure, she was able to travel to St. Valery-sur-Somme and Abbeville &quot;on a successful mission&quot;. &quot;The first vows of religion&quot; were made on October 25, 1805, by Billiart, de Bourdon, and two other sisters. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the sisters &quot;proposed for their lifework the Christian education of girls, and the training of religious teachers who should go wherever their services were asked for&quot;. As its founder and first superior, Billiart established the order&#x27;s devotions from its very beginning. Also according to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, she did away with &quot;the time-honored distinction between choir sisters and lay sisters, but this perfect equality of rank did not in any way prevent her from putting each sister to the work for which her capacity and education fitted her&quot;. She also emphasized the spiritual formation and education of the sisters who taught in their schools and was &quot;ably assisted&quot; by de Bourdon, who was called &quot;Sister St. Joseph&quot;.

On February 2, 1806, Billart had another vision, when she saw the Sisters of Notre Dame &quot;as a &#x27;light of revelation&#x27;&quot; throughout the world. The religious authorities in Amiens opposed the congregation&#x27;s work in other places, so they moved the congregation to Namur in 1809 and they became known as the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. Billart viewed universal education as &quot;a basic human right, and teaching as the &#x27;greatest work on earth&#x27;&quot;. As writer Anne Stevenson states, Billiart &quot;brought the good news and hope in the goodness of God to a depressed and deprived generation by preparing vulnerable children for their duties in life, when children cried out for survival&quot;. As of 2020, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur worked in 16 countries on five continents.

By the time the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur was approved by an imperial decree on June 19, 1806, it had 30 members. In a few years, the order was founded in various towns in France and Belgium, the most important ones in Ghent and Namur, where de Bourdon was the first superior. In 1809, the Namur convent became the order&#x27;s motherhouse, where it remained so as of 1913. Between 1804 and 1816, Billiart founded 15 convents, made 120 &quot;long and toilsome&quot; journeys, and &quot;carried on a close correspondence with her spiritual daughters&quot;, hundreds of which were preserved in Namur. In January 1816, Billiart became ill, &quot;and after three months of pain borne in silence and patience, she died with the Magnificat on her lips&quot;. She died on April 8, 1816, in Namur.

== Legacy ==
Billiart&#x27;s beatification process began in 1881 and was completed on 13 May 1906 by Pope Pius X. Her story &quot;resided in obscurity&quot; for decades.

The first miracle that supported Billiart&#x27;s rise to sainthood occurred on 20 November 1919, in Namur, when a man named Homer Rhodius was healed of renal disease after prayers to Billiart and the use of a relic, provided by his daughter and a nun of the Namur branch of the Sisters of Notre Dame, Sister Marie-Ludovica. The cause for Billiart&#x27;s canonization was formally opened on 23 July 1924.

As briefly reported by Sister Mary Ludvine in the Sisters of Notre Dame of Coesfeld 1952 newsletter, on 30 September 1950, in Mata Virgem, a village in southern Brazil 27 miles from Campos Novos, a 29-year old farmer named Otacilio Ribeiro da Silva was healed of an inoperable tumor by Billiart after the prayers and use of Billiart&#x27;s relic and picture by members of the congregation who also worked at the hospital where da Silva was brought and by Ludvine, who was the hospital&#x27;s superior. In 1952, Mary Verona, an assistant mother general of the Coesfeld Sisters of Notre Dame, who was residing in Rome, was &quot;well connected with the Church hierarchy&quot;, and involved in the decades-long effort to canonize Billiart, read the account of the da Silva miracle in her congregation&#x27;s newsletter. This was the second miracle required for canonization, which was stalled for decades after the 1919 miracle. Four years later, in 1958, the da Silva miracle was authenticated. The 1919 miracle had to be re-examined in 1967, but Billiart was finally canonized by Pope Paul VI on 22 June 1969. Da Silva attended the ceremony and was accompanied by his 14-year old daughter, whom Da Silva named Julie, after Billiart, as he promised the nuns who prayed to Billart for his healing in 1952.

Billiart&#x27;s feast day is April 8. She is the patron saint of educators and teachers.

<text>Thomas Chippendale, the younger (1749–1822) was an English artist, furniture maker and designer, and the eldest of Thomas Chippendale&#x27;s eleven children. He was devoted to his father and worked with Chippendale Senior until the later died in 1779. Thereafter he took over his father&#x27;s business until Thomas Chippendale Jr. was obliged to close the doors on the family business. The company, listed in Sheraton&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet Directory&quot; of 1803, went bankrupt in 1804 but was later re-established. Thomas Chippendale was also a member of the Society of Arts and exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts between 1784 and 1801.

<text>Helioseismology is the study of the structure and dynamics of the Sun through its oscillations. These are principally caused by sound waves that are continuously driven and damped by convection near the Sun&#x27;s surface. It is similar to geoseismology, or asteroseismology, which are respectively the studies of the Earth or stars through their oscillations. While the Sun&#x27;s oscillations were first detected in the early 1960s, it was only in the mid-1970s that it was realized that the oscillations propagated throughout the Sun and could allow scientists to study the Sun&#x27;s deep interior. The term was coined by Douglas Gough in the 90s. The modern field is separated into global helioseismology, which studies the Sun&#x27;s resonant modes directly, and local helioseismology, which studies the propagation of the component waves near the Sun&#x27;s surface.

Helioseismology has contributed to a number of scientific breakthroughs. The most notable was to show that the anomaly in the predicted neutrino flux from the Sun could not be caused by flaws in stellar models and must instead be a problem of particle physics. The so-called solar neutrino problem was ultimately resolved by neutrino oscillations. The experimental discovery of neutrino oscillations was recognized by the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics. Helioseismology also allowed accurate measurements of the quadrupole (and higher-order) moments of the Sun&#x27;s gravitational potential, which are consistent with General Relativity. The first helioseismic calculations of the Sun&#x27;s internal rotation profile showed a rough separation into a rigidly-rotating core and differentially-rotating envelope. The boundary layer is now known as the tachocline and is thought to be a key component for the solar dynamo. Although it roughly coincides with the base of the solar convection zone — also inferred through helioseismology — it is conceptually distinct, being a boundary layer in which there is a meridional flow connected with the convection zone and driven by the interplay between baroclinicity and Maxwell stresses.

Helioseismology benefits most from continuous monitoring of the Sun, which began first with uninterrupted observations from near the South Pole over the austral summer. In addition, observations over multiple solar cycles have allowed helioseismologists to study changes in the Sun&#x27;s structure over decades. These studies are made possible by global telescope networks like the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) and the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON), which have been operating for over several decades.

== Types of solar oscillation ==

Solar oscillation modes are interpreted as resonant vibrations of a roughly spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. Each mode can then be represented approximately as the product of a function of radius formula_1 and a spherical harmonic formula_2, and consequently can be characterized by the three quantum numbers which label:

* the number of nodal shells in radius, known as the &quot;radial order&quot; formula_3;
* the total number of nodal circles on each spherical shell, known as the &quot;angular degree&quot; formula_4; and
* the number of those nodal circles that are longitudinal, known as the &quot;azimuthal order&quot; formula_5.

It can be shown that the oscillations are separated into two categories: interior oscillations and a special category of surface oscillations. More specifically, there are:

=== Pressure modes (p modes) ===

Pressure modes are in essence standing sound waves. The dominant restoring force is the pressure (rather than buoyancy), hence the name. All the solar oscillations that are used for inferences about the interior are p modes, with frequencies between about 1 and 5 millihertz and angular degrees ranging from zero (purely radial motion) to order formula_6. Broadly speaking, their energy densities vary with radius inversely proportional to the sound speed, so their resonant frequencies are determined predominantly by the outer regions of the Sun. Consequently it is difficult to infer from them the structure of the solar core.

=== Gravity modes (g modes) ===

Gravity modes are confined to convectively stable regions, either the radiative interior or the atmosphere. The restoring force is predominantly buoyancy, and thus indirectly gravity, from which they take their name. They are evanescent in the convection zone, and therefore interior modes have tiny amplitudes at the surface and are extremely difficult to detect and identify. It has long been recognized that measurement of even just a few g modes could substantially increase our knowledge of the deep interior of the Sun. However, no individual g mode has yet been unambiguously measured, although indirect detections have been both claimed and challenged. Additionally, there can be similar gravity modes confined to the convectively stable atmosphere.
=== Surface gravity modes (f modes) ===

Surface gravity waves are analogous to waves in deep water, having the property that the Lagrangian pressure perturbation is essentially zero. They are of high degree formula_4, penetrating a characteristic distance formula_8, where formula_9 is the solar radius. To good approximation, they obey the so-called deep-water-wave dispersion law: formula_10, irrespective of the stratification of the Sun, where formula_11 is the angular frequency, formula_12 is the surface gravity and formula_13 is the horizontal wavenumber, and tend asymptotically to that relation as formula_14.

== What seismology can reveal ==

The oscillations that have been successfully utilized for seismology are essentially adiabatic. Their dynamics is therefore the action of pressure forces formula_15 (plus putative Maxwell stresses) against matter with inertia density formula_16, which itself depends upon the relation between them under adiabatic change, usually quantified via the (first) adiabatic exponent formula_17. The equilibrium values of the variables formula_15 and formula_16 (together with the dynamically small angular velocity formula_20 and magnetic field formula_21) are related by the constraint of hydrostatic support, which depends upon the total mass formula_22 and radius formula_9 of the Sun. Evidently, the oscillation frequencies formula_11 depend only on the seismic variables formula_25, formula_17, formula_20 and formula_21, or any independent set of functions of them. Consequently it is only about these variables that information can be derived directly. The square of the adiabatic sound speed, formula_29, is such commonly adopted function, because that is the quantity upon which acoustic propagation principally depends. Properties of other, non-seismic, quantities, such as helium abundance, formula_30, or main-sequence age formula_31, can be inferred only by supplementation with additional assumptions, which renders the outcome more uncertain.

== Data analysis ==

=== Global helioseismology ===


The chief tool for analysing the raw seismic data is the Fourier transform. To good approximation, each mode is a damped harmonic oscillator, for which the power as a function of frequency is a Lorentz function. Spatially resolved data are usually projected onto desired spherical harmonics to obtain time series which are then Fourier transformed. Helioseismologists typically combine the resulting one-dimensional power spectra into a two-dimensional spectrum.

The lower frequency range of the oscillations is dominated by the variations caused by granulation. This must first be filtered out before (or at the same time that) the modes are analysed. Granular flows at the solar surface are mostly horizontal, from the centres of the rising granules to the narrow downdrafts between them. Relative to the oscillations, granulation produces a stronger signal in intensity than line-of-sight velocity, so the latter is preferred for helioseismic observatories.

=== Local helioseismology ===

Local helioseismology—a term coined by Charles Lindsey, Doug Braun and Stuart Jefferies in 1993—employs several different analysis methods to make inferences from the observational data.

* The Fourier–Hankel spectral method was originally used to search for wave absorption by sunspots.
* Ring-diagram analysis, first introduced by Frank Hill, is used to infer the speed and direction of horizontal flows below the solar surface by observing the Doppler shifts of ambient acoustic waves from power spectra of solar oscillations computed over patches of the solar surface (typically 15° × 15°). Thus, ring-diagram analysis is a generalization of global helioseismology applied to local areas on the Sun (as opposed to half of the Sun). For example, the sound speed and adiabatic index can be compared within magnetically active and inactive (quiet Sun) regions.
*Time-distance helioseismology aims to measure and interpret the travel times of solar waves between any two locations on the solar surface. Inhomogeneities near the ray path connecting the two locations perturb the travel time between those two points. An inverse problem must then be solved to infer the local structure and dynamics of the solar interior.
*Helioseismic holography, introduced in detail by Charles Lindsey and Doug Braun for the purpose of far-side (magnetic) imaging, is a special case of phase-sensitive holography. The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions on the far side of the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like seismic migration, a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare.
*In direct modelling, the idea is to estimate subsurface flows from direct inversion of the frequency-wavenumber correlations seen in the wavefield in the Fourier domain. Woodard demonstrated the ability of the technique to recover near-surface flows the f modes.

== Inversion ==

=== Introduction ===

The Sun&#x27;s oscillation modes represent a discrete set of observations that are sensitive to its continuous structure. This allows scientists to formulate inverse problems for the Sun&#x27;s interior structure and dynamics. Given a reference model of the Sun, the differences between its mode frequencies and those of the Sun, if small, are weighted averages of the differences between the Sun&#x27;s structure and that of the reference model. The frequency differences can then be used to infer those structural differences. The weighting functions of these averages are known as &quot;kernels&quot;.

=== Structure ===

The first inversions of the Sun&#x27;s structure were made using Duvall&#x27;s law and later using Duvall&#x27;s law linearized about a reference solar model. These results were subsequently supplemented by analyses that linearize the full set of equations describing the stellar oscillations about a theoretical reference model and are now a standard way to invert frequency data. The inversions demonstrated differences in solar models that were greatly reduced by implementing &quot;gravitational settling&quot;: the gradual separation of heavier elements towards the solar centre (and lighter elements to the surface to replace them).

=== Rotation ===
If the Sun were perfectly spherical, the modes with different azimuthal orders &quot;m&quot; would have the same frequencies. Rotation, however, breaks this degeneracy, and the modes frequencies differ by &quot;rotational splittings&quot; that are weighted-averages of the angular velocity through the Sun. Different modes are sensitive to different parts of the Sun and, given enough data, these differences can be used to infer the rotation rate throughout the Sun. For example, if the Sun were rotating uniformly throughout, all the p modes would be split by approximately the same amount. Actually, the angular velocity is not uniform, as can be seen at the surface, where the equator rotates faster than the poles. The Sun rotates slowly enough that a spherical, non-rotating model is close enough to reality for deriving the rotational kernels.

Helioseismology has shown that the Sun has a rotation profile with several features:
* a rigidly-rotating radiative (i.e. non-convective) zone, though the rotation rate of the inner core is not well known;
* a thin shear layer, known as the &quot;tachocline&quot;, which separates the rigidly-rotating interior and the differentially-rotating convective envelope;
* a convective envelope in which the rotation rate varies both with depth and latitude; and
* a final shear layer just beneath the surface, in which the rotation rate slows down towards the surface.

== Relationship to other fields ==

=== Geoseismology ===

Helioseismology was born from analogy with geoseismology but several important differences remain. First, the Sun lacks a solid surface and therefore cannot support shear waves. From the data analysis perspective, global helioseismology differs from geoseismology by studying only normal modes. Local helioseismology is thus somewhat closer in spirit to geoseismology in the sense that it studies the complete wavefield.

=== Asteroseismology ===

Because the Sun is a star, helioseismology is closely related to the study of oscillations in other stars, known as asteroseismology. Helioseismology is most closely related to the study of stars whose oscillations are also driven and damped by their outer convection zones, known as solar-like oscillators, but the underlying theory is broadly the same for other classes of variable star.

The principal difference is that oscillations in distant stars cannot be resolved. Because the brighter and darker sectors of the spherical harmonic cancel out, this restricts asteroseismology almost entirely to the study of low degree modes (angular degree formula_32). This makes inversion much more difficult but upper limits can still be achieved by making more restrictive assumptions.

== History ==

Solar oscillations were first observed in the early 1960s as a quasi-periodic intensity and line-of-sight velocity variation with a period of about 5 minutes. Scientists gradually realized that the oscillations might be global modes of the Sun and predicted that the modes would form clear ridges in two-dimensional power spectra. The ridges were subsequently confirmed in observations of high-degree modes in the mid 1970s, and mode multiplets of different radial orders were distinguished in whole-disc observations. At a similar time, Jørgen Christensen-Dalsgaard and Douglas Gough suggested the potential of using individual mode frequencies to infer the interior structure of the Sun. They calibrated solar models against the low-degree data finding two similarly good fits, one with low formula_30 and a corresponding low neutrino production rate formula_34, the other with higher formula_30 and formula_34; earlier envelope calibrations against high-degree frequencies preferred the latter, but the results were not wholly convincing. It was not until Tom Duvall and Jack Harvey connected the two extreme data sets by measuring modes of intermediate degree to establish the quantum numbers associated with the earlier observations that the higher-formula_30 model was established, thereby suggesting at that early stage that the resolution of the neutrino problem must lie in nuclear or particle physics.

New methods of inversion developed in the 1980s, allowing researchers to infer the profiles sound speed and, less accurately, density throughout most of the Sun, corroborating the conclusion that residual errors in the inference of the solar structure is not the cause of the neutrino problem. Towards the end of the decade, observations also began to show that the oscillation mode frequencies vary with the Sun&#x27;s magnetic activity cycle.

To overcome the problem of not being able to observe the Sun at night, several groups had begun to assemble networks of telescopes (e.g. the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network, or BiSON, and the Global Oscillation Network Group) from which the Sun would always be visible to at least one node. Long, uninterrupted observations brought the field to maturity, and the state of the field was summarized in a 1996 special issue of &quot;Science magazine&quot;. This coincided with the start of normal operations of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), which began producing high-quality data for helioseismology.

The subsequent years saw the resolution of the solar neutrino problem, and the long seismic observations began to allow analysis of multiple solar activity cycles. The agreement between standard solar models and helioseismic inversions was disrupted by new measurements of the heavy element content of the solar photosphere based on detailed three-dimensional models. Though the results later shifted back towards the traditional values used in the 1990s, the new abundances significantly worsened the agreement between the models and helioseismic inversions. The cause of the discrepancy remains unsolved and is known as the &quot;solar abundance problem&quot;.

Space-based observations by SoHO have continued and SoHO was joined in 2010 by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which has also been monitoring the Sun continuously since its operations began. In addition, ground-based networks (notably BiSON and GONG) continue to operate, providing nearly continuous data from the ground too.

<doc id="408803" wikidata="Q965768" url="?curid=408803" title="Pete Stark">
<text>Fortney Hillman &quot;Pete&quot; Stark Jr. (November 11, 1931 – January 24, 2020) was an American businessman and politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1973 to 2013. A Democrat from California, Stark&#x27;s district— during his last two decades in Congress—was in southwestern Alameda County and included Alameda, Union City, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, and Fremont (his residence during the early part of his tenure), as well as parts of Oakland and Pleasanton. At the time he left office in 2013, he was the fifth most senior Representative, as well as sixth most senior member of Congress overall. He was also the dean of California&#x27;s 53-member Congressional delegation, and the only openly atheist member of Congress.

After 2010 redistricting, Stark&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 15th district for the 2012 election. He narrowly finished first in the primary ahead of fellow Democrat Eric Swalwell, but lost to Swalwell in the general election. He was the second-longest serving U.S. Congressman, after Jack Brooks (D-Texas, 1994), to lose a general election.

== Early life, education, and banking career ==
Stark was born on November 11, 1931, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Dorothy M. () and Fortney Hillman Stark. He was of German and Swiss descent.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree in general engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953. He served in the United States Air Force from 1955 to 1957. After leaving the Air Force, Stark attended the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and received his MBA in 1960.

In 1963, Stark founded Security National Bank, based in Walnut Creek. He described it as &quot;a bank whose sole purpose was to fulfill the financial needs of working people.&quot; It was reportedly the first in the country to offer free checking. While Stark grew up as a Republican, his opposition to the Vietnam War led him to switch parties in the mid-1960s. He printed cheques with peace signs on them and placed a giant peace sign on the roof of his bank&#x27;s headquarters. In 1971, Stark was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. Stark sold his interest in the bank for millions in 1972 when he was elected to the House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1972, at the age of 41, Stark ran in the Democratic primary against 14-term incumbent U.S. Representative and octogenarian George Paul Miller of Alameda in what was then the 8th district. He won the Democratic primary with 56% of the vote, a 34-point margin. In the 1972 United States House of Representatives elections, he defeated Republican Lew Warden with 53% of the vote. He did not face another contest nearly that close until 2012, and was re-elected 18 times.

Stark was unopposed for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 election and was re-elected in the general election with 76.5% of the vote.

He faced his first Democratic challenger in 2010, and the challenger showed weakening support for Stark, gathering 16% of the primary votes without any endorsements.

In the 2012 United States House of Representatives elections, Stark&#x27;s district was renumbered as California&#x27;s 15th congressional district. Because of California&#x27;s new nonpartisan blanket primary, which allows the general election to be contested by the two highest vote-getters in the primary regardless of party affiliation, his opponent in the general election was Dublin city councilman Eric Swalwell, a fellow Democrat who was almost half a century Stark’s junior. During the campaign, the Stark campaign circulated a flyer associating Swalwell with the Tea Party movement, a characterization rejected by both the Swalwell campaign and Josh Richman of the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;. In the general election, Swalwell defeated Stark with 52% of the vote.

===Tenure===
At 40 years (as of the end of service on January 3, 2013), Stark had been the longest-serving member of Congress from California, serving continuously from January 3, 1973, through January 3, 2013. The Hayward Area Historical Society is the repository of Stark&#x27;s papers from his tenure.

===Fiscal policy===
Stark voted against the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which was supported by most House Democrats and over half of House Republicans, in part because of its cost.

Stark voted both times against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Stark strongly criticized the bank bailout legislation. He said he was &quot; one of the few members on my side of the aisle to vote against the TARP bill both times...because I believed that it rewarded the very entities that built the financial house of cards that has come crashing down.&quot;

Stark supported a 0.005% financial transaction tax applying to &quot;trades of stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, futures and options involving large-scale traders who make more than $10,000 in transactions&quot; annually. In 2010, he introduced a bill, the Investing in Our Future Act, that would create such a tax. The bill proposed using the revenue raised to invest in climate change adaptation, child care programs, and a Global Health Trust Fund to combat diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

===Health care===
Stark had a longstanding interest in health care issues and was critical of the health insurance coverage in the United States during the George W. Bush administration. With John Conyers, in April 2006, Stark brought an action against President Bush and others alleging violations of the United States Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which cut Medicaid payments. The case, &quot;Conyers v. Bush&quot;, was dismissed for lack of standing in November 2006.

In January 1985, Stark became Chairman of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee with jurisdiction over Medicare and national health insurance proposals. Over the years, he used Budget Reconciliation bills to add amendments to impact health care. An amendment to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) required many employers to offer continuation health insurance coverage in many different situations (divorce, separation from employment, etc.) Over the years, tens of millions of Americans have used this COBRA law to continue health coverage. In 1986, he led in amending that year&#x27;s budget bill to include the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to treat and stabilize persons presenting at emergency rooms with emergency conditions or in active labor, regardless of the person&#x27;s insurance status or ability to pay. In 1988, Stark introduced an &quot;Ethics in Patient Referrals Act&quot; bill concerning physician self-referrals. Some of the ideas in the bill became law as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. What is referred to as &quot;Stark I&quot; prohibited a physician referring a Medicare patient to a clinical laboratory if the physician or his/her family member has a financial interest in that laboratory. It was codified in the United States Code, Title 42, Section 1395nn (42 U.S.C. 1395nn, &quot;Limitation on certain physician referrals&quot;).

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 contained what is known as &quot;Stark II&quot; amendments to the original law. &quot;Stark II&quot; extended the &quot;Stark I&quot; provisions to Medicaid patients and to DHS other than clinical laboratory services.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued rules in the Federal Register to implement Stark Law, including a 2001 &quot;Phase I&quot; final rule, a 2004 &quot;Phase II&quot; interim final rule, and a 2007 &quot;Phase III&quot; final rule.

Over the years, Stark worked with others, notably his Republican counterpart, Bill Gradison (Ohio), and Representatives Henry Waxman, George Miller, and Senator Ted Kennedy, to advance health improvement ideas. Stark led in introducing bills to allow more people to buy into Medicare at an earlier age, to expand Medicare by allowing all infants to enroll in Medicare, and to provide a prescription drug benefit in Medicare. In his work on the Clinton health care plan of 1993, Stark developed, and continued to promote the basic ideas now part of the Affordable Care Act and in various Medicare for Americans ideas: all Americans should have good, basic health insurance; if they don&#x27;t have such coverage, they should buy it, and if they can&#x27;t afford it, they should get government subsidies to make it affordable.

In 2010, Stark&#x27;s seniority would have placed him in line for the chairmanship of the Ways and Means committee, when Charlie Rangel was forced by ethics charges to step down. However Stark only held the chairmanship for one day, as Democrats instead voted for Sander Levin to take over, due to Stark&#x27;s history of controversial remarks.

===Iraq War===

Stark was an early opponent of the Iraq War, against the resolution authorizing military force against Iraq, on October 10, 2002. In part, he said: 

In January 2003, Stark supported a reinstatement of the draft, partly in protest against the call to war but also saying, &quot;If we&#x27;re going to have these escapades, we should not do it on the backs of poor people and minorities.&quot; In October 2004, he was one of only two members of Congress to vote in favor of the Universal National Service Act of 2003 (HR 163), a bill proposing resumption of the military draft.

He did not vote for any bills to continue funding the Iraq war, but voted &#x27;present&#x27; for some. In a statement posted on his website he explained, &quot;Despite my utmost respect for my colleagues who crafted this bill, I can&#x27;t in good conscience vote to continue this war. Nor, however, can I vote &#x27;No&#x27; and join those who think today&#x27;s legislation goes too far toward withdrawal. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making the difficult decision to vote &#x27;present&#x27;.&quot;

===Atheism===
Stark was the first openly atheist member of Congress, as announced by the Secular Coalition for America. Stark acknowledged that he was an atheist in response to an SCA questionnaire sent to public officials in January 2007.

On September 20, 2007, Stark reaffirmed that he was an atheist by making a public announcement in front of the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, the Harvard Law School Heathen Society, and various other atheist, agnostic, secular, humanist, and nonreligious groups. The American Humanist Association named him 2008 Humanist of the Year, and he served on the AHA Advisory Board. On February 9, 2011, Stark introduced a bill to Congress designating February 12, 2011, as Darwin Day; this was a collaboration between Stark and the American Humanist Association. The resolution states, &quot;Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific advancement ... and around which to build a global celebration of science and humanity.&quot;

In 2011, he and eight other lawmakers voted to reject the existing national motto, “In God We Trust.&quot; The next year, Eric Swalwell, his challenger in the Democratic primary campaign, criticized him for this vote.

Stark served on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America.

==Controversies==
===Controversial statements===
In 1991, he singled out &quot;Jewish colleagues&quot; for blame for the Gulf War, claiming they voted for it &quot;as a matter of convenience&quot; to help Israel and referring to Congressman Stephen Solarz of New York, who co-sponsored the Gulf War Authorization Act, as &quot;Field Marshal Solarz in the pro-Israel forces&quot;.

In 1995, during a private meeting with Congresswoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, he called Johnson a &quot;whore for the insurance industry&quot; and suggested that her knowledge of health care came solely from &quot;pillow talk&quot; with her husband, a physician. His press secretary, Caleb Marshall, defended him in saying, &quot;He didn&#x27;t call her a &#x27;whore&#x27;, he called her a &#x27;whore of the insurance industry.&#x27;&quot;

In a 2001 Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health hearing on abstinence promotion, he referred to Congressman J. C. Watts of Oklahoma as &quot;the current Republican Conference Chairman, whose children were all born out of wedlock.&quot;

In 2003, when Stark was told to &quot;shut up&quot; by Congressman Scott McInnis of Colorado during a Ways and Means Committee meeting due to Stark&#x27;s belittling of the chairman, Bill Thomas of California, he replied, &quot;You think you are big enough to make me, you little wimp? Come on. Come over here and make me, I dare you. You little fruitcake.&quot;

In a 2008 interview with documentarian Jan Helfeld, Stark stated that the size of the national debt is a reflection of the nation&#x27;s wealth. When pressed if the nation should take on more debt in order to have more wealth, Stark threatened Helfeld: &quot;You get the fuck out of here or I&#x27;ll throw you out the window.&quot;

On August 27, 2009, Stark suggested that his moderate Democratic colleagues were &quot;brain dead&quot; for proposing changes to the America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 being considered by Congress. During a conference call, Stark said that they: 

During a town hall meeting in September 2009, a constituent who opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health care plan told Stark, &quot;Mr. Congressman, don&#x27;t pee on my leg and tell me it&#x27;s raining.&quot; Stark responded with, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t dignify you by peeing on your leg. It wouldn&#x27;t be worth wasting the urine.&quot;

====2007 debate====
On October 18, 2007, Stark made the following comments on the House floor during a debate with Congressman Joe Barton of Texas: 

Following the initial criticism to his statements, when asked by a radio station if he would take back any of his statements, Stark responded &quot;Absolutely not. I may have dishonored the Commander-in-Chief, but I think he&#x27;s done pretty well to dishonor himself without any help from me.&quot; The same day, his office also issued a press release, saying in part: &quot;I have nothing but respect for our brave men and women in uniform and wish them the very best. But I respect neither the Commander-in-Chief who keeps them in harms way nor the chickenhawks in Congress who vote to deny children health care”.

Five days later, on October 23, after the House voted down a censure resolution against Stark sponsored by Minority Leader John Boehner, he said: 

===Real estate taxes===
Stark bought a $1.7 million waterfront home in Harwood, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in 1988, and spent most of his time there in the latter part of his congressional tenure. However, he continued to claim a house in Fremont as his official residence, and visited his Bay Area district twice a month. Following his retirement from public office, he remained in Maryland.

For two years, in 2007 and 2008, Stark allegedly claimed the Harwood house as his primary residence, claiming a homestead exemption that reduced his real estate taxes by $3,853. Under Maryland law, to qualify, the owner must register to vote and drive in Maryland; Stark was registered in California despite living in Maryland for two-thirds of the year. The United States House Committee on Ethics began an investigation and in January 2010, it voted unanimously to clear Stark of any wrongdoing.

==Death==
Stark died at his home in Harwood, Maryland, on January 24, 2020, at the age of 88, from leukemia. His successor in Congress, Eric Swalwell, issued a statement:

<doc id="408815" wikidata="Q291193" url="?curid=408815" title="Anna Eshoo">
<text>Anna A. Eshoo ( ; née Georges; born December 13, 1942) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 2025. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 18th district from 2013 to 2023, is based in Silicon Valley, including the cities of Redwood City, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Palo Alto, as well as part of San Jose. Eshoo is the only Assyrian-American in Congress and the only Armenian American woman in Congress. On November 21, 2023, she announced she would not seek re-election in 2024.

== Early life and education ==
Anna Eshoo was born in New Britain, Connecticut, of Assyrian and Armenian heritage. Her mother had fled from Armenia to Iraq, and subsequently to the United States. Her father, Fred Georges, a jeweler and watchmaker, was a Chaldean Christian.

Eshoo graduated from New Britain High School in 1960, and later moved to California. She received an Associate of Arts degree in English from Cañada College in 1975.

==Early political career==
Eshoo was Chair of the San Mateo Democratic Party from 1978 to 1982. She was also a member of the Democratic National Committee in the 1980s. She was chief of staff to Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; Leo McCarthy of the California State Assembly in 1981–82. Eshoo was elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors in 1982 and served until 1992. She was president of the board in 1986.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
===Elections===

====1988====
In the middle of Eshoo&#x27;s second term on the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, she ran for Congress in California&#x27;s 12th congressional district. She won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 43%, but lost the general election to Republican Stanford law professor Tom Campbell, 51–46%.

====1992====
Campbell gave up his congressional seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate, and Eshoo entered the Democratic primary for the open seat, which had been renumbered as the 14th district. She won the seven-way primary with a plurality of 40%.

In the general election, she defeated the Republican nominee, San Mateo County Supervisor Tom Huening, 57%–39%.

====1994====
She survived the Republican Revolution, winning reelection with 61% of the vote.

====2008====

She won reelection against Republican Ronny Santana, 70–22%.

====2010====

She won reelection against Republican Dave Chapman, 69–28%.

====2012====

After redistricting, Eshoo ran for and won reelection in California&#x27;s 18th congressional district based in San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties.

====2014====

After a bitter race that brought to the fore some dissatisfaction over party leadership, regarded as a proxy battle between Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi, Eshoo lost a party vote to Frank Pallone for ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Nancy Pelosi had said Eshoo&#x27;s elevation to the top Democratic spot on that committee would be important for the Democrats, allowing Eshoo &quot;to tap into lucrative fundraising interests in Silicon Valley and elsewhere that the committee has jurisdiction.&quot;

====2016====
====2018====
====2020====

Eshoo beat challenger Rishi Kumar in the Democratic primary and was reelected in the general election.

==== 2022 ====

Eshoo beat challenger Rishi Kumar in a rematch.

===Tenure===

In 2003, Eshoo was elected by her Democratic colleagues in the 108th Congress as an At-Large Democratic Whip, and she has served in that position to the present.

On January 30, 2008, Eshoo formally endorsed U.S. Senator Barack Obama for president.

Eshoo voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time in the 117th Congress, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis. This results in a Biden Plus/Minus score of +0.4.

====Abortion====

Eshoo opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. In 2024, she signed an amicus brief to the consolidated cases of Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States urging the Supreme Court to uphold the right to medical abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).

==== Biodefense ====
On July 16, 2018, Eshoo introduced H.R. 6378, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA), along with Representative Susan Brooks, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, and Ranking Member Frank Pallone. The September 11 attacks and the deadly anthrax attacks that followed motivated Eshoo and former Representative Richard Burr to create the original PAHPA law, which coordinated responses to public health emergencies and developed medical countermeasures.

H.R. 6378 improves preparedness nationwide and response for public health emergencies by speeding up research and development on medical countermeasures. The bill also focuses on the needs of special populations such as seniors, the disabled, and children.

In March 2018, Eshoo and Brooks launched the Congressional Biodefense Caucus. Within a week, 21 members of Congress had joined. The caucus is &quot;dedicated to strengthening our nation&#x27;s biodefense enterprise and national security.&quot; It will focus on chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats and pandemic outbreaks.

====Campaign finance reform====
Eshoo&#x27;s bill to require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to publicly disclose their last 10 federal tax returns was included in the For the People Act. She has said, &quot;The For the People Act is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to restore the faith and function of American democracy&quot;.

====Energy policy====

Eshoo has voted in favor of bills that expand the creation of jobs in renewable energy. She has also supported energy tax credits for companies that use alternative, non-carbon fuel sources. More recently, she has expressed support for the continued funding of research into fusion power. She is also a supporter of Green New Deal policies and is a co-sponsor of the House resolutions calling for Green New Deal legislation as an effort to combat climate change.

In February 2023, Eshoo, along with Representatives Randy Weber (), Lizzie Fletcher (), Nancy Mace (), Abigail Spanberger (), and Don Davis (), introduced the Reinvesting in Shoreline Economies and Ecosystems Act, which aims to share federal offshore wind power revenue with states for coastal protection and restoration work. The bill was also introduced in the Senate.

====Health care====
Eshoo worked on the Affordable Care Act and was present during its signing. She believes in adding a public option to the Act to achieve universal health insurance.

====Human rights====
Eshoo is a strong supporter of the gay rights movement. In 1992, when a gay-bashing mailer was directed at Supervisor Tom Nolan (the first openly gay supervisor in San Mateo and her opponent for her congressional seat), Eshoo stood fast in defending him, his record and years of service. She opposed the Marriage Protection Amendment and the Marriage Protection Act. Her website called the bill &quot;discriminatory, singling out for the first time a minority to prevent their interests from being considered by the highest courts in the land.&quot;

As one of just two Assyrian members of Congress, Eshoo has worked hard to protect indigenous Assyrian Christians in Iraq from continuing religious persecution and political exclusion. She authored an amendment to H.R. 2601, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, stating that &quot;special attention should be paid to the welfare of Chaldo-Assyrians and other indigenous Christians in Iraq.&quot;

Eshoo has been a strong supporter of the congressional resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide. She also supports closer ties between Armenia and the U.S.

Eshoo has fought strongly against certain provisions of the Patriot Act, particularly Section 215 (Access to Business Records), which gives federal investigators the right to obtain any tangible business record without a subpoena.

Eshoo also introduced &quot;Kevin&#x27;s law,&quot; which would have given the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat.

As an Assyrian and Armenian American, Eshoo is co-chair and co-founder of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus. She also serves on the Board of Advisors of The Institute on Religion and Public Policy, a freedom of religion organization.

In August 2024, Eshoo called on the Food and Drug Administration to scrutinize clinical trials conducted in the People&#x27;s Republic of China for threats to intellectual property and forced participation using the Uyghur people.

====Immigration====
Eshoo has worked to create a legal &quot;pathway to citizenship&quot; for foreign workers of all kinds, from doctors and computer programmers to migrant farm workers. She has voted to increase the annual cap on H-1B visas to allow more temporary foreign professionals to work in the United States (especially those with Master&#x27;s Degrees or higher).

In California, where as much as 90% of the agricultural workforce is composed of undocumented immigrants, Eshoo cosponsored H.R. 371, the Agricultural Jobs Act, which would confer blue-card status on undocumented immigrants who had worked an agricultural job in the United States for 150 days or more. This bill never became law.

====Infrastructure====
Eshoo has expressed support for President Biden&#x27;s American Jobs Plan, calling it &quot;a visionary proposal to create millions of good-paying jobs while revitalizing America&#x27;s infrastructure&quot; that &quot;will bring the U.S. into the 21st century.&quot;

====Taxes====
Eshoo voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and has expressed support for repealing the SALT deduction cap, which she views as an unfair burden on the middle class.

====National security====
On July 29, 2015, Eshoo co-introduced H.R. 3299, the Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act of 2015, which would streamline government decisions and provide incentives for vaccines and treatment of dangerous pathogens and diseases. Eshoo co-sponsored the legislation with lead sponsor Rep. Susan Brooks in response to an October 2015 report by the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense.

Other legislation includes:
* H.R. 1275, American Dream Act, cosponsor – Allows states to provide tuition to students that are illegal immigrants, provided they meet certain criteria.
* H.R. 1379, Citizen Promotion Act, cosponsor – Assists lawfully admitted aliens in becoming permanent citizens of the United States.
* H.R. 2221, Uniting American Families Act, cosponsor – Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include &quot;or permanent partner&quot; where spouse occurs.

====Technology====
Eshoo authored two bills authorizing electronic signatures that became law, The Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 (GPEA) and ESIGN. She also introduced controversial legislation to alleviate the proliferation of unsolicited email, known as spam. The U.S. House of Representatives passed The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (S. 877), which authorizes a &quot;Do Not Spam&quot; list, regulates commercial email, and imposes fines on spammers. Eshoo authored the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act of 2001 (H.R. 237), created a program to provide discounts to schools and libraries for Internet access, and authored the Computer Donation Incentive Act.

Eshoo introduced HR 2428, the Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2009. The bill would require new federal road projects to include plastic conduits buried along the side of the roadway, and enough of them to &quot;accommodate multiple broadband providers.&quot; &quot;According to industry experts, more than half of the cost of new broadband deployment is attributable to the expense of tearing up and repaving roads,&quot; Eshoo said. &quot;By putting the broadband conduit in place while the ground beneath the roadways is exposed, we will enable any authorized communications provider to come in later and install fiber-optic cable at far less cost.&quot; The bill is supported by Google.

Together with Rep. Ed Markey, Eshoo introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009, which would make Net Neutrality the law.

Eshoo is co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, a bipartisan group of over 150 members of the House and Senate working to educate their colleagues about the promise and potential of the Internet.

Eshoo supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes. The FCC would have to act more transparently as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations. Eshoo expected Senate support for the bill, saying that they &quot;shouldn&#x27;t find it menacing&quot; and arguing that the bill was &quot;about the functioning of the FCC in the 21st century.&quot;

In 2022, Eshoo, Representative Jan Schakowsky, and Senator Cory Booker&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet/BSAA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act (BSAA).&lt;ref name=&quot;vice/akv7nz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Maggio, CEO and founder of React LLC, called the BSAA &quot;rife with loopholes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiceworks/guest/surveillance-advertising&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The act was tabled. According to PC Magazine, some browsers with some extensions can block some surveillance and some advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcmag/online-ads-proposed-bill&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Wassily Wassilyevich Leontief (; August 5, 1905 – February 5, 1999), was a Soviet-American economist known for his research on input–output analysis and how changes in one economic sector may affect other sectors.

Leontief won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1973, and four of his doctoral students have also been awarded the prize (Paul Samuelson 1970, Robert Solow 1987, Vernon L. Smith 2002, Thomas Schelling 2005).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wassily Leontief was born on August 5, 1905, in Munich, German Empire, the son of Wassily W. Leontief (professor of Economics) and Zlata (German spelling &quot;Slata&quot;; later Evgenia) Leontief (née Becker). Wassily Leontief Sr. belonged to a family of Russian old-believer merchants living in St. Petersburg since 1741. Evgenia (Genya) Becker belonged to a wealthy Jewish family from Odessa. At 15 in 1921, Wassily Jr. entered Petrograd State University in present-day St. Petersburg. He earned his Learned Economist degree (equivalent to Master of Arts) in 1925 at the age of 19.

===Opposition in USSR===
Leontief sided with campaigners for academic autonomy, freedom of speech and in support of Pitirim Sorokin. As a consequence, he was detained several times by the Cheka. In 1925, he was allowed to leave the USSR, mostly because the Cheka believed that he was mortally ill with a sarcoma, a diagnosis that later proved false. He continued his studies at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin and, in 1928, earned a Ph.D. degree in economics under the direction of Werner Sombart, writing his dissertation on &quot;The Economy as Circular Flow&quot; (original German title: &quot;Die Wirtschaft als Kreislauf&quot;).

===Early professional life===
From 1927 to 1930, he worked at the Institute for the World Economy of the University of Kiel. There he researched the derivation of statistical demand and supply curves. In 1929, he traveled to China to assist its ministry of railroads as an advisor.

In 1931, he went to the United States and was employed by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

During World War II, Leontief served as consultant at the U. S. Office of Strategic Services.

===Harvard===
Leontief joined Harvard University&#x27;s department of economics in 1932 and in 1946 became professor of economics there.

In 1949, Leontief used an early computer at Harvard and data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to divide the U.S. economy into 500 sectors. Leontief modeled each sector with a linear equation based on the data and used the computer, the Harvard Mark II, to solve the system, one of the first significant uses of computers for mathematical modeling, along with George W. Snedecor&#x27;s usage of the Atanasoff–Berry computer.

Leontief set up the Harvard Economic Research Project in 1948 and remained its director until 1973. Starting in 1965, he chaired the Harvard Society of Fellows.

===New York University===
In 1975, Leontief joined New York University and founded and directed the Institute for Economic Analysis. He taught graduate and undergraduate classes.

==Personal life==
In 1932, Leontief married the poet Estelle Marks (1908-2005). Their only child, Svetlana Leontief Alpers, was born in 1936. Estelle wrote a memoir, &quot;Genia and Wassily&quot;, of their relations with his parents after they came to the US as émigrés.

As hobbies Leontief enjoyed fly fishing, ballet, and fine wines. He vacationed for years at his farm in West Burke, Vermont, but after moving to New York in the 1970s moved his summer residence to Lakeville, Connecticut.

Leontief died in New York City on Friday, February 5, 1999, at the age of 93.

==Major contributions==
Leontief is credited with developing early contributions to input–output analysis and earned the Nobel Prize in Economics for his development of its associated theory. He has also made contributions in other areas of economics, such as international trade where he documented the Leontief paradox. He was also one of the first to establish the composite commodity theorem.

Leontief earned the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on input–output tables. Input–output tables analyze the process by which inputs from one industry produce outputs for consumption or for inputs for another industry. With the input–output table, one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of input–output analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. Input–output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to Google&#x27;s PageRank.

Leontief used input–output analysis to study the characteristics of trade flow between the U.S. and other countries, and found what has been named Leontief&#x27;s paradox; &quot;this country resorts to foreign trade in order to economize its capital and dispose of its surplus labor, rather than vice versa&quot;, i.e., U.S. exports were relatively labor-intensive when compared to U.S. imports. This is the opposite of what one would expect, considering the fact that the U.S.&#x27;s comparative advantage was in capital-intensive goods. According to some economists, this paradox has since been explained as due to the fact that when a country produces &quot;more than two goods, the abundance of capital relative to labor does not imply that the capital intensity of its exports should exceed that of imports.&quot;

Leontief was also a very strong proponent of the use of quantitative data in the study of economics. Throughout his life Leontief campaigned against &quot;theoretical assumptions and non-observed facts&quot;. According to Leontief, too many economists were reluctant to &quot;get their hands dirty&quot; by working with raw empirical facts. To that end, Wassily Leontief did much to make quantitative data more accessible, and more indispensable, to the study of economics.

<text>Spitalul de Urgenţă, literally &quot;Emergency Hospital&quot;, is a Romanian rock band, integrating elements of traditional Romanian music into a sometimes hard-edged rock sound, although also incorporating influences as diverse as Balkan folk music, European classical music, and cartoon soundtrack music.

The group was formed 2000 in Bucharest. &quot;Spitalul de Urgenţă&quot; is also the Romanian title of the American television show &quot;ER&quot;, but band leader Dan Helciug says that the name actually derived from a time they were playing a concert and &quot;all the musicians arrived injured… we looked like a band from a hospital.&quot; Helciug has now worked with quite a range of musicians and continues to release music in this style under the name &quot;Spitalul de Urgenţă&quot; more or less regardless of exactly who he is playing with. He also plays in the more rock oriented band Nod, which he describes as a blend of Rammstein, Depeche Mode and Korn.

Helciug&#x27;s lyrics often feature a bitter wit that does not lend itself to easy translation, especially because of his tendency to paraphrase (both musically and lyrically) pieces of well known traditional songs. For example, the chorus of their song &quot;Trăiască Berea&quot; (&quot;Long Live Beer&quot;) uses a phrase from a traditional song, &quot;Foaie verde şi-o lalea&quot; (&quot;Green leaf and a tulip&quot;):

:&quot;Trăiască berea in care ne-am născut&quot;
:&quot;Traiăscă berea că tare ne-a durut&quot;
:&quot;Foaie verde şi-o lalea&quot;
:&quot;Fie pâinea cât de rea&quot;
:&quot;Chiar aici in ţara ta&quot;
:&quot;Tot ţi-o fură cineva.&quot;
:::- &quot;Trăiască berea&quot;, Dan Helciug

:Long live beer in which we were born
:Long live beer, for we&#x27;ve suffered much
:Green leaf and a tulip
:However bad the bread may be
:Even here in your own country
:Someone will steal it [the bread] from you.
:::- &quot;Long live beer&quot;, Dan Helciug

The album &quot;Alcool Rafinat&quot; (&quot;Refined Alcohol&quot;, 2005) includes a number of covers and parodies including a reworking of the Judas Priest song &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; as &quot;Caut un bou&quot; (&quot;Looking for an Ox&quot;), in which a cow wanders through Bucharest looking for love, and a more straightforward translation of the Tiger Lillies&#x27; song &quot;Whore&quot; as &quot;Curva&quot;.

<doc id="408822" wikidata="Q1362697" url="?curid=408822" title="Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur">
<text>The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur (Congregationis Sororum a Domina Nostra Namurcensi) is a Catholic institute of religious sisters, founded to provide education to the poor.

The institute was founded in Amiens, France, in 1804, but the opposition of the local bishop to missions outside his diocese led to the moving of headquarters to Namur (in present-day Belgium), in 1809 (then occupied by Napoleon), from which it spread to become a worldwide organization. The Sisters now have foundations in five continents and in 20 countries.

Members of the order are identified by the post-nominal letters SNDdeN (less often SNDN or SND). These should not be confused with the School Sisters of Notre Dame (SSND) of Bavarian origin.

==Foundation==
Founders were St. Julie Billiart and Marie-Louise-Françoise Blin de Bourdon, Countess of Gézaincourt, whose name as a Sister was Mother St. Joseph. Mlle Blin de Bourdon, who had received spiritual guidance from Julie for many years, defrayed the immediate expenses of founding the Congregation.

At Amiens, August 5, 1803, they took a house in Rue Neuve. In the chapel of this house, at Mass on February 2, 1804, the two foundresses and their postulant, Catherine Duchatel of Reims, made or renewed their vow of chastity, to which they added that of devoting themselves to the Christian education of girls, further proposing to train religious teachers who would go wherever their services were requested. Victoire Leleu (Sister Anastasie) and Justine Garçon (Sister St. John) joined the institute the same year.

The Fathers of the Faith (a group founded for Jesuits during the Suppression of the Society of Jesus) who were giving missions in Amiens sent to the sisters women and girls to be prepared for the sacraments. St. Julie assisted the Fathers in the neighboring towns. In Amiens, Mother St. Joseph Blin trained the novices and sisters with the assistance of (former Jesuit) Frs. Varin, Enfantin, and Thomas (a former professor in the Sorbonne).

The first regular schools of the Sisters were opened in August 1806, with a rush of students. The urgent need of Christian education among all classes of society in France at the time, led the foundresses to modify their original plan of teaching only the poor and to open schools for the children of the rich also. A unique feature of St. Julie&#x27;s educational system was to use revenue from the Institute&#x27;s academies to defray expenses at the free schools.

The community lived under a provisional religious Rule based upon that which Saint Ignatius of Loyola wrote for the Jesuits, drawn up by Mother Julie and Fr. Varin and approved in 1805 by Jean-François de Mandolx (fr), Bishop of Amiens. A more permanent Rule was adopted in 1818 and it became the basis for various versions of the Rule until 1968. At that time a total revision occurred guided by changes at the Second Vatican Council. A later update occurred in 1984.

==Expansion==

=== Europe ===
The first branch house was established at St. Nicholas, near Ghent. This, along with Mother Julie&#x27;s five other foundations in France, were all temporary. Later and permanent foundations were made in Belgium: Namur, 1807, which became the motherhouse in 1809; Jumet, 1808; St. Hubert, 1809; Ghent, 1810; Zele, 1811; Gembloux and Andenne, 1813; Fleurus, 1814; and Liège and Dinant, 1816.

Mother St. Joseph Blin de Bourdon, the co-foundress, was elected Superior General succeeding Saint Julie. During her generalate the institute passed through the most critical period of its existence, due to the persecution of religious institutes by William of Orange-Nassau, King of the Netherlands. Some of the measures adopted to harass and destroy all teaching institutes were to compel them to remain in &quot;status quo&quot;, to hold diplomas obtained only after rigid examinations in Dutch and French by state officials, and to furnish lengthy accounts regarding convents, schools, finances, and subjects. But Mother St. Joseph&#x27;s tact and zeal for souls saved the institute. During his tour in 1829, King William visited the establishment at Namur and was so pleased that he gave the Mother General Dutch citizenship. She founded houses at Thuin, 1817; Namur Orphanage, 1823; Hospital St. Jacques, 1823; Verviers, 1827; Hospital d&#x27;Harscamp; and Bastogne, 1836 – which had been for the past thirty years a state normal school; Philippeville, 1837. The Revolution of 1830 and the assumption of the crown of Belgium by Leopold of Saxe-Gotha had put an end to petty persecutions of religious.

The most important work of Mother St. Joseph&#x27;s generalate was the compiling and collating of the Rules and Constitution of the Sisters of Notre Dame. She left an explanation of the Rules, the particular rule of each office, and the Directory and Customs. She had preserved a faithful record of all that Mother Julie had said or written on these points. She also drew up a system of instruction based upon that of St. John Baptist de La Salle for the French Brothers of the Christian Schools. Mother St. Joseph was twice re-elected superior-general, the term being at first fixed at ten years. To give greater stability to the government of the institute, a general chapter unanimously approved extension to life-tenure for the office of superior-general.

In 1819 a foundation for the Netherlands was sought by Rev. F. Wolf, S.J., but, on account of political difficulties, Mother St. Joseph could not grant it. She offered, instead, to train aspirants to the religious life. Accordingly, two came to Namur, passed their probation, made their vows, and returned to labor in their own country. This is the origin of the congregation of Sisters of Notre Dame of Amersfoort, whose mother-house is at Amersfoort, Netherlands. Later in 1850, the political situation in Europe necessitated that the Amersfoort Sisters go to Coesfeld, Germany, to train two young women, Hilligonde Wohlbring and Elizabeth Kuhling, among others, according to the rule of St. Julie. The Sisters of Notre Dame of Coesfeld spread to America where they have large schools in Cleveland, Ohio, Covington, Kentucky, Toledo, Ohio, and Thousand Oaks, California.

Mother St. Joseph died on February 9, 1838. The third superior-general was Mother Ignatius (Therese-Josephine Goethals, b. 1800; d. 1842). Her services during the persecution under King William had been invaluable. Excessive toil, however, took their toll and she died in the fourth year of her generalate, but not before she had sent the first group of sisters to America in 1840. She was succeeded by Mother Marie Therese who, on account of ill-health, resigned her office the following year.

=== Further afield ===
In 1841 Mother Constantine (Marie-Jeanne-Joseph-Collin, b. 1802, d. 1875) was elected. She governed the institute for thirty-three years. Her term of office was marked by the papal approbation of the Rule in 1844, the first mission to England in 1845, to California in 1851, and to Guatemala in 1859. Under Mother Aloysie (Therese-Joseph Mainy, b. 1817, d. 1888), fifth superior-general, the processes for the canonization of Mother Julie and Mother St. Joseph were begun in 1881; twenty houses of the institute were established – in Belgium, England, and America.

Under Aloysie&#x27;s successor, Mother Aimee de Jesus (Elodie Dullaert, b. 1825, d. 1907), the Sisters of Notre Dame, at the request of Leopold II of Belgium, took charge of the girls&#x27; schools in the Jesuit missions of the Congo Free State, where three houses were established. She also sent from England a community of eight sisters for the girls&#x27; schools in the Jesuit mission of Zambezi, Mashonaland. An academy and free school were opened later at Kronstadt, Orange River Colony, South Africa. The King of Belgium created Mother Aimee de Jesus a Knight of the Order of Leopold, and Sister Ignatia was accorded a similar honor after fourteen years of labor in the Congo. During Aimee&#x27;s generalate Mother Julie Billiart was solemnly beatified by Pius X, May 13, 1906. Mother Marie Aloysie was elected superior general in January 1908.

=== The Americas ===
In 1840 the first foundation in America was made at Cincinnati, Ohio, at the request of the Right Reverend John B. Purcell, then Bishop and later the first Archbishop of Cincinnati. Sister Louise de Gonzague was appointed superior of the eight sisters who arrived for this foundation. After firmly establishing the institute in America, failing health caused Sr. Louise&#x27;s recall to Namur, where she worked until her death in 1866. The superiors who followed Louise found themselves after 1845 in charge of other houses founded east of the Rocky Mountains. Every year the sisters were asked for in some part of the country, and the mother-house of Namur gave generously of sisters and funds until the convents in America were able to supply their own needs.

In this period fifteen houses were founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame, including Trinity College, Washington, D.C., and a provincial house and novitiate at Cincinnati, Ohio. Sister Agnes Mary (b. 1840, d. 1910) made three foundations and built the first chapel dedicated to Blessed Mother Julie in America, a beautiful Gothic structure in stone at Moylan, Pennsylvania. In 1886 Sister Julia McGroarty succeeded as superior of the order’s American houses east of the Rocky Mountains. In her 15 years as superior she founded 14 new convents, a large novitiate in Waltham, Massachusetts, and an orphanage in San Jose, California. A Connecticut province was founded and a numerous apostolates would be pursued in Baltimore.

On February 22, 1847, a colony of eight sisters under the care of Right Reverend F.N. Blanchet and Fr. Peter De Smet, S.J., left Namur to labor among the Indians of the Oregon Territory. Five years later these sisters, at the request of the Right Reverend Joseph S. Alemany, Archbishop of San Francisco, were transferred to San Jose, California. This first establishment on the Pacific Coast was followed in the course of time by ten others, which formed a separate province from Cincinnati. For thirty years Sister Marie Cornélia directed the province.

In 1851 two foundations were made in Guatemala, Central America, under government auspices and with such an outburst of welcome and esteem from the people as reads like a romance. Twenty years later the forty-one Sisters of Notre Dame laboring there were expelled by the government. And each February the Sisters remember Sister Dorothy Stang who was assassinated in Brazil in 2005, for standing with the indigenous Amazonian people in their struggle against the logging companies who took their land.

Notre Dame Health Care Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, with roots dating back to 1900, has long been a leading health care facilitator. Peace and justice work has increasingly become a part of the sisters&#x27; efforts.

=== Great Britain ===
It was through the Redemptorists that the Sisters of Notre Dame first went to England. Father de Buggenoms, a Belgian and superior of a small mission at Falmouth, felt the urgent need of schools for poor, Catholic children. He asked and obtained from the Superior of the Sisters of Notre Dame at Namur a community of six sisters, and with these he opened a small school at Penryn in Cornwall. It continued only three years, however, as the place afforded no means of subsistence for a religious house. The Redemptorists having established a second English mission at Clapham, near London, and having asked again for Sisters of Notre Dame for a school, the community of Penryn was transferred there in 1848. Through the initiative of Father Buggenoms the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, a community in the Diocese of Northampton, about fifty in number, were affiliated in 1852 to the Institute of Notre Dame, with the consent of the Bishop of Namur and Bishop of Northampton. Scarcely had the Hierarchy been re-established in England when the Government offered education to the Catholic poor. The Sisters of Notre Dame devoted themselves to this work, under the guidance of Sister Mary of St. Francis (Hon. Laura M. Petre), who was to the congregation in England what Mother St. Joseph was to the whole institute. Before her death (June 24, 1886) eighteen houses had been founded in England. By 1910 there were twenty-one.

Among these English houses is the Training College for Catholic School-Mistresses at Mount Pleasant, Liverpool, the direction of which was confided to the Sisters of Notre Dame by the government in 1856. The sisters who ran the Training College resided in what is now known as Notre Dame Catholic College in Everton valley.

At the request of the Scottish Education Department, the Sisters led by Mary Lescher opened the Dowanhill Training College for Catholic School-Mistresses at Glasgow in 1895. A second convent in Scotland opened at Dumbarton in 1910.

=== Post-Vatican II ===
Pope Paul VI canonized St. Julie Billiart in 1969. With the inspiration of the Second Vatican Council, and with ecclesiastical approval, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur updated their Constitutions in 1984. Their charism now, as then, is to make known God&#x27;s goodness. The great variety of ways they do this includes spirituality programs, legal aid, job training, and simply going around greeting people to bring them comfort and joy.

In 1992, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur established Notre Dame Mission Volunteers - AmeriCorps as a non-profit volunteer organization. In 2015 at the 175th anniversary of their arrival in the United States, the sisters there numbered 800, with an additional 400 in the South American and African missions. A video presentation of their history was made for the occasion.

The current Congregational Leader is Sister Mary Johnson. In 2011 there were about 2000 SNDdeN sisters around the world.

<text>Susan Ellen &quot;Zoe&quot; Lofgren ( ; born December 21, 1947) is an American politician and lawyer serving as a U.S. representative from California. A member of the Democratic Party, Lofgren is in her 15th term in Congress, having been first elected in 1994. Lofgren has long served on the House Judiciary Committee, and chaired the House Administration Committee in the 116th and 117th Congresses.

Lofgren was the 16th district&#x27;s first female U.S. representative, before part of the district was redistricted into the 19th congressional district. She currently represents the 18th district, which covers much of Santa Clara County, including Gilroy, Morgan Hill, and most of San Jose. Representing a district covering much of Silicon Valley, Lofgren has been noted for her activity in tech-related policy areas such as net neutrality and digital surveillance.

==Early life, education and career==
Lofgren was born in San Mateo, California, the daughter of Mary Violet, a school cafeteria employee, and Milton R. Lofgren, a beer truck driver. Her grandfather was Swedish. Lofgren attended Gunn High School (1966) in Palo Alto, and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the Junior State of America, a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization. She earned her B.A. degree in political science from Stanford University in 1970 and her Juris Doctor degree from Santa Clara University School of Law in 1975.

After graduating from Stanford, Lofgren worked as a staffer for Congressman Don Edwards. She served on the House Judiciary Committee when the committee prepared articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in 1973.

In 1978, Lofgren married John Marshall Collins. Returning to San Jose, she worked in Don Edwards&#x27;s district office while earning her J.D. degree. After two years as partner at a San Jose immigration law firm, she was elected to the board of San Jose City College. In 1981, she was elected to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, representing downtown San Jose and nearby communities, where she served for 13 years.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 1994, Lofgren entered a six-way Democratic primary in what was then the 16th district, when Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. The district, then as now, is a Democratic stronghold, and it was understood that whoever won the Democratic primary would be only the second person to represent this district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th district from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993, the 16th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013). A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor Tom McEnery, by just over 1,100 votes. She breezed to victory in November, and has been reelected every two years since with no substantive opposition.

During the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections, Lofgren&#x27;s campaign paid approximately $350,000 to two businesses her husband operates: Collins and Day and John Marshall Collins P.C. over a six-year period to support campaign efforts.

===Tenure===

Lofgren chairs the 46-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In 2007, she co-sponsored the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, which the ACLU characterized as &quot;legislating against thought&quot;. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the Secure Communities deportation program.

Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the House Ethics Committee. In doing so, she presided over a rare sanction of censure, against longtime member Charles B. Rangel. In 2009, Lofgren was appointed and served as an impeachment manager in the impeachment trial of Judge Samuel B. Kent. In 2010, Lofgren was appointed and served as an impeachment manager (prosecutor) in the impeachment trial of Judge Thomas Porteous.

In the Stop Online Piracy Act House Judiciary Committee hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill. She has also opposed the data retention requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011).

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.

In May 2016, Lofgren was publicly reprimanded during a House Judiciary Committee hearing after calling witness Gail Heriot of the United States Commission on Civil Rights an &quot;ignorant bigot&quot; because Heriot&#x27;s written testimony before the hearing had suggested that calling oneself a female does not cause one to be a female. Following the oral warning from acting committee chairman Steve King, Lofgren responded, &quot;I cannot allow that kind of bigotry to go into the record unchallenged&quot;.

In January 2020, Lofgren was selected as one of seven impeachment managers who presented the impeachment case against President Donald Trump during his first trial before the United States Senate. This marked her third time serving as an impeachment manager.

As of October 2021, Lofgren had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Science, Space, and Technology (Ranking Member)
**As Ranking Member of the committee, Rep. Lofgren is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in all subcommittee meetings, per the committee&#x27;s rules.
* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet
** Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement
** Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust

===Caucuses===
* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (Associate member, former)
* Congressional Progressive Caucus (former)
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Afterschool Caucuses
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Congressional Solar Caucus
* Congressional Freethought Caucus
* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus
* Medicare for All Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption

==Political positions==

===Abortion===

Lofgren is pro-choice and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America, an organization that advocates for abortion rights and tracks congressional records on the topic. In 2013, she was chosen as the lead House Democrat to argue against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would have banned abortions after the mother was 20 weeks pregnant. Lofgren said, &quot;Passage of the bill is wrong. It&#x27;s the wrong policy for the freedom of American women.&quot; She opposed the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, calling it &quot;a bleak day&quot; and vowing to keep abortion safe and accessible in California.

=== Tech policy ===
Lofgren, whose district covers much of Silicon Valley, has been noted for her activity in tech industry regulation and privacy policy. In 2012, she was one of two Democrats in Congress to oppose the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s (FTC) then-ongoing antitrust probe of Google. Lofgren criticized the European Commission&#x27;s decision to fine Google $2.7 billion in 2017 over alleged anti-competitive behavior, arguing that the fine was &quot;unfair to the U.S. companies participating in European markets&quot;.

In 2013, in the wake of the prosecution and subsequent suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz (who used a script to download scholarly research articles in excess of what JSTOR terms of service allowed), Lofgren introduced a bill, &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Law&quot; (, ) to exclude terms of service violations from the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and from the wire fraud statute. By May 2014, Aaron&#x27;s Law had stalled in committee. Brian Knappenberger, author of a documentary on Swartz, alleges this occurred due to Oracle Corporation&#x27;s financial interest in maintaining the status quo.

In 2021, Lofgren opposed a series of bipartisan proposals aiming to &quot;break up&quot; Big Tech companies through antitrust enforcement. Alongside a group of other members of the California congressional delegation, she criticized the &quot;antitrust package&quot; due to concerns about its impact on the U.S. tech industry. Following allegations that Lofgren&#x27;s opposition to antitrust measures were potentially influenced by her daughter&#x27;s employment as a corporate counsel for Google, Lofgren was defended by colleagues Ro Khanna and Anna Eshoo, who called these criticisms &quot;ad hominem attacks&quot;.

In 2022, Lofgren was one of 16 Democrats to vote against the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2021, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

===Energy policy===

Lofgren has routinely voted for bills that would expand renewable energy investments. She believes that a clean energy infrastructure is required to curb the effects of climate change. In 2018, Lofgren co-sponsored the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. In February 2019, she co-sponsored the Green New Deal resolution (H.Res. 109).

===Health care===

Lofgren is a member of the Medicare for All Caucus and co-sponsored the legislation introduced by Representative John Conyers in 2017. She rescinded her sponsorship of a similar bill introduced by Representative Pramila Jayapal in 2019, arguing that the bill&#x27;s two-year timeline was not feasible. Lofgren continues to support a public option for health insurance, and 2021 co-sponsored Jayapal&#x27;s bill to lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60.

=== Net neutrality ===
Lofgren is a supporter of net neutrality policies to prevent internet service providers (ISPs) from engaging in data discrimination. In 2018, she signed a discharge petition to force a vote on net neutrality protections in Congress.

===2024 presidential nominee===
On July 19, 2024, Lofgren called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.

<doc id="408840" wikidata="Q2991747" url="?curid=408840" title="Origins of the American Civil War">
<text>The origins of the American Civil War were rooted in the desire of the Southern states to preserve the institution of slavery. Historians in the 21st century overwhelmingly agree on the centrality of slavery in the conflict. They disagree on which aspects (ideological, economic, political, or social) were most important, and on the North&#x27;s reasons for refusing to allow the Southern states to secede. The pseudo-historical Lost Cause ideology denies that slavery was the principal cause of the secession, a view disproven by historical evidence, notably some of the seceding states&#x27; own secession documents. After leaving the Union, Mississippi issued a declaration stating, &quot;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery—the greatest material interest of the world.&quot;

== Slavery ==

=== Slavery Disputes ===
The principal political battle leading to Southern secession was over whether slavery would expand into the Western territories destined to become states. Initially Congress had admitted new states into the Union in pairs, one slave and one free. This had kept a sectional balance in the Senate but not in the House of Representatives, as free states outstripped slave states in numbers of eligible voters. Thus, at mid-19th century, the free-versus-slave status of the new territories was a critical issue, both for the North, where anti-slavery sentiment had grown, and for the South, where the fear of slavery&#x27;s abolition had grown. Another factor leading to secession and the formation of the Confederacy was the development of white Southern nationalism in the preceding decades. The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union, a cause based on American nationalism. In addition, &quot;Republicans did not believe that the Constitution allowed them to wage a war for any &#x27;purpose&#x27; other than the restoration of the Union&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;from the very beginning they insisted that slavery was the cause of the rebellion and emancipation an appropriate and ultimately indispensable means of suppressing it&quot;.

Background factors in the run up to the Civil War were partisan politics, abolitionism, nullification versus secession, Southern and Northern nationalism, expansionism, economics, and modernization in the antebellum period. As a panel of historians emphasized in 2011, &quot;while slavery and its various and multifaceted discontents were the primary cause of disunion, it was disunion itself that sparked the war.&quot;

=== Failed Attempts To Keep the Peace ===
In the interest of maintaining unity, politicians had mostly moderated opposition to slavery, resulting in numerous compromises such as the Missouri Compromise of 1820 under the presidency of James Monroe. After the Mexican–American War of 1846 to 1848, the issue of slavery in the new territories led to the Compromise of 1850. While the compromise averted an immediate political crisis, it did not permanently resolve the issue of the Slave Power (the power of slaveholders to control the national government on the slavery issue). Part of the Compromise of 1850 was the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required Northerners to assist Southerners in reclaiming fugitive slaves, which many Northerners found to be extremely offensive.

Amid the emergence of increasingly virulent and hostile sectional ideologies in national politics, the collapse of the old Second Party System in the 1850s hampered politicians&#x27; efforts to reach yet another compromise. The compromise that was reached (the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act) outraged many Northerners and led to the formation of the Republican Party, the first major party that was almost entirely Northern-based. The industrializing North and agrarian Midwest became committed to the economic ethos of free-labor industrial capitalism.

Arguments that slavery was undesirable for the nation had long existed, and early in U.S. history were made even by some prominent Southerners. After 1840, abolitionists denounced slavery as not only a social evil but also a moral wrong. Activists in the new Republican Party, usually Northerners, had another view: They believed the Slave Power conspiracy was controlling the national government with the goal of extending slavery and limiting access to good farm land to rich slave owners. Southern defenders of slavery, for their part, increasingly came to contend that black people benefited from slavery.

== 1860 Presidential Election ==
Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election. His victory triggered declarations of secession by seven slave states of the Deep South, all of whose riverfront or coastal economies were based on cotton that was cultivated by slave labor. They formed the Confederate States of America after Lincoln was elected in November 1860 but before he took office in March 1861. Nationalists in the North and &quot;Unionists&quot; in the South refused to accept the declarations of secession. No foreign government ever recognized the Confederacy. The U.S. government, under President James Buchanan, refused to relinquish its forts that were in territory claimed by the Confederacy. The war itself began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces bombarded the Union&#x27;s Fort Sumter, in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina.

==Differences In Population==
By the mid-19th century the United States had become a nation of two distinct regions. The free states in New England, the Northeast, and the Midwest had a rapidly growing economy based on family farms, industry, mining, commerce, and transportation, with a large and rapidly growing urban population. Their growth was fed by a high birth rate and large numbers of European immigrants, especially from Ireland and Germany. The South was dominated by a settled plantation system based on slavery; there was some rapid growth taking place in the Southwest (e.g., Texas), based on high birth rates and high migration from the Southeast; there was also immigration by Europeans, but in much smaller number. The heavily rural South had few cities of any size, and little manufacturing except in border areas such as St. Louis and Baltimore. Slave owners controlled politics and the economy, although about 75% of white Southern families owned no slaves.

Overall, the Northern population was growing much more quickly than the Southern population, which made it increasingly difficult for the South to dominate the national government. By the time the 1860 election occurred, the heavily agricultural Southern states as a group had fewer Electoral College votes than the rapidly industrializing Northern states. Abraham Lincoln was able to win the 1860 presidential election without even being on the ballot in ten Southern states. Southerners felt a loss of federal concern for Southern pro-slavery political demands, and their continued domination of the federal government was threatened. This political calculus provided a very real basis for Southerners&#x27; worry about the relative political decline of their region, due to the North growing much faster in terms of population and industrial output.

==Historical tensions and compromises==

===Early Republic===

At the time of the American Revolution, the institution of slavery was firmly established in the American colonies. It was most important in the six southern states from Maryland to Georgia, but the total of a half million slaves were spread out through all of the colonies. In the South, 40 percent of the population was made up of slaves, and as Americans moved into Kentucky and the rest of the southwest, one-sixth of the settlers were slaves. By the end of the Revolutionary War, the New England states provided most of the American ships that were used in the foreign slave trade, while most of their customers were in Georgia and the Carolinas.

During this time many Americans found it easy to reconcile slavery with the Bible, but a growing number rejected this defense of slavery. A small antislavery movement, led by the Quakers, appeared in the 1780s, and by the late 1780s all of the states had banned the international slave trade. No serious national political movement against slavery developed, largely due to the overriding concern over achieving national unity. When the Constitutional Convention met, slavery was the one issue &quot;that left the least possibility of compromise, the one that would most pit morality against pragmatism.&quot; In the end, many would take comfort in the fact that the word &quot;slavery&quot; never occurs in the Constitution. The three-fifths clause was a compromise between those (in the North) who wanted no slaves counted, and those (in the South) who wanted all the slaves counted. The Constitution (Article IV, section 4) also allowed the federal government to suppress domestic violence, a provision that could be used against slave revolts. Congress could not ban the importation of slaves for 20 years. The need for the approval of three-fourths of the states for amendments made the constitutional abolition of slavery virtually impossible.

The importation of slaves into the United States was restricted in 1794, and finally banned in 1808, the earliest date the Constitution permitted (Article 1, section 9). Many Americans believed that the passage of these laws had finally resolved the issue of slavery in the United States. Any national discussion that might have continued over slavery was drowned out by other issues such as trade embargoes, maritime competition with Great Britain and France, the Barbary Wars, and the War of 1812. A notable exception to this quiet regarding slavery was the New Englanders&#x27; association of their frustration with the war with their resentment of the three-fifths clause that seemed to allow the South to dominate national politics.

During the aftermath of the American Revolution (1775–1783), the Northern states (north of the Mason–Dixon line separating Maryland from Pennsylvania and Delaware) abolished slavery by 1804, although in some states older slaves were turned into indentured servants who could not be bought or sold. In the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, Congress (at that time under the Articles of Confederation) barred slavery from the Midwestern territory north of the Ohio River. When Congress organized the territories acquired through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, there was no ban on slavery.

===Missouri Compromise===
With the admission of Alabama as a slave state in 1819, the U.S. was equally divided, with 11 slave states and 11 free states. Later that year, Congressman James Tallmadge Jr. of New York initiated an uproar in the South when he proposed two amendments to a bill admitting Missouri to the Union as a free state. The first would have barred slaves from being moved to Missouri, and the second would have freed at age 25 all Missouri slaves born after admission to the Union. The admission of the new state of Missouri as a slave state would give the slave states a majority in the Senate, while passage of the Tallmadge Amendment would give the free states a majority.

The Tallmadge amendments passed the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate when five Northern senators voted with all the Southern senators. The question was now the admission of Missouri as a slave state, and many leaders shared Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s fear of a crisis over slaverya fear that Jefferson described as &quot;a fire bell in the night&quot;. The crisis was solved by the Missouri Compromise, in which Massachusetts agreed to cede control over its relatively large, sparsely populated and disputed exclave, the District of Maine. The compromise allowed Maine to be admitted to the Union as a free state at the same time that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. The Compromise also banned slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of the state of Missouri along parallel 36°30′ north. The Missouri Compromise quieted the issue until its limitations on slavery were repealed by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854.

In the South, the Missouri crisis reawakened old fears that a strong federal government could be a fatal threat to slavery. The Jeffersonian coalition that united southern planters and northern farmers, mechanics and artisans in opposition to the threat presented by the Federalist Party had started to dissolve after the War of 1812. It was not until the Missouri crisis that Americans became aware of the political possibilities of a sectional attack on slavery, and it was not until the mass politics of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s administration that this type of organization around this issue became practical.

===Nullification crisis===
The American System, advocated by Henry Clay in Congress and supported by many nationalist supporters of the War of 1812 such as John C. Calhoun, was a program for rapid economic modernization featuring protective tariffs, internal improvements at federal expense, and a national bank. The purpose was to develop American industry and international commerce. Since iron, coal, and water power were mainly in the North, this tax plan was doomed to cause rancor in the South, where economies were agriculture-based. Southerners claimed it demonstrated favoritism toward the North.
The nation suffered an economic downturn throughout the 1820s, and South Carolina was particularly affected. The highly protective Tariff of 1828 (called the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot; by its detractors), designed to protect American industry by taxing imported manufactured goods, was enacted into law during the last year of the presidency of John Quincy Adams. Opposed in the South and parts of New England, the expectation of the tariff&#x27;s opponents was that with the election of Andrew Jackson the tariff would be significantly reduced.

By 1828 South Carolina state politics increasingly organized around the tariff issue. When the Jackson administration failed to take any actions to address their concerns, the most radical faction in the state began to advocate that the state declare the tariff null and void within South Carolina. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and his vice-president John C. Calhoun, the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification through his 1828 &quot;South Carolina Exposition and Protest&quot;.

Congress enacted a new tariff in 1832, but it offered the state little relief, resulting in the most dangerous sectional crisis since the Union was formed. Some militant South Carolinians even hinted at withdrawing from the Union in response. The newly elected South Carolina legislature then quickly called for the election of delegates to a state convention. Once assembled, the convention voted to declare null and void the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 within the state. President Andrew Jackson responded firmly, declaring nullification an act of treason. He then took steps to strengthen federal forts in the state.

Violence seemed a real possibility early in 1833 as Jacksonians in Congress introduced a &quot;Force Bill&quot; authorizing the President to use the federal Army and Navy in order to enforce acts of Congress. No other state had come forward to support South Carolina, and the state itself was divided on its willingness to continue the showdown with the federal government. The crisis ended when Clay and Calhoun worked to devise a compromise tariff. Both sides later claimed victory. Calhoun and his supporters in South Carolina claimed a victory for nullification, insisting that it had forced the revision of the tariff. Jackson&#x27;s followers, however, saw the episode as a demonstration that no single state could assert its rights by independent action.

Calhoun, in turn, devoted his efforts to building up a sense of Southern solidarity so that when another standoff should come, the whole section might be prepared to act as a bloc in resisting the federal government. As early as 1830, in the midst of the crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slavesthe foundation of the plantation agricultural systemas the chief southern minority right being threatened:

On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote of this idea, &quot;the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and Southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question.&quot;

The issue appeared again after 1842&#x27;s Black Tariff. A period of relative free trade followed 1846&#x27;s Walker Tariff, which had been largely written by Southerners. Northern industrialists (and some in western Virginia) complained it was too low to encourage the growth of industry.

===Gag Rule debates===
From 1831 to 1836 William Lloyd Garrison and the American Anti-Slavery Society initiated a campaign to petition Congress to end slavery in the District of Columbia and all federal territories. Hundreds of thousands of petitions were sent, with the number reaching a peak in 1835.

The House passed the Pinckney Resolutions on May 26, 1836. The first of these stated that Congress had no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states and the second that it &quot;ought not&quot; do so in the District of Columbia. The third resolution, known from the beginning as the &quot;gag rule&quot;, provided that:

The first two resolutions passed by votes of 182 to 9 and 132 to 45. The gag rule, supported by Northern and Southern Democrats as well as some Southern Whigs, was passed with a vote of 117 to 68.

Former President John Quincy Adams, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1830, became an early and central figure in the opposition to the gag rules. He argued that they were a direct violation of the First Amendment right &quot;to petition the Government for a redress of grievances&quot;. A majority of Northern Whigs joined the opposition. Rather than suppress anti-slavery petitions, however, the gag rules only served to offend Americans from Northern states, and dramatically increase the number of petitions.

Since the original gag was a resolution, not a standing House Rule, it had to be renewed every session, and the Adams&#x27; faction often gained the floor before the gag could be imposed. However, in January 1840, the House of Representatives passed the Twenty-first Rule, which prohibited even the reception of anti-slavery petitions and was a standing House rule. Now the pro-petition forces focused on trying to revoke a standing rule. The Rule raised serious doubts about its constitutionality and had less support than the original Pinckney gag, passing only by 114 to 108. Throughout the gag period, Adams&#x27; &quot;superior talent in using and abusing parliamentary rules&quot; and skill in baiting his enemies into making mistakes, enabled him to evade the rule and debate the slavery issues. The gag rule was finally rescinded on December 3, 1844, by a strongly sectional vote of 108 to 80, all the Northern and four Southern Whigs voting for repeal, along with 55 of the 71 Northern Democrats.

===Antebellum South and the Union===
There had been a continuing contest between the states and the national government over the power of the latterand over the loyalty of the citizenryalmost since the founding of the republic. The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798, for example, had defied the Alien and Sedition Acts, and at the Hartford Convention, New England voiced its opposition to President James Madison and the War of 1812, and discussed secession from the Union.

====Southern culture====
Although a minority of free Southerners owned slaves, free Southerners of all classes nevertheless defended the institution of slaverythreatened by the rise of free labor abolitionist movements in the Northern statesas the cornerstone of their social order.

Per the 1860 census, the percentage of slaveholding families was as follows:
* 26% in the 15 Slave states (AL, AR, DE, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, MO, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA)
* 16% in the 4 Border states (DE, KY, MD, MO)
* 31% in the 11 Confederate states (AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA)
* 37% in the first 7 Confederate states (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, SC, TX)
* 25% in the second 4 Confederate states (AR, NC, TN, VA)

Mississippi was the highest at 49%, followed by South Carolina at 46%

Based on a system of plantation slavery, the social structure of the South was far more stratified and patriarchal than that of the North. In 1850 there were around 350,000 slaveholders in a total free Southern population of about six million. Among slaveholders, the concentration of slave ownership was unevenly distributed. Perhaps around 7 percent of slaveholders owned roughly three-quarters of the slave population. The largest slaveholders, generally owners of large plantations, represented the top stratum of Southern society. They benefited from economies of scale and needed large numbers of slaves on big plantations to produce cotton, a highly profitable labor-intensive crop.

Per the 1860 Census, in the 15 slave states, slaveholders owning 30 or more slaves (7% of all slaveholders) owned approximately 1,540,000 slaves (39% of all slaves).(PDF p. 64/1860 Census p. 247)

In the 1850s, as large plantation owners outcompeted smaller farmers, more slaves were owned by fewer planters. Yet poor whites and small farmers generally accepted the political leadership of the planter elite. Several factors helped explain why slavery was not under serious threat of internal collapse from any move for democratic change initiated from the South. First, given the opening of new territories in the West for white settlement, many non-slaveowners also perceived a possibility that they, too, might own slaves at some point in their life.
Second, small free farmers in the South often embraced racism, making them unlikely agents for internal democratic reforms in the South. The principle of white supremacy, accepted by almost all white Southerners of all classes, made slavery seem legitimate, natural, and essential for a civilized society. Racial discrimination was completely legal. White racism in the South was sustained by official systems of repression such as the slave codes and elaborate codes of speech, behavior, and social practices illustrating the subordination of blacks to whites. For example, the &quot;slave patrols&quot; were among the institutions bringing together southern whites of all classes in support of the prevailing economic and racial order. Serving as slave &quot;patrollers&quot; and &quot;overseers&quot; offered white Southerners positions of power and honor in their communities. Policing and punishing blacks who transgressed the regimentation of slave society was a valued community service in the South, where the fear of free blacks threatening law and order figured heavily in the public discourse of the period.

Third, many yeomen and small farmers with a few slaves were linked to elite planters through the market economy. In many areas, small farmers depended on local planter elites for vital goods and services, including access to cotton gins, markets, feed and livestock, and even loans (since the banking system was not well developed in the antebellum South). Southern tradesmen often depended on the richest planters for steady work. Such dependency effectively deterred many white non-slaveholders from engaging in any political activity that was not in the interest of the large slaveholders. Furthermore, whites of varying social class, including poor whites and &quot;plain folk&quot; who worked outside or in the periphery of the market economy (and therefore lacked any real economic interest in the defense of slavery) might nonetheless be linked to elite planters through extensive kinship networks. Since inheritance in the South was often unequitable (and generally favored eldest sons), it was not uncommon for a poor white person to be perhaps the first cousin of the richest plantation owner of his county and to share the same militant support of slavery as his richer relatives. Finally, there was no secret ballot at the time anywhere in the United Statesthis innovation did not become widespread in the U.S. until the 1880s. For a typical white Southerner, this meant that casting a ballot against the wishes of the establishment meant running the risk of being socially ostracized.

Thus, by the 1850s, Southern slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike felt increasingly encircled psychologically and politically in the national political arena because of the rise of free soilism and abolitionism in the Northern states. Increasingly dependent on the North for manufactured goods, for commercial services, and for loans, and increasingly cut off from the flourishing agricultural regions of the Northwest, they faced the prospects of a growing abolitionist movement in the North.

Historian William C. Davis disputes that Southern culture was different from that of Northern states or that it was a cause of the war, stating, &quot;Socially and culturally the North and South were not much different. They prayed to the same deity, spoke the same language, shared the same ancestry, sang the same songs. National triumphs and catastrophes were shared by both.&quot; Davis argues that slavery, not culture, was the cause of the war: &quot;For all the myths they would create to the contrary, the only significant and defining difference between them was slavery, where it existed and where it did not, for by 1804 it had virtually ceased to exist north of Maryland. Slavery demarked not just their labor and economic situations, but power itself in the new republic.&quot;

====Militant defense of slavery====
With the outcry over developments in Kansas strong in the North, defenders of slaveryincreasingly committed to a way of life that abolitionists and their sympathizers considered obsolete or immoralarticulated a militant pro-slavery ideology that would lay the groundwork for secession upon the election of a Republican president. Southerners waged a vitriolic response to political change in the North. Slaveholding interests sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse &quot;hostile&quot; and &quot;ruinous&quot; legislation. Behind this shift was the growth of the cotton textile industry in the North and in Europe, which left slavery more important than ever to the Southern economy.

====Abolitionism====
Southern spokesmen greatly exaggerated the power of abolitionists, looking especially at the great popularity of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), the novel and play by Harriet Beecher Stowe (whom Abraham Lincoln reputedly called &quot;the little woman that started this great war&quot;). They saw a vast growing abolitionist movement after the success of &quot;The Liberator&quot; in 1831 by William Lloyd Garrison. The fear was a race war by blacks that would massacre whites, especially in counties where whites were a small minority.

The South reacted with an elaborate intellectual defense of slavery. J. D. B. De Bow of New Orleans established &quot;De Bow&#x27;s Review&quot; in 1846, which quickly grew to become the leading Southern magazine, warning about the dangers of depending on the North economically. &quot;De Bow&#x27;s Review&quot; also emerged as the leading voice for secession. The magazine emphasized the South&#x27;s economic inequality, relating it to the concentration of manufacturing, shipping, banking and international trade in the North. Searching for Biblical passages endorsing slavery and forming economic, sociological, historical and scientific arguments, slavery went from being a &quot;necessary evil&quot; to a &quot;positive good&quot;. Dr. John H. Van Evrie&#x27;s book &quot;Negroes and Negro slavery: The First an Inferior Race: The Latter Its Normal Condition&quot;setting out the arguments the title would suggestwas an attempt to apply scientific support to the Southern arguments in favor of race-based slavery.

Latent sectional divisions suddenly activated derogatory sectional imagery which emerged into sectional ideologies. As industrial capitalism gained momentum in the North, Southern writers emphasized whatever aristocratic traits they valued (but often did not practice) in their own society: courtesy, grace, chivalry, the slow pace of life, orderly life and leisure. This supported their argument that slavery provided a more humane society than industrial labor. In his &quot;Cannibals All!&quot;, George Fitzhugh argued that the antagonism between labor and capital in a free society would result in &quot;robber barons&quot; and &quot;pauper slavery&quot;, while in a slave society such antagonisms were avoided. He advocated enslaving Northern factory workers, for their own benefit. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, denounced such Southern insinuations that Northern wage earners were fatally fixed in that condition for life. To Free Soilers, the stereotype of the South was one of a diametrically opposite, static society in which the slave system maintained an entrenched anti-democratic aristocracy.

====Southern fears of modernization====
According to historian James M. McPherson, exceptionalism applied not to the South but to the North after the North ended slavery and launched an industrial revolution that led to urbanization, which in turn led to increased education, which led to various reform movements, especially abolitionism, gaining strength. The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North (and the fact that most immigrants viewed slavery with disfavor), compounded by the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South&#x27;s defensive-aggressive political behavior. The &quot;Charleston Mercury&quot; wrote that on the issue of slavery the North and South &quot;are not only two Peoples, but they are rival, hostile Peoples.&quot; As &quot;De Bow&#x27;s Review&quot; said, &quot;We are resisting revolution... We are not engaged in a Quixotic fight for the rights of man... We are conservative.&quot;

Allan Nevins argued that the Civil War was an &quot;irrepressible&quot; conflict, adopting a phrase from Senator William H. Seward. Nevins synthesized contending accounts emphasizing moral, cultural, social, ideological, political, and economic issues. In doing so, he brought the historical discussion back to an emphasis on social and cultural factors. Nevins pointed out that the North and the South were rapidly becoming two different peoples, a point made also by historian Avery Craven. At the root of these cultural differences was the problem of slavery, but fundamental assumptions, tastes, and cultural aims of the regions were diverging in other ways as well. More specifically, the North was rapidly modernizing in a manner some perceived as threatening to the South. Historian McPherson explains:

 When secessionists protested in 1861 that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values, they were correct. They fought to preserve their constitutional liberties against the perceived Northern threat to overthrow them. The South&#x27;s concept of republicanism had not changed in three-quarters of a century; the North&#x27;s had. ... The ascension to power of the Republican Party, with its ideology of competitive, egalitarian free-labor capitalism, was a signal to the South that the Northern majority had turned irrevocably towards this frightening, revolutionary future.

Harry L. Watson has synthesized research on antebellum southern social, economic, and political history. Self-sufficient yeomen, in Watson&#x27;s view, &quot;collaborated in their own transformation&quot; by allowing promoters of a market economy to gain political influence. Resultant &quot;doubts and frustrations&quot; provided fertile soil for the argument that southern rights and liberties were menaced by Black Republicanism.

J. Mills Thornton III explained the viewpoint of the average white Alabamian. Thornton contends that Alabama was engulfed in a severe crisis long before 1860. Deeply held principles of freedom, equality, and autonomy, as expressed in Republican values, appeared threatened, especially during the 1850s, by the relentless expansion of market relations and commercial agriculture. Alabamians were thus, he judged, prepared to believe the worst once Lincoln was elected.

===Sectional tensions and the emergence of mass politics===
The politicians of the 1850s were acting in a society in which the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional conflict in the 1820s and 1850sthe most important of which being the stability of the two-party systemwere being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and a time in which politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics was, in one of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.
Historian Allan Nevins, for instance, writes of political rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women. Voter turnouts even ran as high as 84% by 1860. An abundance of new parties emerged 1854–56, including the Republicans, People&#x27;s party men, Anti-Nebraskans, Fusionists, Know Nothings, Know-Somethings (anti-slavery nativists), Maine Lawites, Temperance men, Rum Democrats, Silver Gray Whigs, Hindus, Hard Shell Democrats, Soft Shells, Half Shells and Adopted Citizens. By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided four ways. Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the Constitutional Union party in 1860.

Many Southern states held constitutional conventions in 1851 to consider the questions of nullification and secession. With the exception of South Carolina, whose convention election did not even offer the option of &quot;no secession&quot; but rather &quot;no secession without the collaboration of other states&quot;, the Southern conventions were dominated by Unionists who voted down articles of secession.

===Economics===
Historians today generally agree that economic conflicts were not a major cause of the war. Though an economic basis to the sectional crisis was popular among the &quot;Progressive school&quot; of historians from the 1910s to the 1940s, few professional historians now subscribe to this explanation. According to economic historian Lee A. Craig, &quot;In fact, numerous studies by economic historians over the past several decades reveal that economic conflict was not an inherent condition of North-South relations during the antebellum era and did not cause the Civil War.&quot;

When numerous groups tried at the last minute in 1860–61 to find a compromise to avert war, they did not turn to economic policies. The three major attempts at compromise, the Crittenden Compromise, the Corwin Amendment and the Washington Peace Conference, addressed only the slavery-related issues of fugitive slave laws, personal liberty laws, slavery in the territories and interference with slavery within the existing slave states.

====Economic value of slavery to the South====
Historian James L. Huston emphasizes the role of slavery as an economic institution. In October 1860 William Lowndes Yancey, a leading advocate of secession, placed the value of Southern-held slaves at $2.8 billion (~$ in ). Huston writes:

The cotton gin greatly increased the efficiency with which cotton could be harvested, contributing to the consolidation of &quot;King Cotton&quot; as the backbone of the economy of the Deep South, and to the entrenchment of the system of slave labor on which the cotton plantation economy depended. Any chance that the South would industrialize was over.

The tendency of monoculture cotton plantings to lead to soil exhaustion created a need for cotton planters to move their operations to new lands, and therefore to the westward expansion of slavery from the Eastern seaboard into new areas (e.g., Alabama, Mississippi, and beyond to East Texas).

====Regional economic differences====
The South, Midwest, and Northeast had quite different economic structures. They traded with each other and each became more prosperous by staying in the Union, a point many businessmen made in 1860–61. However, Charles A. Beard in the 1920s made a highly influential argument to the effect that these differences caused the war (rather than slavery or constitutional debates). He saw the industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the agrarian Midwest against the plantation South. Critics challenged his image of a unified Northeast and said that the region was in fact highly diverse with many different competing economic interests. In 1860–61, most business interests in the Northeast opposed war.

After 1950, only a few mainstream historians accepted the Beard interpretation, though it was accepted by libertarian economists. Historian Kenneth Stampp, who abandoned Beardianism after 1950, sums up the scholarly consensus: &quot;Most historians ... now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united.&quot;

====Free labor vs. pro-slavery arguments====
Historian Eric Foner argued that a free-labor ideology dominated thinking in the North, which emphasized economic opportunity. By contrast, Southerners described free labor as &quot;greasy mechanics, filthy operators, small-fisted farmers, and moonstruck theorists&quot;. They strongly opposed the homestead laws that were proposed to give free farms in the west, fearing the small farmers would oppose plantation slavery. Indeed, opposition to homestead laws was far more common in secessionist rhetoric than opposition to tariffs. Southerners such as Calhoun argued that slavery was &quot;a positive good&quot;, and that slaves were more civilized and morally and intellectually improved because of slavery.
Karl Marx, developing his economic theories in the mid-19th century, expressed a class-based view of conditions in North America in 1861, believing &quot;that the defeat of the &#x27;slave-holding aristocracy&#x27; would enable the world&#x27;s free workers to prosper as small landholders on America&#x27;s endless frontier&quot;.

===Religious conflict over the slavery question===
Led by Mark Noll, a body of scholarship has argued that the American debate over slavery became a shooting war in part because the two sides reached diametrically opposite conclusions based on reading the same authoritative source of guidance on moral questions: the King James Version of the Bible.

After the American Revolution and the disestablishment of government-sponsored churches, the U.S. experienced the Second Great Awakening, a massive Protestant revival. Without centralized church authorities, American Protestantism was heavily reliant on the Bible, which was read in the standard 19th-century Reformed hermeneutic of &quot;common sense&quot;, literal interpretation as if the Bible were speaking directly about the modern American situation instead of events that occurred in a much different context, millennia ago. By the mid-19th century this form of religion and Bible interpretation had become a dominant strand in American religious, moral and political discourse, almost serving as a de facto state religion.

The Bible, interpreted under these assumptions, seemed to clearly suggest that slavery was Biblically justified:

The pro-slavery South could point to slaveholding by the godly patriarch Abraham (Gen 12:5; 14:14; 24:35–36; 26:13–14), a practice that was later incorporated into Israelite national law (Lev 25:44–46). It was never denounced by Jesus, who made slavery a model of discipleship (Mk 10:44). The Apostle Paul supported slavery, counseling obedience to earthly masters (Eph 6:5–9; Col 3:22–25) as a duty in agreement with &quot;the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness&quot; (1 Tim 6:3). Because slaves were to remain in their present state unless they could win their freedom (1 Cor 7:20–24), he sent the fugitive slave Onesimus back to his owner Philemon (Phlm 10–20). The abolitionist north had a difficult time matching the pro-slavery south passage for passage. ... Professor Eugene Genovese, who has studied these biblical debates over slavery in minute detail, concludes that the pro-slavery faction clearly emerged victorious over the abolitionists except for one specious argument based on the so-called Curse of Ham (Gen 9:18–27). For our purposes, it is important to realize that the South won this crucial contest with the North by using the prevailing hermeneutic, or method of interpretation, on which both sides agreed. So decisive was its triumph that the South mounted a vigorous counterattack on the abolitionists as infidels who had abandoned the plain words of Scripture for the secular ideology of the Enlightenment.

Protestant churches in the U.S., unable to agree on what God&#x27;s Word said about slavery, ended up with schisms between Northern and Southern branches: the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1844, the Baptists in 1845, and the Presbyterian Church in 1857. These splits presaged the subsequent split in the nation: &quot;The churches played a major role in the dividing of the nation, and it is probably true that it was the splits in the churches which made a final split of the nation inevitable.&quot; The conflict over how to interpret the Bible was central:

The theological crisis occasioned by reasoning like [conservative Presbyterian theologian James H.] Thornwell&#x27;s was acute. Many Northern Bible-readers and not a few in the South &quot;felt&quot; that slavery was evil. They somehow &quot;knew&quot; the Bible supported them in that feeling. Yet when it came to using the Bible as it had been used with such success to evangelize and civilize the United States, the sacred page was snatched out of their hands. Trust in the Bible and reliance upon a Reformed, literal hermeneutic had created a crisis that only bullets, not arguments, could resolve.

The result:

The question of the Bible and slavery in the era of the Civil War was never a simple question. The issue involved the American expression of a Reformed literal hermeneutic, the failure of hermeneutical alternatives to gain cultural authority, and the exercise of deeply entrenched intuitive racism, as well as the presence of Scripture as an authoritative religious book and slavery as an inherited social-economic relationship. The Northforced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to createlost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self-consciousness to determine what the Bible said about slavery. For the history of theology in America, the great tragedy of the Civil War is that the most persuasive theologians were the Rev. Drs. William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant.

There were many causes of the Civil War, but the religious conflict, almost unimaginable in modern America, cut very deep at the time. Noll and others highlight the significance of the religion issue for the famous phrase in Lincoln&#x27;s second inaugural: &quot;Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other.&quot;

===The territorial crisis and the United States Constitution===
Between 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase (Louisiana Purchase), negotiation (Adams–Onís Treaty, Oregon Treaty), and conquest (the Mexican Cession). Of the states carved out of these territories by 1845, all had entered the union as slave states: Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, and Texas, as well as the southern portions of Alabama and Mississippi. With the conquest of northern Mexico, including California, in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to the institution flourishing in these lands as well. Southerners also anticipated annexing as slave states Cuba (see Ostend Manifesto), Mexico, and Central America (see Golden Circle (proposed country)). Northern free soil interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave soil. It was these territorial disputes that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided over.

The existence of slavery in the southern states was far less politically polarizing than the explosive question of the territorial expansion of the institution in the west. Moreover, Americans were informed by two well-established readings of the Constitution regarding human bondage: that the slave states had complete autonomy over the institution within their boundaries, and that the domestic slave tradetrade among the stateswas immune to federal interference. The only feasible strategy available to attack slavery was to restrict its expansion into the new territories. Slaveholding interests fully grasped the danger that this strategy posed to them. Both the South and the North believed: &quot;The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.&quot;

By 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories, and they all claimed to be sanctioned by the Constitution, implicitly or explicitly. Two of the &quot;conservative&quot; doctrines emphasized the written text and historical precedents of the founding document, while the other two doctrines developed arguments that transcended the Constitution.

One of the &quot;conservative&quot; theories, represented by the Constitutional Union Party, argued that the historical designation of free and slave apportionments in territories should become a Constitutional mandate. The Crittenden Compromise of 1860 was an expression of this view.

The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balancethat slavery could be excluded altogether in a territory at the discretion of Congresswith one caveat: the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment must apply. In other words, Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The Wilmot Proviso announced this position in 1846.

Of the two doctrines that rejected federal authority, one was articulated by northern Democrat of Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas, and the other by southern Democratic Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and Senator John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky.

Douglas devised the doctrine of territorial or &quot;popular&quot; sovereignty, which declared that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to establish or disestablish slaverya purely local matter. Congress, having created the territory, was barred, according to Douglas, from exercising any authority in domestic matters. To do so would violate historic traditions of self-government, implicit in the US Constitution. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 legislated this doctrine.

The fourth in this quartet is the theory of state sovereignty (&quot;states&#x27; rights&quot;), also known as the &quot;Calhoun doctrine&quot; after the South Carolinian political theorist and statesman John C. Calhoun. Rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the federal union under the US Constitutionand not merely as an argument for secession. The basic premise was that all authority regarding matters of slavery in the territories resided in each state. The role of the federal government was merely to enable the implementation of state laws when residents of the states entered the territories. Calhoun asserted that the federal government in the territories was only the agent of the several sovereign states, and hence incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. State sovereignty, in other words, gave the laws of the slaveholding states &quot;extra-jurisdictional&quot; effect.

&quot;States&#x27; rights&quot; was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority. As historian Thomas L Krannawitter points out, &quot;[T]he Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power.&quot;

By 1860, these four doctrines comprised the major ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery, the territories and the US Constitution. As a practical matter, however, slavery was practically defunct in the territories by 1860. The 1860 census showed: Utah Territory (controlled by Mormons) had 29 slaves; Nebraska had 15; Kansas had 2 (it was abolished there in early 1861 with statehood). There were no slaves in the other territories of Colorado, Washington, Nevada, New Mexico and Dakota, and none in the new states of California &amp; Oregon. See 1860 United States census#Population of U.S. states and territories. See also History of slavery in Nebraska, .History of slavery in Kansas, and History of slavery in Utah.

==Abolitionism==

Antislavery movements in the North gained momentum in the 1830s and 1840s, a period of rapid transformation of Northern society that inspired a social and political reformism. Many of the reformers of the period, including abolitionists, attempted in one way or another to transform the lifestyle and work habits of labor, helping workers respond to the new demands of an industrializing, capitalistic society.

Antislavery, like many other reform movements of the period, was influenced by the legacy of the Second Great Awakening, a period of religious revival in the new country stressing the reform of individuals, which was still relatively fresh in the American memory. Thus, while the reform spirit of the period was expressed by a variety of movements with often-conflicting political goals, most reform movements shared a common feature in their emphasis on the Great Awakening principle of transforming the human personality through discipline, order, and restraint.

&quot;Abolitionist&quot; had several meanings at the time. The followers of William Lloyd Garrison, including Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass, demanded the &quot;immediate abolition of slavery&quot;, hence the name. A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, including Theodore Weld and Arthur Tappan, wanted immediate action, but that action might well be a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage. &quot;Antislavery men&quot;, like John Quincy Adams, did what they could to limit slavery, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841 Adams represented the Amistad African slaves in the Supreme Court of the United States and argued that they should be set free. In the last years before the war, &quot;antislavery&quot; could mean the Northern majority, like Abraham Lincoln, who opposed &quot;expansion&quot; of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians. James M. McPherson explains the abolitionists&#x27; deep beliefs: &quot;All people were equal in God&#x27;s sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God&#x27;s children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution.&quot;

Stressing the Yankee Protestant ideals of self-improvement, industry, and thrift, most abolitionistsmost notably William Lloyd Garrisoncondemned slavery as a lack of control over one&#x27;s own destiny and the fruits of one&#x27;s labor. Wendell Phillips, one of the most ardent abolitionists, attacked the Slave Power and presaged disunion as early as 1845:

 The experience of the fifty years ... shows us the slaves trebling in numbersslaveholders monopolizing the offices and dictating the policy of the Governmentprostituting the strength and influence of the Nation to the support of slavery here and elsewheretrampling on the rights of the free States, and making the courts of the country their tools. To continue this disastrous alliance longer is madness. ... Why prolong the experiment?

Abolitionists also attacked slavery as a threat to the freedom of white Americans. Defining freedom as more than a simple lack of restraint, antebellum reformers held that the truly free man was one who imposed restraints upon himself. Thus, for the anti-slavery reformers of the 1830s and 1840s, the promise of free labor and upward social mobility (opportunities for advancement, rights to own property, and to control one&#x27;s own labor), was central to the ideal of reforming individuals.

Controversy over the so-called Ostend Manifesto (which proposed the U.S. annexation of Cuba as a slave state) and the Fugitive Slave Act kept sectional tensions alive before the issue of slavery in the West could occupy the country&#x27;s politics in the mid-to-late 1850s.

Antislavery sentiment among some groups in the North intensified after the Compromise of 1850, when Southerners began appearing in Northern states to pursue fugitives or often to claim as slaves free African Americans who had resided there for years. Meanwhile, some abolitionists openly sought to prevent enforcement of the law. Violation of the Fugitive Slave Act was often open and organized. In Bostona city from which it was boasted that no fugitive had ever been returnedTheodore Parker and other members of the city&#x27;s elite helped form mobs to prevent enforcement of the law as early as April 1851. A pattern of public resistance emerged in city after city, notably in Syracuse, New York, in 1851 (culminating in the Jerry Rescue incident late that year), and Boston again in 1854. But the issue did not lead to a crisis until revived by the same issue underlying the Missouri Compromise of 1820: slavery in the territories.

===Arguments for and against slavery===
William Lloyd Garrison, a prominent abolitionist, was motivated by a belief in the growth of democracy. Because the Constitution had a three-fifths clause, a fugitive slave clause, and a 20-year protection of the Atlantic slave trade, Garrison publicly burned a copy of the U.S. Constitution, and called it &quot;a covenant with death and an agreement with hell&quot;.
In 1854, he said:

The opposite opinion on slavery was expressed by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens in his &quot;Cornerstone Speech&quot;. Stephens said:

===&quot;Free soil&quot; movement===
Opposition to the 1847 Wilmot Proviso helped to consolidate the &quot;free-soil&quot; forces. In 1848 Radical New York Democrats known as Barnburners, members of the Liberty Party, and anti-slavery Whigs formed the Free-Soil Party. The party supported former President Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams Sr. for President and Vice President. The party opposed the expansion of slavery into territories where it had not yet existed, such as Oregon and the ceded Mexican territory. It had the effect of dividing the Democratic Party in the North, especially in areas of Yankee settlement.

Eric Foner in &quot;Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War&quot; (1970) emphasized the importance of free labor ideology to Northern opponents of slavery, pointing out that the moral concerns of the abolitionists were not necessarily the dominant sentiments in the North. Many Northerners (including Lincoln) opposed slavery also because they feared that rich slave owners would buy up the best lands and block opportunity for free white farmers using family and hired labor. Free Soilers joined the Republican party in 1854, with their appeal to powerful demands in the North through a broader commitment to &quot;free labor&quot; principles. Fear of the &quot;Slave Power&quot; had a far greater appeal to Northern self-interest than did abolitionist arguments based on the plight of black slaves in the South.

==Slavery question in territories acquired from Mexico==

Soon after the Mexican War started and long before negotiation of the new US-Mexico border, the question of slavery in the territories to be acquired polarized the Northern and Southern United States in the most bitter sectional conflict up to this time, which lasted for a deadlock of four years during which the Second Party System broke up, Mormon pioneers settled Utah, the California Gold Rush settled California, and New Mexico under a federal military government turned back Texas&#x27;s attempt to assert control over territory Texas claimed as far west as the Rio Grande. Eventually the Compromise of 1850 preserved the Union, but only for another decade.

Proposals included:
* The Wilmot Proviso banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas, which had been annexed the previous year. Passed by the United States House of Representatives in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later an effort to attach the proviso to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo also failed.
* Failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by William W. Wick and then Stephen Douglas extending the Missouri Compromise line (36°30′ parallel north) west to the Pacific Ocean , allowing slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, southern Nevada, and Southern California, as well as any other territories that might be acquired from Mexico. The line was again proposed by the Nashville Convention of June 1850.
* Popular sovereignty, developed by Lewis Cass and Douglas as the eventual Democratic Party position, letting each territory decide whether to allow slavery.
* William L. Yancey&#x27;s &quot;Alabama Platform&quot;, endorsed by the Alabama and Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories either by the federal government or by territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws.
* General Zachary Taylor, who became the Whig candidate in 1848 and then President from March 1849 to July 1850, proposed after becoming President that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico, but much larger than the eventual ones. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or organized territory, avoiding the question of slavery in the territories.
* The Mormons&#x27; proposal for a State of Deseret, incorporating most of the area of the Mexican Cession but excluding the large non-Mormon populations in Northern California and central New Mexico, was considered unlikely to succeed in Congress, but nevertheless in 1849 President Zachary Taylor sent his agent John Wilson westward with a proposal to combine California and Deseret as a single state, decreasing the number of new free states and the erosion of Southern parity in the Senate.

* The Compromise of 1850, proposed by Henry Clay in January 1850, guided to passage by Douglas over Northern Whig and Southern Democrat opposition, and enacted September 1850, admitted California as a free state, including Southern California, and organized Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory with slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty. Texas dropped its claim to the disputed northwestern areas in return for debt relief, and the areas were divided between the two new territories and unorganized territory. El Paso, where Texas had successfully established county government, was left in Texas. No territory dominated by Southerners (like the later short-lived Confederate Territory of Arizona) was created. Also, the slave trade was abolished in Washington, D.C. (but not slavery itself), and the Fugitive Slave Act was strengthened.

==States&#x27; rights==
States&#x27; rights was an issue in the 19th century for those who believed that the authority of the federal government was superseded by that of the individual states and had exceeded the role intended for it by the Founding Fathers of the United States. Kenneth M. Stampp notes that each section used states&#x27; rights arguments when convenient, and shifted positions when convenient. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was enacted by southern representatives to use federal authority to suppress northern states&#x27; rights. The constitution gave federal protection to slave property rights, and slaveholders demanded that this federal power should be strengthened and take precedence over northern state laws. Anti-slavery forces in northern legislatures had resisted this constitutional right in the form of state personal liberty laws that placed state laws above the federal mandate.

===States&#x27; rights and slavery===
Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. noted that the states&#x27; rights position &quot;never had any real vitality independent of underlying conditions of vast social, economic, or political significance.&quot; He elaborated:

Echoing Schlesinger, Forrest McDonald wrote that &quot;the dynamics of the tension between federal and state authority changed abruptly during the late 1840s&quot; as a result of the acquisition of territory in the Mexican War. McDonald states:

In a February 1861 speech to the Virginian secession convention, Georgian Henry L. Benning stated the reason that Georgia seceded from the Union:

===States&#x27; rights and minority rights===
States&#x27; rights theories gained strength from the awareness that the Northern population was growing much faster than that of the South, so it was only a matter of time before the North controlled the federal government. Acting as a &quot;conscious minority&quot;, Southerners hoped that a strict constructionist interpretation of the Constitution would limit federal power over the states, and that a defense of states&#x27; rights against federal encroachments or even nullification or secession would save the South. Before 1860, most presidents were either Southern or pro-South. The North&#x27;s growing population would mean the election of pro-North presidents, and the addition of free-soil states would end Southern parity with the North in the Senate. As historian Allan Nevins described Calhoun&#x27;s theory of states&#x27; rights, &quot;Governments, observed Calhoun, were formed to protect minorities, for majorities could take care of themselves.&quot;

Until the 1860 election, the South&#x27;s interests nationally were entrusted to the Democratic Party. In 1860, the Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions as the result of a &quot;bitter debate in the Senate between Jefferson Davis and Stephen Douglas&quot;. The debate was over resolutions proposed by Davis &quot;opposing popular sovereignty and supporting a federal slave code and states&#x27; rights&quot; which carried over to the national convention in Charleston.

Jefferson Davis defined equality in terms of the equal rights of states, and opposed the declaration that all men are created equal. Jefferson Davis stated that a &quot;disparaging discrimination&quot; and a fight for &quot;liberty&quot; against &quot;the tyranny of an unbridled majority&quot; gave the Confederate states a right to secede. In 1860, Congressman Laurence M. Keitt of South Carolina said, &quot;The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States.&quot;

Stampp mentioned Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, author of &quot;A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States&quot;, as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the &quot;cornerstone of the Confederacy&quot; when the war began and then later switched course by saying after the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat that the war was not about slavery but was about states&#x27; rights. Stampp said that Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the Lost Cause mythology.

Historian William C. Davis also mentioned inconsistencies in Southern states&#x27; rights arguments. He explained the Confederate Constitution&#x27;s protection of slavery at the national level as follows:

William C. Davis also stated:

Southern historian Gordon Rhea wrote in 2011 that:

==Compromise of 1850==

The victory of the United States over Mexico resulted in the addition of large new territories conquered from Mexico. Controversy over whether the territories would be slave or free raised the risk of a war between slave and free states, and Northern support for the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in the conquered territories, increased sectional tensions. The controversy was temporarily resolved by the Compromise of 1850, which allowed the territories of Utah and New Mexico to decide for or against slavery, but also allowed the admission of California as a free state, reduced the size of the slave state of Texas by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade but not slavery itself in the District of Columbia. In return, the South got a stronger fugitive slave law than the version mentioned in the US Constitution. The Fugitive Slave Law would reignite controversy over slavery.

===Fugitive Slave Law issues===
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required Northerners to assist Southerners in reclaiming fugitive slaves, which many Northerners strongly opposed. Anthony Burns was among the fugitive slaves captured and returned in chains to slavery as a result of the law. Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; greatly increased opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act.

==Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854)==

Most people thought the Compromise had ended the territorial issue, but Stephen A. Douglas reopened it in 1854. Douglas proposed the Kansas–Nebraska Bill with the intention of opening up vast new high-quality farm lands to settlement. As a Chicagoan, he was especially interested in the railroad connections from Chicago into Kansas and Nebraska, but that was not a controversial point. More importantly, Douglas firmly believed in democracy at the grass rootsthat actual settlers have the right to decide on slavery, not politicians from other states. His bill provided that popular sovereignty, through the territorial legislatures, should decide &quot;all questions pertaining to slavery&quot;, thus effectively repealing the Missouri Compromise. The ensuing public reaction against it created a firestorm of protest in the Northern states. It was seen as an effort to repeal the Missouri Compromise. However, the popular reaction in the first month after the bill&#x27;s introduction failed to foreshadow the gravity of the situation. As Northern papers initially ignored the story, Republican leaders lamented the lack of a popular response.

Eventually, the popular reaction did come, but the leaders had to spark it. Salmon P. Chase&#x27;s &quot;Appeal of the Independent Democrats&quot; did much to arouse popular opinion. In New York, William H. Seward finally took it upon himself to organize a rally against the Nebraska bill, since none had arisen spontaneously. Press such as the &quot;National Era&quot;, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, and local free-soil journals, condemned the bill. The Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858 drew national attention to the issue of slavery expansion.

==Fragmentation of the American party system==

===Founding of the Republican Party (1854)===
The American party system had been dominated by Whigs and Democrats for decades leading up to the Civil War. But the Whig party&#x27;s increasing internal divisions had made it a party of strange bedfellows by the 1850s. An ascendant anti-slavery wing clashed with a traditionalist and increasingly pro-slavery southern wing. These divisions came to a head in the 1852 election, where Whig candidate Winfield Scott was trounced by Franklin Pierce. Southern Whigs, who had supported the prior Whig president Zachary Taylor, had been burned by Taylor and were unwilling to support another Whig. Taylor, who despite being a slaveowner, had proved notably anti-slavery despite campaigning neutrally on the issue. With the loss of Southern Whig support, and the loss of votes in the North to the Free Soil Party, Whigs seemed doomed. So they were, as they would never again contest a presidential election.

The final nail in the Whig coffin was the Kansas-Nebraska act. It was also the spark that began the Republican Party, which would take in both Whigs and Free Soilers and create an anti-slavery party that the Whigs had always resisted becoming. The Act opened Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory to slavery and future admission as slave states, thus implicitly repealing the prohibition on slavery in territory north of 36° 30′ latitude that had been part of the Missouri Compromise. This change was viewed by anti-slavery Northerners as an aggressive, expansionist maneuver by the slave-owning South. Opponents of the Act were intensely motivated and began forming a new party. The Party began as a coalition of anti-slavery Conscience Whigs such as Zachariah Chandler and Free Soilers such as Salmon P. Chase.

The first anti-Nebraska local meeting where &quot;Republican&quot; was suggested as a name for a new anti-slavery party was held in a Ripon, Wisconsin schoolhouse on March 20, 1854. The first statewide convention that formed a platform and nominated candidates under the Republican name was held near Jackson, Michigan, on July 6, 1854. At that convention, the party opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates. The Midwest took the lead in forming state Republican Party tickets; apart from St. Louis and a few areas adjacent to free states, there were no efforts to organize the Party in the southern states. So was born the Republican Partycampaigning on the popular, emotional issue of &quot;free soil&quot; in the frontierwhich would capture the White House just six years later.

===&quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; and the elections of 1856===

In Kansas around 1855, the slavery issue reached a condition of intolerable tension and violence. But this was in an area where an overwhelming proportion of settlers were merely land-hungry Westerners indifferent to the public issues. The majority of the inhabitants were not concerned with sectional tensions or the issue of slavery. Instead, the tension in Kansas began as a contention between rival claimants. During the first wave of settlement, no one held titles to the land, and settlers rushed to occupy newly open land fit for cultivation. While the tension and violence did emerge as a pattern pitting Yankee and Missourian settlers against each other, there is little evidence of any ideological divides on the questions of slavery. Instead, the Missouri claimants, thinking of Kansas as their own domain, regarded the Yankee squatters as invaders, while the Yankees accused the Missourians of grabbing the best land without honestly settling on it.

However, the 1855–56 violence in &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; did reach an ideological climax after John Brownregarded by followers as the instrument of God&#x27;s will to destroy slaveryentered the melee. His assassination of five pro-slavery settlers (the so-called &quot;Pottawatomie massacre&quot;, during the night of May 24, 1856) resulted in some irregular, guerrilla-style strife. Aside from John Brown&#x27;s fervor, the strife in Kansas often involved only armed bands more interested in land claims or loot.

Of greater importance than the civil strife in Kansas, however, was the reaction against it nationwide and in Congress. In both North and South, the belief was widespread that the aggressive designs of the other section were epitomized by (and responsible for) what was happening in Kansas. Consequently, &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; emerged as a symbol of sectional controversy.

Indignant over the developments in Kansas, the Republicansthe first entirely sectional major party in U.S. historyentered their first presidential campaign with confidence. Their nominee, John C. Frémont, was a generally safe candidate for the new party. Although his nomination upset some of their Nativist Know-Nothing supporters (his mother was a Catholic), the nomination of the famed explorer of the Far West and ex-senator from California with a short political record was an attempt to woo ex-Democrats. The other two Republican contenders, William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase, were seen as too radical.

Nevertheless, the campaign of 1856 was waged almost exclusively on the slavery issuepitted as a struggle between democracy and aristocracyfocusing on the question of Kansas. The Republicans condemned the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery, but they advanced a program of internal improvements combining the idealism of anti-slavery with the economic aspirations of the North. The new party rapidly developed a powerful partisan culture, and energetic activists drove voters to the polls in unprecedented numbers. People reacted with fervor. Young Republicans organized the &quot;Wide Awake&quot; clubs and chanted &quot;Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men, Frémont!&quot; With Southern Fire-Eaters and even some moderates uttering threats of secession if Frémont won, the Democratic candidate, Buchanan, benefited from apprehensions about the future of the Union.

Millard Fillmore, the candidate of the American Party (Know-Nothings) and the Silver Gray Whigs, said in a speech at Albany, New York, that the election of a Republican candidate would dissolve the Union. Abraham Lincoln replied on July 23 in a speech at Galena, Illinois; Carl Sandburg wrote that this speech probably resembled Lincoln&#x27;s Lost Speech: &quot;This Government would be very weak, indeed, if a majority, with a disciplined army and navy, and a well-filled treasury, could not preserve itself, when attacked by an unarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. All this talk about the dissolution of the Union is humbugnothing but folly. &quot;We won&#x27;t&quot; dissolve the Union, and &quot;you shan&#x27;t&quot;.&quot;

===&quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision (1857) and the Lecompton Constitution===
The Lecompton Constitution and &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (the respondent&#x27;s name, Sanford, was misspelled in the reports) were both part of the Bleeding Kansas controversy over slavery that arose as a result of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which was Stephen Douglas&#x27; attempt to replace the Missouri Compromise&#x27;s ban on slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories with popular sovereignty, which would have allowed the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The Lecompton Constitution, which would have allowed slavery in Kansas, was the result of massive vote fraud by the pro-slavery border ruffians. Douglas defeated the Lecompton Constitution because it was supported by the minority of pro-slavery people in Kansas, and Douglas believed in majority rule. Douglas hoped that both the South and the North would support popular sovereignty, but neither did, as neither trusted Douglas.

The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; escalated the controversy. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney&#x27;s decision said that blacks were &quot;so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,&quot; and that slavery could spread into the territories even if the majority of people in the territories were anti-slavery. Lincoln warned that &quot;the next &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision&quot; could impose slavery on Northern states.

Historians agree that the decision dramatically inflamed tensions leading to the Civil War. In 2022 historian David W. Blight argued that the year 1857 was &quot;the great pivot on the road to disunion...largely because of the Dred Scott case, which stoked the fear, distrust and conspiratorial hatred already common in both the North and the South to new levels of intensity.&quot;

===Buchanan, Republicans and anti-administration Democrats===

President James Buchanan decided to end the troubles in Kansas by urging Congress to admit Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. Kansas voters, however, soundly rejected this constitution by a vote of 10,226 to 138. As Buchanan directed his presidential authority to promoting the Lecompton Constitution, he further angered the Republicans and alienated members of his own party. Prompting their break with the administration, the Douglasites saw this scheme as an attempt to pervert the principle of popular sovereignty on which the Kansas–Nebraska Act was based. Nationwide, conservatives were incensed, feeling as though the principles of states&#x27; rights had been violated. Even in the South, ex-Whigs and border state Know-Nothingsmost notably John Bell and John J. Crittenden (key figures in the event of sectional controversies)urged the Republicans to oppose the administration&#x27;s moves and take up the demand that the territories be given the power to accept or reject slavery.
As the schism in the Democratic party deepened, moderate Republicans argued that an alliance with anti-administration Democrats, especially Stephen Douglas, would be a key advantage in the 1860 elections. Some Republican observers saw the controversy over the Lecompton Constitution as an opportunity to peel off Democratic support in the border states, where Frémont picked up little support. After all, the border states had often gone for Whigs with a Northern base of support in the past without prompting threats of Southern withdrawal from the Union.

Among the proponents of this strategy was &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called on the Republicans to downplay opposition to popular sovereignty in favor of a compromise policy calling for &quot;no more slave states&quot; in order to quell sectional tensions. The &quot;Times&quot; maintained that for the Republicans to be competitive in the 1860 elections, they would need to broaden their base of support to include all voters who for one reason or another were upset with the Buchanan Administration.

Indeed, pressure was strong for an alliance that would unite the growing opposition to the Democratic Administration. But such an alliance was no novel idea; it would essentially entail transforming the Republicans into the national, conservative, Union party of the country. In effect, this would be a successor to the Whig party.

Republican leaders, however, staunchly opposed any attempts to modify the party position on slavery, appalled by what they considered a surrender of their principles when, for example, all the ninety-two Republican members of Congress voted for the Crittenden-Montgomery bill in 1858. Although this compromise measure blocked Kansas&#x27; entry into the union as a slave state, the fact that it called for popular sovereignty, instead of rejecting slavery altogether, was troubling to the party leaders.

In the end, the Crittenden-Montgomery bill did not create a grand anti-administration coalition of Republicans, ex-Whig Southerners in the border states, and Northern Democrats. Instead, the Democratic Party merely split along sectional lines. Anti-Lecompton Democrats complained that certain leaders had imposed a pro-slavery policy upon the party. The Douglasites, however, refused to yield to administration pressure. Like the anti-Nebraska Democrats, who were now members of the Republican Party, the Douglasites insisted that theynot the administrationcommanded the support of most northern Democrats.

Extremist sentiment in the South advanced dramatically as the Southern planter class perceived its hold on the executive, legislative, and judicial apparatuses of the central government wane. It also grew increasingly difficult for Southern Democrats to manipulate power in many of the Northern states through their allies in the Democratic Party.

===Honor===
Historians have emphasized that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. The idea of being treated like a second-class citizen was anathema and could not be tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.

====Assault on Sumner (1856)====

On May 19 Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner gave a long speech in the Senate entitled &quot;, which condemned the Slave Power as the evil force behind the nation&#x27;s troubles. Sumner said the Southerners had committed a &quot;crime against Kansas&quot;, singling out Senator Andrew P. Butler of South Carolina. Sumner famously cast the South Carolinian as having &quot;chosen a mistress ... who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sightI mean the harlot, slavery!&quot; According to Williamjames Hull Hoffer, &quot;It is also important to note the sexual imagery that recurred throughout the oration, which was neither accidental nor without precedent. Abolitionists routinely accused slaveholders of maintaining slavery so that they could engage in forcible sexual relations with their slaves.&quot; Three days later, Sumner, working at his desk on the Senate floor, was beaten almost to death by Congressman Preston S. Brooks, Butler&#x27;s nephew. Sumner took years to recover; he became the martyr to the antislavery cause and said that the episode proved the barbarism of slave society. Brooks was lauded as a hero upholding Southern honor. The episode further polarized North and South, strengthened the new Republican Party, and added a new element of violence on the floor of Congress.

==Emergence of Lincoln==
===Republican Party structure===
Despite their significant loss in the election of 1856, Republican leaders realized that even though they appealed only to Northern voters, they needed to win only two more states, such as Pennsylvania and Illinois, to win the presidency in 1860.

As the Democrats were grappling with their own troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused on the issue of slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it might be necessary to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.

The controversy over slavery in the West was still not creating a fixation on the issue of slavery. Although the old restraints on the sectional tensions were being eroded with the rapid extension of mass politics and mass democracy in the North, the perpetuation of conflict over the issue of slavery in the West still required the efforts of radical Democrats in the South and radical Republicans in the North. They had to ensure that the sectional conflict would remain at the center of the political debate.

William Seward contemplated this potential in the 1840s, when the Democrats were the nation&#x27;s majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country&#x27;s institutional structure and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation&#x27;s territories and to garner a great deal of influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party&#x27;s increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats&#x27; strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals of American democracy.

Republicans believed in the existence of &quot;the Slave Power Conspiracy&quot;, which had seized control of the federal government and was attempting to pervert the Constitution for its own purposes. The &quot;Slave Power&quot; idea gave the Republicans the anti-aristocratic appeal with which men like Seward had long wished to be associated politically. By fusing older anti-slavery arguments with the idea that slavery posed a threat to Northern free labor and democratic values, it enabled the Republicans to tap into the egalitarian outlook which lay at the heart of Northern society.

In this sense, during the 1860 presidential campaign, Republican orators even cast &quot;Honest Abe&quot; as an embodiment of these principles, repeatedly referring to him as &quot;the child of labor&quot; and &quot;son of the frontier&quot;, who had proved how &quot;honest industry and toil&quot; were rewarded in the North. Although Lincoln had been a Whig, the &quot;Wide Awakes&quot; (members of the Republican clubs) used replicas of rails that he had split to remind voters of his humble origins.

In almost every northern state, organizers attempted to have a Republican Party or an anti-Nebraska fusion movement on ballots in 1854. In areas where the radical Republicans controlled the new organization, the comprehensive radical program became the party policy. Just as they helped organize the Republican Party in the summer of 1854, the radicals played an important role in the national organization of the party in 1856. Republican conventions in New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois adopted radical platforms. These radical platforms in such states as Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, and Vermont usually called for the divorce of the government from slavery, the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Laws, and no more slave states, as did platforms in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Massachusetts when radical influence was high.

Conservatives at the Republican 1860 nominating convention in Chicago were able to block the nomination of William Seward, who had an earlier reputation as a radical (but by 1860 had been criticized by Horace Greeley as being too moderate). Other candidates had earlier joined or formed parties opposing the Whigs and had thereby made enemies of many delegates. Lincoln was selected on the third ballot. However, conservatives were unable to bring about the resurrection of &quot;Whiggery&quot;. The convention&#x27;s resolutions regarding slavery were roughly the same as they had been in 1856, but the language appeared less radical. In the following months, even Republican conservatives like Thomas Ewing and Edward Baker embraced the platform language that &quot;the normal condition of territories was freedom&quot;. All in all, the organizers had done an effective job of shaping the official policy of the Republican Party.

Southern slaveholding interests now faced the prospects of a Republican president and the entry of new free states that would alter the nation&#x27;s balance of power between the sections. To many Southerners, the resounding defeat of the Lecompton Constitution foreshadowed the entry of more free states into the Union. Dating back to the Missouri Compromise, the Southern region desperately sought to maintain an equal balance of slave states and free states so as to be competitive in the Senate. Since the last slave state was admitted in 1845, five more free states had entered. The tradition of maintaining a balance between North and South was abandoned in favor of the addition of more free soil states.

===Sectional battles over federal policy in the late 1850s===

====Lincoln–Douglas Debates====

The Lincoln-Douglas debates were a series of seven debates in 1858 between Stephen Douglas, United States senator from Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln, the Republican who sought to replace Douglas in the Senate. The debates were mainly about slavery. Douglas defended his Kansas–Nebraska Act, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of Missouri with popular sovereignty, which allowed residents of territories such as the Kansas to vote either for or against slavery. Douglas put Lincoln on the defensive by accusing him of being a Black Republican abolitionist, but Lincoln responded by asking Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision. Douglas&#x27; Freeport Doctrine was that residents of a territory could keep slavery out by refusing to pass a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. Douglas&#x27; Freeport Doctrine, and the fact that he helped defeat the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, made Douglas unpopular in the South, which led to the 1860 split of the Democratic Party into Northern and Southern wings. The Democrats retained control of the Illinois legislature, and Douglas thus retained his seat in the U.S. Senate (at that time senators were elected by the state legislatures, not by popular vote); however, Lincoln&#x27;s national profile was greatly raised, paving the way for his election as president of the United States two years later.

====Background====
In &quot;The Rise of American Civilization&quot; (1927), Charles and Mary Beard argue that slavery was not so much a social or cultural institution as an economic one (a labor system). The Beards cited inherent conflicts between Northeastern finance, manufacturing, and commerce and Southern plantations, which competed to control the federal government so as to protect their own interests. According to the economic determinists of the era, both groups used arguments over slavery and states&#x27; rights as a cover.

Recent historians have rejected the Beardian thesis. But their economic determinism has influenced subsequent historians in important ways. &quot;Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery&quot; (1974) by Robert William Fogel (who would win the 1993 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences) and Stanley L. Engerman, wrote that slavery was profitable and that the price of slaves would have continued to rise. Modernization theorists, such as Raimondo Luraghi, have argued that as the Industrial Revolution was expanding on a worldwide scale, the days of wrath were coming for a series of agrarian, pre-capitalistic, &quot;backward&quot; societies throughout the world, from the Italian and American South to India. But most American historians point out the South was highly developed and on average about as prosperous as the North.

====Panic of 1857 and sectional realignments====
A few historians believe that the serious financial Panic of 1857 and the economic difficulties leading up to it strengthened the Republican Party and heightened sectional tensions. Before the panic, strong economic growth was being achieved under relatively low tariffs. Hence much of the nation concentrated on growth and prosperity.

The iron and textile industries were facing acute, worsening trouble each year after 1850. By 1854, stocks of iron were accumulating in each world market. Iron prices fell, forcing many American iron mills to shut down.

Republicans urged western farmers and northern manufacturers to blame the depression on the domination of the low-tariff economic policies of southern-controlled Democratic administrations. However, the depression revived suspicion of Northeastern banking interests in both the South and the West. Eastern demand for western farm products shifted the West closer to the North. As the &quot;transportation revolution&quot; (canals and railroads) went forward, an increasingly large share and absolute amount of wheat, corn, and other staples of western producersonce difficult to haul across the Appalachianswent to markets in the Northeast. The depression emphasized the value of the western markets for eastern goods and homesteaders who would furnish markets and respectable profits.

Aside from the land issue, economic difficulties strengthened the Republican case for higher tariffs for industries in response to the depression. This issue was important in Pennsylvania and perhaps New Jersey.

====Southern response====
Meanwhile, many Southerners grumbled over &quot;radical&quot; notions of giving land away to farmers that would &quot;abolitionize&quot; the area. While the ideology of Southern sectionalism was well-developed before the Panic of 1857 by figures like J.D.B. De Bow, the panic helped convince even more cotton barons that they had grown too reliant on Eastern financial interests.

Thomas Prentice Kettell, former editor of the &quot;Democratic Review&quot;, was another commentator popular in the South to enjoy a great degree of prominence between 1857 and 1860. Kettell gathered an array of statistics in his book on &quot;Southern Wealth and Northern Profits&quot;, to show that the South produced vast wealth, while the North, with its dependence on raw materials, siphoned off the wealth of the South. Arguing that sectional inequality resulted from the concentration of manufacturing in the North, and from the North&#x27;s supremacy in communications, transportation, finance, and international trade, his ideas paralleled old physiocratic doctrines that all profits of manufacturing and trade come out of the land. Political sociologists, such as Barrington Moore, have noted that these forms of romantic nostalgia tend to arise when industrialization takes hold.

Such Southern hostility to the free farmers gave the North an opportunity for an alliance with Western farmers. After the political realignments of 1857–58manifested by the emerging strength of the Republican Party and their networks of local support nationwidealmost every issue was entangled with the controversy over the expansion of slavery in the West. While questions of tariffs, banking policy, public land, and subsidies to railroads did not always unite all elements in the North and the Northwest against the interests of slaveholders in the South under the pre-1854 party system, they were translated in terms of sectional conflictwith the expansion of slavery in the West involved.

As the depression strengthened the Republican Party, slaveholding interests were becoming convinced that the North had aggressive and hostile designs on the Southern way of life. The South was thus increasingly fertile ground for secessionism.

The Republicans&#x27; Whig-style personality-driven &quot;hurrah&quot; campaign helped stir hysteria in the slave states upon the emergence of Lincoln and intensify divisive tendencies, while Southern &quot;fire eaters&quot; gave credence to notions of the slave power conspiracy among Republican constituencies in the North and West. New Southern demands to re-open the African slave trade further fueled sectional tensions.

From the early 1840s until the outbreak of the Civil War, the cost of slaves had been rising steadily. Meanwhile, the price of cotton was experiencing market fluctuations typical of raw commodities. After the Panic of 1857, the price of cotton fell while the price of slaves continued its steep rise. At the 1858 Southern commercial convention, William L. Yancey of Alabama called for the reopening of the African slave trade. Only the delegates from the states of the Upper South, who profited from the domestic trade, opposed the reopening of the slave trade since they saw it as a potential form of competition. The convention in 1858 wound up voting to recommend the repeal of all laws against slave imports, despite some reservations.

===John Brown and Harpers Ferry (1859)===

On October 16, 1859, radical abolitionist John Brown led an attempt to start an armed slave revolt by seizing the U.S. Army arsenal at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). Brown and twenty-one followers, including whites (three of whom were Brown&#x27;s sons) and Blacks (three free Blacks, one freedman, and one fugitive slave), planned to seize the armory and use weapons stored there to arm Black slaves in order to spark a general uprising by the slave population.

Although the raiders were initially successful in cutting the telegraph line and capturing the Armory, they allowed a passing train to continue, and at the next station with a working telegraph the conductor alerted authorities to the attack. The raiders were forced by the militia and other locals to barricade themselves in the Armory, in a sturdy building later known as John Brown&#x27;s Fort. Robert E. Lee (then a colonel in the U.S. Army) led a company of U.S. Marines in storming the armory on October 18. Ten of the raiders were killed, including two of Brown&#x27;s sons; Brown himself along with a half dozen of his followers were captured; five of the raiders escaped immediate capture. Six locals were killed and nine injured; the Marines suffered one dead and one injured.

Brown was subsequently hanged by the state of Virginia for treason, murder, and inciting a slave insurrection, as were six of his followers. (See John Brown&#x27;s raiders.) The raid, trial, and execution were covered in great detail by the press, which sent reporters and sketch artists to the scene on the next train. It immediately became a cause célèbre in both the North and the South, with Brown vilified by Southerners as a bloodthirsty fanatic, but celebrated by many Northern abolitionists as a martyr to the cause of ending slavery.

===Elections of 1860===

Initially, William H. Seward of New York, Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, and Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania were the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. But Abraham Lincoln, a former one-term House member who gained fame amid the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, had fewer political opponents within the party and outmaneuvered the other contenders. On May 16, 1860, he received the Republican nomination at their convention in Chicago.

The schism in the Democratic Party over the Lecompton Constitution and Douglas&#x27; Freeport Doctrine caused Southern &quot;Fire-Eaters&quot; to oppose front runner Stephen A. Douglas&#x27; bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Douglas defeated the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas because the majority of Kansans were antislavery, and Douglas&#x27; popular sovereignty doctrine would allow the majority to vote slavery up or down as they chose. Douglas&#x27; Freeport Doctrine alleged that the antislavery majority of Kansans could thwart the Dred Scott decision that allowed slavery by withholding legislation for a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. As a result, Southern extremists demanded a slave code for the territories, and used this issue to divide the northern and southern wings of the Democratic Party. Southerners left the party and in June nominated John C. Breckinridge, while Northern Democrats supported Douglas. As a result, the Southern planter class lost a considerable measure of sway in national politics. Because of the Democrats&#x27; division, the Republican nominee faced a divided opposition. Adding to Lincoln&#x27;s advantage, ex-Whigs from the border states had earlier formed the Constitutional Union Party, nominating John C. Bell for president. Thus, party nominees waged regional campaigns. Douglas and Lincoln competed for Northern votes, while Bell, Douglas and Breckinridge competed for Southern votes.

====Result and impact of the election of 1860====
Lincoln handily won the electoral votes:
* Abraham Lincoln: 180 (40% of the popular vote)
* J.C. Breckinridge: 72 (18% of the popular vote)
* John Bell: 39 (13% of the popular vote)
* Stephen A. Douglas: 12 (30% of the popular vote)
Voting [on November 6, 1860] split sharply along sectional lines. Lincoln was elected by carrying the electoral votes of the North; he had a sweeping majority of 180 electoral votes. Given the vote count in each state, he would still have won the electoral college even if all three opponents had somehow been able to merge their tickets.

===Split in the Democratic Party===
The Alabama extremist William Lowndes Yancey&#x27;s demand for a federal slave code for the territories split the Democratic Party between North and South, which made the election of Lincoln possible. Yancey tried to make his demand for a slave code moderate enough to get Southern support and yet extreme enough to enrage Northerners and split the party. He demanded that the party support a slave code for the territories &quot;if later necessary&quot;, so that the demand would be conditional enough to win Southern support. His tactic worked, and lower South delegates left the Democratic Convention at Institute Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, and walked over to Military Hall. The South Carolina extremist Robert Barnwell Rhett hoped that the lower South would completely break with the Northern Democrats and attend a separate convention at Richmond, Virginia, but lower South delegates gave the national Democrats one last chance at unification by going to the convention at Baltimore, Maryland, before the split became permanent. The result was that John C. Breckinridge became the candidate of the Southern Democrats, and Stephen Douglas became the candidate of the Northern Democrats.

Yancey&#x27;s previous 1848 attempt at demanding a slave code for the territories was his Alabama Platform, which was in response to the Northern Wilmot Proviso attempt at banning slavery in territories conquered from Mexico. Justice Peter V. Daniel wrote a letter about the Proviso to former President Martin Van Buren: &quot;It is that view of the case which pretends to an insulting exclusiveness or superiority on the one hand, and denounces a degrading inequality or inferiority on the other; which says in effect to the Southern man, &#x27;Avaunt! you are not my equal, and hence are to be excluded as carrying a moral taint with you.&#x27; Here is at once the extinction of all fraternity, of all sympathy, of all endurance even; the creation of animosity fierce, implacable, undying.&quot; Both the Alabama Platform and the Wilmot Proviso failed, but Yancey learned to be less overtly radical in order to get more support. Southerners thought they were merely demanding equality, in that they wanted Southern property in slaves to get the same (or more) protection as Northern forms of property.

===Southern secession===

With the emergence of the Republicans as the nation&#x27;s first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the Westthe focal point of sectional tensionswas unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation&#x27;s territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But Democrats suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.

Immediately after finding out the election results, a special South Carolina convention declared &quot;that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states under the name of the &#x27;United States of America&#x27; is hereby dissolved;&quot; by February six more cotton states would follow (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas), forming the Confederate States of America. In 1960, Lipset examined the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860–61. In each state he divided the counties by the proportion of slaves, low, medium and high. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties, the vote was only 37% for secession, and in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was at 60%. Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and the incoming Lincoln administration refused to recognize the legality of secession or the legitimacy of the Confederacy. After Lincoln called for troops, four border states (that lacked cotton) seceded (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee). The Upper Southern States were in a dilemma: they wanted to retain their slaves but were afraid that if they joined with the lower southern states that were rebelling they would be caught in the middle of a conflict, and their states would be the battle ground. By staying in the Union the Upper Southern states felt that their slave rights would continue to be recognized by the Union.

===Other issues===
The tariff issue was and is sometimes citedlong after the warby Lost Cause historians and neo-Confederate apologists. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession brought up the tariff issue as a major issue. Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff, and when some did, for instance, Matthew Fontaine Maury and John Lothrop Motley, they were generally writing for a foreign audience.

The tariff in effect prior to the enactment of the Morrill Tariff of 1861 had been written and approved by the South for the benefit of the South. Complaints came from the Northeast (especially Pennsylvania) and regarded the rates as too low. Some Southerners feared that eventually the North would grow so big that it would control Congress and could raise the tariff at will.

As for states&#x27; rights, while a state&#x27;s right of revolution mentioned in the Declaration of Independence was based on the inalienable equal rights of man, secessionists believed in a modified version of states&#x27; rights that was safe for slavery.

These issues were especially important in the lower South, where 47 percent of the population were slaves. The upper South, where 32 percent of the population were slaves, considered the Fort Sumter crisisespecially Lincoln&#x27;s call for troops to march south to recapture ita cause for secession. The northernmost border slave states, where 13 percent of the population were slaves, did not secede.

==Fort Sumter==
When South Carolina seceded in December 1860, Major Robert Anderson, a pro-slavery, former slave owner from Kentucky, remained loyal to the Union. He was the commanding officer of United States Army forces in Charleston, South Carolinathe last remaining important Union post in the Deep South. Acting upon orders from the War Department to hold and defend the U.S. forts, he moved his small garrison from Fort Moultrie, which was indefensible, to the more modern, more defensible, Fort Sumter in the middle of Charleston Harbor. South Carolina leaders cried betrayal, while the North celebrated with enormous excitement at this show of defiance against secessionism. In February 1861 the Confederate States of America were formed and took charge. Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, ordered the fort be captured. The artillery attack was commanded by Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, who had been Anderson&#x27;s student at West Point. The attack began April 12, 1861, and continued until Anderson, badly outnumbered and outgunned, surrendered the fort on April 14. The battle began the American Civil War, as an overwhelming demand for war swept both the North and South, with only Kentucky attempting to remain neutral.
According to Adam Goodheart (2011), the modern meaning of the American flag was also forged in the defense of Fort Sumter. Thereafter, the flag was used throughout the North to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism.

==Historiographical debates on causes==

Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s rejection of the Crittenden Compromise, the failure to secure the ratification of the Corwin Amendment in 1861, and the inability of the Washington Peace Conference of 1861 to provide an effective alternative to Crittenden and Corwin came together to prevent a compromise that is still debated by Civil War historians. Even as the war was going on, William Seward and James Buchanan were outlining a debate over the question of inevitability that would continue among historians.

===Needless war argument===
Two competing explanations of the sectional tensions inflaming the nation emerged even before the war. The first was the &quot;Needless War&quot; argument. Buchanan believed the sectional hostility to be the accidental, unnecessary work of self-interested or fanatical agitators. He also singled out the &quot;fanaticism&quot; of the Republican Party. Seward, on the other hand, believed there to be an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces. Shelden argues that, &quot;Few scholars in the twenty-first century would call the Civil War &#x27;needless,&#x27; as the emancipation of 4 million slaves hinged on Union victory.&quot;

===Irrepressible conflict argument===
The &quot;Irrepressible Conflict&quot; argument was the first to dominate historical discussion. In the first decades after the fighting, histories of the Civil War generally reflected the views of Northerners who had participated in the conflict. The war appeared to be a stark moral conflict in which the South was to blame, a conflict that arose as a result of the designs of slave power. Henry Wilson&#x27;s &quot;History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America&quot; (1872–1877) is the foremost representative of this moral interpretation, which argued that Northerners had fought to preserve the union against the aggressive designs of &quot;slave power&quot;. Later, in his seven-volume &quot;History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 to the Civil War&quot; (1893–1900), James Ford Rhodes identified slavery as the centraland virtually onlycause of the Civil War. The North and South had reached positions on the issue of slavery that were both irreconcilable and unalterable. The conflict had become inevitable.

===Revisionists===
The idea that the war was avoidable became central among historians in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Revisionist historians, led by James G. Randall (1881–1953) at the University of Illinois, Woodrow Wilson (1856–1924) at Princeton University and Avery Craven (1885–1980) at the University of Chicago, saw in the social and economic systems of the South no differences so fundamental as to require a war. Historian Mark Neely explains their position:

Revisionism challenged the view that fundamental and irreconcilable sectional differences made the outbreak of war inevitable. It scorned a previous generation&#x27;s easy identification of the Northern cause with abolition, but it continued a tradition of hostility to the Reconstruction measures that followed the war. The Civil War became a needless conflict brought on by a blundering generation that exaggerated sectional differences between North and South. Revisionists revived the reputation of the Democratic party as great nationalists before the war and as dependable loyalists during it. Revisionism gave Lincoln&#x27;s Presidency a tragic beginning at Fort Sumter, a rancorous political setting of bitter factional conflicts between radicals and moderates within Lincoln&#x27;s own party, and an even more tragic ending. The benevolent Lincoln died at the moment when benevolence was most needed to blunt radical designs for revenge on the South.

Randall blamed the ineptitude of a &quot;blundering generation&quot; of leaders. He also saw slavery as essentially a benign institution, crumbling in the presence of 19th century tendencies. Craven, the other leading revisionist, placed more emphasis on the issue of slavery than Randall but argued roughly the same points. In &quot;The Coming of the Civil War&quot; (1942), Craven argued that slave laborers were not much worse off than Northern workers, that the institution was already on the road to ultimate extinction, and that the war could have been averted by skillful and responsible leaders in the tradition of Congressional statesmen Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. Two of the key leaders in antebellum politics, Clay and Webster, in contrast to the 1850s generation of leaders, shared a predisposition to compromises marked by a passionate patriotic devotion to the Union.

But it is possible that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of the political debate). David Herbert Donald (1920–2009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in a society in which traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.

<text>Samuel Sharon Farr (born July 4, 1941) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 17th (1993–2013) and 20th congressional districts (2013–17). He is a member of the Democratic Party. He was elected to Congress in a 1993 special election when longtime Democratic Rep. Leon Panetta resigned to become Director of the Office of Management and Budget. On November 12, 2015, he announced his retirement from Congress after the 2016 elections.

==Early life and education ==
Farr was born in San Francisco, the son of Janet Emerson (née Haskins) and Frederick Sharon &quot;Fred&quot; Farr. One of his maternal great-grandfathers was acting mayor of Los Angeles William Hartshorn Bonsall, and one of his paternal great-great-grandfathers was the brother of Nevada Senator William Sharon. He grew up in Carmel, where he still lives. His father was a California state senator from 1955 to 1967.

He was educated at Willamette University, Santa Clara University and the Monterey Institute of International Studies. Farr is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity at Willamette University.

== Early career ==

===Peace Corps service===
Farr joined the Peace Corps in 1964 and served for two years as a volunteer in Colombia. He spent his time in a poor barrio near Medellin, teaching community development skills.

While Farr was serving in Colombia, his mother died from cancer. Following her death, his father visited with Farr&#x27;s sisters. While riding horses, his sister Nancy was thrown and hit her head. She died on the operating table in a Colombian hospital.

Since his Peace Corps service ended, Farr has visited Colombia often. He went there for his honeymoon and has returned several other times for both personal and official business. During a trip in 2007, Farr spoke before the Colombian Congress and was awarded the Orden del Congreso de Colombia.

===State and local political career===
Farr&#x27;s public service career began in the California State Assembly, where he worked as a staffer on budget issues for a decade. In 1975, he ran for and won a seat on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors.

In 1980 he was elected to a seat in the Assembly, where he became a champion for the organics industry and wrote one of the country&#x27;s strictest oil-spill liability laws. He served in the Assembly until his election to Congress in 1993. 

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Farr was elected to the House of Representatives in a 1993 special election. He succeeded Leon Panetta, who resigned to become President Bill Clinton&#x27;s budget director. Farr defeated Republican Bill McCampbell with 52 percent of the vote, and then was elected to his first full term in 1994, defeating McCampbell again with 52 percent of the vote. Both contests were the closest in the district since Panetta claimed the seat for the Democrats in 1977, and to date are the only times since then that a Republican has crossed the 40 percent mark. The district quickly reverted to form, and Farr was re-elected ten more times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 64 percent of the vote.

===Legislation===
*Farr introduced the &quot;Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act&quot; (H.R. 21 ) in January 2007. The bill would consolidate national management of oceans, creating a system of regional governance; make the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the chief oceans agency; create an ocean advisor in the president&#x27;s Cabinet; create regional and national ocean advisory committees; and create an Oceans and Great Lakes Conservation Trust Fund. It received a subcommittee markup in April 2008 and passed by a vote of 11–3.
*Farr&#x27;s &quot;Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2008&quot; (H.R. 1084 ) was approved by the House but stalled in the Senate. The bill would create capacity within the State Department to quickly deploy civilian expertise and coordinate the government response to crises abroad. President [George W. Bush] supported the program and approved initial creation of the group. Farr participated in a rollout of the group with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in July 2008.

===Caucus work===
 Farr was active in several congressional caucuses, including the House Oceans Caucus, the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, the Congressional Bike Caucus, the Congressional Organic Caucus, the International Conservation Caucus, and the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus.

He served as co-chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus with Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Florida). Farr actively supported the travel industry, boosting membership in the caucus to more than 100 and hosting caucus events, including a June 2008 gathering of travel executives and congressional leaders--The Economic Roundtable: Travel&#x27;s Significance to the U.S. Economy.

Farr also was active as co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus, which he co-chaired with four other members. Each year the caucus helps sponsor Capitol Hill Oceans Week, known as CHOW, which draws hundreds of ocean experts from across the country. Farr also co-chaired the Congressional Organic Caucus and the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus.

===Other leadership positions===
Farr served on the House Democracy Assistance Commission, a group established by the House and mandated to work with emerging democracies throughout the world. The group engages in &quot;peer-to-peer cooperation to build technical expertise in partner legislatures that will enhance accountability, transparency, legislative independence, access to information, and government oversight.&quot;

He also is the former chairman of the California Democratic congressional delegation, the largest state delegation in Congress.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies

==Political positions==
*Farr was one of 31 House members who voted to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.
*He opposed the USA PATRIOT Act and is pro-choice. He received a 91% progressive rating by Progressive Punch, ranking him the 42nd most progressive member of congress.
*Farr took a leadership role for the House Democrats in opposing the Central American Free Trade Agreement because he did not think it had good environmental and worker protections.
*He voted against the invasion of Iraq and was actively against the Iraq War.
*Farr voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
*He received a perfect 100% rating for the 110th, 111th, and 112th United States Congresses from the Human Rights Campaign.

===Domestic issues===

*Farr is a proponent of ocean protection and conservation. In addition to H.R. 21, Farr introduced the Southern Sea Otter Recovery and Research Act (H.R. 3639) and the Clean Cruise Ship Act (H.R. 6434 ).
*He opposes opening new areas to offshore drilling, instead supporting the drilling of of federally owned land already under lease, including on the Outer Continental Shelf. Farr also supports ending subsidies to oil companies.
*Farr has worked closely with Central Coast cities and the Army on the re-use of the former Fort Ord. He was integral in securing $29 million for the creation of California State University, Monterey Bay. He also played a role in making sure land on the former installation included significant amounts of affordable housing.
*He supports comprehensive immigration reform that includes a guest worker program for farm workers, allowing undocumented students to remain in the country (known as the DREAM Act), and deporting undocumented felons in U.S. jails.

===Foreign Affairs===
*Farr consistently opposed the war in Iraq. He voted against the &quot;Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002&quot; that started the war. Farr cosponsored several bills including H.Res. 1329 , which supported a timetable for troop withdrawal, and H.R. 5626 and H.R 4959 , which called for congressional approval for any long-term agreements with Iraq.
*He was vocal in efforts to prevent military action against Iran, cosponsoring H. Con. Res 33, which would require congressional approval before any incursion into Iran, and H.R. 3119 , a bill to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran.
*Farr parlayed his experience in Colombia to become a congressional leader on Colombian affairs. He was an active supporter of rebalancing funds dedicated to Plan Colombia, the U.S. anti-drug effort, to include more support for economic redevelopment efforts. He hosted a wide range of Colombian political leaders in his Washington office including then-President Álvaro Uribe and former President Andrés Pastrana.

===Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) comment===
On February 26, 2008, at the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Farr said &quot;the public image of (the ICE agents)&quot; has become &quot;not (a) compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a Gestapo-type agency that is knocking down doors&quot; when conducting raids on illegal immigrants. Julie Myers, assistant secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, responded to Farr&#x27;s comments by saying, &quot;We are not the Gestapo. The men and women of this agency have a very difficult job...and I think they do that with distinction and great honor.&quot;. Farr replied that he knew and appreciated this, but reiterated that there is &quot;there is a very ill will public opinion in the counties (he) represent(s), about ICE&quot;.

===H.Res. 333===

On July 12, 2007, Farr joined 11 cosponsors of H.Res. 333, which laid out three articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney. The bill maintained that the vice president purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States (1) by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and (2) about an alleged relationship between Iraq and Al-Qaeda in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests, and (3) that Cheney had openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States.

&quot;Many residents in the Central Coast support the removal of Cheney from office, and I am proud to represent their values in Congress,&quot; Farr said in a brief statement.

==Awards==
On July 30, 2007, Farr received the Senator David Pryor Special Achievement Award for his ongoing advocacy for communities with military bases presented by the Association of Defense Communities. The award is given to an individual who advocates for communities with active or closed military bases. &quot;Communities with active or closed military bases face many special concerns, from land use to economic development to ordnance disposal,&quot; said Farr. &quot;I have been lucky enough to assist in the transition efforts at Fort Ord, and that experience has helped me push those issues locally and nationwide.&quot; As vice-chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Farr successfully increased clean-up funds from $221 million to $271 million for military bases closed prior to 2005.

== Personal life ==
Farr is married to the former Shary Baldwin and has one daughter, Jessica. He is an Episcopalian.

<doc id="408849" wikidata="Q185776" url="?curid=408849" title="Big Fat Liar">
<text>Big Fat Liar is a 2002 American teen comedy film directed by Shawn Levy, and written by Dan Schneider from a story by Schneider and Brian Robbins. It stars Frankie Muniz, Paul Giamatti and Amanda Bynes, with a supporting cast featuring Amanda Detmer, Donald Faison, Lee Majors and Russell Hornsby.

The plot, alluding to Aesop&#x27;s Fable &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot;, follows a 14-year-old boy (Muniz) whose creative writing assignment &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; is stolen by an arrogant Hollywood producer (Giamatti) who plans to use it to make the fictional film of the same name. It was released in the United States on February 8, 2002, to commercial success but mixed to unfavorable critical reviews. It was followed by a 2017 standalone direct-to-DVD critically panned sequel.

==Plot==
Jason Shepherd is a 14-year-old compulsive liar living in the town of Greenbury, Michigan, who tries to lie his way out of a creative writing assignment. He gets caught by his English teacher, who alerts his parents. He is given 3 hours to submit his essay, or he will have to repeat English in summer school.

Remembering an earlier comment from his father about making up stories being his “God-given talent”, Jason writes a story titled “Big Fat Liar”, drawing inspiration from his lying. While riding his sister&#x27;s old bike to turn in the essay, Jason is accidentally struck by the limousine of Marty Wolf, an arrogant, unscrupulous Hollywood producer, whom Jason gets to give him a ride.

Marty, also a compulsive liar, is shooting his film &quot;Whitaker and Fowl&quot; in town. In a rush, Jason accidentally leaves his essay in the limo when it falls out of his backpack. Inspired, Marty keeps the story for himself. Realizing his essay is missing, Jason tries to explain what happened but gets sent to summer school.

Jason and his girlfriend Kaylee discover Marty has plagiarized Jason&#x27;s essay into a film when they see a theatrical trailer. They fly to Los Angeles while their parents are out of town for the weekend and sneak into Marty&#x27;s studio office to request that Marty confess to his parents, but he purposefully burns Jason&#x27;s essay and calls security to remove them.

Angered, the teens plot to inconvenience him until Marty confesses. Marty&#x27;s former limo driver and struggling actor Frank Jackson agrees to help. Jason and Kaylee sabotage Marty through pranks such as dyeing his skin blue via his swimming pool and his hair orange via his shampoo. They also superglue his headset to his ear, trick him into going to a child&#x27;s birthday party, where the children mistake him for the hired clown and attack him, and tamper with his car&#x27;s controls, which causes it to malfunction. Marty&#x27;s car is also rear-ended by a cranky elderly woman into a monster truck owned by a wrestler, the Masher, who destroys it.

These pranks cause Marty to miss both of his appointments with Universal Pictures president Marcus Duncan. He has plans to produce &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; with Universal, but Marcus, seeing the commercial and critical failure of &quot;Whitaker and Fowl&quot;, refuses to approve the budget, so Jason agrees to help Marty in exchange for his confession to his parents.

With Jason&#x27;s advice, Marty makes a successful presentation and gets the film approved by Universal, but Marcus warns Marty that any more problems will result in Universal pulling the plug and ending his career. Marty subsequently betrays Jason and calls security to remove him and Kaylee again.

Marty&#x27;s abused assistant Monty Kirkham offers to help Jason and Kaylee expose him. They rally Marty&#x27;s other tormented employees, while Jason calls his parents to tell them the truth about the weekend.

The next morning, Marty heads to the studio to begin filming &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, but his employees delay him through many mishaps. As he finally arrives, he encounters Jason, who steals his stuffed monkey toy, Mr. Funnybones. Jason flees across the studio, luring Marty to a rooftop where he retrieves his toy and mocks Jason.

Marty boastfully admits his actions, unaware that the entire conversation is witnessed by Jason&#x27;s parents, the media, and Marcus, who immediately fires him. Jason thanks Marty for teaching him an important lesson about the truth. Marty furiously tries to attack him for permanently ruining his reputation, but he leaps off the building and safely lands on a stunt cushion, where he finally regains his parents&#x27; trust.

Universal produces Big Fat Liar after Marty&#x27;s firing, using the talents of those he mistreated. The film is a success, earning Jason full credit for his story. Meanwhile, Marty, now a bankrupt birthday clown, unknowingly performs at the Masher&#x27;s house. Upon recognizing him, the Masher orders his son, Darren, to kick Marty in the crotch. Darren eagerly obeys, drop-kicking Marty with full force, leaving him frozen in horror before crumpling in agony.

==Cast==
Kenan Thompson, Dustin Diamond and the film&#x27;s director Shawn Levy appear as guests at the after party of the premiere of Wolf&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Whitaker and Fowl&quot;, which they criticise. Jaleel White also appears uncredited as himself, starring as Officer Fowl in &quot;Whitaker and Fowl&quot;. White is annoyed that Wolf often calls him &quot;Urkel&quot;.

==Production==
Screenwriter John Hamburg provided rewrites during production, but final writing credits were awarded to Dan Schneider (screenplay/story) and producer Brian Robbins (story only).

===Filming===
&quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; was filmed from March to June 2001. The film was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood (with sets from the film The Scorpion King visible in some scenes) and its Flash Flood set, and Los Angeles International Airport, as well as in Glendale, Monrovia, Pasadena, and Whittier, California.

The exotic Intermec 6651 Handheld PC appears as the computer used by Lester Golub to help Jason by releasing a stream of water into Marty&#x27;s path.

===Soundtrack===
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released by Mercury Records in 2002.
==Release==

==Reception==

===Box office===

The film grossed $11.6 million in its opening weekend, finishing in second at the box office behind &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; ($15.1 million).

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; has an approval rating of 45% based on 93 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus read, &quot;Though there&#x27;s nothing that offensive about &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, it is filled with Hollywood cliches and cartoonish slapstick, making it strictly for kids.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score 36 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Some critics called the film energetic and witty, but others called it dull and formulaic. Ebert and Roeper gave it &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave it 3 out of 4, and called it &quot;A surprisingly entertaining movie [...] ideal for younger kids, and not painful for their parents.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;an innocent comedic revenge fantasy that somehow manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Sequel==
In August 2016, it was announced that a standalone sequel had begun principal photography. &quot;Bigger Fatter Liar&quot; starred Ricky Garcia as Kevin Shepherd, Jodelle Ferland as Becca, and Barry Bostwick as Larry Wolf. The plot, though unrelated to the first film, was similar in many ways to &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;. Released directly to DVD in April 2017, the film was met with critical and commercial failure. It was later released on Blu-ray in July 2018.

===Potential future===
In March 2022, Shawn Levy revealed that he has always wanted to make a direct-sequel to &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, stating that the plot would include a Marty Wolf revenge story. The filmmaker referenced the revitalized &quot;Real Steel&quot; franchise in the form of the upcoming television series, as hope for a future &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; sequel to be made.

<doc id="408857" wikidata="Q538888" url="?curid=408857" title="Dennis Cardoza">
<text>Dennis Alan Cardoza (born March 31, 1959) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2012. The district took in a large swath of the Central Valley, from Stockton to Fresno. He is a member of the Democratic Party. On October 20, 2011, he announced he would retire from Congress at the end of 2012.

He first won election to Congress after defeating Congressman Gary Condit in the March 2002 Democratic Party primary election.

He resigned from Congress effective August 15, 2012, citing family concerns as a priority, and joined the law firm Foley &amp; Lardner LLP in a public affairs and lobbying role.

==Early life==
Cardoza was born in Merced, California, of Portuguese ancestry. He grew up in Atwater, California, and graduated from Atwater High School. He was educated at California State University, Stanislaus in Turlock, California, then transferred to the University of Maryland, College Park. He is a member of Theta Chi fraternity.

==Political career==
Cardoza&#x27;s interest in public service began in college when he interned on Capitol Hill during the summer of 1979. The first in his family to graduate from college, Cardoza went on to run a successful small business. Cardoza served as a city council member in both Merced and Atwater and was a member of the California State Assembly from 1996 to 2002. During his six years in the Assembly, he chaired the Rules Committee and helped found the Moderate Democratic Caucus.

Cardoza represented California&#x27;s 18th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. The seat was previously held by Gary Condit. When Cardoza was starting out in politics, he served as Condit&#x27;s chief of staff while Condit was still in the California Assembly. When Condit&#x27;s career came under a cloud because of his extramarital affair with murdered intern Chandra Levy, Cardoza ran against him in the 2002 Democratic primary and won. Cardoza then faced Republican State Senator Dick Monteith in the November election. This race was considered to be the only potentially competitive House contest in California; redistricting after the 2000 census gave most of the state&#x27;s 53 congresspersons safe districts. However, the Democratic-controlled state legislature had been concerned about a growing Republican trend in the 18th even before Condit&#x27;s career imploded. The district and its predecessors had been in Democratic hands since 1955 and remained that way until the election of Republican John Duarte to Congress in 2022. The legislature shifted a Republican-leaning portion of eastern Stanislaus County to the heavily Republican 19th District. They replaced it with a mostly Democratic spur in and around Stockton, which gave the district a plurality of Latino voters. Cardoza defeated Monteith, 51 percent to 43 percent. He was reelected four times against only nominal opposition.

Cardoza was considered a conservative Democrat by California standards, which is typical for Democrats from the Central Valley. However, his voting record was slightly more liberal than that of Condit. During the 109th Congress, Cardoza was a co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate to conservative House Democrats of which Condit was a founding member. He was a member of the Resources Committee, Agriculture Committee, and International Relations Committee.

For the 112th Congress, Cardoza sat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, as well as the Agriculture Committee where he was ranking member of the Livestock, Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee. He remained a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, but his co-chairmanship was assumed by Congressman Mike Ross.

Media accounts suggest that Cardoza&#x27;s decision to retire stemmed from the 2012 redistricting map, which put his hometown of Merced in the same district as fellow Blue Dog Jim Costa. Meanwhile, the reconfigured 10th, which included much of Cardoza&#x27;s old district, was won by Republican Jeff Denham.

<doc id="408862" wikidata="Q1353949" url="?curid=408862" title="George Radanovich">
<text>George Purdy Radanovich (born June 20, 1955) is an American politician and former U.S. Representative for , serving from 1995 to 2011. The district includes most of northern Fresno, as well as several rural areas northeast of the city. He did not seek reelection in 2010. He is a member of the Republican Party.

==Background==
Radanovich was born in Mariposa, California to a Catholic family of Croatian extraction.

He was educated at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. After college, he performed a variety of jobs, including work as a banker, substitute teacher, and construction worker. He began growing grapes in his native Mariposa County in 1982, after observing a microclimate in the area suitable for their growth. In 1986, he opened the Radanovich Winery, the first winery in the region. He was a member of the Mariposa County Board of Supervisors from 1988 to 1992, serving as chairman in 1991. He first ran for Congress in 1992 after his home in Mariposa was shifted to the 19th District, and lost in the Republican primary to Fresno businessman Tal Cloud.

Radanovich won the Republican primary in 1994. In the general election, Radanovich faced six-term incumbent Democrat Richard H. Lehman in the following November election. Lehman had only defeated Cloud by 1,100 votes in the previous election cycle, and speculation had abounded that the 19th would not stay Democratic for long. Radanovich defeated Lehman by a shocking 17-point margin (56 percent to Lehman&#x27;s 39 percent). It was one of the largest margins of defeat for an incumbent in a cycle that saw many tenured Democrats lose their seats.

According to &quot;Wine Spectator,&quot; in 2003 Congressman Radanovich closed &quot;Radanovich Winery&quot; due to “the tough economic times currently facing many California wineries, the congressman said on Friday. &quot;It has been a painful decision,&quot; said Radanovich, 47. &quot;The past six months have been some of the most difficult that I&#x27;ve been through.&quot; &quot;SFGate&quot; reported on this as well saying, “Radanovich cited the current wine oversupply situation facing California vintners, the economic situation and his desire to focus on his job in Washington. The winery&#x27;s tasting room has closed and some winery inventory will be sold to pay outstanding debts.”

In the 2006 election, Radanovich ran against chemical engineer T. J. Cox, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Cox was arguably Radanovich&#x27;s most serious and well-funded challenger since his 1994 election. However, Michael Der Manouel Jr. commented on Cox&#x27;s chances for election by saying, &quot;Cox could spend $10 million and Nancy Pelosi could spend another $10 million and Congressman Radanovich wouldn&#x27;t lose.&quot; Radanovich was reelected with 60% of the vote in 2006 and was unopposed for reelection in 2008 in what is now considered one of the most Republican districts in California. Cox was later elected to Congress in the 21st district in the 2018 elections.

On December 29, 2009, Radanovich announced he would not seek reelection in 2010.

==Life after congress==
In 2022, Radanovich ran for California&#x27;s 4th State Senate district. He was eliminated when he placed third in the primary. 

In 2024, Radanovich placed first in the primary election for California&#x27;s 8th Assembly district, but lost to fellow Republican David Tangipa in the general election.

He was president of the Republican freshman class of 1994, has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, and is a member of the Republican Study Committee.

<text>The omega constant is a mathematical constant defined as the unique real number that satisfies the equation

:formula_1

It is the value of , where is Lambert&#x27;s function. The name is derived from the alternate name for Lambert&#x27;s function, the &quot;omega function&quot;. The numerical value of is given by
: .

== Properties ==
=== Fixed point representation ===
The defining identity can be expressed, for example, as
:formula_2
or
:formula_3
as well as
:formula_4

=== Computation ===
One can calculate iteratively, by starting with an initial guess , and considering the sequence

:formula_5

This sequence will converge to as approaches infinity. This is because is an attractive fixed point of the function .

It is much more efficient to use the iteration

:formula_6

because the function

:formula_7

in addition to having the same fixed point, also has a derivative that vanishes there. This guarantees quadratic convergence; that is, the number of correct digits is roughly doubled with each iteration.

Using Halley&#x27;s method, can be approximated with cubic convergence (the number of correct digits is roughly tripled with each iteration): (see also ).

:formula_8

=== Integral representations ===
An identity due to Victor Adamchik is given by the relationship
:formula_9

Other relations due to Mező
and Kalugin-Jeffrey-Corless
are:
:formula_10
:formula_11
The latter two identities can be extended to other values of the function (see also ).

===Transcendence===
The constant is transcendental. This can be seen as a direct consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. For a contradiction, suppose that is algebraic. By the theorem, is transcendental, but , which is a contradiction. Therefore, it must be transcendental.

<text>The 108th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives from January 3, 2003, to January 3, 2005, during the third and fourth years of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency.

House members were elected in the 2002 general election on November 5, 2002. Senators were elected in three classes in the 1998 general election on November 3, 1998, 2000 general election on November 7, 2000, or 2002 general election on November 5, 2002. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 2000 United States census.

This is the most recent Congress to have a Democratic senator from South Carolina, Fritz Hollings, who retired at the end of the Congress.

Both chambers had a Republican majority, with the Republicans slightly increasing their edge in the House, and regaining control of the Senate, after party control had switched back and forth during the 107th Congress due to various factors. With President Bush, this gave the Republicans an overall federal government trifecta.

<text>Calvin M. Dooley (born January 11, 1954), American politician, was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 2005, representing the 17th and 20th districts of California.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Visalia, California, he grew up on his parents&#x27; farm several miles east of Hanford and graduated from Hanford Union High School in 1972. Dooley earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in agricultural economics from the University of California, Davis in 1977 and a master&#x27;s degree in Management from Stanford University in 1987.

== Career ==
Dooley worked as a rancher and then as an administrative assistant for California State Senator Rose Ann Vuich from 1987 to 1990.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1990, Dooley won the Democratic primary for what was then the 17th District and faced six-term Republican Chip Pashayan in November. Although Pashayan had been reelected with 71 percent of the vote in 1988, he was bogged down by the House banking scandal, and Dooley defeated him by just over 9 points. In 1992, his district was renumbered as the 20th District and drawn as a Latino-majority district. He was easily reelected that year and five more times after that. He faced only one truly serious contest, when Republican Rich Rodriguez managed to hold him to 53 percent of the vote. A &quot;New Democrat,&quot; his voting record was considered moderate, as is typical for Democrats from the Central Valley.

Dooley announced his retirement in 2004 and endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor. However, most of the rest of the state Democratic establishment endorsed Jim Costa, a former state legislator from the Fresno area. This touched off a contentious primary battle which was won by Costa, all but assuring him of victory in November. 
On October 10, 2002, Cal Dooley was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He has later said that he regrets this vote.

=== Later career ===
Having served as the president and CEO of the Food Products Association (FPA), Dooley assumed the same roles at the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), following a merger with the FPA. GMA is a Washington-based trade association representing food manufacturers.

In September 2008, Dooley assumed the position of CEO of the American Chemistry Council, the trade association for American chemical companies. He announced his retirement in 2018.

== Personal life ==
Dooley is married to the former Linda Phillips, who heads the Bryce Harlow Foundation in Washington DC. The couple have two daughters, one of whom is on the Charlottesville City School Board.

<text>The BMW 003 (full RLM designation 109-003) is an early axial turbojet engine produced by BMW AG in Germany during World War II. The 003 and the Junkers Jumo 004 were the only German turbojet engines to reach production during World War II.

Work had begun on the design of the BMW 003 before its contemporary, the Jumo 004, but prolonged developmental problems meant that the BMW 003 entered production much later, and the aircraft projects that had been designed with it in mind were re-engined with the Jumo powerplant instead. The most famous case of this was the Messerschmitt Me 262, which used the 003 in two of the V-series prototypes and in the two experimental A-1b aircraft. The only production aircraft to use the BMW 003 were the Heinkel He 162 and the later C-series, four-engined versions of the Arado Ar 234.

About 3,500 BMW 003 engines were built in Germany, but very few were ever installed in aircraft. The engine also formed the basis for turbojet development in Japan during the war, and in the Soviet Union following the war. A larger derivative was the BMW 018, but only three prototypes had been built by the end of the war.

==Design and development==
The practicality of jet propulsion had been demonstrated in Germany in early 1937 by Hans von Ohain working with the Heinkel company. Recognising the potential of the invention, the Reich Air Ministry (, abbreviated RLM) encouraged Germany&#x27;s aero engine manufacturers to begin their own programmes of jet engine development, offering contracts to both Junkers and BMW for an engine capable of static thrust.

The BMW 003 began development as a project of the Brandenburgische Motorenwerke (Brandenburg Motor Works, known as &quot;Bramo&quot;), under the direction of Hermann Östrich and assigned the RLM designation 109-003 (using the RLM&#x27;s &quot;109-&quot; prefix, common to all jet and rocket engine projects). Bramo was also developing another turbojet, the 109-002. In 1939, BMW bought out Bramo, and in the acquisition, obtained both engine projects. The 109-002 had a very sophisticated contra-rotating compressor design intended to eliminate torque, but was abandoned in favour of the simpler engine, which in the end proved to have enough development problems of its own.

Construction began late in the same year and the engine ran for the first time in August 1940, but produced only thrust, just half what was desired. The first flight test took place in mid-1941, mounted underneath a Messerschmitt Bf 110 testbed airframe. Problems continued, however, so delaying the program that while the Me 262 V1 prototype airframe (the first aircraft intended to use the engine) was ready for flight-testing, there were no power plants available for it and it actually began flight tests with a supplementary, conventional Junkers Jumo 210 piston engine in the nose. It was not until November 1941 that the Me 262 V1 was flown with BMW engines, which both failed during the test. The prototype aircraft had to return to the airfield on the power of the piston engine, which was still fitted.

The general usage of the BMW powerplant was abandoned for the Me 262, except for two experimental examples of the plane known as the Me 262 A-1b. The few &quot;Messerschmitt Me 262 A-1b&quot; test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of . The Me 262A-1a production version used the competing Jumo 004, whose heavier weight required the wings to be swept back in order to move the center of gravity into the correct position. Work on the 003 continued anyway, and by late 1942 it had been made far more powerful and reliable. The improved engine was flight tested under a Junkers Ju 88 in October 1943 and was finally ready for mass production in August 1944. Completed engines earned a reputation for unreliability; the time between major overhauls (not technically a TBO) was about 50 hours. (The competing Jumo 004&#x27;s was between thirty and fifty, and may have been as low as ten.) Through 1944 the 003&#x27;s reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the &quot;Jägernotprogramm&quot;’s light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 &quot;Spatz&quot; design.

Developments of the engine included the 003C, which raised thrust to — in the same thrust class as the competing Jumo 004B, but some 136 kg/300 lb lighter in weight; and the 003D, which raised it to nearly , which added one extra compressor stage beyond the seven of the earlier designs, and an extra turbine stage, with the thrust-weight ratio of 16.58 N/kg for the 003D at only in weight, being some 30% greater than the figure for the Heinkel HeS 011A.

Only two German production aircraft used the 003. The first was the Heinkel He 162A &quot;Spatz&quot; (since the &quot;Volksjäger&quot; light fighter design competition mandated its use), with the &quot;Spatz&quot; utilizing an 003E version, designed to possess ventral mounting points to allow it to be mounted atop the fuselage of an aircraft. The other was the four-engined Arado Ar 234C reconnaissance-bomber variants, which were designed to use what was supposed to be the &quot;more available&quot; engine, despite its primary allocation for the He 162A.

The BMW 003 proved cheaper in materials than the company&#x27;s own 801 radial, to , and cheaper than the Junkers Jumo 213 inverted V12 piston engine at , but slightly more costly than the competing Junkers Jumo 004&#x27;s . Moreover, the 004 needed only 375 hours to complete (including manufacture, assembly, and shipping), compared to 1,400 for the 801. At Kolbermoor, location of the Heinkel-Hirth engine works, the Fedden Mission, led by Sir Roy Fedden, found jet-engine manufacturing was simpler and required lower-skill labor and less sophisticated tooling than piston engine production; in fact, most of making of hollow turbine blades and sheet metal work on jets could be done by tooling used in making automobile body panels. The lifetime of the combustion chambers was estimated at 200 hours.

The BMW 003 utilized nearly the same starting method as its slightly more powerful Jumo 004 competitor: one of Norbert Riedel&#x27;s 10 PS flat-twin two-stroke engines, installed within the engine&#x27;s intake diverter as a mechanical APU, to get the 003&#x27;s central shaft rotating for operation. An American military-authored post-war review of the BMW 003 stated that an electric starter of some sort was used to &quot;turn over&quot; the Riedel APU, with no existing photos of either wartime or restored BMW 003s showing the &quot;D-shape&quot; pull handle so prominent on the noses of many museum-preserved Jumo 004&#x27;s intake diverters.

===&quot;Mixed-power&quot; upgrade===

One late version of the engine added a small rocket motor (the BMW 109-718) at the rear and usually just above the exhaust of the engine, which added some thrust each for three to five minutes, for take off and short dashes. In this configuration, it was known as the BMW 003R and was tested, albeit with some serious reliability problems, on single prototypes for advanced models of the Me 262 (the Me 262C-2b &quot;Heimatschützer II&quot; [Home Defender II]), and He 162 (He 162E). Both prototypes flew under hybrid jet/rocket power during March 1945, though records do not indicate the results of testing with the 162E.

Only about 500 examples of the BMW 003 were built, but the Fedden Mission postwar estimated total German jet engine production by mid-1946 could have reached 100,000 units a year, or more.

The 003 was intended for export to Japan, but working examples of the engine were never supplied. Instead, Japanese engineers used cross-section drawings to design an indigenous turbojet, the Ishikawajima Ne-20.

===Turboshaft development===

The 003 was selected as the basis for a gas turbine development project for the German military&#x27;s anticipated need for what is today called a turboshaft powerplant for multiple needs — this project was called the GT 101, using the 003 axial-flow turbojet as the starting point in mid-November 1944. Its original purpose would have been to re-engine the Panther tank with a turboshaft-based power system capable of up to a 1,150 PS usable shaft horsepower rating into an AFV&#x27;s drivetrain, from an engine weight of only , giving it a 27 hp/ton power-to-weight ratio — just over twice the factor that the Panther&#x27;s original gasoline-fueled Maybach V12 piston engine provided.

===Post-war use===
Following the war, two captured 003s powered the prototype of the first Soviet jet, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9. Blueprints for BMW engines had been seized by Soviet forces from both the Basdorf-Zühlsdorf plant near Berlin and the notorious Mittelwerk slave labor facility near Nordhausen. Production of the 003 was set up at the &quot;Red October&quot; GAZ 466 (&quot;Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod&quot;, or Gorky Automobile Plant) in Leningrad and in Kuznetsov along KMPO, where the engine was mass-produced from 1947 under the designation RD-20 (&quot;reactivnyi dvigatel&quot;, or &quot;jet drive&quot;).

After the Allied occupation of Germany, Marcel Dassault assisted Hermann Östrich in moving from the American Zone of occupied Germany into the French Zone. Within a couple of years, he was working for Voisin, a division of SNECMA, France&#x27;s state-owned aircraft engine company. Using the basic design of the 003, he produced the larger Atar jet engine that powered Dassault&#x27;s Ouragan, Dassault Mirage III and Mystère fighters.

<doc id="408872" wikidata="Q539493" url="?curid=408872" title="Devin Nunes">
<text>Devin Gerald Nunes (; born October 1, 1973) is an American businessman and politician who serves as the Chair of the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board since January 20, 2025, and as chief executive officer of the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG). Before resigning from the House of Representatives and joining TMTG, Nunes was first the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2013, and then from 2013 to 2022.

A member of the Republican Party, Nunes was the chair of the House Intelligence Committee from 2015 to 2019. He was also a member of President Donald Trump&#x27;s first transition team. Nunes&#x27;s former district, numbered as the 21st from 2003 to 2013 and as the 22nd after redistricting, was in the San Joaquin Valley and included most of western Tulare County and much of eastern Fresno County.

In March 2017, the U.S. House intelligence committee, which Nunes chaired at the time, launched an investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In February 2018, Nunes publicly released a four-page memorandum alleging an FBI conspiracy against Trump. Nunes subsequently began an investigation of the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly abusing their powers in an attempt to hurt Trump. In January 2021, Trump awarded Nunes the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Nunes was born on October 1, 1973, the older of two sons of Antonio L. &quot;Anthony&quot; Nunes Jr. and Toni Diane Nunes (&quot;née&quot; Enas). His grandfather founded Nunes &amp; Sons, a prominent dairy operation in Tulare County. His family operated their farm in California until 2006, when they sold the property and purchased a dairy in Sibley, Iowa.

Nunes is of three-quarters Portuguese descent, with ancestors emigrating from the Azores to California. He has one younger brother, Anthony III. In 2009, Nunes wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that he became an entrepreneur at age 14 when he bought seven head of young cattle, learning quickly how to profit from his investment.

After receiving his Associate of Arts degree from the College of the Sequoias in 1993, Nunes graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agricultural business in 1995, and a master&#x27;s degree in agriculture in 1996. After finishing school, Nunes returned to farming.

In 1996, at age 23, Nunes was elected to the College of the Sequoias Board, making him one of California&#x27;s youngest community college trustees in state history. He served on the board until 2002.

In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Nunes to serve as California State Director for the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Rural Development section.

==U.S. Congress==


===Elections===

In 1998, Nunes entered the &quot;top two&quot; primary race for California&#x27;s 20th congressional district seat held by Democrat Cal Dooley. He finished in third place.

In 2002, Nunes ran for the Republican nomination in the 21st congressional district, a new district created by reapportionment after the 2000 United States census. His principal opponents in the crowded seven-way primary were former Fresno mayor Jim Patterson and state Assemblyman Mike Briggs. Nunes was the only major candidate from Tulare County; Patterson and Briggs were both from Fresno. This was critical, as 58% of the district&#x27;s population was in Tulare County.

Patterson and Briggs split the vote in Fresno County, allowing Nunes to win by a four-point margin over Patterson, his nearest competitor. Nunes won 46.5% of the vote in Tulare County and 28.1% of the vote in Fresno County. Nunes was also helped by a strong showing in the rural part of the district. He was endorsed by the California Farm Bureau and &quot;The Fresno Bee&quot;. The district was solidly Republican, and Nunes coasted to victory in November 2002. He was 29 years old.

Nunes faced token Democratic opposition in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He ran unopposed in the 2010 general election.

After the 2010 census, Nunes&#x27;s district was renumbered the 22nd. It lost most of eastern Tulare County to the neighboring 23rd District, and now has a small plurality of Hispanic voters. Despite these changes, on paper it was no less Republican than its predecessor. Nunes was reelected with 62% of the vote in 2012, 72% in 2014, and 68% in 2016.

During the 2014 election cycle Nunes received approximately $1.4million in political action committee (PAC) contributions. During the 2016 election cycle, he received approximately $1.6million in campaign contributions from PACs.

In 2018, Nunes faced Democratic nominee Andrew Janz, a Fresno County prosecutor. Nunes defeated Janz with 53% of the vote to Janz&#x27;s 47%, the closest race of Nunes&#x27;s career.

In 2020, Nunes received 56.5% of the vote in the primary. Nunes defeated Phil Arballo in the general election on November 3, 2020.

===Committees and caucuses===

In 2015, Nunes became the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

As co-chair of the U.S.–Mexico Friendship Caucus, he and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer met with President Felipe Calderón of Mexico in April 2012.

Nunes was a member of the House Baltic Caucus and the U.S.-Japan Caucus.

In December 2021, Nunes resigned from the House, effective January 1, 2022, in order to join the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group as chief executive officer.

==Political positions==

Former Trump campaign CEO and chief strategist Steve Bannon has called Nunes Trump&#x27;s second-strongest ally in Congress.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described him as &quot;one of Trump&#x27;s most ardent and outlandish defenders in Congress&quot; who &quot;parroted the president&#x27;s conspiracy theories&quot; and used his position &quot;to try to undermine [the] investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.&quot;

During the presidency of Donald Trump, Nunes voted in line with the president&#x27;s stated position 96.2% of the time. As of December 2021, Nunes had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 11% of the time.

===Energy===

On July 28, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 5899, &quot;A Roadmap for America&#x27;s Energy Future&quot;, which would have accelerated the exploration and production of fossil fuel, supported the rapid development of market-based alternative energy supplies, and expanded the number of nuclear reactors from 104 to 300 over the next thirty years. Kimberley Strassel of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a bill designed to produce energy, not restrict it&quot; with &quot;no freebies&quot;, and &quot;offers a competitive twist to government support of renewable energy.&quot;

===Environment===

Nunes wrote in his book &quot;Restoring the Republic&quot; that environmental lobbyists were &quot;followers of neo-Marxist, socialist, Maoist or Communist ideals.&quot;

In February 2014, during a drought in California, Nunes rejected any link to global warming, claiming &quot;Global warming is nonsense.&quot; He has said it was a &quot;man-made drought&quot; due to water restrictions from the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and other environmental regulations that have seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years.

He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California&#x27;s system of water irrigation and storage and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon and the delta smelt. Nunes co-sponsored the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act to stop a project designed to restore a dried-up section of the San Joaquin River. He also co-sponsored the California Emergency Drought Relief Act. The bills passed the House of Representatives in February 2014 and December 2014 respectively, but were not voted on by the Senate.

===Fiscal policy===

On January 27, 2010, Nunes co-sponsored H.R. 4529, Roadmap for America&#x27;s Future Act of 2010, the Republican Party&#x27;s budget proposal.

On December 2, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 6484, the Public Employee Pension Transparency Act, which would &quot;provide for reporting and disclosure by State and local public employee retirement pension plans,&quot; but it never received a vote.

Nunes has long been a proponent of a consumption tax model and has been influenced by David Bradford. In 2016, he introduced the American Business Competitiveness Act (H.R. 4377), known as the ABC Act, a &quot;cash-flow tax plan&quot; featuring full expensing and a reduction of the highest rate for federal corporate income tax rate to 25%. Nunes&#x27;s proposal was influential among House Republicans, and had similarities to the House Republican tax plan introduced by Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in June 2016. Conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin said Nunes had &quot;a tremendous impact on the debate&quot; for a non-chairman.

In April 2016, Nunes voted for the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, a bill that would prevent the IRS from accessing the names of donors to nonprofit organizations. Critics of the bill, which was promoted by the Koch brothers, say IRS access to donor information is important for ensuring foreign funds do not impact U.S. elections.

Nunes voted in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

===Health care===

In 2009, Nunes co-authored the &quot;Patients&#x27; Choice Act&quot; with Paul Ryan (R-WI) in the House, and Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Richard Burr (R-NC) in the Senate. The bill would have established a system of state health insurance exchanges and amended the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. It also proposed to absorb Medicaid programs into the exchange system. The Patients&#x27; Choice Act was incorporated into the &quot;Roadmap for America&#x27;s Future Act of 2010&quot;.

Nunes opposes the Affordable Care Act and has said it cannot be fixed. In 2017 he voted to repeal it.

===Immigration and refugees===

Nunes supported President Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769 imposing a temporary ban on entry into the United States by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, claiming it was &quot;a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland&quot;.

===Intelligence Committee===

Nunes opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an international agreement that the U.S. and other major world powers negotiated with Iran, under which Iran was granted partial sanctions relief in exchange for limits on and monitoring of its nuclear activities.

As House Intelligence Committee chairman, Nunes oversaw the Republican-controlled committee&#x27;s two-year-long investigation into the U.S. response to the 2012 Benghazi attack. The committee&#x27;s final report found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or any other Obama administration officials, and concluded that the response of CIA and U.S. military to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound was correct. The committee&#x27;s report debunked &quot;a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies&quot; about the attack, determining that &quot;there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria&quot;, but found &quot;that the State Department facility where [Christopher] Stevens and [Sean] Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack&quot;.

Paul Ryan vacated the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee when he replaced John Boehner as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Ryan asked Nunes to stay on the Intelligence Committee, and Nunes complied.

===Marijuana policy===

Nunes has a &quot;D&quot; rating from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) for his voting history on cannabis-related causes.

===Surveillance===

In January 2019, Congress passed a bill Nunes supported, which extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) until 2023, and Trump signed it into law that month. FISA Section 702 allows the National Security Agency to conduct searches of foreigners&#x27; communications without a warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans. Nunes lauded the bill&#x27;s passing: &quot;The House of Representatives has taken a big step to ensure the continuation of one of the Intelligence Community&#x27;s most vital tools for tracking foreign terrorists&quot;.

===Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict===
Nunes accused Turkey, a NATO member, of inciting the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. On October 1, 2020, he co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan&#x27;s offensive operations against Nagorno-Karabakh, denounced Turkey&#x27;s role in the conflict and called for an immediate ceasefire.

===Transportation===

California State Route 99 is a highway running north–south that branches from Interstate 5 at the community of Wheeler Ridge in Kern County and continues northward through the Central Valley until it connects with Interstate 5 again at Red Bluff in Tehama County. In 2005 Nunes introduced H.R. 99, which designated State Route 99 as a congressional High Priority Corridor. The bill also provided federal authorization for Highway 99 to become part of the Interstate Highway System. On February 17, 2011, Nunes introduced H.R. 761, the &quot;San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act&quot;, which would give the State of California the option to redirect federal high-speed rail funds to finance improvements to Highway 99. H.R. 761 was cosponsored by Jeff Denham (R-CA) and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

===U.S. base in Portugal===

In 2015, Nunes clashed with the Pentagon over a U.S. base in the Azores, Portugal. He proposed relocating Africa Command and European Command intelligence centers to the Azores, contrary to plans by Pentagon and NATO to create a larger intelligence &quot;fusion&quot; facility in the United Kingdom, maintaining that this would save money because of the Azores&#x27; lower living and construction costs. The Pentagon responded by stating &quot;Moving to Lajes Field is very expensive and living is expensive as well.&quot; In sum, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found inaccuracies in the information provided by the Department of Defense to Congress, according to its report.

===COVID-19 pandemic===

On March 15, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Nunes encouraged families who were &quot;healthy&quot; to &quot;go out and go to a local restaurant, likely you can get in easy.&quot; This advice contradicted that of the CDC, and WHO, as well as that of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government&#x27;s leading expert on infectious diseases, who advised people to stay at home if they could. Later, Nunes walked back his comments and claimed that he had encouraged people to use drive-throughs. On March 31, he described California&#x27;s decision to close schools to halt the spread of coronavirus as &quot;way overkill&quot;. Nunes said he wanted people to return to work in one to two weeks.

On March 17, 2020, Nunes told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that the media was exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. He predicted that the crisis would be over by Easter. &quot;There&#x27;s a good chance we can get through this in the next couple of weeks and for sure by Easter, because we will have a handle on who&#x27;s getting sick and how to treat them,&quot; he said.

==Legal issues==
===Comments about other politicians===

During the debate over the Affordable Health Care Act in the House of Representatives, Nunes said of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, &quot;For most of the 20th century people fled the ghost of communist dictators and now you are bringing the ghosts back into this chamber.&quot; He has also had a long-running dispute with another San Francisco Bay-area Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, over California water policy and other issues, even running a series of advertisements against her in California.

Nunes&#x27;s criticisms have not been limited to liberals or the Obama administration. During the October 2013 budget standoff, Nunes called certain members of his own Republican Conference who favored a government shutdown &quot;lemmings with suicide vests&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of an insult to lemmings to call them lemmings&quot; because of their tactics, he said.

In May 2014, Nunes came under fire when he charged that Michigan Congressman and (then) fellow Republican Justin Amash was &quot;al-Qaeda&#x27;s best friend in Congress&quot; because of Amash&#x27;s supposed voting record on National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance. At the time, Amash had voted in opposition to a Nunes water bill for California &quot;on constitutional grounds&quot;.

===Role in Trump–Russia investigation===

In February 2017, Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, was the first leading House Republican to deny that the intelligence community had evidence of contact between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. He rejected repeated calls for an investigation by a select committee, saying the House should not engage in a &quot;witch hunt&quot; and that &quot;at this point, there&#x27;s nothing there&quot;. Nunes also rejected calls that he request President Trump&#x27;s tax returns. At a White House communications aide&#x27;s request, Nunes spoke to a reporter for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to challenge a story about the Trump campaign&#x27;s connections to Russia.

When Trump&#x27;s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned after it was revealed that he had allegedly misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communication with Russian officials, Nunes said he would not seek to investigate Flynn&#x27;s ties to Russia: &quot;From everything that I can see, his conversations with the Russian ambassador—he was doing this country a favor, and he should be thanked for it.&quot;

On March 22, 2017, during the House Intelligence Committee&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Nunes held a press conference to announce that he had received information that the communications of &quot;some members of Trump&#x27;s transition team, including potentially the president himself&quot; had been &quot;incidentally collected&quot; by the intelligence community and &quot;widely disseminated&quot; throughout the intelligence community. He added that it was legal FISA surveillance, and unrelated to Russia. It was later revealed that it involved Russia and the Trump transition team. The surveillance was of multiple phone conversations between Michael Flynn, a member of the transition team, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which occurred after Flynn sought advice from the Trump transition team at Mar-a-Lago, where they discussed what Flynn should tell Kislyak &quot;about the administration&#x27;s stance on the sanctions. [Kislyak had contacted Flynn the day before]... members of the team at the president&#x27;s Florida estate agree that they do not want Russia to escalate the diplomatic crisis. After the initial call, Flynn [spoke] with Kislyak multiple times by phone and urge[d] him not to exacerbate the situation. U.S. intelligence officials intercept[ed] the calls as part of their routine surveillance of foreign dignitaries.&quot;

Nunes had met his source for the information one day earlier at the White House grounds, with a spokesman for Nunes claiming this provided &quot;a secure location&quot; to view the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelsey_5/3/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nunes had characterized his intelligence sources as whistle-blowers whose identities he had to protect, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that they were actually White House officials Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that along with Cohen-Watnick and Ellis, a third man, National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg, was involved.

Nunes was widely criticized for sharing this information with the media and the president before briefing his colleagues on the committee. According to Nunes, the intercepted communications came in November, December and January—after Trump won the election but before he was sworn in as president. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the committee, and House Democratic leadership called on Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. He also received criticism from Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. The latter compared Nunes&#x27;s actions to those of the comically incompetent fictional character Inspector Clouseau. Nunes was criticized by Democrats and some Republicans for sharing information on an investigation of the Trump campaign with the administration without communicating it to Schiff, his Democratic Intelligence Committee counterpart.

In late March 2017, Nunes canceled a public hearing in which former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, former National Security Agency Director James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan were to testify, saying he wanted to hear FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers in a classified setting first. Democrats criticized Nunes&#x27;s decision and said he was trying to protect the White House from damaging revelations.

On April 6, 2017, Nunes temporarily stepped aside from leading the Russia investigation while the Office of Congressional Ethics investigated whether he had &quot;made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct&quot; in his March press conference. He called the charges &quot;entirely false and politically motivated&quot;. On April 12, 2017, sources from both the Republican and the Democratic parties said the original documents Nunes cited did not support Trump&#x27;s claims that the Obama administration acted illegally or unusually.

In May 2017, Nunes unilaterally issued three subpoenas seeking documents about former Obama administration officials who requested the unmasking of Trump aides, which led to renewed accusations of colluding with the White House to undercut the Russia probe.

According to &quot;Politico&quot;, in July 2017 an aide to Nunes secretly sent a pair of Republican staffers to London to contact Christopher Steele. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial board wrote that Nunes&#x27;s involvement in the investigation was &quot;threatening the credibility of the probe&quot;.

In December 2017, the United States House Committee on Ethics closed its investigation into improper disclosure of classified information by Nunes; the co-chairs of the Committee stated: &quot;The Committee does not determine whether information is or is not classified. In the course of this investigation, the Committee sought the analysis of Representative Nunes&#x27;s statements by classification experts in the intelligence community. Based solely on the conclusion of these classification experts that the information Representative Nunes disclosed was not classified, the Committee will take no further action and considers this matter closed.&quot; In January 2018, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; cited three congressional sources describing that the Ethics Committee was never able to obtain the classified information it was investigating regarding Nunes&#x27;s case. In February 2018, Nunes released a four-page memorandum alleging that the FBI&#x27;s 2016 surveillance of Carter Page, a former member of the Trump campaign, was motivated by bias against Trump. Trump said the Nunes memo vindicated him.

In August 2018, Nunes traveled to London in an attempt to meet with the heads of MI5, MI6, and GCHQ for information about Steele, but was rebuffed by the three agencies.

===Role in Trump impeachment inquiry===

As the top Republican (&quot;Ranking Member&quot;) on the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes was a key player in the Trump impeachment inquiry. During the November 2019 public hearings, he delivered the opening statement for the GOP minority. Nunes used most of the allotted Republican time for questioning himself instead of deferring to the Minority Counsel. Nunes has tried to identify the whistle-blower whose complaint played a part in launching the impeachment inquiry. Further, during the hearings, Nunes repeatedly claimed that Ukraine had attempted to influence the 2016 United States presidential election, one of the conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal.

In November 2019, Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s associate Lev Parnas said he had helped Nunes arrange meetings with Ukrainian officials in efforts to procure politically embarrassing &quot;dirt&quot; on former Vice President Joe Biden. Parnas said he would be willing to testify to Congress about his own role as well as Nunes&#x27;s in the events, which included meeting with disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin.

Parnas&#x27;s attorney Joseph A. Bondy has said that Nunes and his staffer former U.S. Army colonel Derek Harvey met with Parnas several times for updates on claims against Biden and the CrowdStrike/2016 U.S. election conspiracy theory. Parnas&#x27;s attorney said, &quot;Mr. Parnas learned through Nunes&#x27;s investigator, Derek Harvey, that the congressman had sequenced this trip to occur after the mid-term elections yet before Congress&#x27; return to session, so that Nunes would not have to disclose the trip details to his Democrat colleagues in Congress.&quot;

When asked by CNN to comment on his trips overseas to solicit dirt on Biden, Nunes responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t talk to you in this lifetime or the next lifetime. At any time. On any question.&quot;

On November 24, 2019, Nunes alleged in an interview with Fox News that CNN and the Daily Beast had committed crimes reporting on his trips to Europe and that he would pursue legal action against the news organizations for reporting the stories. In the interview, he did not answer the host Maria Bartiromo&#x27;s question about whether he had met with disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2018, saying he would be detailing all the facts in federal court filings.

That same day, CNBC reported that Lev Parnas was willing to testify under oath in Congress that Nunes&#x27;s aides called off a 2019 trip to Ukraine to dig up more dirt on Joe Biden when they realized he would have to report the trip to Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. CNBC reported that Parnas&#x27;s allegations &quot;potentially implicate Nunes and his committee staff in the same events the committee is currently investigating. Specifically, the monthslong effort by Trump, Giuliani and others to get Ukrainian officials to help them dig up dirt on Biden, and to validate far-right conspiracies about Ukraine and the 2016 election.&quot;

Nunes, who co-sponsored the &quot;Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act&quot;, has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits. On December 4, 2019, Nunes sued CNN for alleged defamation in &quot;Nunes v. CNN&quot;, seeking $435,350,000 in damages for their reporting of Parnas&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s statement. That month, an attorney for Nunes sent a letter to congressman Ted Lieu threatening to sue over Lieu&#x27;s comments about Nunes&#x27;s relationship with Parnas. In response, Lieu wrote, &quot;I welcome any lawsuit from your client and look forward to taking discovery of Congressman Nunes. Or, you can take your letter and shove it.&quot; Federal judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed Nunes&#x27;s suit against CNN on February 19, 2021.

On December 3, 2019, the report from the House Intelligence Committee regarding the impeachment inquiry documented with call records new information about Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s interactions with the White House, his associates and Nunes. The frequent contact of Giuliani and Lev Parnas, who has been indicted for criminal activity, with Nunes are regarded as &quot;highly unusual and likely to renew calls from Democrats for Mr. Nunes to face an ethics inquiry.&quot; The report detailed call records acquired by subpoenas from AT&amp;T that revealed Nunes to be in contact with Giuliani on April 10, and with Giuliani and Parnas on April 12, described in the report as the same days as other significant actions in the scandal, including phone calls between Giuliani and the White House and the Office of Management and Budget as well as a retainer agreement between Trump-affiliated lawyers diGenova &amp; Toensing and former Ukrainian officials Yuriy Lutsenko and Konstiantyn Kulyk, &quot;two of the primary sources&quot; for articles in &quot;The Hill&quot; that promoted the conspiracy theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Nunes asserted it was &quot;very unlikely&quot; he had spoken with Parnas, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t really recall that name.&quot;

After the report was released, CNN analysts suggested the new evidence raises questions about whether Nunes was an investigator or a participant in the Trump–Ukraine scandal.

On January 14, 2020, the House Intelligence Committee released text messages Parnas had provided investigators. Two days later, Nunes acknowledged he had spoken to Parnas, after previously suggesting he had not. The next day, the House Judiciary Committee released text messages between Nunes&#x27;s top aide Derek Harvey and Parnas in which they discussed arranging meetings for Harvey with Ukrainian officials.

===Defamation lawsuits filed by Nunes===

Nunes has filed multiple lawsuits characterized as Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (&quot;SLAPP&quot;). Experts have described the lawsuits as &quot;unlikely to succeed&quot; and &quot;virtually free of merit&quot;. Between 2019 and 2023, Nunes has filed at least 11 defamation suits; many have been dismissed, others have been voluntarily dropped by Nunes.

====Twitter, Liz Mair, Devin Nunes&#x27;s Mom, Devin Nunes&#x27;s Cow ====

On March 18, 2019, Nunes filed defamation lawsuits against Twitter, Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Mair, Mair Strategies LLC, and the Twitter accounts &quot;Devin Nunes&#x27;s Mom&quot; (@DevinNunesMom) and &quot;Devin Nunes&#x27;s Cow&quot; (@DevinCow), seeking $250million in damages. As the story went viral, the popularity of the defendants&#x27; accounts soared, gaining more followers than Nunes&#x27;s own account. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; cited this as an example of the Streisand effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrne_Dineen_3/19/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Watson of CBS News said the filing was &quot;particularly interesting&quot; because in 2018 Nunes supported the &quot;Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson_3/20/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A filing to quash a subpoena argued that &quot;no reasonable person would believe that Devin Nunes&#x27;s cow actually has a Twitter account&quot; as cows &quot;do not have the intelligence, language, or opposable digits needed to operate a Twitter account&quot;. In June 2020, a judge ruled that Twitter was immune from Nunes&#x27;s suit because of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In August 2021, the same judge dismissed the second of two suits Nunes had filed against Mair.

====McClatchy====

In April 2019, Nunes filed a separate $150million defamation lawsuit against the McClatchy Company and others. In May 2018, &quot;The Fresno Bee&quot;, a local paper owned by McClatchy, reported that in 2016 a former server of Alpha Omega Winery sued the winery, which is partly owned by Nunes. The server alleged that in 2015 some investors of the company held a yacht party that involved cocaine and prostitution. The report said it was &quot;unclear&quot; whether Nunes &quot;was aware of the lawsuit&quot; or involved in the fund-raising event at the yacht. He did not attend the party, nor was he mentioned in the lawsuit. Nunes said the article was politically motivated and improperly linked him to the fund-raiser. A McClatchy spokesperson defended the report and said Nunes&#x27;s claim was without merit. Some legal experts have speculated that even though both Nunes and McClatchy are based in California, he filed the lawsuit in Virginia because California has enacted stricter rules against strategic defamation lawsuits than Virginia. Kelly McBride of the Poynter Institute said the report did not say or imply that Nunes was at the party. According to her, his intention was to harm the &quot;Bee&quot; and similar lawsuits are designed to send a chilling effect on journalists. Nunes withdrew the suit in 2020.

====Buxman et. al.====

In August 2019, Nunes sued a group of activists who had tried to force Nunes to stop using &quot;farmer&quot; as his occupation on the 2018 ballot. The activists had argued that Nunes&#x27;s parents had long ago moved the family dairy farm to Iowa and Nunes himself had no apparent farming connection left other than a small investment in a friend&#x27;s Napa valley winery. Nunes withdrew the suit in 2019.

====Ryan Lizza and Hearst Magazines====

In September 2019, Nunes sued political journalist Ryan Lizza and Hearst Magazines, the publisher of &quot;Esquire&quot;, alleging that a 2018 &quot;Esquire&quot; story had damaged his reputation. Lizza wrote that Nunes&#x27;s family had &quot;secretly&quot; moved its dairy operation from California to Iowa in 2007. Nunes did not specifically contest the veracity of Lizza&#x27;s reporting, but claimed he &quot;fabricated a &#x27;secret&#x27; where none existed&quot;. By the time &quot;Esquire&quot; published the piece, &quot;The Bee&quot; had already covered the move to Iowa. Nunes alleged in the suit that &quot;Lizza stalked Plaintiff&#x27;s grammar-school aged nieces, behaved like a sex offender or pedophile cruising the local neighborhood for victims, frightened a family member to tears, and exploited a grieving mother.&quot; United States District Judge C. J. Williams, a Trump appointee, dismissed this suit in its entirety on August 5, 2020. On September 15, 2021, the Eighth Circuit Court upheld the dismissal of some counts but remanded the case back to the district court. On April 25, 2023, the district court ruled that the claims at issue were essentially accurate and dismissed the suit, including a similar suit filed by his relatives and the company NuStar Farms.

====Campaign for Accountability and Fusion GPS====

In September 2019, Nunes sued the liberal nonprofit Campaign for Accountability (CfA) and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The latter was hired to dig up dirt on Trump at the behest of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign. The research was compiled into the Steele dossier. In 2018 CfA filed three ethics complaints against Nunes. In the lawsuit he alleged that CfA and Fusion GPS had conspired to hinder his investigation into the dossier, citing a $138,684 payment from CfA to Fusion GPS. CfA said it did not hire Fusion GPS to investigate Nunes. The suit was dismissed in September 2020.

====CNN====

On December 4, 2019, Nunes sued CNN for alleged defamation, seeking $435,350,000 in damages for their reporting of Parnas&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s statement. The complaint stated, &quot;CNN is the mother of fake news. It is the least trusted name. CNN is eroding the fabric of America, proselytizing, sowing distrust and disharmony. It must be held accountable.&quot; He claimed that the network has an &quot;institutional hatred&quot; for the Republican Party. The suit alleges that CNN reported that Nunes traveled to Vienna in December 2018, and met with Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general, about investigating Joe Biden. The suit claims this is untrue and that Nunes was in Benghazi, followed by Malta. Before the filing of the CNN suit, an attorney representing McClatchy in Nunes&#x27;s suit told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Eric Wemple, &quot;He&#x27;s filing these lawsuits and threatening these lawsuits purely to try to chill speech about himself and matters of public interest.&quot; Federal judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed the suit on February 19, 2021.

====Ted Lieu====

On December 31, 2019, Nunes, through his Charlottesville, Virginia, attorney Steven S. Biss, issued a letter that threatened litigation against Representative Ted Lieu based on alleged damage to Nunes&#x27;s reputation. Lieu responded, &quot;I welcome any lawsuit from your client and look forward to taking discovery of Congressman Nunes. Or, you can take your letter and shove it.&quot;

====NBCUniversal====
On August 3, 2021, Nunes filed a defamation suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas which was transferred to the Southern District of New York, the domicile of the defendant, on February 28, 2022. The complaint alleges that several statements made by Rachel Maddow on defendant&#x27;s MSNBC network in March 2021 defamed Nunes. On November 28, 2022, Judge Kevin Castel ruled against Nunes on all but one claim, allowing the case to proceed on the one claim the judge found to &quot;plausibly allege actual malice&quot; and allowed the case to proceed with respect to that one claim.

====CNN and Jake Tapper====
On November 19, 2022, Nunes filed a defamation suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleging that several statements made on CNN on October 31, 2022, were defamatory. The case was dismissed in March 2023 on jurisdictional grounds since the segment and people who made it have no direct connection to the state of Florida. Nunes appealed the decision, which was denied on May 22, 2023, because his attorneys failed to respond to notices from the appellate court.

====The Guardian====

In April 2023, Nunes filed suit against &quot;The Guardian&quot;, alleging that he had been defamed by an article entitled &quot;Federal investigators examined Trump Media for possible money laundering, sources say&quot; claiming that the &quot;Defendants published and republished egregious statements online and via social media (Twitter) that falsely accused or implied that Nunes engaged in or aided and abetted money laundering.&quot; Also named in the suit is Will Wilkerson, former executive vice president of operations for Donald Trump&#x27;s media business and co-founder of Trump&#x27;s Truth Social website. Wilkerson provided 150,000 emails, contracts and other internal documents from Trump Media and Truth Social to law enforcement, and was interviewed by the Guardian for the article named in the lawsuit.

===Conservative Political Action Conference attendance===
In late February 2021, Nunes and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Nunes and the other lawmakers.

==Personal life==
Nunes married Elizabeth Nunes (&quot;née&quot; Tamariz), an elementary school teacher, in 2003. They have three daughters. Nunes is a practicing Catholic, and attends Mass in Tulare.

Nunes wrote a foreword for the 2012 edition of the 1951 novel &quot;Home Is An Island&quot; by Portuguese-American author Alfred Lewis. It was published by Tagus Press, an imprint of the Center for Portuguese Culture and Studies at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.

==Honors==

President Donald Trump awarded Nunes the Presidential Medal of Freedom on January 4, 2021, along with fellow Representative Jim Jordan. No media were allowed to document the ceremony. In a press release from the Trump White House before the ceremony, Nunes was described as having exposed illegal wiretapping by the Obama administration on Trump and the Trump campaign, as part of the unsubstantiated Trump Tower wiretapping allegations. In the same release Nunes is praised as having helped &quot;thwart a plot to take down a sitting United States president&quot;, in reference to his work to discredit the allegations (which the release calls the &quot;Russia Hoax&quot;) leading to Trump&#x27;s first impeachment.

Nunes has received the following foreign honors: 
: Grand-Officer of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (June 7, 2013)
: Commander of the Order of the Star of Romania, Romania (June 8, 2017)

<text>William Marshall Thomas (born December 6, 1941) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1979 to 2007, finishing his tenure representing California&#x27;s 22nd congressional district and as the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

==Early life and family==
Thomas was born in Wallace, Idaho, moving with his parents to Southern California. He graduated from Garden Grove High School, attended Santa Ana College, earning an associate&#x27;s degree before transferring to San Francisco State University, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree in political science in 1963 and 1965, respectively. He became an instructor at Bakersfield College before running for and winning a seat in the California State Assembly in 1974. He won election to the House of Representatives in 1978, representing the 18th congressional district.

Thomas married the former Sharon Lynn Hamilton in 1968. They have two grown children. He and his wife are Baptists.

==Career==

When &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine polled congressional aides on the &quot;best and worst&quot; of Congress, Thomas was voted #2 for &quot;brainiest&quot;, #3 for &quot;workhorse&quot;, and #1 for &quot;meanest&quot; and overwhelmingly for &quot;hottest temper&quot; in the House. Thomas is known for being able to comprehend and communicate the intricacies of obscure legislative matters, studying testimony and research reports himself instead of relying on executive summaries from his aides. Thomas is also known for losing his temper when people are unprepared, earning a reputation for sharp interrogations. &quot;He&#x27;s revered, but he&#x27;s also reviled to some degree&quot;, fellow representative Mark Foley told &quot;CQ Weekly&quot;.

Thomas was a key proponent of several of President George W. Bush&#x27;s agenda items, including three major tax cut bills and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (PL 108–173), and was also instrumental in the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

On March 6, 2006, Thomas announced he would not seek reelection, retiring after 28 years in the House. A major influence on his decision was the internal GOP term limits that would require him to relinquish his Ways and Means chairmanship even if he were re-elected. Thomas endorsed a former aide, Assemblyman Kevin McCarthy, who was elected to replace him. Following McCarthy&#x27;s vote to decertify the 2020 presidential election, Thomas said that McCarthy was a &quot;hypocrite&quot; and generally lambasted his behavior in regard to that election. Thomas has criticized McCarthy in several interviews since that time.

In 2007, after leaving the House, Thomas joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting fellow working on tax policy, trade policy, and health care policy. Thomas also joined law and lobbying firm Buchanan, Ingersoll &amp; Rooney.

On September 8, 2016, Thomas was named to the Kern Community College District Board of Trustees for Area 1, filling the seat of Rick Wright. He did not run for reelection in 2018. He was replaced by Nan Gomez-Heitzeberg.

===Controversies===

====1992: Congressional banking scandal====

In the 1992 Rubbergate banking scandal, involving House members writing checks when the funds were not available, Thomas bounced 119 checks, the tenth-highest amount for a Republican member of Congress. A brief overdraft of $16,200, occurred in October 1989, as he wrote a $15,300 check to buy a car.

===2001: alleged affair with lobbyist===
The &quot;Bakersfield Californian&quot; published an article on Thomas about an affair with Deborah Steelman, a lobbyist for Cigna, Pfizer, Aetna, United Healthcare Corporation, the Healthcare Leadership Council, and Prudential. Thomas was then chair of the House subcommittee that regulates HMOs. &quot;Any personal failures of commitment or responsibility to my wife, family or friends are just that, personal,&quot; the former congressman wrote in an &quot;open letter to friends and neighbors.&quot; Neither he nor Steelman explicitly denied the allegations. She was promoted to Vice President of Eli Lilly, a position which she used to steer huge campaign gifts to Thomas&#x27;s war chest.

The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 prohibited Medicare from negotiating prescription prices with the drug industry, for instance.

=== 2003: controversy involving U.S. Capitol police ===
In July 2003, Thomas called the U.S. Capitol Police to eject Democrats from a meeting room. A few days later, he tearfully apologized on the House floor for what he called his &quot;just plain stupid&quot; decision to ask the police to eject the Congressmen.

<doc id="408884" wikidata="Q459693" url="?curid=408884" title="Lois Capps">
<text>Lois Ragnhild Capps (née Grimsrud; January 10, 1938) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1998 to 2017. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district, numbered as the 22nd District from 1998 to 2003 and the 23rd from 2003 to 2013, includes all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and a portion of Ventura County.

Capps served on the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where she was a member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Health. She was a member of the New Democrat Coalition.

==Early life and education==
Capps was born Lois Ragnhild Grimsrud in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, the daughter of Solveig Magdalene (née Gullixson) and Rev. Jurgen Milton Grimsrud, a Lutheran minister. Both of her parents&#x27; families came from Norway. She has lived in Santa Barbara since 1964. She was educated at Pacific Lutheran University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in nursing. She earned a master&#x27;s degree in religion at Yale Divinity School in 1964 and a Master of Arts degree in education at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 1990.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Walter Capps was elected to Congress in 1996 in a rematch of his 1994 race against Republican Andrea Seastrand. However, he died of a heart attack on October 28, 1997, only nine months into his term. His widow won the then-22nd District seat by defeating Republican Tom Bordonaro in a special election on March 10, 1998. She was sworn into the 105th Congress on March 17. Lois Capps defended her seat against Bordonaro in a general election later that year and commenced her first full term in office.

In 2000, Capps retained the 22nd district seat, defeating Republican Mike Stoker with 53% of the vote. She was the first Democrat to hold the district for more than one term in over 50 years (the district, known as the 11th from its formation in 1943 until 1953, the 13th from 1953 to 1975, and the 19th from 1975 to 1993, had been held by Republicans from 1947 until Walter Capps was sworn in 1997).

Capps&#x27; district was renumbered as the 23rd after the 2000 census and made somewhat safer, and she was reelected without serious opposition in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. Her district was renumbered as the 24th District after the 2010 census. David Wasserman, House editor of &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot;, predicted that this would be a more difficult race, and local Republicans confirmed that Capps was one of their top targets in California. The reconfigured district still includes Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, but was redrawn to include most of the more Republican inland areas of Santa Barbara County. Capps eventually beat her opponent, Abel Maldonado, with 54.8% of the vote.

In 2014, Capps ran against Republican Chris Mitchum, an actor, screenwriter, and businessman. Mitchum is the son of legendary film star Robert Mitchum. This was Mitchum&#x27;s second consecutive try for the 24th district, having previously lost the 2012 primary to Abel Maldonado. In the closest race of her entire congressional career, Capps ultimately won with only a 3.8% margin over Mitchum.

Capps announced in April 2015 that she would not seek reelection in 2016.

===Political positions===
Capps has been described as a &quot;solid liberal&quot;. In &quot;The Washingtonian&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Best and Worst of Congress&quot; poll of congressional staffers, Capps was named the nicest member of Congress.

In 2011, Capps voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain American citizens and others without trial indefinitely.

;Health care
Capps supported the Obama administration&#x27;s economic stimulus and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. She was strongly critical of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment to the latter, which placed limits on taxpayer-funding of abortions (except in the cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother&#x27;s life). Capps had earlier sponsored the Capps Amendment, which was defeated and replaced by the Stupak Amendment. Capps introduced the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013 which would, if enacted, authorize the NIH to support, fund, and coordinate data from research on rare pediatric diseases.

;Foreign policy
In 2012, she was the only member of the House to vote &quot;no&quot; on Resolution 556 to condemn the government of Iran for its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of Youcef Nadarkhani of the charge of apostasy. The resolution passed 417–1 with 15 non-votes. Her spokeswoman later said that Capps strongly supported the resolution, but cast the no vote by mistake.

;Environmental policy
In 2004, the House passed her legislation prohibiting &quot;comprehensive inventory of oil and gas resources beneath the outer continental shelf.&quot; She was also a vocal opponent of drilling for oil in the Los Padres National Forest and offshore drilling off the coast of California.

===Legislation sponsored===
* H.R. 3008; 113th Congress -- &quot;to provide for the conveyance of a small parcel of National Forest System land in Los Padres National Forest in California&quot; -- Capps introduced this bill, which would swap a parcel of federal land with the White Lotus Foundation in exchange for a parcel of their land. The White Lotus Foundation offers training in yoga and wanted the land to build better access to their site.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Energy and Power
** Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
** Subcommittee on Health

===Caucus membership===
* Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Women&#x27;s Issues
* Co-Chair of the National Marine Sanctuary Caucus
* Co-Chair of the Congressional Coastal Caucus
* Co-Chair of the Biomedical Research Caucus
* Co-Chair of the House Cancer Caucus
* Co-Chair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition
* Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Infant Health and Safety
* Founded the Congressional Nursing Caucus
* Founded the School Health and Safety Caucus
* Member of the Veterinary Medicine Caucus

==Personal life==
In 1960, while at Yale, she married Walter Capps, a divinity student who later became a prominent religious studies professor at UCSB; they eventually had three children. Walter died in 1997 and their eldest daughter died in 2000. Lois Capps worked for 20 years as a nurse and health advocate for the Santa Barbara public schools and also taught early childhood education part-time at Santa Barbara City College. Capps&#x27; daughter Laura was married to Bill Burton, a political consultant who served as Deputy White House Press Secretary in the Obama administration.

<doc id="408887" wikidata="Q542676" url="?curid=408887" title="Elton Gallegly">
<text>Elton William Gallegly (born March 7, 1944) is a former U.S. Representative from California. A Republican, he last represented . He previously represented the 23rd and 21st Districts, and served from 1987 to 2013. He did not seek re-election in 2012.

Gallegly is the longest-serving Congressional representative in Ventura County history.

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
Born in Huntington Park, California on March 7, 1944, Gallegly attended California State University, Los Angeles but did not graduate. He worked as a real estate broker before entering politics. Gallegly is a former member of the Simi Valley, California City Council. He became Simi Valley&#x27;s first elected mayor in 1982.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1986, incumbent Republican U.S. Congresswoman Bobbi Fiedler decided to retire to run for the U.S. Senate. Gallegly won the primary with 50% of the vote over Tony Hope, the son of famed entertainer Bob Hope. In the general election, he won with 68% of the vote. He won re-election in 1988 with 69% and in 1990 with 58%. In 1992, he defeated Democrat Anita Perez Ferguson 54%–41%. Since then, he won re-election with at least 58% of the vote, except in 2000. That year, he defeated Democrat Michael Case 54%–41%.

;2006
On March 10, 2006, Gallegly announced his intent to retire from the House of Representatives after the 2006 mid-term elections, citing health concerns. He had already filed nomination papers to seek another term, however, and attempted to have his name removed from the Republican primary ballot. California election law, though, makes it clear that a candidate&#x27;s name can only be withdrawn in the case of their death and, as a result, that Gallegly&#x27;s name would have to remain on the ballot. The following week, after learning that he could not have his name removed from the ballot and that no new challengers would be allowed to enter the race, Gallegly changed his mind and decided to seek what he said would be his final term. He won re-election with 62% of the vote.

;2008
Gallegly won re-election with 58% of the vote.

;2010
Gallegly won re-election with 60% of the vote.

The top 5 groups or industries that have contributed cash to Representative Gallegly&#x27;s 2009/2010 campaign are:
(1) Retirees: $39,484
(2) Real Estate: $35,578 
(3) Lawyers/Law Firms: $29,374
(4) Pharmaceuticals: $22,500, and
(5) Crop Production/Processing $20,179.

===Tenure===
Gallegly&#x27;s activism has focused on the issue of animal rights. Gallegly himself wrote a bill, enacted in 1999, which made it a federal crime to sell videos of dogfights and other depictions of animal violence, which enabled people to profit from animal cruelty. However, on April 20, 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States, in an 8–1 ruling written by Chief Justice John Roberts, overturned Gallegly&#x27;s law on the ground that the law violated the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, and created a &quot;criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.&quot;

In his defense, Gallegly argued that the bill he wrote contained &quot;exceptions for religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, and artistic expression [that] may have provided too many loopholes within the legislation. Bob Stevens was convicted of committing animal cruelty as defined by the law, but claimed that his rights to free speech and artistic expression protected him against prosecution.&quot; Representative Gallegly objected to Stevens’ defense, claiming that the videos &quot;promote violence and, as such, are not protected by the Constitution.&quot;.

In 2011, Gallegly voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.

Gallegly was a supporter of gifted and talented education, having introduced the Gifted and Talented Students Act of 1998 to provide funding for gifted education.

In January 2012, it was reported that Gallegly received so-called &quot;VIP&quot; or &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; loans from troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, in which loans were granted at lower rates than were available to the public. Gallegly and names of other legislators were forwarded to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which begun an investigation into the issue. Gallegly denied knowing that he was part of Countrywide Financial&#x27;s special loan program.

<doc id="408890" wikidata="Q4656398" url="?curid=408890" title="A Delicate Balance (play)">
<text>A Delicate Balance is a three-act play by Edward Albee, written in 1965 and 1966. Premiered in 1966, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1967, the first of three he received for his work.

The uneasy existence of upper-middle-class suburbanites Agnes and Tobias and their permanent houseguest, Agnes&#x27;s witty and alcoholic sister Claire, is disrupted by the sudden appearance of lifelong family friends Harry and Edna, fellow empty nesters with free-floating anxiety, who ask to stay with them to escape an unnamed terror. They soon are followed by Agnes and Tobias&#x27;s bitter 36-year-old daughter Julia, who returns home following the collapse of her fourth marriage.

== Plot and summary ==

===Act I ===
Agnes, an upper-class woman in her late 50s, discusses the possibility of losing her mind. Agnes exclaims that although she is astonished by her own thoughts of madness, it is her sister, Claire, who lives with them, who astonishes her the most. Claire appears and apologizes to Agnes that her own nature is such to bring out in her sister the full force of her brutality. Claire senses that Tobias and Agnes&#x27;s daughter Julia might be going on her fourth divorce and predicts that Julia will be coming home shortly. Agnes reenters, announcing that Julia is coming home. Tobias then tells the story of a cat that he once had. There is a knock on the door. Harry and Edna, Agnes and Tobias&#x27;s best friends, arrive and ask if they can stay there. They have been frightened by something intangible.

===Act II ===
Agnes and Julia are discussing the fact that Harry and Edna are occupying Julia&#x27;s old bedroom. Harry and Edna have spent the entire day in the room. Julia whines to Tobias next about not having her room. Claire enters and chides Julia about her new divorce. Julia teases Claire back about her drinking. After asking Tobias for a drink, she announces that “there is no point in pressing” the issue of Harry and Edna. At the end of scene 1, Harry and Edna appear with their coats over their arms. They announce they are going home but will return with their suitcases.
Scene 2 opens with Julia and Agnes alone after dinner. Julia is disgusted with her mother&#x27;s desire to control everyone&#x27;s conversations and emotions. Agnes retorts, “There is a balance to be maintained...and I must be the fulcrum.” Agnes and Tobias leave to help Harry and Edna unload their suitcases from their car. Edna enters and tells Julia that it is time for her to grow up. Julia reminds Edna that she is a guest in the house, and Edna responds that she and Harry are Agnes and Tobias&#x27;s best friends. When Harry enters, he goes to fix everyone a drink at the bar. Julia blocks him from the bar and insists that he stay away from it. Julia yells “I WANT...WHAT IS MINE!” and leaves the room. Agnes reminisces about the death of her son. She suspects that Tobias has been unfaithful, and asks Harry and Claire to confirm it, but they both deny it. After Tobias attempts to excuse Julia as being in hysterics, Julia reappears with a gun in her hand. She insists that Harry and Edna leave. Edna declares, “We have rights here. We belong,” and insists that she and Harry are staying there forever, “if need be.”

===Act III ===
Tobias has stayed up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. She tells Tobias that it is his role to make all the decisions with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house in spite of the fact that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that Harry and Edna have the right to be there because they are friends. He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes..too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes&#x27;s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out, to let the mind go raving mad, and when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.”

==Characters and cast==
Notable casts
===Agnes===
Agnes is the main female character of the play. She is a woman in her 50s, well off, and married to Tobias. She is also the mother of Julia and the sister of Claire. Agnes believes herself to be the fulcrum of the family, keeping everyone in balance. She often maintains this balance, or order, by not confronting issues, not taking a stand, and not processing emotions. She tries to keep the peace by not dealing with anything that might upset it.

On the surface, Agnes is completely supportive of her husband Tobias. She looks to him to confirm her thoughts, and likewise, she confirms his. It is not until near the end of the play that she brings up issues that show cracks in her relationship with her husband. When the memory of the death of her son is brought to the surface of her thoughts, she reminisces about how difficult a time that was for her, a time when she questioned everything, including her husband&#x27;s love and faithfulness to her.

Although she feels as if she is the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if she could just suddenly slip off into madness and what that would be like. She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.”

Agnes&#x27;s relationship with her daughter Julia does not fare much better. Julia also embarrasses her mother. When Julia becomes hysterical, Tobias asks Agnes to go talk to their daughter. Agnes&#x27;s response is “I haven’t the time.” Instead of empathizing with Julia, Agnes becomes more self-absorbed. She tells her husband that she has suffered far more than her daughter. This same self-absorption is apparent in all of Agnes&#x27;s relationships. She easily becomes lost in self-pity and at the same time believes herself to be above everyone around her. If she is the fulcrum of the balance in the family, Albee portrays her as a very unstable one. Albee has admitted that the character of Agnes is based on his real-life adopted mother.

===Claire===
Claire is Agnes&#x27;s younger sister. She claims that she is not an alcoholic but rather a willful drinker. Of all the characters in the play, whether it is due to the alcohol or not, Claire has the loosest tongue. She speaks her mind and is the least affected by social politeness.

Claire lives with Agnes and Tobias and appears to have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life seems to be to annoy and embarrass her sister. She is everything that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he would be better off if he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.

Claire&#x27;s relationship with Julia is closer than her relationship with anyone else. She and Julia identify with one another in their roles as the “other”—people on the periphery of Tobias&#x27;s and Agnes&#x27;s lives. Claire and Julia are the rebels, the failures, the embarrassments that must be tolerated. When Julia arrives home, Claire greets her more honestly, more warmly than do Julia&#x27;s parents.

Despite Claire&#x27;s open disdain for her sister, she has never told Agnes about Tobias&#x27;s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, almost as if she has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may have to use it one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire&#x27;s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes describes Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to...Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly...You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee&#x27;s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.

===Edna===
Edna is Harry&#x27;s wife. It is not clear if she is really Agnes&#x27;s friend or if she and Agnes know one another only because their husbands are friends. Edna arrives one day at the door of Agnes and Tobias&#x27;s home. She takes it for granted that they will let her and Harry stay there for however long it takes them to get over their unnamed fear.

Despite the fact that the relationship between Edna and Agnes is not clear (their names are very similar), Edna sometimes takes on the role of mother to Julia. Although Edna&#x27;s manner is dissimilar, her sentiments are comparable to Agnes&#x27;s. Edna is not afraid to voice her opinions. Edna tells Julia that she is no longer a child and should take more responsibility for her life. She also declares that Julia no longer has rights in her parents’ house.

Edna also confronts Agnes and tells her to stop making fun of her and her husband Harry. Although Edna may not be able to name the fear that has driven her out of her own house, she appears to be quite capable of naming the things that other people are doing wrong in their lives.

But then again, it is Edna, in the end, who realizes that there are boundaries, even between friends. She understands that there are some boundaries that should not be pushed, some things that “we may not do ... not ask, for fear of looking in a mirror.” And it is also through her reflection that the play resolves. Edna has looked into that mirror at the end of the play and has decided that if the tables were turned, if Agnes and Tobias had come to her, she would not have allowed them to stay at her house.

===Harry===
Harry is Edna&#x27;s husband and Tobias&#x27;s best friend. At one point in the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been businessmen and meeting at the same club, it is unclear what else Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another for a long time and neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, he is a man of few words with pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at them straight on. He also avoids questions, like when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes&#x27;s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point he repeats the same line four times when he tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.

===Julia===
Julia is the 36-year-old daughter of Agnes and Tobias. Three times divorced, she has recently left her fourth husband, and has returned home. Her father calls her a whiner, and her mother has little time for her. Julia has set a pattern in her life of marrying for the wrong reasons and then divorcing and returning home. Her parents welcome her, although they make it clear that they wish she would establish an independent life of her own.

Julia is the catalyst of the play. While the other characters either hide their emotions in alcohol or avoid confrontations by smothering their feelings in banal talk, Julia brings matters to the forefront. She has wants, and she demands that they be at least heard, if not satisfied. The most obvious thing that she wants in this play is her bedroom in her parents’ home. However, upon her return, she discovers that her room is being occupied by Edna and Harry, her parents’ so-called best friends. In her attempts to regain control of her bedroom, Julia makes everyone confront the issues of the play, namely defining relationships, wants, needs, and rights. At one point, Julia forces the issue first by having an emotional tantrum, then by upsetting the furniture and all the clothes in her bedroom, and finally by threatening everyone with a gun.

Julia tends to put down her mother and commiserate with her mother&#x27;s sister Claire. Julia acts as if she is Claire&#x27;s friend until Claire points her finger at Julia and lets her know that Julia is as much a visitor in her parents’ home as Harry and Edna are.

Julia, Claire, Harry, and Edna are portrayed as invaders in the lives of Agnes and Tobias. They all have their own reasons for needing to be there: None of them is able to make it alone in the outside world. Julia falls back on her childhood to claim her spot, even though she is nearing middle age. She has little empathy for the others who are also seeking comfort in the same house. The character of Julia is based on Barbara Lauder, one of Albee&#x27;s cousins. 

===Tobias===
Tobias is Agnes&#x27;s husband and the father of Julia. He is a well-to-do, retired businessman. Although he is tolerant of people around him, he, like his wife, tends to avoid emotional topics. His tolerance toward his sister-in-law Claire is shown in his nonjudgmental attitude toward her drinking. Although he encourages her to return to Alcoholics Anonymous at one point in the play, he does not berate her for drinking. In some ways, he even encourages it or at least does not discourage it. There are a few subtle insinuations that Claire and Tobias might have at one time had an affair, but this is initially only alluded to by script directions that have Claire open her arms to Tobias in a “casual invitation”. Later in the play, Agnes asks Tobias (when he cannot sleep) if he went to Claire.

Whether Tobias had an affair with Claire is not certain; however, his infidelity is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. Despite all this, Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, even though they have not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in the way that he reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all people, should not worry about going mad.

Tobias appears to be closer to his daughter than Agnes is. However, the degree of intimacy is not considerably greater. Tobias is the more concerned parent when Julia becomes hysterical, although he does nothing but ask Agnes to console her. It is Tobias who takes the gun away from his daughter, and it is Tobias to whom Julia apologizes for her outburst.

If Agnes is the fulcrum, then Tobias is the energy behind the fulcrum that works at keeping a balance in this dysfunctional family. He constantly is asking people to talk more kindly about one another. Or, in the least, it is Tobias who keeps silent while fury flares around him. It is also Tobias who serves everyone drinks as if trying to soften the edges of their grievances with alcohol.

It is Tobias&#x27;s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) who bring the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias to define what friendship is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias&#x27;s friend Harry has the right to move into Tobias&#x27;s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells in the middle of the play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat&#x27;s noncompliance, and eventually he hits the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his 30-something daughter to continually move in and out of his house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry&#x27;s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry&#x27;s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.

<text>Howard Philip &quot;Buck&quot; McKeon (born September 9, 1938) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from California&#x27;s 25th congressional district from 1993 to 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party. He is a former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Education Committee.

==Early life and education==
Born in Tujunga, Los Angeles, California, McKeon graduated from Verdugo Hills High School. He spent two years as a Mormon missionary before enrolling at Brigham Young University. He later received his Bachelor of Science degree in animal husbandry in 1985, after previously putting his studies on hold to raise a family and establish his early business career.

== Early career ==
He was an owner of a Western-themed clothing retail chain, Howard &amp; Phil&#x27;s Western Wear. The business went bankrupt in 1999, though at that point he hadn&#x27;t worked for the chain in years. He had also worked as the chairman of a small, regional bank. McKeon gained his first political experience when he was elected to the William S. Hart High School District board of trustees.

McKeon was a one-term councilman of Santa Clarita, being one of the first to hold that post after the city incorporated in 1987. He held that position until entering the House.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services (Chairman)
**As chair of the full committee, McKeon may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees. Even though he is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, McKeon never served in the armed forces.
*Committee on Education and the Workforce
**Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training

In 2009, McKeon served as ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. In June, President Barack Obama nominated Representative John M. McHugh of New York, who was the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, as Secretary of the Army. On June 9, the House Republican leadership appointed McKeon as the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee. Under rules of the House of Representatives, McKeon was required to step down from his position as ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, though he continued to serve on the committee. McKeon was named chairman of the Committee on Armed Services in January, following the Republican takeover of the House in the November 2010 elections.

As a member of the House, he made education and defense issues two of his main priorities. He was greatly involved in the reform of the Student Loan Aid Program, which reduced interest rates but controversially increased federal control over education policy, such as teacher training. He also supports a strong national defense budget. Along with Dean Gallo of New Jersey, McKeon introduced the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on March 11, 1993. McKeon was a member of the Republican Study Committee.

===Political campaigns===
In 1992, California gained seven additional seats following the census. A new 25th District was created in the Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys in north Los Angeles County and the communities of Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Northridge, and Porter Ranch in the northwestern San Fernando Valley. McKeon was thus the first congressman to represent the new district.

In the 2002 reapportionment, the San Fernando Valley and portions of the Antelope Valley were removed from the 25th District. To make up for the loss of population, the district was pushed all the way to the Nevada border, taking in all of Inyo and Mono counties and about half of the land area within San Bernardino County. The Los Angeles County portion of the district still included the cities of Santa Clarita, Palmdale, and part of the city of Lancaster.

In 2012, the California Citizens Redistricting Commission drew new lines for the 25th district, pushing it well to the north and making it somewhat more compact. It retained its share of Los Angeles County, added parts of Porter Ranch and Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley, and expanded into parts of Ventura County, including most of Simi Valley.

During the 2006 election cycle, McKeon received 60% of the vote in his district, defeating Democrat Robert Rodriguez and Libertarian David Erickson. The district has been considered to be &quot;safe&quot; for the Republican Party because it included predominantly Republican areas in the Antelope and Santa Clarita Valleys and conservative rural areas of the High Sierra and desert regions of California. McKeon handily won reelection with 58% of the vote in 2008, even though Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama carried the district over his Republican rival John McCain.

McKeon&#x27;s campaigns received the greatest financial support from the defense industry, especially aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing. Additionally, he is endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the California Pro-Life Council.

===Political positions===

McKeon served as the chairman on the Armed Services Committee. He held the position from January 2011 to January 2015. He was previously the ranking member of the committee. California&#x27;s 25th District holds several military bases, including Fort Irwin, Edwards Air Force Base, Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, and the Marine Mountain Warfare Training Center. Although he has spoken strongly against Obama&#x27;s budgets and governmental support of the economy and has encouraged reducing spending, McKeon opposed cutting the military budget, stating, &quot;a defense budget in decline portends an America in decline.&quot;

McKeon voted in favor of American military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Barack Obama&#x27;s Afghanistan &quot;surge&quot; strategy, and has voted for increasing money and supplies to troops there. He has gone on record saying that withdrawal from Afghanistan should be conditions-based, and done with full consultation with senior military leadership. In a statement from May 2010, McKeon outlined his personal philosophy on the role of the United States and its military, calling for a return to &quot;peace through strength&quot; and Reagan-esque policies, including full financial and material support for the military in its current wars, keeping Guantanamo Bay open, and military posturing.

In a speech before the Foreign Policy Initiative research group in 2010, McKeon called for increases in government spending on defense above Obama&#x27;s budgets. He has also called on Congress to &quot;embrace and build on&quot; Robert Gates&#x27; plan to find $100 billion in savings in the defense budget.

In 2011 McKeon organized a fundraiser for the &quot;Lucky 13&quot; Republican freshmen on the House Armed Services Committee to get contributions from defense contractor political action committees.

In 2011, McKeon proposed Section 1034, an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that would have inserted the language &quot;Congress affirms that ... the President has the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force during the current armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces pursuant to&quot; the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF Against Terrorists) (Public Law 107–40) and stated that &quot;the current armed conflict includes nations, organization, and persons who (A) are part of, or are substantially supporting, al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; or (B) have engaged in hostilities or have directly supported hostilities in aid of a nation, organization, or person described in subparagraph (A).&quot; McKeon also offered an NDAA proposal that &quot;contained a provision designed to require military detention of terrorism suspects, even those arrested domestically and even those who are U.S. citizens,&quot; but this was later watered down to a proposal stating that the president, under the AUMF Against Terrorists, had &quot;the authority to detain belligerents...until the termination of hostilities. President Obama did not request that this language be included, and in a statement the White House issued a veto threat and said &quot;The Administration strongly objects to section 1034 which, in purporting to affirm the conflict, would effectively recharacterize its scope and would risk creating confusion regarding applicable standards.&quot; The expansive language of Section 1034 was criticized in a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial, which called it an unnecessary and dangerous proposal and said that it was &quot;wildly expansive authorization would, in essence, make the war on terror a permanent and limitless aspect of life on earth, along with its huge potential for abuse.&quot; The American Civil Liberties Union also criticized McKeon&#x27;s proposal. U.S. Representative Justin Amash (Republican of Michigan) and Representative Barbara Lee (Democrat of California) offered an amendment that would remove McKeon&#x27;s Section 1034 (the &quot;so-called &#x27;endless war&#x27;&quot; provision) from the NDAA bill. The House rejected the Amash-Lee amendment by a 234–187, with most Democrats voting in favor and most Republicans voting against. President Obama ultimately signed the 2012 NDAA with the contentious provisions, but in February 2012, issued a set of broad waivers that allowed U.S. law enforcement agencies &quot;to retain custody of al-Qaeda terrorism suspects rather than turn them over to the military&quot; as contemplated by the NDAA. Human Rights Watch said that Obama&#x27;s waiver was &quot;essentially a 3,450-word line-item veto, rendering the mandatory military detention provision mostly moot.&quot;

McKeon said if forced to choose between tax increases and cuts to the Pentagon budget, he would choose tax increases. However he would prefer to cut entitlement spending instead. In 2012, McKeon sought a one-year fix to stave off the defense budget cuts from sequestration, although he had previously voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included sequestration. McKeon led efforts by some Republicans that contributed to replacement of the sequester cuts for 2014 and 2015 with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. In 2014 McKeon said of Obama&#x27;s plan to raise taxes on banks and millionaires, &quot;I think that would be wonderful but it&#x27;s not going to happen&quot;. He dismissed calls to replace USMC jet fighters destroyed by the Taliban in the September 2012 Camp Bastion raid.

McKeon opposed abortion. He was endorsed by the California Pro-Life Council. He opposed &quot;amnesty for those who have entered the country illegally&quot; and emphasized border security. The congressman threatened to derail the 2012 defense authorization bill unless it contained provisions prohibiting military chaplains from officiating at same-sex marriages and restricting access to the civil court system by persons suspected of terrorism.

McKeon introduced the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, a bill that the House Armed Services Committee renamed in his honor. According to the House Armed Services Committee, which oversaw the legislation, the bill &quot;will be the comprehensive legislation to authorize the budget authority of the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy.&quot; The total appropriations that are authorized amount to approximately $600 billion for fiscal year 2015.

===Countrywide Financial loan===
In January 2012, it was reported that McKeon received a so-called &quot;VIP&quot; or &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; loan from troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, in which loans were granted at lower interest rates than were available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo created the program to boost the company&#x27;s standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. The congressman received a $315,000 loan from Countrywide at below-market rates in the late 1990s. A congressional probe identified an internal Countrywide email regarding McKeon&#x27;s loan that stated: &quot;Per Angelo—&#x27;take off 1 point, no garbage fees, approve the loan and make it a no doc.&#x27;&quot; McKeon and names of other legislators who received similar loans were subsequently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as part of an ethics investigation into improper gifts. McKeon denied knowing that he was part of Countrywide Financial&#x27;s special loan program. In a response to a press inquiry about his knowledge of the loan discounts McKeon stated, &quot;If I had known we had got a good deal then I would have gotten all my loans from Countrywide.&quot;

==Personal life==
McKeon is married to the former Patricia Kunz. They have six children and 31 grandchildren. They are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Patricia Kunz McKeon was active in her husband&#x27;s political campaigns, serving as treasurer and drawing a salary, which has been the subject of controversy. According to a study by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, McKeon&#x27;s campaign committees paid her a total of $263,168 between 2001 and 2006 - the highest such payment in the group of Representatives studied by CREW. In the 2005-2006 election cycle she was paid $110,000 to do fundraising and prepare campaign finance reports. She has also worked as a lobbyist.
