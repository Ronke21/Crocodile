<text>The Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, originally the Crown Jewels of England, are a collection of royal ceremonial objects kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, which include the coronation regalia and vestments worn by British monarchs.

The coronation regalia are the only working set in Europe and the collection is the most historically complete of any royal regalia in the world. Objects used at the coronation ceremony variously denote the monarch&#x27;s roles as head of state of the United Kingdom, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and head of the British armed forces. The regalia feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and other Commonwealth countries.

Use of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when the country was converted to Christianity in the Early Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12th century. The sacred holy relics were kept at Westminster Abbey, venue of coronations since 1066, while monarchs wore another set of regalia at religious feasts and State Openings of Parliament. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of the Crown. Most of the collection dates from around 1660 when Charles II ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had either been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the English Civil War. Only four original items predate the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th-century swords. The regalia continued to be used by British monarchs after the kingdoms of England and Scotland united in 1707.

The regalia contain around 23,578 gemstones, among them Cullinan I (), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the eponymous Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to Edward VII. In the Imperial State Crown are Cullinan II (), the Stuart Sapphire, St Edward&#x27;s Sapphire, and the Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby – a large red spinel. The Koh-i-Noor diamond () was acquired by Queen Victoria from the Sikh Empire and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of disused objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystal replicas.

At a coronation, the monarch is anointed using holy oil poured from an ampulla into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with St Edward&#x27;s Crown. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings, known as queens consort, are invested with a plainer set of regalia. Also regarded as crown jewels are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the Royal Collection and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next. In the Jewel House they are seen by 2.5 million visitors every year.
==History==

===Prehistory and Romans===
The earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in Deal, Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150 BC. A sword, brooch, ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a single arch, which sat directly on the head of its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the Deal Warrior. At this point, crowns were symbols of authority worn by religious and military leaders. Priests continued to use crowns following the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD. A dig in a field at Hockwold cum Wilton, Norfolk, in the 1950s revealed a bronze crown with two arches and depictions of male faces, as well as two bronze diadems with an adjustable headband and &quot;repoussé&quot; silver embellishments, dating from the Roman period. One diadem features a plaque in the centre depicting a man holding a sphere and an object similar to a shepherd&#x27;s crook, analogues of the orb and sceptre that evolved later as royal ornaments.

===Anglo-Saxons===
By the early 5th century, the Romans had withdrawn from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One method used by regional kings to solidify their authority was the use of ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king – evidence suggests Rædwald of East Anglia () – at Sutton Hoo illustrates the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon monarch. Inside the early 7th-century tomb, discovered in 1939, was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, consisting of an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask decorated with copper alloy images of animals and warriors set with garnets. He was also buried with a decorated sword; a ceremonial shield; and a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag.

In 597 CE, a Benedictine monk was sent by Pope Gregory I to start converting Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with which they were buried upon death. In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the Byzantine tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns.

King Æthelstan () united the various Anglo-Saxon realms to form the Kingdom of England. In the earliest known depiction of an English king wearing a crown he is shown presenting a copy of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Cuthbert&quot; to the saint himself. Until his reign, kings were portrayed on coins wearing helmets and circlets, or wreath-like diadems in the style of Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Whether they actually wore such an item is not known. Edgar the Peaceful () was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced for his coronation. After crowns, sceptres were the most potent symbols of royal authority in medieval England.

===Edward the Confessor===
Edward the Confessor () is depicted on a throne and wearing a crown while holding a sceptre in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry. Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became an important part of William I&#x27;s efforts to assert authority over his new territory and subjects. At his death in 1087, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reported: &quot;[William] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year as often as he was in England … He was so stern and relentless … we must not forget the good order he kept in the land&quot;. Those crown-wearings were held on the religious festivals of Easter, Whitsun, and Christmas.

In 1161, Edward the Confessor was made a saint, and objects connected with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place, Westminster Abbey, claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and that they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of precious relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; a crown and two rods for the queen&#x27;s coronation; and a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold for the Holy Communion. Although the Abbey&#x27;s claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward&#x27;s grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe. Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch, and the regalia had always been royal property – the abbots were mere custodians. In the following centuries, some of these objects would fall out of use and the regalia would expand to include many others used or worn by monarchs and queens consort at coronations.

An object referred to as &quot;St Edward&#x27;s Crown&quot; is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of Henry III () and appears to be the same crown worn by Edward. Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king&#x27;s legitimacy. The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its destruction in the 1600s. Few descriptions survive, although one 17th-century historian noted it was &quot;ancient Work with Flowers, adorn&#x27;d with Stones of somewhat a plain setting&quot;, and an inventory described it as &quot;gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells&quot;, weighing . Edward is thought to be the first English king who wore a crown with arches. Known as a &#x27;closed&#x27; or imperial crown, the arches and cross symbolised the king as an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman emperor. Also in the Royal Collection was an item called a state crown, which together with other crowns, rings, and swords, constituted the monarch&#x27;s state regalia that were kept mainly at royal palaces, separate from the coronation regalia.

===Late medieval period===
The handing over of crowns symbolised the transfer of power between rulers. Following the defeat in 1282 of the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd by Edward I (), the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary King Arthur, were surrendered to England. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Aberconwy Abbey&quot;, &quot;and so the glory of Wales and the Welsh was handed over to the kings of England&quot;. After the invasion of Scotland in 1296, the Stone of Scone was sent to the Tower of London &quot;in recognition of a kingdom surrendered and conquered&quot;. It was fitted into a wooden chair, which came to be used for the investiture of English kings and known as the Coronation Chair. The Scottish regalia were also taken to London and offered at the shrine of Edward the Confessor; Scotland eventually regained its independence. In the treasury of Edward II () there were no fewer than 10 crowns. When Richard II () was forced to abdicate, he symbolically handed St Edward&#x27;s Crown over to his successor with the words &quot;I present and give to you this crown … and all the rights dependent on it&quot;.

Monarchs often pledged items of state regalia as collateral for loans. Edward III () pawned his &quot;magna corona&quot; to Baldwin of Luxembourg in 1339 for more than £16,650, . Three crowns and other jewels were held by the Bishop of London and the Earl of Arundel in the 1370s as security for £10,000. One crown was exchanged with the Corporation of London in 1386 for a £4,000 loan. Mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects sometimes released objects on a temporary basis for the royal family to use at state occasions. Monarchs also distributed plate and jewels to troops in lieu of money. At some point in the 14th century, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Having fallen out of use in England in the 13th century, two arches topped with a monde and cross reappeared on the state crown during the reign of Henry V (), though arches did not feature on the Great Seal again until 1471.

===Tudors and early Stuarts===
The traditions established in the medieval period continued later. By the mid 15th century, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints&#x27; Day, and one or both feasts of St Edward. A crown was displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Also around this time, three swords – symbols of kingship since ancient times – were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king&#x27;s powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy.
An emerging item of regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a gold ball with a cross, which underlined the monarch&#x27;s sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages, but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until Henry VIII (). State regalia increasingly passed from one monarch to the next. The best example of this was the Tudor Crown, probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. It first appears in a royal inventory during Henry VIII&#x27;s reign and was one of three used at the coronation of each of his next three successors, the other two being St Edward&#x27;s Crown and a &quot;rich crown&quot; made specially for the new monarch. After the English Reformation, when England broke away from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England denounced the veneration of medieval relics and downplayed the history of St Edward&#x27;s regalia.

The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law in 1606 when James I (), the first Stuart king to rule England, decreed a list of &quot;Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme&quot;. After James died, his son, Charles I () ascended the throne. Desperate for money, one of his first acts was to load 41 masterpieces from the Jewel House onto a ship bound for Amsterdam – the hub of Europe&#x27;s jewel trade. This hoard of unique treasures, including the Mirror of Great Britain brooch, a 14th-century pendant called the Three Brothers, a gold salt cellar known as the Morris Dance, and much fine Elizabethan plate, was expected to swell the king&#x27;s coffers by £300,000, but fetched only £70,000.

Charles&#x27;s many conflicts with Parliament, stemming from his belief in the divine right of kings and the many religious conflicts that pervaded his reign, triggered the English Civil War in 1642. Parliament deemed the regalia &quot;Jewels of the Crown&quot;: their ownership was vested in the monarch by virtue of his public role as king and not owned by him personally. To avoid any legal risk to his subjects, Charles asked his wife, Henrietta Maria, to smuggle the inalienable property of the Crown abroad and sell it on the Dutch jewellery market. Upon learning of the scheme, the House of Lords and House of Commons both declared anyone involved in trafficking the Crown Jewels to be enemies of the state. Henrietta succeeded in disposing of a small quantity of jewels, albeit at a heavy discount, and shipped munitions back to England for the royalist cause. Two years later, Parliament seized of rare silver-gilt pieces from the Jewel House and used the proceeds to bankroll its own side of the war.

===Interregnum===
After nine years of war, Charles was defeated and executed, and less than a week later, the Rump Parliament voted to abolish the monarchy. The newly created English Commonwealth found itself short of money. To raise funds, the Act for the Sale of the Goods and Personal Estate of the Late King, Queen and Prince was brought into law, and trustees were appointed to value the Jewels – then regarded by Oliver Cromwell as &quot;symbolic of the detestable rule of kings&quot; and &quot;monuments of superstition and idolatry&quot;  – and sell them to the highest bidder. The most valuable object was Henry VIII&#x27;s Crown, valued at £1,100. Their gemstones and pearls removed, most of the coronation and state regalia were melted down and struck into coins by the Mint.

Two nuptial crowns survived: the Crown of Margaret of York and the Crown of Princess Blanche had been taken out of England centuries before the Civil War when Margaret and Blanche married kings in continental Europe. Both crowns and the 9th-century Alfred Jewel give a sense of the character of royal jewellery in England in the Middle Ages. Another rare survivor is the 600-year-old Crystal Sceptre, a gift from Henry V to the Lord Mayor of London, who still bears it at coronations. Many pieces of English plate that monarchs had presented to visiting dignitaries before the interregnum can be seen in museums throughout Europe. Cromwell declined Parliament&#x27;s invitations to be made king and became Lord Protector. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall in 1657 where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested with many traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown—probably made of gilded base metal—was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.

===Restoration to present===
The monarchy was restored after Cromwell&#x27;s death. For the English coronation of Charles II (), who returned from exile abroad, new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items. They were supplied by the banker and royal goldsmith, Sir Robert Vyner, at a cost of £12,184 7s 2d – as much as three warships. It was decided to fashion the replicas like the medieval regalia and to use the original names. These 22-carat gold objects, made in 1660 and 1661, form the nucleus of the Crown Jewels: St Edward&#x27;s Crown, two sceptres, an orb, an ampulla, a pair of spurs, a pair of armills or bracelets, and a staff. A medieval silver-gilt anointing spoon and three early Stuart swords had survived and were returned to the Crown, and the Dutch ambassador arranged the return of extant jewels pawned in Holland. The king also spent £11,800 acquiring of altar and banqueting plate, and he was presented with conciliatory gifts.

In 1669, the Jewels went on public display for the first time in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a cupboard and showed it to visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and stole a crown, a sceptre, and an orb. Blood and his three accomplices were apprehended at the castle perimeter, but the crown had been flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. He was pardoned by the king, who also gave him land and a pension; it has been suggested that Blood was treated leniently because he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.

Since the Restoration, there have been many additions and alterations to the regalia. A new set was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration (Charles II was unmarried when he took the throne). Another, more elaborate set had to be made for Mary II (), who was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband William III (). After England and Scotland were united as one kingdom by the Acts of Union 1707, the Scottish regalia were locked away in a chest, and the English regalia continued to be used by British monarchs. Gemstones were hired for coronations – the fee typically being 4% of their value – and replaced with glass and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice that continued until the early 20th century.

As enemy planes targeted London during the Second World War, the Crown Jewels were secretly moved to Windsor Castle. The most valuable gemstones were taken out of their settings by James Mann, Master of the Armouries, and Sir Owen Morshead, the Royal Librarian. They were wrapped in cotton wool, placed in a tall glass preserving-jar, which was then sealed in a biscuit tin, and hidden in the castle&#x27;s basement. Also placed in the jar was a note from the King, stating that he had personally directed that the gemstones be removed from their settings. As the Crown Jewels were bulky and thus difficult to transport without a vehicle, the idea was that if the Nazis invaded, the historic precious stones could easily be carried on someone&#x27;s person without drawing suspicion and, if necessary, buried or sunk.

After the war, the Jewels were kept in a vault at the Bank of England for two years while bomb damage to the Jewel House was repaired. In May 2023, St Edward&#x27;s Crown was placed on the head of Charles III () in the only ceremony of its kind in Europe. Other European monarchies have abandoned coronations in favour of secular ceremonies. The Crown Jewels consist of approximately 140 objects, which are permanently set with around 23,578 precious and semi-precious stones and are seen by around 2.5 million visitors every year.

==Crowns==
Crowns are the main symbols of royal authority. All crowns in the Tower are decorated with alternating crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis, a pattern which first appears on the great seal of Richard III, and their arches are surmounted with a monde and cross pattée. Most of the crowns also have a red or purple velvet cap and an ermine border.

===St Edward&#x27;s Crown===

The centrepiece of the coronation regalia is named after Edward the Confessor and is placed on the monarch&#x27;s head at the moment of crowning. Made of gold and completed in 1661, St Edward&#x27;s Crown is embellished with 444 stones, including amethysts, garnets, peridots, rubies, sapphires, topazes, tourmalines and zircons. This coronation crown closely resembles the medieval one, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the disproportionately large arches are a Baroque affectation. It was long assumed to be the original as their weight is almost identical and an invoice produced in 1661 was for the addition of gold to an existing crown. In 2008, new research found that it had actually been made in 1660 and was enhanced the following year when Parliament increased the budget for Charles II&#x27;s twice-delayed coronation. The crown is tall and at a weight of has been noted to be extremely heavy. After 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., that of George IV) or their state crown, while St Edward&#x27;s Crown rested on the high altar. At Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation in 1838 it was entirely absent from the ceremony. The tradition of using St Edward&#x27;s Crown was revived in 1911 by George V and has continued ever since. In 1953 Elizabeth II opted for a stylised image of this crown to be used on coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia in the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority, replacing the image of a Tudor-style crown adopted in 1901 by Edward VII.

===Imperial State Crown===

A much lighter crown is worn by the monarch when leaving Westminster Abbey, and at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 for George VI and is a copy of the one made in 1838 for Queen Victoria, which had fallen into a poor state of repair, and had been made using gems from its own predecessor, the State Crown of George I. In 1953, the crown was resized to fit Elizabeth II, and the arches were lowered by . The gold, silver and platinum crown is decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 5 rubies. Among the largest stones are the Cullinan II diamond, also known as the Second Star of Africa, added to the crown in 1909 (the larger Cullinan I is set in the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre). The Black Prince&#x27;s Ruby, set in the front cross, is not actually a ruby but a large cabochon red spinel. According to legend it was given to Edward the Black Prince by the Spanish king Peter of Castile in 1367 and Henry V wore it at the Battle of Agincourt. How the stone found its way back into the Royal Collection after the Interregnum is unclear, but a substantial &quot;ruby&quot; was acquired for the Crown Jewels in 1661 at a cost of £400, and this may well have been the spinel. On the back of the crown is the cabochon Stuart Sapphire, and in the top cross is St Edward&#x27;s Sapphire, reputedly taken from the ring of the Confessor when his body was re-interred at the Abbey in 1163. Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Elizabeth I, but the association is almost certainly erroneous.

===Consort crowns===
After the Restoration, wives of kings – queens consort – traditionally wore the State Crown of Mary of Modena, who first wore it at her coronation in 1685. Originally set with 561 hired diamonds and 129 pearls, it was re-set with crystals and cultured pearls for display in the Jewel House along with a matching diadem that consorts wore in procession to the Abbey. The diadem once held 177 diamonds, 1 ruby, 1 sapphire, and 1 emerald. By the 19th century, that crown was judged to be too theatrical and in a poor state of repair, so in 1831 the Crown of Queen Adelaide was made for Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen using gemstones from her private jewellery.

Thus began a tradition of each queen consort having a custom-made crown. In 1902 the Crown of Queen Alexandra, a European-style crown – flatter and with eight half-arches instead of the typical four – was made for Alexandra of Denmark to wear at her coronation. Set with over 3,000 diamonds, it was the first consort crown to include the Koh-i-Noor diamond presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 following the British conquest of the Punjab. Originally and set in an armlet, it was cut down to an oval brilliant weighing , which Victoria mounted in a brooch and circlet. The Crown of Queen Mary was the second to contain the Koh-i-Noor; also unusual for a British crown owing to its eight half-arches, it was made in 1911 for Mary of Teck. Mary purchased the Art Deco-inspired crown with her own money hoping it would become an heirloom used by future queens consort. Altogether, it was adorned with 2,200 diamonds, and contained the Cullinan III and Cullinan IV diamonds. Its arches were made detachable in 1914 allowing it to be worn as an open crown or circlet.

After George V&#x27;s death, Mary continued wearing the crown (without its arches) as a queen mother, so the Crown of Queen Elizabeth was created for Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later known as the Queen Mother, to wear at her coronation in 1937. It is the only British crown made entirely out of platinum, and was modelled on Queen Mary&#x27;s Crown, but has four half-arches instead of eight. The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, with the Koh-i-Noor in the middle of the front cross. It also contains a replica of the Lahore Diamond given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851, and a diamond given to her by Abdülmecid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1856. The crown was laid on top of the Queen Mother&#x27;s coffin in 2002 during her lying in state and funeral. The crowns of Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary feature crystal replicas of the Koh-i-Noor, which has been the subject of repeated controversy, with governments of both India and Pakistan claiming to be the diamond&#x27;s rightful owners and demanding its return ever since gaining independence from the UK.

Queen Camilla was crowned using Queen Mary&#x27;s crown at her coronation with Charles III on 6 May 2023. Alterations included re-setting the crown with the original Cullinan diamonds and reducing the number of half-arches from eight to four. The Cullinan V brooch replaced the Koh-i-Noor and a new purple velvet cap was also fitted into the crown. It was officially renamed Queen Camilla&#x27;s Crown in January 2025.

===Prince of Wales coronets===
A relatively modest gold coronet was made in 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of George II. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by Charles II in 1677, which states &quot;the Son &amp; Heir apparent of the Crown for the time being shall use &amp; bear his coronett composed of crosses &amp; flowers de Lizs with one Arch &amp; in the midst a Ball &amp; Cross&quot;. The single arch denotes inferiority to the monarch while showing that the prince outranks other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion in front of him when he first took his seat in the House of Lords. It was subsequently used by George III, George IV, and Edward VII when they were Princes of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for the future George V to wear at Edward VII&#x27;s coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George&#x27;s coronation in 1911 the coronet was worn by his eldest son, Edward, who was invested as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle a month later. The revival of this public ceremony, not performed since the early 17th century, was intended to boost the Royal family&#x27;s profile in Wales. Princely regalia known as the Honours of Wales were designed for the occasion by Goscombe John, comprising a Welsh gold circlet with pearls, amethysts and engraved daffodils; a rod; a ring; a sword; and a robe with doublet and sash. After he became king in 1936, Edward VIII abdicated the same year and emigrated to France, where the 1902 coronet remained in his possession until his death in 1972. In its absence, a new coronet had to be created in 1969 for the investiture of the future Charles III, which is made from gold and platinum and is set with diamonds and emeralds. Both it and the rod were added to the Jewel House in 2020, joining the 1728 and 1902 coronets.

===Non-coronation crowns===
In the Jewel House there are two crowns that were never intended to be worn at a coronation. Queen Victoria&#x27;s Small Diamond Crown is just tall and was made in 1870 using 1,187 diamonds for Victoria to wear on top of her widow&#x27;s cap. She often wore it at State Openings of Parliament in place of the much heavier Imperial State Crown. After the queen&#x27;s death in 1901, the crown passed to her daughter-in-law Queen Alexandra and later Queen Mary. When George V attended the Delhi Durbar with Queen Mary in 1911 to be proclaimed (but not crowned) as Emperor of India, he wore the Imperial Crown of India. As the British constitution forbids coronation regalia to leave the United Kingdom, it was not possible for him to wear St Edward&#x27;s Crown or the Imperial State Crown, so one had to be made specially for the event. It contains 6,170 diamonds, 9 emeralds, 4 rubies and 4 sapphires. The crown has not been used since and is considered a part of the Crown Jewels.

==Processional objects==
A coronation begins with the procession into Westminster Abbey.

===Swords===
The swords of state reflect a monarch&#x27;s role as Head of the British Armed Forces and Defender of the Faith. Three are carried before the monarch into the Abbey: the blunt Sword of Mercy (also known as Curtana), the Sword of Spiritual Justice, and the Sword of Temporal Justice. All are believed to have been supplied at the time of James I between 1610 and 1620, probably by a member of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, using blades created in the 1580s by Italian bladesmiths Giandonato and Andrea Ferrara. They were deposited with St Edward&#x27;s regalia at the Abbey by Charles II. Before that point, new swords had been made for each coronation since the 15th century. Sold in the civil war, they were returned at the Restoration, and their use was first recorded at the coronation of James II in 1685.

The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch&#x27;s authority and is also carried before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath, made in 1689, is bound in crimson velvet decorated with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis, and portcullises. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword&#x27;s handle. The sword weighs and is long. During a coronation it must be held for much of the service pointing upwards without touching the body by the Lord President of the Privy Council.

Before the investiture, the unwieldy Sword of State is exchanged for the lighter Sword of Offering, which is described as &quot;the one true coronation sword&quot;. Commissioned by George IV for his extravagant 1821 coronation, its gilded leather sheath is encrusted with 1,251 diamonds, 16 rubies, 2 sapphires and 2 turquoises. The sword has a partly blued and gilt steel blade, and its handle is set with 2,141 diamonds, 12 emeralds and 4 rubies. The stones are arranged to form roses, thistles, shamrocks, oak leaves and acorns. Two diamond lion heads, one at each end of the cross-piece, have ruby eyes. George paid more than £5,000 for the sword out of his own pocket in a radical change from the austere £2 swords used by his 18th-century predecessors. It remained in the Royal family&#x27;s personal ownership until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels and has been used at every coronation since 1911. A monarch is girded and blessed using the sword, which is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the Abbey for a token sum of £5, and is borne unsheathed for the rest of the ceremony.

The 17th-century Irish Sword of State was held by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (a viceroy) prior to Ireland&#x27;s independence from the UK in 1922 and has been displayed in the Jewel House since 1959. The handle takes the form of a lion and a unicorn and is decorated with a Celtic harp. Each new viceroy was invested with the sword at Dublin Castle where it usually sat across the arms of a throne, representing the king or queen in their absence. It was borne in procession in front of monarchs during their official visits to Dublin. In June 1921 the sword was present at the official opening of the Parliament of Northern Ireland by George V. The sword was displayed at Dublin Castle in 2018 as part of the &#x27;Making Majesty&#x27; exhibition – the first time it had been to Ireland in 95 years.

===St Edward&#x27;s Staff===
St Edward&#x27;s Staff is a ceremonial gold walking stick made for Charles II in 1661. It has a plain monde and cross at the top and a steel pike at the bottom. This object is almost certainly a copy of the long rod mentioned in the list of royal plate and jewels destroyed in 1649, although the pre-Interregnum version was gold and silver and topped by a dove. The staff&#x27;s intended role in the coronation has been forgotten since medieval times, and so it is carried into the Abbey by a peer as a holy relic and laid on the altar, where it remains throughout the ceremony.

===Trumpets===
The Crown Jewels include 16 silver trumpets dating from between 1780 and 1848. Nine are draped with red silk damask banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in the 19th century. The trumpeters&#x27; main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.

===Maces===

Beginning as lethal weapons of medieval knights, maces evolved into ceremonial objects carried by sergeants-at-arms that represent a monarch&#x27;s authority. The House of Commons can only operate lawfully when the royal mace – dating from Charles II&#x27;s reign – is present at the table. Two other maces dating from the reigns of Charles II and William III are used by the House of Lords, one of which is placed on the Woolsack before the house meets and is absent when a monarch is there in person delivering the King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Speech. In the late 17th century there were 16 maces, but only 13 survive, 10 of which are on display at the Tower of London. Two of these are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and coronations. Each mace is about long and weighs an average of . They are silver-gilt and were made between 1660 and 1695.

==Anointing objects==
When a monarch is anointed, the Dean of Westminster first pours holy anointing oil from an ampulla into a spoon.

===Ampulla===
The Ampulla, tall and weighing , is a hollow gold vessel made in 1661 and shaped like an eagle with outspread wings. Its head unscrews, enabling the vessel to be filled with oil, which exits via a hole in the beak. The original ampulla was a small stone phial, sometimes worn around the neck as a pendant by kings, and otherwise kept inside an eagle-shaped golden reliquary. According to 14th-century legend, the Virgin Mary appeared to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until 1170, and presented him with a gold eagle and some oil for anointing English kings. This ampulla was first recorded as being used at Henry IV&#x27;s coronation in 1399 and was deposited for safekeeping with St Edward&#x27;s regalia at the Abbey by Richard III in 1483. Known as the Holy Oil of St Thomas, the same batch was used to anoint all subsequent kings and queens (except Mary I) until it eventually ran out in 1625. It is unclear why, after the Restoration, the vessel itself came to be reinterpreted as an eagle standing on a domed base. In terms of religious importance, the anointing objects are second only to St Edward&#x27;s Crown, and in 2013 the ampulla stood beside the crown on the altar of Westminster Abbey at a service marking the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation.

===Coronation Spoon===
The Coronation Spoon, which dates from the late 12th century, is silver-gilt and set with four pearls added in the 17th century. A ridge divides the bowl in half, creating grooves into which the Archbishop of Canterbury dips two fingers and anoints the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Originally, it may have been used for mixing water and wine in a chalice. The spoon is first known to have been used to anoint a monarch at the English coronation of James I in 1603. It is the oldest surviving piece of the Crown Jewels (and the only surviving English royal goldsmith&#x27;s work from the 1100s), first recorded in the Royal Collection in 1349 as &quot;a spoon of ancient form&quot;, and was probably made for Henry II or Richard I. In 1649 the spoon was sold for 16 shillings to Clement Kynnersley, Yeoman of the Removing Wardrobe, who returned it to Charles II upon the restoration of the monarchy.
==Robes and ornaments==
The anointing is followed by investing with coronations robes and ornaments.

===Robes===
All the robes have priestly connotations and their form has changed little since the Middle Ages. A tradition of wearing St Edward&#x27;s robes came to an end in 1547 after the English Reformation, but was revived in 1603 by James I to emphasise his belief in the divine nature of kingship. As well as robes, a monarch also wore cloth-of-gold buskins or sandals, depending on his or her foot size. These holy relics were destroyed along with royal crowns and ornaments in the Civil War. New robes were made for each monarch starting with Charles II, a practice that ended in 1911, when George V reused the 1902 Supertunica (a dalmatic), and the Imperial Mantle (a cope), fashioned for George IV in 1821. They were also worn by his successors George VI, Elizabeth II and Charles III. Together, the gold robes weigh approximately . A new Stole Royal was made in 2023 for Charles III by the Royal School of Needlework, taking inspiration from the 1953 stole of his predecessor, Elizabeth II. It is adorned with emblems of the four countries of the United Kingdom, a dove representing the Holy Spirit, a Tudor-style crown, and a pattern based on the Cosmati Pavement in Westminster Abbey.

===Spurs===
Prick spurs remade for Charles II are presented to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have crimson velvet straps embroidered in gold. Both necks terminate in a Tudor rose with a spike at its centre. Also known as St George&#x27;s Spurs, they are emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign&#x27;s role as head of the armed forces. Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard I, though it is likely they were introduced for Henry the Young King in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights. A pair of mid 14th-century spurs were added to St Edward&#x27;s regalia at the Abbey in 1399 and used at all coronations until their destruction in 1649. Historically, spurs were fastened to a monarch&#x27;s feet, but since the Restoration they are simply presented to the monarch.

===Armills===
The Armills are gold bracelets of sincerity and wisdom. Like spurs, they were first used at English coronations in the 12th century. By the 17th century, armills were no longer delivered to the monarch, but simply carried at the coronation. A new pair had to be made in 1661; they are wide, in diameter, and champlevé enamelled on the surface with roses, thistles and harps (the national symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland) as well as fleurs-de-lis. For Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953, the tradition of wearing armills was revived, and a new set of plain 22-karat gold armills lined with crimson velvet presented to the Queen on behalf of various Commonwealth governments. Each bracelet is fitted with an invisible hinge and a clasp in the form of a Tudor rose. The hallmark includes a tiny portrait of the Queen, who continued to wear them upon leaving the Abbey and could be seen wearing them later, along with the Imperial State Crown and Sovereign&#x27;s Ring, at her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

===Orbs===
An orb, a type of globus cruciger, was first used at an English coronation by Henry VIII in 1509, and then by all subsequent monarchs apart from the early Stuart kings James I and Charles I, who opted for the medieval coronation order. The Tudor orb was deposited with St Edward&#x27;s regalia at Westminster Abbey in 1625. Since 1661 the Sovereign&#x27;s Orb is a hollow gold sphere about in diameter and weighing (more than twice as heavy as the original) made for Charles II. A band of gems and pearls runs along the equator and there is a half-band on the top hemisphere. Atop the orb is an amethyst surmounted by a jewelled cross, symbolising the Christian world, with a sapphire on one side and an emerald on the other. Altogether, the orb is decorated with 375 pearls, 365 diamonds, 18 rubies, 9 emeralds, 9 sapphires, 1 amethyst and 1 piece of glass. It is handed to the sovereign during the investiture rite of the coronation, and is borne later in the left hand when leaving Westminster Abbey. A small version, originally set with hired gems, was made in 1689 for Mary II to hold at her coronation as joint sovereign with William III; it was never used again at a coronation and was re-set with imitation gems and cultured pearls. The orb is in diameter and weighs . Both orbs were laid on Queen Victoria&#x27;s coffin at her state funeral in 1901. Officially, no reason was given for using Mary II&#x27;s orb, but it may have been intended to reflect Victoria&#x27;s position as Empress of India.

===Rings===
The Sovereign&#x27;s Ring has been worn by monarchs at their coronation since William IV in 1831, with the exceptions of Queen Victoria, whose fingers were too small to retain it, and Charles III, who acknowledged the ring but did not wear it. In the centre is a large octagonal sapphire overlaid with rubies forming a cross, surrounded by 14 brilliant diamonds. The general design is intended to represent the red St George&#x27;s Cross (England) on the blue background of St Andrew&#x27;s Cross (Scotland). Rubies symbolise all the kingly virtues – such as humility, good morals, and charity – and have featured on coronation rings since the early Middle Ages. A small copy was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter: &quot;The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the greatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with great pain&quot; – her jewellers had measured the wrong finger. In 1919 both rings were deposited at the Tower along with the Queen Consort&#x27;s Ring, which is similar in design and was made in 1831 for Queen Adelaide.

Before 1831, monarchs generally received a new ring symbolising their &quot;marriage&quot; to the nation, with perhaps two exceptions: Richard II offered Westminster Abbey a &quot;solemn jewel, a gold ring set with a precious stone called a ruby, of no small value&quot; to be worn by his successors. Evidence suggests it was later worn by Henry V. Another was the Stuart Coronation Ring, probably used at the English coronations of Charles I and Charles II, and certainly that of James II, who took it into exile with him in France after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. It was returned to the British monarchy 100 years later and belongs to the Royal Collection of Gems and Jewels. The ring has a large ruby etched with a St George&#x27;s Cross and bordered by 26 diamonds. Since 1830 it has been on permanent loan from Windsor Castle to Edinburgh Castle where it is displayed with the Honours of Scotland. The coronation ring of Mary II survives in the Portland Collection at Welbeck Abbey.

===Sceptres===
The sceptre, a symbolic ornamental rod held by the monarch at a coronation, is derived from the shepherd&#x27;s staff via the crozier of a bishop. Two gold sceptres made in 1661 are part of the coronation regalia. The Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross is a token of his or her temporal power as head of state. The whole object is long, weighs around , and is decorated with 333 diamonds, 31 rubies, 15 emeralds, 7 sapphires, 6 spinels, and 1 composite amethyst. In 1910, it was redesigned to incorporate Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which, at over , is the largest clear cut diamond in the world. It was part of a rough diamond weighing found in South Africa in 1905, and was named after Thomas Cullinan, the chairman of the mining company. The gold clasps holding it can be opened and the stone removed to be worn as a pendant hanging from Cullinan II, which is set in the Imperial State Crown, to form a brooch – Queen Mary often wore it like this. Above the pear-shaped diamond is the amethyst surmounted by a cross pattée encrusted with an emerald and small diamonds.

The Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre with Dove, which has also been known as the Rod of Equity and Mercy, is emblematic of the monarch&#x27;s spiritual role. It is slightly longer, at , but weighs about the same as the Sceptre with Cross. The sceptre is decorated with 285 gemstones, including 94 diamonds, 53 rubies, 10 emeralds, 4 sapphires and 3 spinels. Circling the rod are bands of precious stones. At the top is a gold monde set with diamonds and topped by a plain cross, upon which sits a white enamelled dove with its wings outspread, representing the Holy Ghost. A sceptre like this first appeared in the 11th century and was probably based on the German sceptre, which was topped by an Imperial Eagle. The Sceptre with Dove is the penultimate piece of regalia to be delivered. Holding both sceptres, the monarch is crowned with St Edward&#x27;s Crown.

The Crown Jewels include two sceptres made for Mary of Modena in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort&#x27;s Sceptre with Cross, and another made of ivory topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort&#x27;s Ivory Rod with Dove. Unlike the sovereign&#x27;s dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. For the coronation of Mary II, the wife and joint sovereign of William III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only to be found in 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.

==Altar plate==
In the Jewel House there is a collection of chalices, patens, flagons, candlesticks, and dishes – all silver-gilt except five gold communion vessels – that are displayed on the altars of Westminster Abbey during coronations. Although not regalia these items, known as plate (from the Spanish &quot;plata&quot;, meaning silver), are considered to be Crown Jewels by virtue of their long association with the Jewel House.

One of the most striking pieces is a large dish across and weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ&#x27;s Commission to the Apostles. Made in 1664 for James, Duke of York, and later acquired by Charles II, it stands on the high altar during a coronation ceremony. At each end of the altar stands a tall candlestick made in the 17th century, which is engraved all over with scrolls, leaves and flowers.

An altar dish and flagon were made in 1691 for the royal Church of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London. The dish measures across and depicts the Last Supper above the coat of arms of co-monarchs William III and Mary II. The flagon stands tall. Both pieces are still used in the chapel on Easter, Whitsun and Christmas, and they were first displayed at a coronation in 1821.

Another dish still in regular use is the Maundy Dish – one of six used by the King at Royal Maundy for handing out alms to elderly people in recognition of their service to the church and local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing the feet of the poor in 1730, and the dish, though it bears the royal cypher of William and Mary, dates from the reign of Charles II. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient.

==Banqueting plate==

The last coronation banquet held at Westminster Hall took place in 1821 for George IV. Silverware used at those banquets include the Plymouth Fountain, a wine fountain made around 1640 by a German goldsmith and presented to Charles II by the city of Plymouth. Gilded for George II in 1726, it is tall and decorated with flowers, fruit, dolphins, mermaids and sea monsters. The nautical theme is continued in the silver-gilt Wine Cistern, also known as the Grand Punch Bowl, which is cast as a giant oyster shell. It weighs , measures , and can hold 144 bottles of wine on ice. It was commissioned in 1829 by George IV but not completed until after his death. It is the heaviest surviving piece of English banqueting plate. In 1841, the cistern was re-purposed as a punch bowl, with the addition of a large ivory-stemmed ladle, which has a silver-gilt bowl in the form of a nautilus shell.

The Exeter Salt is a tall salt cellar in the form of a castle on a rocky outcrop. Each of its four main compartments held about of salt, while smaller ones held pepper and other spices. It was made 1630 in Germany and is set with 73 gems probably added later. The Salt was bought in Hamburg in 1657 by the city&#x27;s British Resident as a peace offering to the Russian court, which had cut all ties with Britain during the Interregnum. He was turned away at the Russian border and eventually took it home to London. In 1660, it was acquired from a private dealer for £700 by the city of Exeter and presented to Charles II.

Eleven smaller salts named after St George were originally made for a St George&#x27;s Day banquet of the Knights of the Garter in the late 17th century. A twelfth, the Queen Elizabeth Salt, was made in 1572 during the reign of Elizabeth I for a member of the aristocracy; it was later acquired by Charles II. Twelve spoons made for George IV in 1820 complement these salts.

==Baptismal plate==
Three silver-gilt objects (comprising a total of six parts) associated with royal christenings are displayed in the Jewel House. Charles II&#x27;s tall font was created in 1661 and stood on a basin to catch any spills. Surmounting the font&#x27;s domed lid is a figure of Philip the Evangelist baptising the Ethiopian eunuch. While Charles&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Braganza produced no heir, the font may have been used to secretly baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children. In 1688, James Francis Edward Stuart, son of James II and Mary of Modena, was the first royal baby to be christened using this object.

A ewer and basin of French design made in 1735 were only used at two christenings. The tall ewer&#x27;s handle is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, an unlikely motif for baptismal plate, suggesting it originally had an alternate purpose. Indeed, it was first used in 1738 at the impromptu christening of a &quot;very ill&quot; future George III only hours after his birth. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, was banished from the royal court and forbidden to use the Charles II font. An inscription on the ewer records its presence at the 1780 christening of George III&#x27;s youngest son, Prince Alfred.

The Lily Font was made in 1840 for the christening of Victoria, Princess Royal, the first child of Queen Victoria, who declined to use the Charles II font because of its unseemly history. The 1661 font was recycled as a plinth (&quot;pictured&quot;) and its basin found a new role as an altar dish. The Lily Font stands tall and weighs approximately . It is decorated with water lilies, symbolising purity and new life, and cherubs plucking lyres. The object has been used for the christenings of all of Elizabeth II&#x27;s children and grandchildren (except Princess Eugenie) with holy water brought from the River Jordan.

==Ownership, management and value==
The Crown Jewels are part of the Royal Collection. As with Royal palaces, ownership is regarded as inalienable and passes from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. However, a 17th-century ruling by Sir Edward Coke, which states &quot;the ancient jewels of the crown are heirloomes and shall descend to the next successor and are not devisable by testament&quot;, contains an exception allowing the monarch to dispose of objects via letters patent during their lifetime under the Great Seal or Privy Seal. In 1995, Iain Sproat, then Secretary of State for National Heritage, confirmed that the disposal of the Royal Collection was &quot;entirely a matter for the Queen&quot;. Their potential value is generally not included in estimates of the monarch&#x27;s wealth because in practice it is unlikely the Crown Jewels will ever be sold, nor are they insured against loss, and are officially described as priceless. Maintenance, alteration and repair falls to the Crown Jeweller, a member of the Royal Household who cleans them after visiting hours at the Tower of London each January and accompanies the regalia and plate whenever they leave the Tower for use at royal ceremonies. Older items have been conserved by experts from the British Museum. The Royal Collection Trust keeps an inventory of the jewels, and Historic Royal Palaces is responsible for their display.

<text>Lee McGeorge Durrell (née McGeorge; born September 7, 1949) is an American naturalist, author, zookeeper, and television presenter. She is best known for her work at the Jersey Zoological Park in the British Channel Island of Jersey with her late husband, Gerald Durrell, and for co-authoring books with him.

==Biography==

Lee was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and showed an interest in wildlife as a child. She studied philosophy at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia before enrolling in 1971 for a graduate programme at Duke University, to study animal behaviour. She conducted research for her PhD on the calls of mammals and birds in Madagascar. She met Gerald Durrell when he gave a lecture at Duke University in 1977, and married him in 1979.

Lee Durrell moved to Jersey and became involved with the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (then the &quot;Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust&quot;). She accompanied Durrell on his last three conservation missions:
*Mauritius, other Mascarene Islands and Madagascar (1982) (account in Gerald Durrell&#x27;s &quot;Ark on the Move&quot;)
*Russia (1986) (account in &quot;Durrell in Russia&quot;, co-authored with Gerald Durrell)
*Madagascar (1990) (account in Gerald Durrell&#x27;s &quot;The Aye-Aye and I&quot;)

She became the honorary director of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust after the death of her husband in 1995. She was instrumental in getting the &quot;Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust&quot; renamed after Gerald Durrell, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Jersey Zoo. She is also a member of various expert groups on conservation, and is fondly called &quot;Mother Tortoise&quot; in certain areas of Madagascar due to her work with the ploughshare tortoise.

In December 2005, Lee Durrell handed over a large collection of dead animals (which had originally been collected and bred by her husband Gerald Durrell) to the National Museums of Scotland to aid genetic research of the critically rare species.

Lee acted as consultant for &quot;The Durrells&quot;, a 2016 ITV six-part dramatisation of &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;.

==Bibliography==

Durrell is the author of three books:
*&quot;A Practical Guide for the Amateur Naturalist&quot; (with Gerald Durrell) (Hamish Hamilton (UK) / Alfred A. Knopf (USA), 1982) 
*&quot;Durrell in Russia&quot; (with Gerald Durrell) (MacDonald (UK) / Simon &amp; Schuster (USA), 1986)
*&quot;State of the Ark&quot; – an atlas of conservation in action (Bodley Head, 1986) 
**Foreword by Gerald Durrell
** Dedicated &quot;To GMD for his contribution to conservation, which is greater than most, because he shares his delight in the natural world so well&quot;

She is also the editor of:
*&quot;The Best of Gerald Durrell&quot; (HarperCollins, 1996)

The companion book of a TV series documents the series where she was co-presenter:

*&quot; Ourselves and Other Animals&quot; – from the TV series with Gerald and Lee Durrell, Peter Evans (1987)

==Honours==
&quot;Nactus serpeninsula durrelli&quot;, or Durrell&#x27;s night gecko, is the Round Island race of the Serpent Island gecko, named after Gerald and Lee Durrell for their contribution to saving the gecko and Round Island fauna in general. Mauritius released a stamp depicting Durrell&#x27;s night gecko.

Lee Durrell was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2011 Birthday Honours.

<text>Roland Deschain of Gilead is a fictional character and the protagonist of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series. He is the son of Steven and Gabrielle Deschain and is descended from a long line of &quot;gunslingers&quot;, peacekeepers and diplomats of Roland&#x27;s society.

==Fictional biography==
===Background===
Roland becomes a gunslinger at the unheard-of age of 14 after being manipulated into taking the &quot;trial of manhood&quot; by Marten Broadcloak, his father&#x27;s adviser and alias of Randall Flagg. Marten has an affair with Roland&#x27;s mother and makes sure Roland finds out about it, prompting Roland to request his trial in order to gain his guns and exact revenge on Marten. In the trial, Roland must defeat his teacher, Cort, using a weapon of his choosing. He chooses a hawk named David and defeats Cort. Roland sacrifices David to win the fight, setting the tone for Roland&#x27;s future choices in life. Despite Roland&#x27;s victory, Cort and Roland&#x27;s father convince Roland to bide his time before seeking retribution.

Not long after, Roland&#x27;s father sends him on a mission to the town of Hambry in the Outer Barony of Mejis with his friends Alain Johns and Cuthbert Allgood, who will form the basis of his first ka-tet. While there, he meets Susan Delgado, whom he falls in love with. He also comes into the possession of a pink crystal ball, one of 13 magical artifacts referred to as &quot;Maerlyn&#x27;s Rainbow.&quot; It was while looking into this artifact that Roland first discovered his destiny to quest for the Dark Tower. 

Roland is a 30th-generation descendant of his world&#x27;s version of King Arthur, referred to in the series as Arthur Eld. In &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;, during a flashback to Roland&#x27;s time in the Barony of Mejis, a letter from his father identifies Steven Deschain as a 29th-generation descendant of Arthur Eld from a side lineage (that is to say, from one of Arthur&#x27;s many &quot;gillies,&quot; or concubines). Even his guns were originally made of the melted-down metal from the legendary Excalibur sword. It is hinted that one must possess this sword, or another sign of the Eld (the line of Arthur Eld) in order to open the door at the foot of the Tower. According to a supplemental prose story by Robin Furth included in &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born&quot; (issues #7 &amp; #2, respectively), Roland&#x27;s ancestry traces back to Arthur Eld and Emmanuelle Deschain, the daughter of his seneschal, Kay Deschain, while the Crimson King&#x27;s ancestry traces back to an affair between Arthur and the Crimson Queen.

===Quest for the Dark Tower===
Roland is alone at the beginning of the series, following the way of &quot;ka&quot;, a variant of destiny. The term &quot;ka-tet&quot; is used for a group of people who are deeply bonded to one another through ka. The eight-book series is about Roland&#x27;s acquisition of a new ka-tet and the completion of his quest. Roland is the last surviving gunslinger and is possessed (or, as he describes it himself, &quot;addicted&quot;) by a quest to reach The Dark Tower, the axis upon which infinite numbers of parallel worlds rotate. (Eddie Dean, an ex-heroin addict and member of Roland&#x27;s ka-tet, calls Roland a &quot;Tower junkie.&quot;) The Dark Tower is under assault by the Crimson King, Lord of Discordia, a Satanic figure bent on destroying the Dark Tower by undermining the &quot;Beams&quot; that support it.

In the first novel, &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger&quot;, Roland&#x27;s original desire is simply to climb to the Dark Tower&#x27;s top to question whatever god dwells there, but ka has greater plans for him. The ka-tet he acquires during the series bears many resemblances to his childhood ka-tet, who were all killed trying to help Roland on his quest. How he treats his new ka-tet when faced with decisions between their lives and his quest is a key component of the novels. Ultimately, his ka-tet represents a chance for redemption and a means by which he can ultimately change his own ka.

At the end of the seventh novel, it is revealed that he is trapped in a repetitive reincarnation, his &quot;damnation&quot; for his crimes and killings (similar to Stephen King&#x27;s short story &quot;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French&quot;, in which he expresses that his idea of hell is repetition). However, it is also suggested that this eternal repetition is not quite eternal; after his rebirth at the end of the novel, it is revealed that in this particular reiteration of his journey, he possesses the Horn of Eld which in his previous pilgrimages he had lost in the final stand at Jericho Hill, the one major element which was discrepant from his approach to the tower and Childe Roland&#x27;s approach in Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&quot; (&quot;Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set...&quot;).

==Characteristics==
Physically, Roland is described by most of his ka&#x27;tet as &quot;old long, tall, and ugly&quot; with &quot;blue, bombadier&#x27;s eyes.&quot; He is described as tall and lanky, with a problematic hip that frequently troubled him yet doesn&#x27;t mention to his travel companions. Emotionally, Roland at times appears detached or unsympathetic, often reacting with seeming indifference or anger at signs of cowardice or self-pity, yet he possesses a strong sense of heroism, often attempting to help those in need. He is shown to be emotionally scarred from the deaths of all his friends and family, often thinking about their words and actions, and he is said (on more than one occasion by himself) to lack imagination. He describes this trait as being &quot;not very good in thinking around corners&quot;. He is nevertheless highly intelligent and perceptive, exemplified by his interest in riddles; though he enjoys hearing them, he usually overcomplicates the solution. Cuthbert, Roland&#x27;s childhood best friend, once said the gears in Roland&#x27;s head turn slow, but grind extremely well. Roland is impatient, especially when he is under stress, and often makes a rotating gesture with his hand, which means &#x27;go on, hurry, move on&#x27; in conversations. Similarly, he prefers not to over-plan his actions, trusting in his instinct and skill at improvising according to the situation. He is also shown not to have a great sense of humor; despite his love for riddles, he rarely jokes and is visibly irritated at times when Eddie (and in the past, Cuthbert) joke around.

In &quot;The Waste Lands,&quot; Susannah compares Roland first to Marshal Matt Dillon of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, but later comes to believe he is more like John F. Kennedy. While she acknowledges that Roland lacks the president&#x27;s imagination, both men have similar levels of charisma, cunning, and romance. King often notes Roland&#x27;s strong sense of romance in his narrations, but describes this aspect of the gunslinger&#x27;s character as being usually hidden by his more dominant sense of pragmatism.

Roland is also shown to care a great deal for his Ka-Tet, or &quot;Companions in fate&quot;, and often puts himself at risk to save or assist them. When confronted with the choice between saving one of them or getting one step closer to the fabled Dark Tower of legend, Roland often, but not always, feels inclined to choose the Tower; however, many members of his Ka-Tets, both old and new, make the choice for him, suggesting the enormity of his quest.

Roland carries a pair of revolvers, sometimes referred to as &quot;the big guns&quot; by other characters. They are described as long and heavy, with blued steel (originally from his world&#x27;s Excalibur) and sandalwood grips. These guns are a major sigil, as they are recognized throughout Mid-World and are used as an identifier of Roland. During the search for more ammunition in New York City in &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot;, the guns are revealed to be chambered close enough to .45 or the .45 Long Colt to use commercially available cartridges. In &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; Roland exhibits a technique for reloading his weapons at blinding speed, though it causes burns to his fingertips when done repeatedly in a short time. He loses this ability at the start of &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; when the first two fingers of his right hand are bitten off. Even after being crippled, he possesses almost superhuman accuracy and he can draw his guns faster than any other character. Roland is noted as being able to shoot equally well with both hands.

In addition to being a master gunslinger, Roland is an experienced traveler, able to hunt, make his own clothes from the skins of animals, and navigate via the stars. Roland can speak five languages, including the High Speech and the Low Speech. He also possess a great deal of knowledge about &quot;ka&quot; and the nature of the world. Roland is also a skilled leader, diplomat, and teacher.

There is a point during the second book at which Roland psychically bonds himself with a murderer named Jack Mort; the combination of the two personages is said to resemble the mannerisms of Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appeared in &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Eddie Dean sees Stephen King as a young man and recognizes that he and Roland share many of the same physical features, saying that Roland could be King&#x27;s father.

Some of his hair is grey or white, but some remains black. His facial features are described as rough (although Susannah once compared them to that of a tired poet; Eddie frequently refers to him as &quot;old long tall and ugly&quot;), and he has light blue eyes, often referred to by characters and Stephen King as &quot;bombardier&#x27;s eyes.&quot; Roland lost his right big toe and his right index and middle fingers, which is problematic as he is right-handed in everything other than shooting. He is a strong and disciplined man, capable of working through injuries and illnesses that would have killed or incapacitated another man. Roland is also unusually tall; at 14, he stood taller than the 16-year-old Susan, and, as an adult, his height exceeds that of his father. In &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; he is described as having reached an adult height of roughly 6&#x27;3&quot;.

In the last novel, it is implied that the gunslinger&#x27;s mostly cold, ruthless nature is alleviated slightly every time he reaches the Dark Tower and begins his journey again—Whilst his memories are erased, his personality changes in the reflection of the experiences of each quest. This is symbolised by his re-acquisition of the Horn of Eld after the version covered in the Dark Tower series, implying that he has learned some of the true values of family and love (and patience); he has clearly taken the horn from Cuthbert Allgood&#x27;s body as he wished rather than leaving it there as he did before.

==Adaptations==

*In Frank Darabont&#x27;s 2007 film adaptation of King&#x27;s novella &quot;The Mist&quot;, the main character, David Drayton, can be seen painting a movie poster with Roland in the center, standing in front of a trans-dimensional Ironwood door, with a rose and the dark tower to each side.
*Idris Elba portrays Roland in the 2017 film &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. Actors Javier Bardem and Russell Crowe were previously considered for the role.
*Sam Strike was cast as young Roland in the Amazon Prime adaptation of the series, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;.

<text>The Union Cycliste Internationale (; UCI; ) is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland.

The UCI issues racing licenses to riders and enforces disciplinary rules, such as in matters of doping. The UCI also manages the classification of races and the points ranking system in various cycling disciplines including road and track cycling, mountain biking, cyclo-cross, Gravel, and BMX, for both men and women, amateur and professional. It also oversees the World Championships.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UCI said that Russian and Belarusian teams were forbidden from competing in international events. It also stripped both Russia and Belarus of scheduled events.

== History ==
UCI was founded in 1900 in Paris by the national cycling sports organisations of Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland. It replaced the International Cycling Association (ICA) by setting up in opposition in a row over whether Great Britain should be allowed just one team at the world Championships or separate teams representing England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Britain found itself outflanked, and it was not able to join the UCI – under the conditions the UCI had imposed – until 1903.

There were originally 30 countries affiliated to the union. They did not have equal voting power and some had no vote at all. Votes were distributed by the number of tracks, or velodromes, that each nation claimed. France had 18 votes, the highest number, and Germany and Italy 14 each. Britain had eight, a number the writer Bill Mills said was acquired &quot;by including many rather doubtful grass tracks.&quot;

In 1965, under the pressure of the IOC, when the Olympics was an amateur event, the UCI created two subsidiary bodies, the International Amateur Cycling Federation ( or FIAC) and the International Professional Cycling Federation ( or FICP). The UCI assumed a role coordinating both bodies.

The FIAC was based in Rome, the FICP in Luxembourg, and the UCI in Geneva.

The FIAC was the bigger of the two organisations, with 127 member federations across all five continents. It was dominated by the countries of the Eastern Bloc which were amateur. The FIAC arranged representation of cycling at the Olympic Games, and FIAC cyclists competed against FICP members on only rare occasions. In 1992, the UCI reunified the FIAC and FICP, and merged them back into the UCI. The combined organisation then relocated to Aigle, close to the IOC in Lausanne.

In 2004, the UCI constructed a 200-metre velodrome at the new World Cycling Centre adjacent to its headquarters.

In September 2007 the UCI announced that it had decided to award ProTour status for the first time ever to an event outside of Europe; the Tour Down Under in Adelaide, Australia. The announcement followed negotiations between UCI President Pat McQuaid and South Australian Premier Mike Rann.

In 2013 Tracey Gaudry became the first woman appointed as vice president of the UCI.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UCI said that Russian and Belarusian teams are forbidden from competing in international events. It also stripped both Russia and Belarus of scheduled events.

In 3 May 2023, UIC approved a process to review and allow Russian and Belarusian riders to participant UCI events under Individual neutral athlete.

==World championships==
The UCI organises cycling&#x27;s world championships, administration of which it gives to member nations. The first championships were on the road and on the track. They were allocated originally to member nations in turn, on condition the country was deemed competent and that it could guarantee ticket sales. A nation given a championship or series of championships was required to pay the UCI 30 per cent of ticket receipts from the track and 10 per cent from the road. Of this, the UCI kept 30 per cent and gave the rest to competing nations in proportion to the number of events in which it competed. The highest gate money in this pre-war era was 600 000 francs in Paris in 1903.

There were originally five championships: amateur and professional sprint, amateur and professional road race, and professional Motor-paced racing. The road race was traditionally a massed start but did not have to be: Britain organised its road championship before the war as a time trial, the National Cyclists Union believing it best to run races against the clock, and without publicity before the start, to avoid police attention. Continental European organisers generally preferred massed races on circuits, fenced throughout or along the finish to charge for entry.

===Records===
The original records were on the track: unpaced, human-paced and mechanically paced. They were promoted for three classes of bicycle: solos, tandems and unusual machines such as what are now known as recumbents, on which the rider lies horizontal. Distances were imperial and metric, from 440 yards and 500 metres to 24 hours. The UCI banned recumbents in competitions and in record attempts on 1 April 1934. Later changes included restrictions on riding positions of the sort that affected Graeme Obree in the 1990s and the banning in 2000 of all frames that did not have a seat tube.

=== Rainbow jersey ===
The winner of a UCI World Championship title is awarded a rainbow jersey, white with five coloured bands on the chest. This jersey can be worn in only the discipline, specialty and category of competition in which it was awarded, and expires on the day before the following world championship event. Former champions are permitted to wear rainbow piping on the cuffs and collar of their clothing.

==Controversies==

=== Helmet use in road racing ===
For decades, professional road cyclists refused to wear helmets. The first serious attempt by the UCI to introduce compulsory helmet use was the 1991 Paris–Nice race, which resulted in a riders&#x27; strike, and the UCI abandoned the idea.

After the death of Andrei Kivilev in the 2003 Paris–Nice, new rules were introduced on 5 May 2003, with the 2003 Giro d&#x27;Italia being the first major race affected. The 2003 rules allowed for discarding the helmets during final climbs of at least 5 kilometres in length; subsequent revisions made helmet use mandatory at all times.

=== Bribery and doping ===
The UCI was accused of accepting a bribe in the 1990s to introduce the keirin, a track cycling race, into the Olympics. An investigation by the BBC claims that the UCI was paid approximately $3,000,000 by Japanese sources to add the race to the Olympic programme, something denied by the UCI.

When Floyd Landis confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career in May 2010, he alleged that the UCI had accepted a bribe from Lance Armstrong to cover up an EPO positive after the 2001 Tour de Suisse.

Discussing doping in 2012, UCI president Pat McQuaid emphasised the fact that his organisation was &quot;the first entity to introduce blood tests, the first sport to introduce the test for EPO&quot;.

=== Doping and defamation lawsuits ===

The UCI has sued or threatened to sue several cyclists, journalists, and writers for defamation after they accused it of corruption or other misdeeds related to doping. Many, though not all, of these suits are heard in the Est Vaudois district court of Vevey, Switzerland

In 2002 UCI sued Festina soigneur Willy Voet over claims in his book &quot;Breaking the Chain&quot;. In 2004 the UCI won the case, and in 2006 won the appeal. Voet had made various claims about UCI and Verbruggen&#x27;s behavior related to the Laurent Brochard Lidocaine case at the 1997 UCI Road World Championships.

In 2006, according to Cycling News, the UCI contacted Greg LeMond after an interview he did in 2006 with &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot;, and threatened to sue him for defamation. LeMond mentioned the UCI-commissioned Vrijman report, as well as Operacion Puerto, and called the body &quot;corrupt&quot;.

Another lawsuit was by Hein Verbruggen against WADA Chief Dick Pound in Swiss court regarding his comments about doping and the UCI. The lawsuit was settled by the parties in 2009.

In 2011, the UCI sued Floyd Landis in Switzerland after Landis accused the body of several misdeeds, including the aforementioned alleged coverup involving Lance Armstrong and the 2001 Tour de Suisse. In 2012 Cycling News reported that a District Court had ruled for UCI against Landis.

In 2012 UCI president Pat McQuaid and former president Hein Verbruggen, as well as the UCI itself, sued journalist Paul Kimmage in Switzerland for defamation. In 2013, the President of Cycling Federation of Russia called the UCI Ethics Committee to investigate Pat McQuaid actions after the UCI Licence Commission denied team Katusha a place in the 2013 WorldTour – the action which was promptly reversed. Kimmage had been a racer and had a long history of investigating doping in the sport, including a book and, more recent to the suit, articles for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot; which discussed doping and UCI. Greg LeMond, David Walsh and others voiced their support for Kimmage and a legal defense fund was set up to assist him.

=== Sufferance of an international law violation ===

Under approval of the UCI, the &quot;Free Rate Downhill Race&quot; took place in May 2015 on Crimea, an internationally recognised Ukrainian territory that was annexed by the Russian Federation in March 2014. By officially overseeing an international competition with Russian license on the Ukrainian peninsula, the UCI was the first and only international sports governing body which undermined the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Yet, in the aftermath of this &quot;scandal of sports and international law&quot; the UCI negotiated with the Cycling Federation of Ukraine and, in November 2015, announced to remove the &quot;Free Rate Downhill Race&quot; officially from the UCI international calendar.

=== Turkmenistan ===
Turkmenistan&#x27;s authoritarian leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow was awarded the highest award of the Union Cycliste Internationale for his country&#x27;s commitment to the sport.

==Disciplines==

===Road racing===

==== Men ====
The UCI organize the Road World Championships (road race first held in 1921, time trial first held in 1994), as well as administer the premier tier UCI World Tour and second tier UCI ProSeries races. The highest level teams in men&#x27;s road cycling are the UCI WorldTeam, who are obliged to take part in all UCI World Tour races.

On top of having organized the Road World Championships since 1921, from 1989 until 2004, the UCI administered the UCI Road World Cup, a season-long competition incorporating all the major one-day professional road races. In 2005 this was replaced by the UCI ProTour series which initially included the Grand Tour road cycling stage races (the Tour de France, Giro d&#x27;Italia and Vuelta a España) and a wider range of other one-day and stage races. However, the three Grand Tour races withdrew from the series, and in July 2008 all the major professional teams threatened to quit the series, putting its future in doubt. The ProTour was replaced as a ranking system the following year by the UCI World Ranking, which added the three Grand Tours, two early season stage races, and five more one-day classics to the 14 remaining ProTour events. The World Ranking and ProTour merged in 2011, becoming the UCI World Tour.

To expand the participation and popularity of professional road bicycle racing throughout the globe, the UCI develop a series of races collectively known as the UCI Continental Circuits for each region of the world.

==== Women ====
The UCI organize the Road World Championships (road race first held in 1959, time trial first held in 1994), as well as administer the premier tier UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour races. The highest level teams in women&#x27;s road cycling are the UCI Women&#x27;s WorldTeams, who are invited to all UCI World Tour races.

Between 1998 and 2015, the UCI Women&#x27;s Road World Cup served as a season-long competition of elite-level one-day events. From 2016, the competition was replaced by the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour - which includes stage stages as well as one-day events, including many races used in the World Cup.

<text>Helen Mason Young (1938 in Glasgow, Scotland – 1989 in London, UK) was a journalist and children&#x27;s author.

She gave up a journalistic career with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; after she married the political journalist Hugo Young and decided care for her four children. As they grew older, she began to return to paid work. She completed a number of successful children&#x27;s books under her married name, Helen Young, including &quot;Wide Awake Jake&quot;, &quot;A Throne for Sesame&quot; and &quot;What Difference Does it Make, Danny?&quot; whose target age-groups grew along with her own children.

Eventually she resumed her journalism as a freelance columnist on a number of newspapers, such as &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. As a journalist she was usually credited under her maiden name Helen Mason, and occasionally other pseudonyms to protect her children from the embarrassment of being identified by their friends with some of her more personal observations about them.

<text>Abraham &quot;Kid Twist&quot; Reles (; May 10, 1906 – November 12, 1941) was a New York Jewish mobster who was a hit man for Murder, Inc., the enforcement contractor for the Mafia&#x27;s National Crime Syndicate.

Reles later turned government witness and sent several members of Murder, Inc. to the electric chair. Reles&#x27;s death from falling through a window while in police custody might have been a hit placed by the American Mafia, as he was set to testify against Gambino crime family underboss and future boss Albert Anastasia.

==Early years==

Abraham Reles, the son of Jewish immigrants from Galicia, was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, on May 10, 1906. His father, Sam, worked in one of the garment trades until sometime during the Great Depression. His father&#x27;s last known occupation was peddling knishes on the streets of Brownsville. His full formal Hebrew name was Elkanah ben Shimon.

Reles attended school through the eighth grade. After leaving school, he began hanging out at pool rooms and candy stores in and around Brownsville. He soon teamed up with two of his childhood friends, Martin &quot;Buggsy&quot; Goldstein and Harry &quot;Pittsburgh Phil&quot; Strauss, who eventually rose to power with him in the group conventionally known as Murder, Inc. His first arrest came in 1921 for stealing $2 worth of gum from a vending machine, and he was sent to the Children&#x27;s Village at Dobbs Ferry, New York, for four months.

Reles&#x27;s small physical size did not deter him from committing ruthless acts of violence. When carrying out murders, his weapon of choice was an ice pick, which he would ram through his victim&#x27;s ear into the brain. On one occasion, in broad daylight, he attacked a worker at a car wash for failing to clean a smudge from the fender of his car. Another time, Reles killed a parking lot attendant for failing to fetch his car fast enough. One night, according to journalist Rich Cohen, he and Harry Strauss with the help of Buggsy and Dukey murdered &quot;Puggy&quot; Feinstein in Kid Twist&#x27;s house. Before the murder, they dismissed his wife and Buggsy&#x27;s wife, giving them fifty dollars each. His mother-in-law was still sleeping in the back of the house, which he believed would be no problem, but before the victim arrived, he had to wake her up to ask where there was a rope and where the ice pick was.

==Prohibition and Murder, Inc.==
During the Prohibition days of the 1920s, while still teenagers, Reles and Goldstein went to work for the Shapiro brothers, who ran the Brooklyn rackets. Soon Reles and Goldstein were committing petty crimes for the brothers. On one such occasion, Reles was caught and sentenced to two years in an upstate New York juvenile institution. The Shapiro brothers failed to help Reles, prompting Reles to plan revenge.

After his release, Reles, Goldstein, and George Defeo entered the slot machine business, the province of the Shapiro brothers. Through Defeo&#x27;s connections, Reles and Goldstein were able to make a deal with the influential crime lord Meyer Lansky, who wanted access to the poorer neighborhoods of Brooklyn and thus agreed. Both parties prospered: Lansky was able to get sizable footholds in Brownsville, East New York, and Ocean Hill, while Reles gained the backing he needed to keep both his business and himself alive.

Reles, Goldstein, and Strauss were partners in all of their criminal activities, which had primarily been the slot machine business and quickly expanded to include loan sharking, crap games, and labor slugging in connection with union activities, especially the restaurant union.

The slot machine business thrived and soon Reles and Goldstein were on the Shapiros&#x27; hit list. One night, the two men received a phone call from a &quot;friend&quot; saying that the Shapiros had left their East New York headquarters. Hopping into a car with Defeo, they headed to East New York. However, when they reached the Shapiros&#x27; building, the three men were ambushed. Reles and Goldstein were wounded, but all three managed to escape. In the meantime, Meyer Shapiro abducted Reles&#x27; girlfriend and dragged her to an open field, where he beat and raped her.

==Revenge against Shapiro Brothers==

To avenge the ambush and his girlfriend&#x27;s rape, Reles enlisted the help of fellow Murder, Inc. killers Frank &quot;Dasher&quot; Abbandando and Harry &quot;Happy&quot; Maione. The two killers were glad to help: they hoped to kill the Shapiro brothers and take over some of their operations. After several futile attempts by each side to eradicate the other, the Murder, Inc. group finally caught up with Irving Shapiro.

On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving from the hallway of his home out into the street. Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving numerous times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro on the street and killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles finally got the last Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, stuffed into a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro&#x27;s body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive.

==Government informant==

In 1940, Reles was implicated in a number of killings. Realizing that he faced execution if convicted, Reles became a government witness. Reles implicated his boss Lepke Buchalter in the murder of Brooklyn candy store owner Joseph Rosen; Buchalter was eventually convicted and executed for this crime. Reles&#x27;s information also implicated Louis Capone, Mendy Weiss, Harry Maione, Harry Strauss, Frank Abbandando, Irving (&quot;Knadles&quot; and &quot;the Plug&quot;) Nitzberg, and even his own childhood friend &quot;Buggsy&quot; Goldstein. All except Nitzberg were eventually convicted and executed. Reles&#x27; next target was Albert Anastasia, who had been co-chief of operations of Murder, Inc.

Reles was to implicate Anastasia in the murder of union longshoreman Pete Panto. However, unlike other members of Murder, Inc., Anastasia was a high-ranking member of the Cosa Nostra. The trial, based solely on Reles&#x27; testimony, was set for November 12, 1941. Until then, Reles was under constant guard by police detectives at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island.

==Death==
In the early morning of November 12, 1941, with police guarding the door, Reles fell to his death from a window in room 623 at the Half Moon Hotel.

It appeared he may have been trying to lower himself to the fifth floor window underneath using two bedsheets tied together and then to a four-foot length of wire that had been attached to a valve in his room. However, the wire knot to the valve came undone, and he fell to a second floor outdoor landing, and newspapers dubbed him &quot;The Canary Who Could Sing, But Couldn&#x27;t Fly&quot;.

The following day, five police officers who had been guarding him were demoted.

There was widespread speculation that he had been thrown or pushed out of the window and the room had been arranged to look like he was trying to escape. Reles had shown no inclination to escape from protective custody and indeed had demonstrated a fear of even being out of earshot of the police.

Frank Costello reportedly raised $100,000 to bribe these guards to kill Reles. In 2005 evidence was reported that NYPD Detective Charles Burns, one of Reles&#x27;s police bodyguards, was involved in the disappearance and probable murder of NYC anti-corruption judge Joseph Force Crater in 1930.

However, in 1951 a grand jury concluded Reles died accidentally during an attempted escape.

Reles is buried in Old Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens.

<text>Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is a conservation organization with a mission to save species from extinction. Gerald Durrell founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust as a charitable institution in 1963 with the dodo as its symbol. The trust was renamed Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in its founder&#x27;s honor on 26 March 1999. Its patron is Princess Anne, the Princess Royal.

Its headquarters are at Les Augrès Manor on the isle of Jersey in the English Channel. The grounds of Les Augrès Manor form the Durrell Wildlife Park, which was originally established by Gerald Durrell in 1959 as a sanctuary and breeding center for endangered species. The zoological park was known as the &quot;Jersey Zoo&quot; at that time.

As of 2016, the zoo was home to more than one hundred species of reptiles, birds and mammals, many of which are designated as endangered in the wild.
Despite strong resistance to his ideas from much of the zoological community, in 1959 Gerald Durrell succeeded in creating his own Zoo in Jersey, dedicating it to saving endangered animals from extinction. Gerald Durrell died aged 70, in January 1995. His wife Lee McGeorge Durrell succeeded him as Honorary Director of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and maintains an intense involvement in the Trust&#x27;s work both in Jersey and overseas.

==Jersey==
Durrell provides intensive hands-on management of endangered species at its Jersey headquarters and through 50 conservation programmes in 18 countries worldwide.

Durrell&#x27;s headquarters in Jersey is a safe-haven for endangered animals which need to be rescued from whatever is threatening their survival in their native home. Here they breed and recover in numbers while keeper-conservationists observe and study them to learn more about what they will need to thrive in the wild again.
==Durrell Wildlife Camp==
Work began on the Durrell Wildlife Camp in early 2012. The wooded copse to the west of Les Augres Manor, bordering on the &#x27;Lemur Lake&#x27; enclosure housing a mixed population of ring-tailed lemurs, black and white ruffed lemurs and red-fronted brown lemurs to the southwest. The lodging was named among the best overnight lodging at a zoo in the UK.

==Organic farm==
The Trust established its own organic farm before any establishment of its kind in the UK. The Durrell Organic Farm was created in 1976 to provide the animal collection with non-chemically treated foods such as sunflowers and maize. It provides 70% of the animals&#x27; fruit, vegetable and forage needs over the year – produce which would otherwise cost the Trust well in excess of £20,000 to buy in commercially.
==Dodo Club==
The Dodo Club is the children&#x27;s wing of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. The main focus of the club is environmental awareness and citizen science projects among younger members of the Trust. The Dodo Club is so named because the logo of the trust is a dodo, chosen by the founder Gerald Durrell as a reminder of man&#x27;s wanton environmental destruction.

<doc id="400671" wikidata="Q618690" url="?curid=400671" title="Apitherapy">
<text>Apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that uses honey bee products, including honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. There has been no scientific or clinical evidence for the efficacy or safety of apitherapy treatments. Bee venom can cause minor or major reactions, including allergic responses, anaphylaxis or death.

== History ==
References to possible medical properties of bee products can be found in Chinese, Korean, Russian, Egyptian and Greek traditional medicine practices. Apitherapy has been practiced since the times of Hippocrates and Galen. Modern use of bee venom appears to have originated with Austrian physician, Philipp Terč, and his 1888 article &quot;About a Peculiar Connection Between the Bee Stings and Rheumatism&quot;, but his claims were never tested in proper clinical trials. More recent alternative medicine practice is attributed to the Hungarian physician Bodog F. Beck who coined the term &quot;bee venom therapy&quot; in 1935, and to beekeeper Charles Mraz (1905–1999) in the latter half of the twentieth century. In 1957, the USSR Ministry of Health sanctioned use of bee venom to treat certain ailments by approval of Nikolay Artemov&#x27;s &quot;Instruction for Bee Sting Venom Apitherapy&quot;.

Humans have historically used bee products in various ways: beeswax was used in casting metals and making incendiary weapons, honey was used for food and religious offerings, propolis was used as an adhesive, and pollen was used for agricultural work such as plant breeding. Much later, there was an attempt to use bee venom clinically via injection by J. Langer at the University of Prague in late 1890s and in 1930, a firm in south Germany named Mack produced bee venom solution commercially. Apitherapy is used in traditional medicine in countries in Europe, Asia, and South America including China, Korea, and Russia.

==Alternative medicine ==

Apitherapy is promoted as alternative medicine for several uses, but its health claims are not supported by scientific evidence. Bee venom or other honeybee products are ineffective for the treatment or prevention of cancer. In general, evidence for using honey in wound treatment is of such low quality that firm conclusions cannot be drawn.

== Risks ==
Adverse reactions to bee venom therapy are frequent. Frequent exposure to the venom can also lead to arthropathy. In sensitized persons, venom compounds can act as allergens, causing a spectrum of allergic reactions that can range from mild, local swelling to severe systemic reactions, anaphylactic shock, or even death.

In March 2018 it was reported that a 55-year-old woman died after receiving &quot;live bee acupuncture&quot;, suffering a severe anaphylactic episode which the apitherapy practitioner did not respond to by administering adrenaline. While stabilized by ambulance personnel on the way to the hospital, she died a few weeks later from complications resulting in multiple organ failure.
Live bee acupuncture therapy is &quot;unsafe and unadvisable&quot;, according to researchers who studied the case.

<text>Proscription () is, in current usage, a &#x27;decree of condemnation to death or banishment&#x27; (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;) and can be used in a political context to refer to state-approved murder or banishment. The term originated in Ancient Rome, where it included public identification and official condemnation of declared enemies of the state and it often involved confiscation of property. 

Its usage has been significantly widened to describe governmental and political sanctions of varying severity on individuals and classes of people who have fallen into disfavor, from the &quot;en masse&quot; suppression of adherents of unorthodox ideologies to the suppression of political rivals or personal enemies. In addition to its recurrences during the various phases of the Roman Republic, it has become a standard term to label: 
* The suppression of Royalists after Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s decisive defeat of Charles II at the Battle of Worcester in 1651 (see image)
* The curbing of Western religion in early 18th-century China 
* The banning of Highland dress following the Jacobite rising of 1745 in Scotland 
* Atrocities that occurred during the Reign of Terror (1793-1796) phase of the French Revolution
* The mass deportations of British and French workers from Russia in the mid-19th century, with the onset of the Crimean War 
* In the 20th century, such things as the efforts of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom to prevent &quot;Communist entryism&quot; through blacklisting propagandizing persons and organisations 
* The broad prohibitions of Jewish cultural institutions and activities in the Soviet Union after the birth of the state of Israel in 1948 and the onset of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War
* The banning of organisations considered terrorist—including the membership of and support for—in Ireland, particularly the Provisional IRA and the INLA in the 1970s.

== Ancient Rome ==
=== Origin ===
Proscriptions (Latin &quot;proscriptio&quot;, plural &quot;proscriptiones&quot;) initially meant public advertisements or notices signifying property or goods for sale.

During the dictatorial reign of Sulla, the word took on a more sinister meaning. In 82 or 81 BC, Sulla instituted the process of proscription in order to purge the state of those supporters of his populist rivals, Gaius Marius and his son. He instituted a notice for the sale of confiscated property belonging to those declared public enemies of the state (some modern historians estimate about 520 people were proscribed as opposed to the ancient estimate of 4,700 people) and condemned to death those proscribed, called &quot;proscripti&quot; in Latin.

=== Treason ===
There were multiple reasons why the ancient Roman government may have desired to proscribe or attribute multiple other forms of pain. One of the most prevalent reasons for punishment are treason crimes, also known as lex maiestatis. Treason crimes consisted of a very broad and large number of regulations, and such crimes had a negative effect on the government. This list includes, but is not limited to: assisting an enemy in any way, Crimen Laesae Majestasis, acts of subversion and usurpation, offense against the peace of the state, offenses against the administration of justice, and violating absolute duties. Overall, crimes in which the state, emperor, the state&#x27;s tranquility, or offenses against the good of the people would be considered treason, and, therefore, would constitute proscription. Some of these regulations are understandable and comparable to safety laws today. Others, like violating absolute duties, could very easily be accidents or circumstantial crises that would deserve punishment regardless.

Punishments for treason were quite harsh and were meant to highlight the seriousness and shamefulness of the treason crimes committed. There were a variety of punishments for capital crimes, including death, loss of a freedman&#x27;s status, loss of citizenship with a loss of family rights, and a loss of family rights only. Death was a very common punishment and was referred to as &quot;summum supplicium&quot;, or the &quot;extreme penalty&quot;. The death sentence was often the punishment for all but the mildest forms of treason. Julius Caesar was an influential framer of the law on treason. The Interdiction from Water and Fire was a civil excommunication resulting in ultimate exile, which included forfeiture of citizenship and forfeiture of property. Those who were condemned would be deported to an island. Emperor Augustus frequently utilized this method of exile, as he desired to keep banished men from banding together in large groups. Such punishment was given for only the mildest forms of treason, in comparison to the death penalty, which served for most other treason crimes. Augustus also created the prefect, whose powers included the ability to banish, deport, or send to the mines. The prefect also heard appeals.

=== Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship ===
An early instance of mass proscription took place in 82 BC, when Lucius Cornelius Sulla was appointed &quot;dictator rei publicae constituendae&quot; (&quot;Dictator for the Reconstitution of the Republic&quot;). Sulla proceeded to have the Senate draw up a list of those he considered enemies of the state and published the list in the Roman Forum. Any man whose name appeared on the list was &quot;ipso facto&quot; stripped of his citizenship and excluded from all protection under law; reward money was given to any informer who gave information leading to the death of a proscribed man, and any person who killed a proscribed man was entitled to keep part of his estate (the remainder went to the state). No person could inherit money or property from proscribed men. Many victims of proscription were decapitated and their heads were displayed on spears in the Forum.

Sulla used proscription to restore the depleted Roman Treasury (&quot;Aerarium&quot;), which had been drained by costly civil and foreign wars in the preceding decade, and to eliminate enemies (both real and potential) of his reformed state and constitutions; the plutocratic knights of the Ordo Equester were particularly hard-hit. Giving the procedure a particularly sinister character in the public eye was the fact that many of the proscribed men, escorted from their homes at night by groups of men all named &quot;Lucius Cornelius&quot;, never appeared again. (These men were all Sulla&#x27;s freedmen.) This gave rise to a general fear of being taken from one&#x27;s home at night as a consequence of any outwardly seditious behaviour.

Sulla&#x27;s proscription was bureaucratically overseen, and the names of informers and those who profited from killing proscribed men were entered into the public record. Because Roman law could criminalise acts &quot;ex post facto&quot;, many informers and profiteers were later prosecuted.

The proscription lists created by Sulla led to mass terror in Rome. During this time, &quot;the cities of Italy became theaters of execution.&quot; Citizens were terrified to find their names on the lists. Those whose names were listed were ultimately sentenced to death. The executions were brutal and consisted of beheading. Often, the heads were then put on display for the city to see. The bodies of the condemned were often mutilated and dragged before being thrown into the Tiber River. Additionally, those who were condemned lost rights even after their brutal death. Those killed were denied the right to a funeral, and all of their possessions were auctioned off, often to the ones who killed them. Negative consequences arose for anyone that chose to assist those on the list, despite not being listed on the proscribed lists themselves. Anyone who was found guilty of assisting the condemned was capitally punished.

Families were also punished as a result of being related to one of the proscribed. It was forbidden to mourn the death of a proscribed person. According to Plutarch, the greatest injustice of all the consequences was stripping the rights of their children and grandchildren. While those proscribed and their loved ones faced harsh consequences, the people who assisted the government by killing any person on the proscription list were actually rewarded.

===Second Triumvirate===
The proscription of 43 BC was the second major proscription. It began with an agreement in November 43 between the triumvirs Octavian Caesar, Marcus Antonius, and Marcus Lepidus after two long meetings. Their aim was to avenge Julius Caesar’s assassination, eliminate political enemies, and acquire their properties. The proscription was aimed at Julius Caesar’s conspirators, such as Brutus and Cassius, and other individuals who had taken part in the civil war, including wealthy people, senators, knights, and republicans such as Sextus Pompey and Cicero. There were 2,000 names on the list in total, and a handsome reward of 2,500 drachmae for bringing back the head of a free person on the list (a slave&#x27;s head was worth 1,000 drachmae); the same rewards were given to anyone who gave information on where someone on the list was hiding. Anyone who tried to save people on the list was added to the list. The material belongings of the dead victims were to be confiscated. Some of the listed were stripped of their property but protected from death by their relatives in the Triumvirate (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Lucius Julius Caesar and Lepidus&#x27; brother Paullus). Most were killed, in some cases gruesomely. Cicero, his younger brother Quintus Tullius Cicero (one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s legates) and Marcus Favonius were all killed in the proscription. Cicero&#x27;s head and hands were famously cut off and fastened to the Rostra.

Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for the proscriptions and killing. They agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies. Marcus Velleius Paterculus asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them. Cassius Dio defended Octavian as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.

This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies. Suetonius said that Octavian was at first reluctant to proscribe officials, but eventually pursued his enemies with more vigor than the other triumvirs. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar, and Lepidus his brother, although only Cicero would ultimately be killed as a result of these concessions.

<text>Oujda (, ) is a major city in northeast Morocco near the border with Algeria. Oujda is the capital city of the Oriental region of northeastern Morocco and has a population of 720,618 people (2022 census). It is located about west of the Moroccan-Algerian border in the south of the Beni Znassen Mountains and about south of the Mediterranean Sea coast.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
There is some evidence of a settlement during the Roman occupation, which seems to have been under the control of Berbers rather than Romans.

The city was founded in 994 by Ziri ibn Atiyya, Berber chief of the Zenata Maghrawa tribe. Ziri was, with his tribe, authorized to occupy the region of Fas, but feeling insecure in that region and that town, and wishing to be nearer to the central Maghrib homeland of his tribe, he moved to Ouajda, installed there a garrison and his possessions, appointing one of his relatives as governor.

=== 11th to 19th centuries ===
In the mid-11th century, a new quarter with a wall was allegedly added to the primitive core. Yusuf ibn Tashfin occupied the city in 1079, and in the next century, it came under Almohad control, with its fortifications repaired and strengthened under the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir.

Oujda played an important strategic role between the Marinids, based in Fes, and the Abdalwadids of the Kingdom of Tlemcen. The Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub destroyed the city when he defeated Sultan Yaghmorasan in 1271. When his successor Abu Yaqub Yusuf conquered the city again in 1296, he destroyed the remaining fortifications but then rebuilt the town with the new walls, a palace, and a Great Mosque (the current one). The town continued to change hands, however. Around 1325, Sultan Abu al-Hasan took the city again during a series of campaigns which extended Marinid control into the central Maghreb for a brief period.

Because of its frontier position, the city was frequently contested between the Sharifian dynasties of Morocco – the Saadis, followed by the Alaouites – to the west and the Ottoman Empire to the east, from the 16th century onward. It was often attached to the province or region of Tlemcen, which itself also changed hands several times in this period. During the long reign of Moulay Isma&#x27;il (1672–1727), Oujda was firmly under Alaouite control and defended by new fortifications and garrisons built by the sultan. After Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s death, however, political instability returned. It was only in 1795 that the city was retaken by the Alaouite empire and permanently incorporated into Morocco.

The French occupied it in 1844 and again in 1859. To the west of the city is the site of the Battle of Isly which occurred in 1844. In 1907-1908, Oujda was reconquered by General Bugeaud and Marshal Lyautey and used as a French military base to control eastern Morocco. The modern city owes much of its present form to the French, who developed along the roads built at that time.

=== 20th century and present day ===
Anti-Jewish riots occurred in Oujda June 1948, during the 1948 Palestine war in the aftermath of the establishment of the State of Israel. Oujda, located near the border, was a departure point for Moroccan Jews seeking to reach Israel by crossing into French Algeria; at the time they were not permitted to do so from within Morocco. In the events, 47 Jews and a French person were killed, many were injured, and property was damaged.

The 1953 Oujda revolt took place during Thami El Glaoui&#x27;s attempted coup against Sultan Muhammad V.

In 1954, from the beginning of the Algerian Independence War, Morocco allowed Oujda to become the logistic center of the Oujda Group.

The Moroccan border with Algeria is just east of Oujda; on the other side of the border is the Algerian town of Maghnia. The border has been closed since 1994. 

In 2010, Rod Solaimani chronicled his trip to Oujda for MTV.

==Geography==
The city is located south of the Mediterranean sea and west of Algeria, with an estimated altitude of .

 south from city centre, is Jbel Hamra, a typical Mediterranean forest and into the east of this forest is Sidi Maafa park.

Oujda is located in the south of Beni Znassen mountains.

===Climate===
The city has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Rainfall is between and per year. It rarely snows in winter; last snowfall was on 5 February 2012. Weather in Oujda is cool but still tepid and wet in winter, hot and dry in summer.

==Architecture==
The main characteristic of the city is having the old city in the centre. The old city maintains traditional features of the Moroccan architecture with its narrow, winding alleys which lead to the houses and markets such as the jewelry market and the leather market. The Grand Mosque of Oujda is one of its historically most important mosques.

Bled el Gaada is a Roman era ruins just outside of Ouijda. The ruins consist of a Roman fort measuring .

==Music==
Gharnati refers to a variety of music originating in Andalusia. Its name was derived from the Arabic name of the Spanish city of Granada. Gharnati constitutes the musical mode mostly used in Oujda, where besides this musical kind is omnipresent and where each year in June the International Festival of Gharnati music is held.

Reggada Music is a major traditional music movement. Its a Moroccan Amazigh ancient musical genre and traditional war dance from the Beni Znassen/Aït Iznasen tribes of north-east Morocco (Provinces of Oujda, Berkane and Taourirt), more precisely coming from the village called Ain-Reggada. This dance used to celebrate and emulate victory of a battle. This music has now become part of the global music sphere.

==Subdivisions==
The province is divided administratively into the following:

==Transport==
Tourists aiming at Saïdia, bordering the Mediterranean, transit to Oujda&#x27;s airport. The city is served by Angads Airport, which has connecting international flights to Lisbon, Brussels, Madrid, Marseille or Paris for example, as well as domestic flights to Casablanca.

The city is the endpoint of the main railroad from Casablanca via Fes and Taourirt before the border with Algeria. There are several day and night trains to and from the city, linking it to the western part of the country. 

The Oriental Desert Express was originally built in the 1920s and 1930s as part of the Mediterranean–Niger Railway. One of its cars, the historical &quot;prince&#x27;s wagon&quot; passenger car runs now twice annually. Outside camera shots of the Oriental Desert Express were featured in the 2015 James Bond film &quot;Spectre&quot;.

==Economy==
Oujda has a strategic importance because of its location on the border. There are many economic and natural resources, however, the city struggles historically with an unemployment rate higher than the national average, standing on average at 20% compared to the 10.3% national average.

Oujda relies heavily on trading given its location near the borders of Algeria. The economy of the city is directly related to the border&#x27;s condition as it represents a passage for businesses directed towards Fes in the west, Talmasan in the east, Figuig in the south and Melilla in the north. 

On 18 March 2003, King Mohammed VI indicated the importance of reviving the economy of the Eastern regions of Morocco. As a result of this effort, Technopole Oujda was established and the region witnessed road improvement, airport expansion and other projects.

==Sport==

The sports infrastructure in Oujda is composed of a municipal stadium, an Olympic venue, the Honneur Stadium of Oujda, built in 1976, the sports complex &#x27;Rock&#x27; including a rugby stadium, a complex tennis in the park Lala Aicha, a golf course and two sports halls.

===Football===
In 1957, MC Oujda (MCO) became the first football club to win the Throne Cup of Morocco, defeating the Wydad of Casablanca, a feat the club repeated the following year. In 1959, in its third successive appearance in the final, the club lost against FAR of Rabat. However, in MC Oujda&#x27;s fourth successive final, the club defeated FUS Rabat. In 1962 MCO won its last Throne cup against the Kawkab Athletic Club of Marrakech.

After ten years, MC Oujda came back to win in 1972 the Maghreb Cup, three years after it won The Botola Pro of Morocco.

US Musulmane d&#x27;Oujda, is another football club in Oujda.

<text>Monsterpiece Theater (later called Monsterpiece Theatre) is a recurring segment on the popular children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a parody of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;.

==Format==
While using Muppet characters to act out educational principles, primarily Grover and other Muppet monsters, &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; is also a parody of the similarly acclaimed PBS show &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, now known simply as &quot;Masterpiece&quot;. The theme song is also a modified version of &quot;Fanfare-Rondeau&quot;, the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; theme song, only with trumpets and a much more upbeat tempo.

&quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; is hosted by Alistair Cookie, a play on the journalist and television personality Alistair Cooke, portrayed by Cookie Monster. He wears a smoking jacket and holds a pipe which he usually ends up eating. The segments are loosely based on classic literature, plays, films, and TV shows. Similar segments, titled &quot;Mysterious Theater&quot; and parodying fellow PBS anthology &quot;Mystery!&quot;, are hosted by &quot;Vincent Twice Vincent Twice,&quot; a parody of Vincent Price.

==Alistair Cookie==
Alistair Cookie is Cookie Monster&#x27;s alter ego when hosting &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot;. Created as a spoof of the original &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; host Alistair Cooke, Alistair Cookie is basically Cookie Monster in an English smoking jacket and ascot tie, although Cooke was neither a pipe smoker nor did he wear a smoking jacket on &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. Alistair Cookie introduced viewers to a spot of culture while relaxing in a well-stuffed armchair. Though seemingly more sedate and urbane, Alistair Cookie is still a Cookie Monster, devouring baked goods, props—and in the revamped opening in the 1990s, noisily consuming cookies over the theme, while offering judicious comments on the texture.

He used to appear smoking a pipe and then eating it at the end of each piece. In the late 1980s, the pipe was gone so as not to reinforce smoking as a positive attribute.

In a 2004 Chicago Public Radio interview, David Rudman (who performs Cookie Monster) referred to Cookie Monster&#x27;s occasional use of more advanced phrases, such as &quot;It a bit esoteric,&quot; as his Alistair Cookie side:

He throws out these words like, you know, &quot;Me digress.&quot; It&#x27;s his whole Alistair Cookie side... It&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother side of Cookie, where he&#x27;s just kinda, you know, laid back and intellectual, but he still has that &quot;Me Alistair Cookie,&quot; and it&#x27;s just such a funny contrast.

Alistair Cookie is generally a detached party who simply serves as a frame for the &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; spoofs. Occasionally, however, the participants take their grievances directly to Alistair Cookie (&quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;), crash into his sanctum (&quot;The 39 Stairs&quot;), or otherwise disrupt his hosting duties. On rare occasions, Cookie Monster himself stars in the sketches, as in &quot;Twin Beaks&quot;, invariably winning rave critical reviews from Alistair Cookie.

He was first introduced c. 1978. Alistair Cooke retired from &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; in 1992, replaced by American host Russell Baker, but this had no effect on Alistair Cookie, as reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from February 24, 1993: &quot;A spokeswoman for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; yesterday reassured its fans—and their children—that despite the change at the top, Cookie Monster will continue to appear as Alistair Cookie, the host of &#x27;Monsterpiece Theater&#x27;—big chair, fireplace and all... &#x27;We love that character,&#x27; said Ellen Morgenstern...&quot;.

Cooke himself was wryly appreciative of the take-off, predicting at a 1991 dinner celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; that if he was remembered at all, he would be best recalled by fans of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as &quot;Alistair Cookie, the Cookie Monster of Monsterpiece Theater&quot;.

In 1998, Applause Toys offered a limited edition stuffed Alistair Cookie to collectors, complete with smoking jacket, slippers, and armchair. The item is still available through certain PBS stations.

<doc id="400679" wikidata="Q2382319" url="?curid=400679" title="Ecological crisis">
<text>An ecological or environmental crisis occurs when changes to the environment of a species or population destabilizes its continued survival. Some of the important causes include:

* Degradation of an abiotic ecological factor (for example, increase of temperature, less significant rainfalls)
* Increased pressures from predation
* Rise in the number of individuals (i.e. overpopulation)

The evolutionary theory of punctuated equilibrium sees infrequent ecological crises as a potential driver of rapid evolution.

Because of the impact of humans on the natural environment in the recent geological period, the term ecological crisis is often applied to environmental issues caused by human civilizations such as: the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and plastic pollution which have emerged as major global challenges during the first few decades of the 21st century.

== Examples ==

=== Crises caused by abiotic factors ===
Climate change is starting to have major impacts on ecosystems. With global temperature rising, there is a decrease in snow-fall, and sea levels are rising. Ecosystems will change or evolve to cope with the increase in temperature. Consequently, many species are being driven out of their habitats.

Polar bears are being threatened. They need ice for hunting seals, their primary prey. However, the ice caps are melting, making their hunting periods shorter each year. As a result, the polar bears are not developing enough fat for the winter; therefore, they are not able to reproduce at a healthy rate.

Fresh water and wetland ecosystems are dealing with extreme effects of the increase of temperature. The climate change could be devastating to salmon and trout and to other aquatic life. The increase in temperature will disrupt the current life patterns of the salmon and trout. The cold-water fish will eventually leave their natural geographical range to live in cooler waters by migrating to higher elevations.

While many species have been able to adapt to the new conditions by moving their range further towards the poles, other species are not as fortunate. The option to move is not available for polar bears and for some aquatic life.

==== Climate change ====
=== Biodiversity extinction ===
=== Animal overpopulation ===
In the wilderness, the problem of animal overpopulation is solved by predators. Predators tend to look for signs of weakness in their prey, and therefore usually first eat the old or sick animals. This has the side effects of ensuring a strong stock among the survivors and controlling the population.

In the absence of predators, animal species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation. In fact, an abundant supply of resources can produce a &quot;population boom&quot; that ends up with more individuals than the environment can support. In this case, starvation, thirst, and sometimes violent competition for scarce resources may effect a sharp reduction in population, and in a very short lapse, a population crash. Lemmings, as well as other less popular species of rodents, are known to have such cycles of rapid population growth and subsequent decrease.

In an ideal setting, when animal populations grow, so do the number of predators that feed on that particular animal. Animals that have birth defects or weak genes (such as the runt of the litter) also die off, unable to compete over food with stronger, healthier animals.

In reality, an animal that is not native to an environment may have advantages over the native ones, such being unsuitable for the local predators. If left uncontrolled, such an animal can quickly overpopulate and ultimately destroy its environment.

Examples of animal overpopulation caused by introduction of a foreign species abound.

*In the Argentine Patagonia, for example, European species such as the trout and the deer were introduced into the local streams and forests, respectively, and quickly became a plague, competing with and sometimes driving away the local species of fish and ruminants.
*In Australia, when rabbits were introduced (unwillingly) by European immigrants, they bred out of control and ate the plants that other native animals needed to survive. Farmers hunted the rabbits to reduce their population and prevent the damage the rabbits did to the crops. They also brought cats to guard against rabbits and rats. These cats created another problem, since they became predators of local species.

== More examples ==
Some common examples of ecological crises are:

* Deforestation and desertification, with disappearance of many species.
* Extinction events
** Permian-Triassic extinction event 250 million years ago
** Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago
* The Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989
* Global warming related to the Greenhouse effect. Warming could involve flooding of the Asian deltas (see also eco refugees), multiplication of extreme weather phenomena and changes in the nature and quantity of the food resources (see Global warming and agriculture). See also international Kyoto Protocol.
* The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl in 1986 caused the death of many people and animals from cancer, and caused mutations in a large number of animals and people. The area around the plant is now abandoned by humans because of the large amount of radiation generated by the meltdown. Twenty years after the accident, the animals have returned.
* Ozone layer depletion.
* Volcanic eruptions such as Mount St. Helens and the Tunguska and other impact events
*Coral bleaching
*Acid rain
*Groundwater depletion
*North Atlantic garbage patch

<doc id="400684" wikidata="Q318948" url="?curid=400684" title="Jimmy Smith (musician)">
<text>James Oscar Smith (December 8, 1928 – February 8, 2005) was an American jazz musician who helped popularize the Hammond B-3 organ, creating a link between jazz and 1960s soul music.

In 2005, Smith was awarded the NEA Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor that America bestows upon jazz musicians.

==Early years==
James Oscar Smith was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania northwest of Philadelphia. He joined his father doing a song-and-dance routine in clubs at the age of six. He began teaching himself to play the piano. When he was nine, Smith won a Philadelphia radio talent contest as a boogie-woogie pianist. After a period in the U.S. Navy, he began furthering his musical education in 1948, with a year at Royal Hamilton College of Music, then the Leo Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia in 1949. He began exploring the Hammond organ in 1951. From 1951 to 1954, he played piano, then organ in Philly R&amp;B bands like Don Gardner and the Sonotones. He switched to organ permanently in 1954 after hearing Wild Bill Davis play.

==Career==
He purchased his first Hammond organ, rented a warehouse to practice in and emerged after little more than a year. Upon hearing him playing in a Philadelphia club, Blue Note&#x27;s Alfred Lion immediately signed him to the label and his second album, &quot;The Champ&quot;, quickly established Smith as a new star on the jazz scene. He was a prolific recording artist and, as a leader, dubbed The Incredible Jimmy Smith, he recorded around forty sessions for Blue Note in just eight years beginning in 1956. Albums from this period include &quot;The Sermon!&quot;, &quot;House Party&quot;, &quot;Home Cooking&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Back at the Chicken Shack&quot; and &quot;Prayer Meetin&#x27;&quot;.

Smith signed to the Verve label in 1962. His first album, &quot;Bashin&#x27;&quot;, sold well and for the first time Smith worked with a big band, led by Oliver Nelson. Further big band collaborations followed with composer/arranger Lalo Schifrin for &quot;The Cat&quot; and guitarist Wes Montgomery, with whom he recorded two albums: &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot; and &quot;Further Adventures of Jimmy and Wes&quot;. Other albums from this period include &quot;Blue Bash!&quot; and &quot;Organ Grinder Swing&quot; with Kenny Burrell, &quot;The Boss&quot; with George Benson, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, &quot;Got My Mojo Working&quot;, and &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Smith almost always performed live, in a trio, consisting of organ, guitar and drums. The Jimmy Smith Trio performed &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; and &quot;The Sermon&quot; in the film &quot;Get Yourself a College Girl&quot; (1964).

In the 1970s, Smith opened his own supper club in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, at 12910 Victory Boulevard and played there regularly with Kenny Dixon on drums, Herman Riley and John F. Phillips on saxophone; also included in the band was harmonica/flute player Stanley Behrens. The 1972 album &quot;Root Down&quot;, considered a seminal influence on later generations of funk and hip-hop musicians, was recorded live at the club, albeit with a different group of backing musicians.
==Later career==
Holle Thee Maxwell, then known as Holly Maxwell, was Smith&#x27;s vocalist for two years in the late 1970s. During a South African tour, they recorded the album &quot;Jimmy Smith Plays for the People&quot; in 1978.

Smith had a career revival in the 1980s and 1990s, again recording for Blue Note and Verve, and for Elektra and Milestone. He also recorded with Quincy Jones, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson (he can be heard on the title track of the &quot;Bad&quot; album), Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Joey DeFrancesco. His last album, &quot;Dot Com Blues&quot; (Blue Thumb/Verve, 2000), was recorded with B. B. King, Dr. John, and Etta James.

Smith and his wife moved to Scottsdale, Arizona in 2004. She died of cancer a few months later. Smith recorded &quot;Legacy&quot; with Joey DeFrancesco, and the two prepared to go on tour. However, before the tour began, Smith died on February 8, 2005, at his Scottsdale home, where he was found by his manager, Robert Clayton. He died in his sleep of natural causes.

==Musical style==

While the electric organ had been used in jazz by Fats Waller, Count Basie, Wild Bill Davis and others, Smith&#x27;s virtuoso improvisation technique on the Hammond helped to popularize the electric organ as a jazz and blues instrument. The B3 and companion Leslie speaker produce a distinctive sound. The drawbar setting most commonly associated with Smith is to pull out the first three drawbars on the &quot;B&quot; preset on the top manual of the organ, with added harmonic percussion on the 3rd harmonic. The tone has been emulated by many jazz organists since Smith. Smith&#x27;s style on fast tempo pieces combined bluesy &quot;licks&quot; with bebop-based single note runs. For ballads, he played walking bass lines on the bass pedals. For uptempo tunes, he played the bass line on the lower manual and use the pedals for emphasis on the attack of certain notes, which helped to emulate the attack and sound of a string bass.

Smith influenced a constellation of jazz organists including Jimmy McGriff, Brother Jack McDuff, Don Patterson, Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes, Joey DeFrancesco, Tony Monaco and Larry Goldings as well as rock keyboardists such as Jon Lord, Brian Auger and Keith Emerson. Emerson would later recount a story where Smith grabbed Emerson&#x27;s &quot;meat and two veg&quot; as a humorous greeting. Later, Smith influenced bands such as Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood and the Beastie Boys, who sampled the bassline from &quot;Root Down (and Get It)&quot; from &quot;Root Down&quot;—and saluted Smith in the lyrics—for their own hit &quot;Root Down&quot;. Often called the father of acid jazz, Smith lived to see that movement come to reflect his organ style. In the 1990s, Smith went to Nashville, taking a break from his ongoing gigs at his Sacramento restaurant, which he owned, and in Music City, Nashville, with the help of a webmaster he produced &quot;Dot Com Blues&quot;, his last Verve album. In 1999, Smith guested on two tracks of a live album, &quot;Incredible!&quot; (Smith&#x27;s nickname during the 1960s) with his protégé, Joey DeFrancesco, a then 28-year-old organist. Smith and DeFrancesco&#x27;s collaborative album &quot;Legacy&quot; was released in 2005 shortly after Smith&#x27;s death.

<text>Thelma Catherine &quot;Pat&quot; Nixon (; March 16, 1912 – June 22, 1993) was First Lady of the United States from 1969 to 1974 as the wife of President Richard Nixon. She also served as the second lady of the United States from 1953 to 1961 when her husband was vice president.

Born in Ely, Nevada, she grew up with her two brothers in Artesia, California, graduating from Excelsior Union High School in Norwalk, California in 1929. She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters, Tricia and Julie. Dubbed the &quot;Nixon team&quot;, Richard and Pat Nixon campaigned together in his successful congressional campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected vice president in 1952 alongside General Dwight D. Eisenhower, whereupon Pat became second lady. Pat Nixon did much to add substance to the role, insisting on visiting schools, orphanages, hospitals, and village markets as she undertook many missions of goodwill across the world.

As first lady, Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes, including volunteerism. She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the White House, an acquisition larger than that of any other administration. She was the most traveled first lady in U.S. history, a record unsurpassed until 25 years later. She accompanied the president as the first first lady to visit China and the Soviet Union, and was the first president&#x27;s wife to be officially designated a representative of the United States on her solo trips to Africa and South America, which gained her recognition as &quot;Madame Ambassador&quot;; she was also the first first lady to enter a combat zone. Though her husband was re-elected in a landslide victory in 1972, her tenure as first lady ended two years later, when President Nixon resigned amid the Watergate scandal.

Her public appearances became increasingly rare later in life. She and her husband settled in San Clemente, California, and later moved to New Jersey. She suffered two strokes, one in 1976 and another in 1983, and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992. She died in 1993, aged 81.

==Early life==
Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in 1912 in the small mining town of Ely, Nevada. Her father, William M. Ryan Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and truck farmer of Irish ancestry; her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant. The nickname &quot;Pat&quot; was given to her by her father, because of her birth on the day before Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day and her Irish ancestry. When she enrolled in college in 1931 she started using the name &quot;Pat&quot; (and occasionally &quot;Patricia&quot;) instead of &quot;Thelma&quot; but she did not legally change her name.

After her birth, the Ryan family moved to California, and in 1914 settled on a small truck farm in Artesia (present-day Cerritos). Thelma Ryan&#x27;s high school yearbook page gives her nickname as &quot;Buddy&quot; and her ambition to run a boarding house.

She worked on the family farm and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper. Her mother died of cancer in 1924. Pat, who was only 12, assumed all the household duties for her father (who died himself of silicosis 5 years later) and her two older brothers, William Jr. (1910–1997) and Thomas (1911–1992). She also had a half-sister, Neva Bender (1909–1981), and a half-brother, Matthew Bender (1907–1973), from her mother&#x27;s first marriage; her mother&#x27;s first husband had died during a flash flood in South Dakota.

== Education and career ==
After graduating from Excelsior High School in 1929, she attended Fullerton College. She paid for her education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a typist. She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank, and from 1930 until 1931, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and also as a radiographer.

Determined &quot;to make something out of myself&quot;, she enrolled in 1931 at the University of Southern California (USC), where she majored in merchandising. A former professor noted that she &quot;stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks&quot;. She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in Bullock&#x27;s-Wilshire department store, and taught touch typing and shorthand at a high school. She also supplemented her income by working as an extra and bit player in the film industry, for which she took several screen tests. In this capacity, she made brief appearances in films such as &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; (1935), &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936), and &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1936). In some cases she ended up on the cutting room floor, such as with her spoken lines in &quot;Becky Sharp&quot;. She told Hollywood columnist Erskine Johnson in 1959 that her time in films was &quot;too fleeting even for recollections embellished by the years&quot; and that &quot;my choice of a career was teaching school and the many jobs I pursued were merely to help with college expenses.&quot; During the 1968 presidential campaign, she explained to the writer Gloria Steinem, &quot;I never had time to think about things like... who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work.&quot;

In 1937, Pat Ryan graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from USC with a Bachelor of Science degree in merchandising, together with a certificate to teach at the high school level, which USC deemed equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher at Whittier Union High School in Whittier, California.

== Marriage and family, early campaigns ==
While in Whittier, Pat Ryan met Richard Nixon, a young lawyer who had recently graduated from the Duke University School of Law. The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. Known as Dick, he asked Pat to marry him the first night they went out. &quot;I thought he was nuts or something!&quot; she recalled. He courted the redhead he called his &quot;wild Irish Gypsy&quot; for two years, even driving her to and from her dates with other men.

They eventually married on June 21, 1940, at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California. She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he &quot;was going places, he was vital and ambitious ... he was always doing things&quot;. Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, &quot;Oh but you just don&#x27;t realize how much fun he is! He&#x27;s just so much fun!&quot; Following a brief honeymoon in Mexico, the two lived in a small apartment in Whittier. As U.S. involvement in World War II began, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., with Richard taking a position as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration (OPA); Pat worked as a secretary for the American Red Cross, but also qualified as a price analyst for the OPA. He then joined the United States Navy as a commissioned officer and, while he was stationed in San Francisco, she resumed work for the OPA as an economic analyst.

Veteran UPI reporter Helen Thomas suggested that in public, the Nixons &quot;moved through life ritualistically&quot;, but privately, however, they were &quot;very close&quot;. In private, Richard Nixon was described as being &quot;unabashedly sentimental&quot;, often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him, although she did have a nickname for him which he despised, so she rarely used it: &quot;Little Dicky&quot;. Of his critics, she said that &quot;Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That&#x27;s the way my husband is.&quot;

Pat campaigned at her husband&#x27;s side in 1946 when he entered politics and successfully ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, Patricia, known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had the couple&#x27;s second and last child, Julie. When asked about her husband&#x27;s career, Pat once stated, &quot;The only thing I could do was help him, but [politics] was not a life I would have chosen.&quot; Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent Jerry Voorhis. She also wrote and distributed campaign literature. Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent California&#x27;s 12th congressional district. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the United States Senate, and then be nominated as Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s vice presidential candidate.

Although Pat Nixon was a Methodist, she and her husband attended whichever Protestant church was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters&#x27; Brownie troop, occasional Baptist services with Billy Graham, and Norman Vincent Peale&#x27;s Marble Collegiate Church.

== Second Lady of the United States, 1953–1961 ==

At the time of her husband coming under consideration for the vice presidential nomination, Pat Nixon was against her husband accepting the selection, as she despised campaigns and had been relieved that as a newly elected senator he would not have another one for six years. She thought she had prevailed in convincing him, until she heard the announcement of the pick from a news bulletin while at the 1952 Republican National Convention. During the presidential campaign of 1952, Pat Nixon&#x27;s attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed &quot;Checkers speech&quot;, so-called for the family&#x27;s dog, a cocker spaniel given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat&#x27;s first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a man of the people, Nixon stressed his wife&#x27;s abilities as a stenographer, then said, &quot;I should say this, that Pat doesn&#x27;t have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her she would look good in anything.&quot;

Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad during his vice presidential years. She traveled to 53 nations, often bypassing luncheons and teas and instead visiting hospitals, orphanages, and even a leper colony in Panama. On a trip to Venezuela, crowds pelted the Nixons&#x27; limousine with rocks and spit on the couple for being representatives of the U.S. government.

A November 1, 1958, article in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; was typical of the media&#x27;s favorable coverage of the future first lady, stating that &quot;Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And she sure is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn&#x27;t just shake hands but clasps a visitor&#x27;s hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct ... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been.&quot; A year and a half later, during her husband&#x27;s campaign for the presidency, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;a paragon of wifely virtues&quot; whose &quot;efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented&quot;.

Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year (1953), Mother of the Year (1955), and the Nation&#x27;s Ideal Housewife (1957). She once said that, on a rare evening to herself, she pressed all of her husband&#x27;s suits, adding, &quot;Of course, I didn&#x27;t have to. But when I don&#x27;t have work to do, I just think up some new project.&quot;

== Her husband&#x27;s campaigns—1960, 1962 and 1968 ==
In the 1960 election, Vice President Nixon ran for president of the United States against Democratic opponent Senator John F. Kennedy. Pat was featured prominently in the effort; an entire advertising campaign was built around the slogan &quot;Pat for First Lady&quot;. Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud. Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined. Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost—&quot;millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes&quot;, as one reporter put it. This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon&#x27;s view of politics.

In 1962, the Nixons embarked on another campaign, this time for Governor of California. Prior to Richard Nixon&#x27;s announcement of his candidacy, Pat&#x27;s brother Tom Ryan said, &quot;Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him.&quot; She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband, but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to Pat Brown.

Six years later, Richard Nixon ran again for the presidency. Pat was reluctant to face another campaign, her eighth since 1946. Her husband was a deeply controversial figure in American politics, and Pat had witnessed and shared the praise and vilification he had received without having established an independent public identity for herself. Although she supported him in his career, she feared another &quot;1960&quot;, when Nixon lost to Kennedy. She consented, however, and participated in the campaign by traveling on campaign trips with her husband. Richard Nixon made a political comeback with his narrow presidential victory of 1968 over Vice-President Hubert Humphrey—and the country had a new First Lady.

== First Lady of the United States, 1969–1974 ==

=== Major initiatives ===
Pat Nixon felt that the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue as a symbol of dignity, but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position. When considering ideas for a project as First Lady, Pat refused to do (or be) something simply to emulate her predecessor, Lady Bird Johnson. She decided to continue what she called &quot;personal diplomacy&quot;, which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations.

One of her major initiatives as First Lady was the promotion of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems at the local level through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers. She stated, &quot;Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others.&quot; She undertook a &quot;Vest Pockets for Volunteerism&quot; trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs. Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady&#x27;s scheduling, noted that Pat &quot;saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn&#x27;t been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be&quot;. Her second volunteerism tour—she traveled within the United States—helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the Vietnam War. She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League, and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations. Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy.

Pat Nixon became involved in the development of recreation areas and parkland, was a member of the President&#x27;s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, and lent her support to organizations dedicated to improving the lives of handicapped children. For her first Thanksgiving in the White House, Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families. The following year, she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House. Though presidents since George Washington had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations, Pat became the only First Lady to issue one.

=== Life in the White House ===
After her husband was elected president in 1968, Pat Nixon met with the outgoing First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson. Together, they toured the private quarters of the White House on December 12. She eventually asked Sarah Jackson Doyle, an interior decorator who had worked for the Nixons since 1965 and who decorated the family&#x27;s 10-room apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York with French and English antiques, to serve as a design consultant. She hired Clement Conger from the State Department to be the Executive Mansion&#x27;s new curator, replacing James Ketchum, who had been hired by Jacqueline Kennedy.

Pat Nixon developed and led a coordinated effort to improve the authenticity of the White House as an historic residence and museum. She added more than 600 paintings, antiques and furnishings to the Executive Mansion and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration; this greatly, and dramatically, expanded upon Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s more publicized efforts. She created the Map Room and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine other rooms, including the Red Room, Blue Room and Green Room. She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, making it glow a soft white. She ordered the American flag atop the White House flown day and night, even when the president was not in residence.

She ordered pamphlets describing the rooms of the house for tourists so they could understand everything, and had them translated into Spanish, French, Italian and Russian for foreigners. She had ramps installed for the handicapped and physically disabled. She instructed the police who served as tour guides to attend sessions at the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library (to learn how tours were guided &quot;in a real museum&quot;), and arranged for them to wear less menacing uniforms, with their guns hidden underneath. The tour guides were to speak slowly to deaf groups, to help those who lip-read, and Pat ordered that the blind be able to touch the antiques.

The First Lady had long been irritated by the perception that the White House and access to the President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous; she routinely came down from the family quarters to greet tourists, shake hands, sign autographs, and pose for photos. Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, &quot;she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little-known organizations...&quot;

She invited former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and her children Caroline and John Jr. to dine with her family and view the White House&#x27;s official portraits of her and her husband, the late President Kennedy. It was the first time that the three Kennedys had returned to the White House since the president&#x27;s assassination eight years earlier. Pat had ordered the visit to be kept secret from the media until after the trip&#x27;s conclusion in an attempt to maintain privacy for the Kennedys. She also invited President Kennedy&#x27;s mother Rose Kennedy to see her son&#x27;s official portrait.

She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented. The tours that were conducted in December displayed the White House&#x27;s Christmas decor. In addition, she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions, from opera to bluegrass; among the guests were The Carpenters in 1972. These events were described as ranging from &quot;creative to indifferent, to downright embarrassing&quot;. When they entered the White House in 1969, the Nixons began inviting families to non-denominational Sunday church services in the East Room of the White House. She also oversaw the White House wedding of her daughter, Tricia, to Edward Ridley Finch Cox in 1971.

In October 1969, she announced her appointment of Constance Stuart as her staff director and press secretary. To the White House residence staff, the Nixons were perceived as more stiff and formal than other first families, but nonetheless kind.

She spoke out in favor of women running for political office and encouraged her husband to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court, saying &quot;woman power is unbeatable; I&#x27;ve seen it all across this country&quot;. She was the first of the American First Ladies to publicly support the Equal Rights Amendment, though her views on abortion were mixed. Following the Court&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, Pat stated she was pro-choice. However, in 1972, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m really not for abortion. I think it&#x27;s a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand—wholesale.&quot;

In 1972, she became the first Republican First Lady to address a national convention. Her efforts in the 1972 reelection campaign—traveling across the country and speaking on behalf of her husband—were copied by future candidates&#x27; spouses.

Pat Nixon held the record as the most-traveled First Lady until her mark was surpassed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. In President Nixon&#x27;s first term, Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states, and in the first year alone, shook hands with a quarter of a million people. She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England. On such trips, Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage, feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers. Soon after, during a trip to South Vietnam, Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. She had tea with the wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter—armed by military guards with machine guns—to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below. She later admitted to experiencing a &quot;moment of fear going into a battle zone&quot;, because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, &quot;Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire.&quot; She later visited an army hospital, where, for two hours, she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient. The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, said Pat Nixon&#x27;s trip &quot;intensified our morale&quot;.

After hearing about the Great Peruvian earthquake of 1970, which caused an avalanche and additional destruction, Pat initiated a &quot;volunteer American relief drive&quot; and flew to the country, where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims. She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams. Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort, and her presence was a direct boost to political relations. One Peruvian official commented: &quot;Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done,&quot; and an editorial in Peru&#x27;s &quot;Lima Prensa&quot; said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon. Fran Lewine of the Associated Press wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a &quot;mercy mission&quot; resulting in such &quot;diplomatic side effects&quot;. On the trip, the Peruvian government presented her with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun, the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas.

She became the first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972, on a , eight-day journey to Ghana, Liberia, and the Ivory Coast. Upon arrival in Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute reserved only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops. She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals. She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood, Liberia&#x27;s highest honor. In Ghana, she again danced with local residents, and addressed the nation&#x27;s Parliament. In the Ivory Coast, she was met by a quarter of a million people shouting &quot;Vive Madame Nixon!&quot; She conferred with leaders of all three African nations. Upon her return home, White House staffer Charles Colson sent a memo to the President reading in part, &quot;Mrs. Nixon has now broken through where we have failed ... People—men and women—identify with her, and in return with you.&quot;
Another notable journey was the Nixons&#x27; historic visit to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1972. While President Nixon was in meetings, Pat toured through Beijing in her red coat. According to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, China was Pat Nixon&#x27;s &quot;moment&quot;, her turning point as an acclaimed First Lady in the United States. She accompanied her husband to the Nixon–Brezhnev summit meetings in the Soviet Union later in the year. Though security constraints left her unable to walk freely through the streets as she did in China, Pat was still able to visit with children and walk arm-in-arm with Soviet First Lady Viktoria Brezhneva. Later, she visited Brazil and Venezuela in 1974 with the unique diplomatic standing of personal representative of the president. The Nixons&#x27; last major trip was in June 1974, to Austria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel, and Jordan.

=== Fashion and style ===

The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation&#x27;s hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; stated that Pat had a &quot;good figure and good posture&quot;, as well as &quot;the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today&quot;. Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. &quot;I consider it my duty to use American designers&quot;, she said, and favored them because, &quot;they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they&#x27;re non crushable&quot;. She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. &quot;I&#x27;m a size 10,&quot; she told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;I can just walk in and buy. I&#x27;ve bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers.&quot; She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, at the suggestion of Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon&#x27;s yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as &quot;a schoolteacher on her night out&quot;, but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, &quot;Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike.&quot;

Nixon did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s, because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband&#x27;s political star rose. &quot;Always before, it was sort of fun to get some ... thing that was completely different, high-style&quot;, she told a reporter. &quot;But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular.&quot;

=== Watergate ===

At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon &quot;barely noticed&quot; the reports of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, &quot;I know only what I read in the newspapers.&quot; In 1974, when a reporter asked &quot;Is the press the cause of the president&#x27;s problems?&quot;, she shot back, &quot;What problems?&quot; Privately, she felt that the power of her husband&#x27;s staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.&quot;
Pat Nixon did not know of the secret tape recordings her husband had made. Julie Nixon Eisenhower stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence. Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to &quot;private love letters—for one person alone&quot;. Believing in her husband&#x27;s innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him. She said to her friend Helene Drown, &quot;Dick has done so much for the country. Why is this happening?&quot;

After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency, she replied &quot;But why?&quot; She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family&#x27;s personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat sat on the edge of a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, &quot;We&#x27;re all very proud of you, Daddy.&quot; Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, &quot;Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling.&quot;

On the morning of August 9 in the East Room, Nixon gave a televised 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff, during which time he read from Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s biography and praised his own parents. The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion&#x27;s South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford. The outgoing president departed from the White House on Marine One. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one arm around her husband&#x27;s waist and one around Betty&#x27;s, said to Betty &quot;You&#x27;ll see many of these red carpets, and you&#x27;ll get so you hate &#x27;em.&quot; The helicopter transported them to Andrews Air Force Base; from there they flew to California.

Pat Nixon later told her daughter Julie, &quot;Watergate is the only crisis that ever got me down ... And I know I will never live to see the vindication.&quot;

=== Public perception ===
Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted that ordinary citizens responded to, and identified with, Pat Nixon. When a group of people from a rural community visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because he could not see her washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons&#x27; trip to China in 1972, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was sufficiently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the United States as a gift from China.

Pat Nixon was listed on the Gallup Organization&#x27;s top-ten list of the most admired women fourteen times, from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979. She was ranked third in 1969, second in 1970 and 1971, and first in 1972. She remained on the top-ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office. To many, she was seen as an example of the &quot;American Dream&quot;, having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the &quot;great silent majority&quot; of voters. Mary Brooks, the director of the United States Mint and a long-time friend of Pat&#x27;s, illustrated some of the cultural divides present at the time when she described the First Lady as &quot;a good example to the women of this country–if they&#x27;re not part of those Women&#x27;s Liberation groups&quot;. Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent Helen Thomas that Pat &quot;was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people the most. I think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive.&quot;

Press accounts framed Pat Nixon as an embodiment of Cold War domesticity, in stark contrast to the second-wave feminism of the time. Journalists often portrayed her as dutiful and selfless and seeing herself as a wife first and individual second. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described her as &quot;the perfect wife and mother–pressing [her husband&#x27;s] pants, making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie, doing her own housework even as the Vice President&#x27;s wife&quot;. In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged &quot;Plastic Pat&quot;, a derogatory nickname applied because, according to critics, she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion and her body language made her seem reserved, and at times, artificial. Some observers described Pat Nixon as &quot;a paper doll, a Barbie doll–plastic, antiseptic, unalive&quot; and that she &quot;put every bit of the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role, and she may no longer recognize it as such&quot;.

As for the criticisms, she said, &quot;I am who I am and I will continue to be.&quot; She unguardedly revealed some of her opinions of her own life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: &quot;Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven&#x27;t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I&#x27;ve stayed interested in people. I&#x27;ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don&#x27;t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I&#x27;ve never had it easy. I&#x27;m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy.&quot;

Despite her largely demure public persona as a traditional wife and homemaker, she was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve had enough of this kitchen thing, don&#x27;t you?&quot; Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert E. Thompson, felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that &quot;women can play a vital role in world affairs&quot; while still retaining a &quot;feminine manner&quot;. Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration&#x27;s policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them in one instance in 1970, however, one of the students told the press that &quot;she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised.&quot; Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.

== Later life ==

After returning to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons&#x27; home, &quot;La Casa Pacifica&quot;, Pat Nixon rarely appeared in public and only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood hometown of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them. I am happy to tell you that I&#x27;m not gone—I mean, not really gone.&quot; It was Pat&#x27;s only solo public appearance in five and a half years in California.

On July 7, 1976, at &quot;La Casa Pacifica&quot;, Nixon suffered a stroke, which resulted in the paralysis of her entire left side. Physical therapy enabled her to eventually regain all movement. She said that her recovery was &quot;the hardest thing I have ever done physically&quot;. In 1979, she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan, New York. They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a house in Saddle River, New Jersey. This gave the couple additional space, and enabled them to be near their children and grandchildren. Pat, however, sustained another stroke in 1983 and two lung infections the following year.
Appearing &quot;frail and slightly bent&quot;, she appeared in public for the opening of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace (now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) in Yorba Linda, California, on July 19, 1990. The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, &quot;I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady&quot;, and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, &quot;There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through her smile you could see that she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs.&quot;

The Nixons moved to a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat&#x27;s health was failing, and the house was smaller and contained an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.

== Death and funeral ==
Pat Nixon died at her Park Ridge, New Jersey, home at 5:45 a.m. on June 22, 1993, the day after her fifty-third wedding anniversary. She was 81 years old. Her daughters and husband were by her side.

The funeral service for Pat Nixon took place on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, including California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton did not attend the funeral and former presidents Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush and their wives Rosalynn and Barbara also did not attend. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith and Ed Nixon both said they had never seen him more distraught.

Nixon&#x27;s tombstone gives her name as &quot;Patricia Ryan Nixon&quot;, the name by which she was popularly known. Her husband survived her by ten months, dying on April 22, 1994. He was also 81. Her epitaph reads:

==Popular culture impact==
In 1994, the Pat Nixon Park was established in Cerritos, California. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, one of the few statues created in the image of a first lady.

Pat has been portrayed by Joan Allen in the 1995 film &quot;Nixon&quot; (for which Allen earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress), Patty McCormack in the 2008 film &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; and Nicole Sullivan in the 2009 film &quot;Black Dynamite&quot;. She was sung by soprano Carolann Page in John Adams&#x27; opera &quot;Nixon in China&quot; 1987 world premiere in Houston, Texas; a &quot;New York Times&quot; critic noted that the performance captured &quot;the First Lady&#x27;s shy mannerisms&quot; while one from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the subject as the &quot;chronically demure First Lady&quot;. The part was later sung by Scottish soprano Janis Kelly in the 2011 Metropolitan Opera premiere in New York. This &quot;New York Times&quot; critic wrote that Kelly &quot;was wonderful as Pat Nixon. During the affecting Act II scene in which she is guided by Chinese escorts and journalists to a glass factory, a people&#x27;s commune and a health clinic, she is finally taken to a school. She speaks of coming from a poor family and tells the obliging children that for a while she was a schoolteacher. In Mr. Adams&#x27;s tender music, as sung by Ms. Kelly, you sense Mrs. Nixon wistfully pondering the much different life she might have had.&quot;

==Historical assessments==
Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In terms of cumulative assessment, Nixon has been ranked:
*37th-best of 42 in 1982
*18th-best of 37 in 1993
*33rd-best of 38 in 2003
*35th-best of 38 in 2008
*33rd-best of 39 in 2014

In the 2014 survey, Nixon and her husband were ranked the 29th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

<doc id="400695" wikidata="Q233641" url="?curid=400695" title="Julia Grant">
<text>Julia Boggs Grant (née Dent; January 26, 1826 – December 14, 1902) was the first lady of the United States and wife of President Ulysses S. Grant. As first lady, she became the first woman in the position to write a memoir. Her memoirs, &quot;The Personal Memoirs of Julia Dent Grant&quot;, were published in 1975.

== Early life and education ==
Julia Boggs Dent was born on January 26, 1826, at White Haven plantation west of St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents were Frederick Dent (1787–1873), a planter and merchant, and Ellen Wrenshall Dent. Frederick enslaved about 30 Africans, whom he freed only when compelled by law, having previously resisted moral arguments against slavery. Her family was of English descent, as her mother was born in England.

Grant, a distant maternal relative to Confederate general James Longstreet, was the fifth of eight children. In her memoirs, Grant described her childhood as &quot;one long summer of sunshine, flowers, and smiles…&quot;

Around 1831–1836, Julia attended the Gravois School, a co-educational one-room schoolhouse in St. Louis. From age 10 to age 17, Grant attended the Mauro Academy for Young Ladies in St. Louis with the daughters of other affluent parents. Grant was a boarding student during the week and returned home to White Haven on weekends.

The Dent family was highly social, with visitors coming from among the elite class of Cincinnati, Louisville, and Pittsburgh. William Clark (of Lewis and Clark) and politician Alexander McNair were family friends.

As a young woman, Grant was a skilled pianist, an expert horsewoman, and a voracious reader of novels.

== Strabismus ==
Grant was born with strabismus (more commonly known as &quot;crossed eyes&quot;), which prevents both eyes from lining up in the same direction. When she was younger, one of the best surgeons in the country offered to perform the simple operation that would fix them. Grant was not keen on surgery, however, and declined.

Because her strabismus was never corrected, Grant almost always posed in profile for portraits.

==Engagement and marriage to Grant==
While a student at West Point, New York, Fred Dent wrote to his sister Julia about how impressed he was with a fellow student, Ulysses S. Grant: &quot;I want you to know him, he is pure gold.&quot; In 1844, Grant began visiting the Dent family. In April of that year, Ulysses asked Julia to wear his class ring as a sign of their exclusive affection. Eighteen-year-old Julia initially demurred. Ulysses&#x27; regiment was then ordered to Louisiana in preparation for service in the Mexican–American War. Distraught at their separation, Julia had an intense dream, which she detailed to several people, that Ulysses would somehow return within days, wearing civilian clothes and state his intention of staying for a week. Despite the unlikeliness of the dream, Ulysses did return just as Julia had predicted, and the two became engaged. 
Neither set of parents was enthusiastic about the match, with her parents doubting his future earnings capability and his parents disliking her father for being an enslaver. Nonetheless, the engagement held, and Ulysses often sent letters to her, including ones that described his first exposure to the horrors of battle. The couple would not get married until 1848, four years later, once Ulysses returned from the war. He then was posted to several far-away locations, including Panama and Vancouver Barracks, where she did not accompany him, although he continued to write her. He suffered from loneliness, boredom, and a possible drinking problem, and resigned from the Army in 1854.

Over the next few years, he tried several business ventures, none too successful, and her friends indicated that she had been unhappy for much of the first decade of their marriage. Meanwhile, she gave birth to four children between 1850 and 1858. In 1860, the family located themselves in Galena, Illinois, where Ulysses worked as a clerk in a store owned by his brother.

With the American Civil War underway, Ulysses rejoined the Army. During some parts of the war, Grant traveled to be near her husband, something unusual at the time. The rest of the time, the two sent letters to each other. While she was careful to preserve his letters to her — which have been published in several forms — none of her letters to him are known to survive, possibly because at some point she destroyed them.
== Children ==

The Grants had three sons and a daughter:
* Frederick Dent Grant (1850–1912)soldier, public official
* Ulysses Simpson Grant Jr. known as &quot;Buck&quot; (1852–1929)lawyer
* Ellen Wrenshall Grant known as &quot;Nellie&quot; (1855–1922)homemaker
* Jesse Root Grant (1858–1934)engineer

== First Lady ==

Grant often referred to her time in the White House as the &quot;happiest period&quot; of her life. She hosted parties frequently, including gathering Union Army Officers and orchestrating elaborate and lavish dinners for politicians and guests. She was the originator of the State Dinner at the White House, which honored King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i. 

During her husband&#x27;s first term in office, Grant redecorated the family living quarters into a Renaissance Revival style, with money appropriated from Congress for the renovations. During his second term in 1873, Congress appropriated $100,000 for additional renovations from 1873–1874. To prepare for First Daughter Nellie Grant&#x27;s wedding, the Grants focused their refurbishing on the East Room, including the installation of gas globe chandeliers, which became renowned during the American Gilded Age among the elite. Herter Brothers, the New York furniture company, was the supplier of the furnishings in the East Room.

Grant sought to bring prestige to the position of First Lady and improve the stature of the wives of other government officials, including the cabinet, the Congress, and the Supreme Court. She was close friends with Julia Fish, wife of secretary of state Hamilton Fish. She did not publicly support women&#x27;s suffrage, but notably refused to sign an anti-suffrage petition.

Grant was the first First Lady recorded on film. 
== Later life ==
Grant was the first First Lady to write a memoir. However, she was unable to find a publisher. She had been dead almost 75 years before &quot;The Personal Memoirs of Julia Dent Grant (Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant)&quot; was finally published in 1975. She died in Washington, D.C. on December 14, 1902, at the age of 76.
In 1897, she attended the dedication of Grant&#x27;s monumental tomb overlooking the Hudson River in New York City. She was laid to rest in a sarcophagus beside her husband. She had ended her own chronicle of their years together with a firm declaration: &quot;the light of his glorious fame still reaches out to me, falls upon me, and warms me.&quot;

While in Washington, D.C., Grant followed Dolley Madison&#x27;s lead and acted as a &quot;Queen Mother&quot; figure. She became friends with First Ladies Frances Cleveland, Caroline Harrison, and Edith Roosevelt.

<doc id="400711" wikidata="Q4162531" url="?curid=400711" title="Grünwald–Letnikov derivative">
<text>In mathematics, the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative is a basic extension of the derivative in fractional calculus that allows one to take the derivative a non-integer number of times. It was introduced by Anton Karl Grünwald (1838–1920) from Prague, in 1867, and by Aleksey Vasilievich Letnikov (1837–1888) in Moscow in 1868.

==Constructing the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative==

The formula 
:formula_1
for the derivative can be applied recursively to get higher-order derivatives. For example, the second-order derivative would be:

:formula_2

Assuming that the &quot;h&quot; &#x27;s converge synchronously, this simplifies to:

:formula_3

which can be justified rigorously by the mean value theorem. In general, we have (see binomial coefficient):

:formula_4

Removing the restriction that &quot;n&quot; be a positive integer, it is reasonable to define:

:formula_5

This defines the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative.

To simplify notation, we set:

:formula_6

Then the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative may be succinctly written as:

:formula_7

===An alternative definition===

In the preceding section, the general first principles equation for integer order derivatives was derived. It can be shown that the equation may also be written as

:formula_8

or removing the restriction that &quot;n&quot; must be a positive integer:

:formula_9

This equation is called the reverse Grünwald–Letnikov derivative. If the substitution &quot;h&quot; → −&quot;h&quot; is made, the resulting equation is called the direct Grünwald–Letnikov derivative:

:formula_10

<doc id="400717" wikidata="Q1031842" url="?curid=400717" title="CanJet">
<text>CanJet was a Canadian low-cost airline headquartered in Enfield, Nova Scotia and based at Halifax Stanfield International Airport. In addition to initially flying scheduled passenger service, CanJet operated charter flights using its own brand as well as flying contract and ad hoc charters for other tour operators and airlines throughout Canada and the United States. CanJet was wholly owned by IMP Group International and had 572 employees as of March 2007. The airline ceased operations in 2015.

== History ==
===Before the merger with Canada 3000 ===
The airline was established in 1999 and started operations on September 5, 2000. It was launched as a division of IMP Group and merged with Canada 3000 in May 2001 shortly before Canada 3000&#x27;s bankruptcy.

===Scheduled operations from 2002-2006===

CanJet was relaunched on June 20, 2002, as an independent airline. The relaunched airline flew to three destinations, but quickly expanded. Canjet operated a fleet of nine Boeing 737-500 — seven of which were previously operated by United Airlines and one by Sabena — and one Boeing 737-300. These airframes date back to the early 1990s. There were plans to expand the airline&#x27;s fleet of Boeing 737-500 aircraft to 20 by 2006; however, the plans were not realized.

In April 2004, CanJet launched services at Hamilton/John C. Munro International Airport, Hamilton to fill a void left after WestJet shifted its eastern Canada hub to Toronto Pearson International Airport.

In May 2005, the company began to expand into the western Canadian market with a flight between Calgary and Toronto, with plans to slowly expand to other western markets. In the wake of the bankruptcy of Jetsgo, the company hoped to fill some of that company&#x27;s market share, and hoped to expand slowly to avoid the fate of other companies such as Canada 3000. In June 2005, two weeks after Air Canada Jazz announced new service to Hamilton/John C. Munro International Airport from Montreal and Ottawa, CanJet announced it would end its service to Hamilton. In August 2005, CanJet announced new service to Fort Lauderdale, Florida from Toronto.

In May 2006, CanJet and Harmony Airways signed a marketing pact to allow greater cross country service. CanJet would end flights west of Toronto, and focus more on Atlantic flights. This pact allowed consumers to book flights with both companies and have their luggage transferred between the two airlines.

===Charter operations since 2006===

On September 5, 2006, CanJet announced that on September 10, 2006, it would cancel all regularly scheduled services and focus instead on charter service because of the highly competitive nature of the airline industry in Canada, and the resulting slim profit margins. Ken Rowe, IMP Chairman and CEO, said, &quot;with the rising business risks of operating a scheduled airline, IMP has decided to suspend year-round scheduled airline service and focus on their increasing charter business.&quot; CanJet stated that any passengers who had bought tickets for travel dates after September 10, 2006, would be provided a full refund, or alternative travel arrangements. Before the announcement, CanJet had been operating scheduled services and served 15 cities in Canada and the United States.

On September 27, 2006, CanJet announced that it would rehire more than 100 airline pilots and flight attendants; about 20% of the number laid-off on September 10, 2006, as the company regained a contract to fly chartered flights for tour operator, Sunquest.

On February 13, 2009, CanJet announced a five-year partnership with Montreal based Transat AT. Since 1 May 2009, Transat Tours Canada has chartered CanJet&#x27;s Boeing 737 aircraft flying from Canadian cities to various destinations. This replaced an agreement with Calgary-based Westjet.

In 2014, CanJet started to sell holiday packages branded &quot;CanJet Vacations&quot; in addition to its charter activities.

On April 14, 2015, the company laid off approximately half of its flight staff and eliminated its planned summer European operations. It also planned to park five of its six aircraft in the wake of the termination of the cooperation with Air Transat and the insufficient sales of holiday packages. A few weeks later the shut down of its &quot;CanJet Vacations&quot; holiday package operations was announced after 10 months of service due to much lower demand than expected.

On September 1, 2015, CanJet announced that it was ceasing flight operations indefinitely and effective immediately. Its corporate website www.canjet.com is no longer in operation.

== Fleet ==
===Fleet at closing===

As of December 2014, the CanJet fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

=== Historical fleet===
CanJet has also operated the following aircraft types:

== Onboard service==
CanJet provided free hot meals on all flights (except USA flights) with a free glass of wine, non-alcoholic beverages, coffee and tea on all flights. Pizza and sandwiches were available for purchase on USA flights, with free non-alcoholic beverages, coffee and tea. Snacks and alcoholic beverages were available for sale. On southbound flights, a free glass of sparkling wine was provided on board. Pillow &amp; blanket comfort travel kits, and headsets for in-flight entertainment were available for purchase on board.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On April 19, 2009, CanJet Flight 918 was taken over by an armed man who slipped through security checks at Sangster International Airport, Montego Bay, Jamaica. All passengers were released early on, but six CanJet crew members were kept as hostages for several hours. The hostages were eventually rescued by Jamaican Police, who successfully stormed the aircraft, following negotiations that involved Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding.

<text>Catherine Oxenberg (born September 22, 1961) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Amanda Carrington on the 1980s prime-time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Oxenberg is the daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and her first husband, Howard Oxenberg (1919–2010). She twice played Diana, Princess of Wales on screen, in &quot;The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana&quot; (1982) and &quot;Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After&quot; (1992), and has appeared in many other films.

==Early life==
Oxenberg was born in New York City, and grew up in London. She is the eldest daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia (born 1936), a member of the House of Karađorđević, and her first husband Howard Oxenberg (1919–2010), a Jewish dress manufacturer and close friend of the Kennedy family. Her sister is Christina Oxenberg. Princess Elizabeth is the only daughter of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia (who served as regent for his cousin&#x27;s eldest son King Peter II of Yugoslavia) and Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark.

Through her maternal grandmother, Catherine is a first cousin once removed of: Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy and Prince Michael of Kent. Oxenberg is a second cousin once removed of Queen Sofía of Spain and Charles III of the United Kingdom, making Catherine a third cousin of Felipe VI of Spain and William, Prince of Wales. She is also a third cousin once removed of Margrethe II of Denmark and Harald V of Norway; and a fourth cousin to Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg and King Philippe of Belgium.

Oxenberg was educated at the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in Kensington, London, St. Paul&#x27;s School, and Columbia University, though she did not finish college.

A contemporary &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; piece indicates that she was at least initially in the Class of 1983, dubbing her &quot;queen of the facebook&quot;.

==Film and television==

Oxenberg made her acting debut in the 1982 made-for-television film &quot;The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana&quot;, in which she played Diana, Princess of Wales. In 1984, Oxenberg joined the hit ABC prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;—then at its height of popularity—in the role of Amanda Carrington. Oxenberg left &quot;Dynasty&quot; in 1986, following a salary dispute after the end of her second season, and the role was recast with Karen Cellini. Though Oxenberg&#x27;s publicist insisted that the actress left &quot;Dynasty&quot; voluntarily, several media outlets reported that she was fired.

Oxenberg was the guest host on the May 10, 1986, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, making her the only descendant of a royal family to host the show. Oxenberg starred as Princess Elysa in the 1987 television film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; in 1988, and reprised the role of Diana, Princess of Wales in the TV film &quot;Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After&quot; in 1992. From 1993 to 1994, she starred in the short-lived series &quot;Acapulco H.E.A.T.&quot;

Oxenberg was portrayed by Rachael Taylor in the 2005 telemovie &quot;&quot;, a fictionalized retelling of the behind-the-scenes goings-on during the production of &quot;Dynasty&quot;. In 2006, Oxenberg appeared in the TV special, &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights &amp; Caviar&quot;, in which she was reunited with her former &quot;Dynasty&quot; castmates to reminisce about the series.

In 2019, Catherine Oxenberg produced and narrated &quot;Escaping the NXIVM Cult: A Mother&#x27;s Fight to Save Her Daughter&quot; in which Andrea Roth portrayed her.

==NXIVM==
Oxenberg acknowledged in November 2017 that she had had interactions with Keith Raniere and his NXIVM organization, bringing her daughter India into NXIVM in 2011 for what she thought would be &quot;a self-help, business-oriented program.&quot; Oxenberg confirmed that her daughter became heavily involved in the cult and that she had initiated what proved to be a failed intervention for India. 

In August 2018, Oxenberg revealed that India had left NXIVM in June, after the arrest of Raniere, and they were working on their relationship. In August 2018, Oxenberg&#x27;s book &quot;Captive: A Mother&#x27;s Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult&quot; co-written by former &quot;People&quot; magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff was published.

In 2020, Oxenberg was featured in &quot;The Vow&quot;, a documentary series for HBO, directed by Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, which follows Oxenberg&#x27;s attempts to rescue her daughter India. Oxenberg also appears in &quot;&quot; a documentary series for Starz, directed by Cecilia Peck and Inbal B. Lessner, which features India speaking out about her experiences for the first time.

==Personal life==
In June 1991, Oxenberg had a daughter, India Riven Oxenberg, whose father was later revealed to be the convicted drug smuggler William Weitz Shaffer. In December 1992, Oxenberg was living with her daughter in Coldwater Canyon, Los Angeles, California.

Oxenberg&#x27;s first marriage was to the producer Robert Evans, in Beverly Hills, California, on July 12, 1998, but the marriage was annulled nine days later.

Oxenberg met the actor Casper Van Dien during the filming of the 1999 TV movie &quot;The Collectors&quot;, and they worked together again the same year in the Evangelical Christian thriller &quot;The Omega Code&quot;. On May 8, 1999, they were married at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Van Dien had a son and a daughter from a previous marriage. Van Dien and Oxenberg have two daughters. In 2005, the couple appeared in their own reality series, &quot;I Married a Princess&quot;, which aired on the Lifetime Television channel in the United States and on LIVINGtv in the United Kingdom. Van Dien filed for divorce from Oxenberg in 2015.

While Oxenberg and Van Dien were married, and before India joined NXIVM, Oxenberg and Van Dien were celebrity ambassadors for the non-profit organization Childhelp.

In June 2023, Oxenberg revealed her engagement to businessman Ellis Jones. They began dating shortly after Jones offered Oxenberg a place to stay following her losing her home in the 2018 California wildfires. The couple married on October 21, 2023.

== Filmography ==

For playing Amanda Carrington, Oxenberg won two &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards in 1985, for Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Female Newcomer.

==Ancestry==

Through her maternal grandfather, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia of the House of Karađorđević, Catherine Oxenberg is a great-great-great-granddaughter of Karađorđe, who started the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804. Her maternal grandmother, Princess Olga, was the daughter of Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia and Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, himself the son of another Romanov grand duchess, Queen Olga Konstantinovna of the Hellenes and her Danish-born husband King George of Greece, brother of Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom and the Empress Maria Fyodorovna.

<doc id="400719" wikidata="Q931824" url="?curid=400719" title="Virgil Earp">
<text>Virgil Walter Earp (July 18, 1843 – October 19, 1905) was an American lawman. He was both deputy U.S. Marshal and City Marshal of Tombstone, Arizona, when he led his younger brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and Doc Holliday, in a confrontation with outlaw Cowboys at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. They killed brothers Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps&#x27; interference in their illegal activities. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Ike Clanton, who had run from the gunfight. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated the men, concluding they had been performing their duty.

But two months later on December 28, friends of the slain outlaws retaliated, ambushing Virgil. They shot him in the back, hitting him with three shotgun rounds, shattering his left arm and leaving him permanently maimed. The Cowboys suspected were let off for lack of evidence. His brother Morgan Earp was assassinated in March 1882. Charges against those suspected were dismissed on a technicality. Wyatt Earp, appointed as deputy U.S. Marshal to replace Virgil, concluded he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. Wyatt assembled a federal posse that included their brother Warren Earp and set out on a vendetta to kill those they felt were responsible. Virgil left Tombstone to recuperate from his wounds in Colton, California, where his parents lived.

Virgil married before he left to serve in the Union Army during the American Civil War. When he returned, his wife and child had left. He held a variety of other jobs throughout his life, though he primarily worked in law enforcement. His younger brother Wyatt, who spent most of his life as a gambler, became better known as a lawman because of writer Stuart N. Lake&#x27;s fictionalized 1931 biography &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; and later portrayals of him in movies and fiction as Old West&#x27;s &quot;toughest and deadliest gunmen of his day.&quot; In 1898, Virgil learned that his first wife Ellen Rysdam and their daughter were living in Oregon and reestablished contact with them. After suffering from pneumonia for six months, Virgil died on October 19, 1905.

==Early life==
Virgil Earp was born in Hartford, Kentucky, the second son of Nicholas Earp and Virginia Ann Cooksey.

===Marriage to Ellen Rysdam===

In February 1860, while living in Pella, Iowa, 16-year-old Virgil eloped with 17-year-old Dutch immigrant Magdalena C. &quot;Ellen&quot; Rysdam (October 25, 1842, in Utrecht, Netherlands – May 3, 1910, in Cornelius, Oregon). One report states that they saw each other only occasionally and kept their marriage secret until Ellen was about to deliver their first child. When her parents Gerrit Rysdam and Magdalena Catrina Van Velzen learned of the marriage, they were furious, as they preferred that she marry a man who was also Dutch. Virgil&#x27;s father thought he was too young to marry. Both parents wanted to get the marriage annulled. One source reports that Rysdam was successful, but another says her father failed because Virgil and Ellen refused to reveal where they had been married. They also claimed they had used false names, which would have made the marriage invalid in any case.

Virgil and Ellen remained together for a year in spite of his and her parents&#x27; disapproval. On July 26, 1861, Virgil enlisted at age 18 in the Union Army. Ellen had a daughter named Nellie Jane, born January 7, 1862 or in July 1862. Virgil was mustered in to the Illinois Volunteer Infantry for three years on September 21, 1862.

===Civil War Service===

Virgil enlisted as a Private in Company C of the 83rd Illinois Infantry on July 26, 1862, and mustered into service on August 21. The 83rd fought at the Battle of Dover and then was primarily on garrison duty in Tennessee. Virgil was court-martialed for a minor offense and docked two weeks pay as punishment.

In the summer of 1863 while Virgil was on active duty, Ellen&#x27;s father told her that Virgil had been killed in Tennessee. In early 1864, Ellen married a Dutch man named John Van Rossum, and in May of that year they joined a large group who relocated from Pella, Iowa, to the Oregon Territory.

When Virgil was discharged from the military on June 26, 1865, he returned to Iowa but could not find his wife and daughter. He hired on at a local farm and helped operate a grocery store, before leaving for California to join the rest of the Earp family. In 1868, Nicholas Earp took the family east again, eventually settling in Lamar, Missouri. On August 28, 1870, Virgil married Rosella Dragoo (born in France in 1853) in Lamar. His father as justice of the peace married them, but there are no further records of Rosella.

===Allie Sullivan===

Virgil later met Alvira &quot;Allie&quot; Sullivan from Florence, Nebraska in 1874. She was a waitress at the Planter&#x27;s House Hotel in Council Bluffs, Iowa. They never married but remained together the rest of his life. During the remainder of his life, Virgil worked at a variety of jobs, including peace officer, farmer, rail construction in Wyoming, stagecoach driver, sawmill sawyer in Prescott, Arizona Territory, mailman, and later in life, prospector. The Earp brothers were close and often moved together, seeking a better life. Virgil spent time in Dodge City, Kansas in 1877 with his younger brother Wyatt. Although there is no record of Virgil ever holding any law enforcement position there, Allie claimed he briefly worked as a deputy town marshal with Wyatt.

===Arrival in Arizona===
From Dodge City, Virgil and Allie arrived in Yavapai County, Arizona, in July 1877. Virgil lived in Camp Verde, Arizona where he first delivered mail and drove passengers between Camp Verde and Prescott on the Star Line stage. By October 1877 Virgil and Allie had moved to Prescott, Arizona, where he later owned a saw mill outside of town.

On October 16, 1877, U.S. Marshal Wiley Standifer, Yavapai County Sheriff Edward Franklin Bowers, Prescott Constable Frank Murray, Virgil Earp, and Colonel William Henry McCall attempted to arrest John Tallos and accused murderer George Wilson. While the others rode on horseback or carriages, Virgil ran on foot after the posse that pursued the two men to the edge of town, where a gun fight broke out. Virgil spotted one of the two men under a tree, reloading his pistol. Using a Winchester rifle from a distance, Virgil shot him through the head, killing him.

Virgil was shortly afterwards offered a job as a driver for Patterson, Caldwell &amp; Levally, a local freight company, during which he met John J. Gosper, Secretary of the Arizona Territory. Gosper was acting Governor in the place of Governor John C. Frémont, who was frequently absent. When Crawley Dake was appointed U.S. Marshal, he and Virgil became friends. In 1878, Virgil was appointed as Prescott&#x27;s night watchman, which paid $75 a month.

In November 1878, he was elected as constable for Prescott, for which he received fees for serving summonses, subpoenas, writs and warrants. While constable, Virgil wrote his brother Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. In September 1879, Wyatt resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City. Accompanied by his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, his brother Jim and his wife Bessie, they left for Las Vegas in the New Mexico Territory. There they were reconnected with Doc Holliday and his common-law wife Kate Horony, who had been running a gambling business until the territorial legislature banned gambling. Virgil and his wife met the others in Prescott.

==Appointed deputy U.S. marshal==
Knowing Virgil was moving to Tombstone, U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake appointed Virgil as deputy U.S. marshal for the Tombstone District of Pima County, on November 27, 1879. He was instructed by Dake to help resolve ongoing problems with outlaw Cowboys. But the job didn&#x27;t pay much. He was mostly on call helping county and city officials.

In an interview after he left Tombstone, Virgil said that &quot;The first stage that went out of Prescott toward Tombstone was robbed. Robberies were frequent and became expensive.&quot; Virgil and his brothers Wyatt and Jim and their wives arrived together in Tombstone on December 1, 1879.

===Tombstone City Marshal===
On October 30, 1880, after town marshal Fred White was accidentally shot and killed by outlaw and gunman &quot;Curly Bill&quot; Brocius, Virgil was appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone. Virgil now held both the more powerful local town marshal position and the prestigious federal law enforcement appointment. As town marshal, Virgil earned a regular salary of $100 a month plus a percentage of city taxes he collected.

But Virgil did not hold the job for long. The city held a special election on November 13, and Tombstone city policemen James Flynn and Ben Sippy competed for the job. But then Flynn dropped out of the race and Sippy beat Virgil for the office, 311 votes to Earp&#x27;s 259. On January 4, 1881, the city held its first regular election, and Virgil lost to Sippy once again.

However, Sippy was known to be in financial trouble. He requested a two-week leave of absence on June 6, 1881, and never returned. The city council once again appointed Virgil as temporary city marshal. On June 22, the center section of Tombstone was devastated by a fire. Virgil kept looting under control and chased off lot jumpers who tried to take over property. On June 28, it was learned that Sippy had left about $3,000 in bad debt and financial improprieties in his office. Virgil was appointed by Tombstone Mayor John Clum as the permanent city marshal and paid $150.00 per month.

===Conflict with Cowboys===
To reduce crime in Tombstone, the City Council enacted an ordinance in April 1881 that prohibited anyone from carrying a deadly weapon in town. Everyone was required to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town. A long-simmering feud between the Earps and some of the Cowboys played a big role in a gunfight that broke out when Virgil decided to enforce the ordinance on Wednesday, October 26, 1881.

Virgil was told by several concerned citizens that several Cowboys, who had been threatening the Earps for several months, were in town and armed in violation of the ordinance. Assisted by his deputy Morgan Earp and temporary deputies Wyatt Earp and John &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday, Virgil went to disarm Frank and Tom McLaury, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Billy Claiborne. That confrontation turned into a shootout now known as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

===Gunfight at the O.K. Corral===
Modern media depictions of Wyatt Earp made him into a legend. He is often depicted as the central lawman in the shootout, but Virgil was Tombstone City Marshal and a Deputy U.S. Marshal. Although Wyatt had previously served in Wichita, Kansas, and Dodge City as a lawman, Virgil had three years of Civil War service, and had previously worked in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. Virgil made the decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town and to disarm the Cowboys. While Wyatt had acted as city marshal the week prior when Virgil was out of town, Wyatt was on that day only a temporary assistant marshal to his brother.

Before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Virgil and Wyatt had been in only one shootout each, and Morgan had never been in any gun battles. Billy Claiborne had been in one gunfight prior to the shootout and was the only member of the Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting experience (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had not taken part in any gunfights, although he was involved in several drunken brawls involving both guns and knives. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night before the gunfight gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both outdoors, wounded from having been pistol-whipped by the Earps earlier that morning, and at least Ike was still drunk.

Virgil initially avoided a confrontation with Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had arrived in town early that afternoon and had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable after their arrival, as required by ordinance#9. Virgil had been offered armed assistance from the town Vigilance committee and the town militia, but he declined the help. Around 1:00 p.m., a miner named Ruben F. Coleman told Virgil that the Cowboys had left the Dunbar and Dexter Stable for the O.K. Corral and were still armed, and Virgil decided he had to disarm them.

Virgil testified after the shootout that he thought he saw Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury buying cartridges at Spangenberg&#x27;s gun shop beforehand. He went by the Wells Fargo office around the corner on Allen Street and picked up a 10- or 12-gauge short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone&#x27;s public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford&#x27;s Saloon.

Virgil, his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and Doc Holliday confronted the Cowboys in a narrow lot on Fremont Street. Virgil was not expecting a fight. He later testified that when he saw the Cowboys, he immediately commanded them to &quot;Throw up your hands, I want your guns!&quot; But shooting broke out almost immediately. Witnesses were conflicted about who fired first. During the gunfight, Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Virgil was shot through the calf (he thought by Billy Clanton). Three days after the O.K. Corral gunfight, the city council suspended Virgil as city marshal pending outcome of the preliminary hearing. Virgil was eventually exonerated of wrongdoing, but his reputation suffered thereafter.

==Assassination attempt==


After the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral the Earps relocated their families to the Cosmopolitan Hotel for mutual support and protection. At about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, Virgil was ambushed as he walked from the Oriental Saloon to his room. The &quot;Sacramento Daily Record-Union&quot; reported that &quot;he was fired upon with double-barreled shotguns, loaded with buckshot, by three men concealed in an unfinished building diagonally across on Allen street.&quot;

Virgil was hit in the back and left arm by three loads of buckshot from about . The Crystal Palace Saloon and the Eagle Brewery beyond Virgil were struck by nineteen buckshot; three passed through the window and one about a foot over the heads of some men standing by a faro-table. George Parsons wrote that he heard &quot;four shots in quick succession.&quot; Critically wounded, Virgil staggered into the hotel.

Earp&#x27;s upper arm was longitudinally fractured, and Dr. George E. Goodfellow removed of shattered humerus bone and his elbow, leaving his arm permanently crippled. Virgil told his wife Allie, &quot;Never mind, I&#x27;ve got one arm left to hug you with.&quot; Virgil was also shot through the back above the hip, and Goodfellow removed twenty buckshot that penetrated his body and lodged near the hip bone above the groin. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily Herald&quot; reported that the &quot;cow-boys are bent on vengeance for the slaughter of their companeros a few weeks ago.&quot; &quot;The doctor says there are four chances in five that he will die.&quot;

George W. Parsons, who had been treated by Goodfellow for an injury he received, was staying in Goodfellow&#x27;s office while he recuperated. He kept a journal, in which he recorded:

===Others threatened===

Wyatt, assuming that Virgil was dying, telegraphed U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake asking him to name him as Virgil&#x27;s replacement as deputy U.S. marshal:

Commenting on the telegram received by Dake, the &quot;Weekly Arizona Miner&quot; wrote about the repeated threats received by the Earps and others.

For some time, the Earps, Doc Holliday, Tom Fitch and others who upheld and defended the Earps in their late trial have received, almost daily, anonymous letters, warning them to leave town or suffer death, supposed to have been written by friends of the Clanton and McLowry boys, three of whom the Earps and Holliday killed and little attention was paid to them as they were believed to be idle boasts but the shooting of Virgil Earp last night shows that the men were in earnest. The &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; reported on December 30 that &quot;the &quot;local authorities are doing nothing to capture the assassins so far as is known ... Judge Spicer, Marshal Williams, Wyatt Earp, Rickabaugh and other are in momentary danger of assassination.&quot;

===Suspects===

The suspected shooters were later identified as Phin Clanton, Ike Clanton, Johnny Barnes, Johnny Ringo, Hank Swilling and Pete Spence. On Tuesday, January 31, 1882, Ike and Phin were brought before Judge William H. Stilwell on suspicion of shooting Virgil. The district attorney asked that bail be set at $5,000, but the judge released both men on $1,500 bond, indicating he thought the prosecution&#x27;s case was weak.

Although a hat that Wyatt later claimed belonged to Ike Clanton was found near the shooting, the evidence was circumstantial. Sherman McMaster provided the most convincing evidence. He testified that he saw Ike later that night in nearby Charleston. He said he asked Clanton &quot;about the shooting, at which Clanton replied that he &#x27;would have to go back and do the job over.&#x27;&quot; On February 2, Clanton&#x27;s attorney brought in seven witnesses who provided an alibi for Clanton. They all testified that Clanton had been in Charleston at the time of Virgil&#x27;s shooting. Spicer was compelled to release Clanton.

===Morgan Earp murdered===

After his shooting, Virgil spent the next three months recuperating. He was just starting to get back on his feet when on Saturday, March 18, 1882, Virgil&#x27;s younger brother Morgan Earp was killed in another ambush.

On Monday, March 20, Virgil and Allie were escorted by Wyatt and deputies Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, and &quot;Turkey Creek&quot; Jack Johnson to Contention, where they drove two wagons to the Arizona and New Mexico Railroad terminal away in Benson. Wyatt and his deputies had initially planned to travel only as far as Benson. Wyatt reported later that he received word in Contention that Ike Clanton, Frank Stilwell, Hank Swilling, and another cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson with the aim to kill Virgil. Wyatt and the rest of the posse remained with Virgil and Allie through to Tucson.

The men were well armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two cartridge belts. Allie wore Virgil&#x27;s pistol belt during the journey so it would be handy. Virgil told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; two months later that upon getting off the train in Tucson, &quot;Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth.&quot; &quot;They fell back into the crowd as soon as they saw I had an escort, and the boys took me to the hotel to supper.&quot; Guarded by his brothers and the deputies, Virgil and Allie had dinner at Porter&#x27;s Hotel in Tucson. Virgil was so weak he had to be carried up the steps of the train. Once they were safely seated, the rest of the guards kept watch for the Cowboys. Virgil and Allie along with James accompanied Morgan&#x27;s body to the Earp family home in Colton, California.

As Virgil&#x27;s train was pulling out of Tucson on its way to California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave contradictory accounts about the number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter&#x27;s Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark. Wyatt said later that he and his deputies spotted Frank Stilwell and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar.

When Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell may have stumbled or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp&#x27;s shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the &quot;Denver Republican&quot;, said &quot;I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn&#x27;t shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet.&quot;

He said Stilwell cried &quot;Morg!&quot; before he was killed. Stilwell&#x27;s body, riddled with buckshot from two shotgun rounds, one in his leg and the second in his chest with powder burns, and four other bullet wounds, was found the next morning near the tracks. Ike Clanton got away. When the Tucson sheriff learned who was responsible for Stilwell&#x27;s death, he issued warrants for the lawmen&#x27;s arrest.

Clanton gave an interview afterward to the newspapers in which he claimed that he and Stilwell had been in Tucson to respond to federal charges about interfering with a U.S. mail carrier, stemming from his alleged involvement in robbing the Sandy Bob line of the Bisbee stage on September 8, 1881. Clanton said that they had heard that the Earps were coming via the train and they had plans to kill Stilwell. According to Clanton, Stilwell disappeared from the hotel before he was found several blocks away, shot dead by the tracks.

==Later life and death==

After Virgil was ambushed and maimed in Tombstone, he and Allie moved to his parents&#x27; home in Colton, California, to recover from his wounds, which took almost two years. He sought treatment for his wounds in San Francisco and was interviewed on the Southern Pacific train by a reporter whose story was printed in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; on May 27, 1882. The reporter described Virgil&#x27;s appearance:

Despite the use of only one arm, Virgil was hired by the Southern Pacific Railroad to guard its tracks in Colton&#x27;s famous &quot;battle of the crossing&quot;. Virgil carried a top break revolver that could be reloaded with one hand. Southern Pacific was attempting to stop the California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, from installing a crossing over the Southern Pacific tracks in Colton to gain access to California, which resulted in the frog war. Governor Waterman deputized a posse from San Bernardino, California and came down in person to enforce construction of the crossing, ending the Southern Pacific&#x27;s railroad monopoly in Southern California.

In 1884 Earp&#x27;s father, Nicholas Porter Earp was elected justice of the peace in Colton. Two years later, Virgil Earp opened a private detective agency, which by all accounts he had quit by 1886, when he was elected village constable in July.

When Colton was incorporated as a city, Earp was elected as Colton&#x27;s first City Marshal on July 11, 1887. He was paid $75 a month and was re-elected to another term in 1888. Among other duties, he was reported to have cleared blocked sewers and kept track of the electric light bulbs. Virgil and Allie Earp&#x27;s Colton home still stands at 528 West &quot;H&quot; Street.

In 1888 Earp resigned as city marshal and he and Allie left Colton for San Bernardino. Five years later, in 1893, he and his wife moved to the short-lived mining town Vanderbilt, California. He owned and operated the only two-story building in town, Earp&#x27;s Hall, a saloon and meeting hall used for public gatherings and even the town&#x27;s church services. His business success in Vanderbilt did not match his success in politics, and he lost the election for town constable in 1894.

In 1895, Virgil and Allie traveled to Cripple Creek, Colorado, where they met Virgil&#x27;s brother Wyatt. They stayed briefly and soon moved back to Prescott in Yavapai County, Arizona, where Virgil became involved in mining. Virgil started mining in the Hassayampa district in partnership with W.H. Harlon. They leased the Grizzly mine owned by W.C. Hanson. The Prescott &quot;Weekly Journal-Miner&quot; reported on November 8, 1896, that the day before &quot;a serious accident had occurred at this mine. Virgil Earp and W. H. Harlon were working in a tunnel. The ground caved catching Mr. Earp and pinning him to the ground. He was unconscious for several hours and Dr. Abbott, was called to dress his wounds.&quot; The doctor told Earp he had dislocated his right hip. Both his feet and ankles were badly crushed, he had a serious cut on his head and bruises all over his body. The doctor said it would be several weeks before Virgil would be able to move around again, but it took him much longer to recover.
They moved south after that and began ranching in the Kirkland Valley. Virgil was nominated as a candidate for Yavapai county sheriff in 1900, but declined the nomination, possibly for health reasons.

===Reunites with first wife===

In 1898 Earp received a startling letter from a Mrs. Levi Law. At the end of the Civil War, his wife Ellen was told by her family that Virgil had been killed. Her family had been against their marriage. They took her and the baby daughter Nellie to Walla Walla, Washington, where she later married Thomas Eaton. She had four more children. Mrs. Levi Law was Virgil&#x27;s daughter, Nellie. The next year, encouraged by his wife, Virgil traveled to Portland, Oregon, where he was reunited with Ellen and Nellie Jane Law. On April 22, 1898, The Oregonian reported that Earp &quot;... is now enjoying a very pleasant visit with her and his two grandchildren at her home, which is near that of Mrs. Eaton, in North Portland.&quot; He also met three grandchildren he never knew existed. Later that year, according to her letter to The Oregonian, Nellie Jane visited Virgil and Allie Earp at their home in Arizona.

===Death in Nevada===

Before 1904, Virgil and Allie returned to Colton, where city records show that he along with three others unsuccessfully petitioned the city leaders to repeal a temperance law that allowed only one saloon in town. In 1904, they left California for the last time and moved to the boom town of Goldfield in Esmeralda County, Nevada, where Virgil planned to open a saloon. He quickly discovered there was plenty of competition and realized he didn&#x27;t have the capital required. Virgil and Allie were down to their last dollar so he took up gambling, at which he had been good.

In January 1905 he was hired as a deputy sheriff for Esmeralda County, where he was essentially a county paid security guard at the National Club. Virgil caught pneumonia in February 1905. His brother Wyatt was also living in Goldfield and visited with him. Earp slowly got better and attended an Order of Eagles meeting in May.

The serious injuries he had sustained during the mine cave-in several years earlier had left him debilitated and he never recovered his full health. Earp&#x27;s recovery from pneumonia did not last and in early October he had a relapse. On October 19, 1905, Earp died at St. Mary&#x27;s hospital in Goldfield.

In her memoirs, Allie wrote that Virgil&#x27;s last words were, &quot;Light my cigar, and stay here and hold my hand.&quot; His brother Wyatt was the last surviving participant of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Virgil was also survived by his father Nicholas, brothers James and Newton, wife Allie, and daughter Nellie.

At the request of his daughter, Nellie Jane Bohn, Allie sent his body to Portland, Oregon, and he was buried in the River View Cemetery there.

<text>The Chief Secretary for Ireland was a key political office in the British administration in Ireland. Nominally subordinate to the Lord Lieutenant, and officially the &quot;Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant&quot;, from the early 19th century until the end of British rule he was effectively the government minister with responsibility for governing Ireland, roughly equivalent to the role of a Secretary of State, such as the similar role of Secretary of State for Scotland. Usually it was the Chief Secretary, rather than the Lord Lieutenant, who sat in the British Cabinet. The Chief Secretary was &quot;ex officio&quot; President of the Local Government Board for Ireland from its creation in 1872.

British rule over much of Ireland came to an end as the result of the Irish War of Independence, which culminated in the establishment of the Irish Free State. In consequence the office of Chief Secretary was abolished, as well as that of Lord Lieutenant. Executive responsibility within the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland was effectively transferred to the President of the Executive Council (i.e. the prime minister) and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland respectively.

==History of the office==

The dominant position of the Lord Lieutenant at Dublin Castle had been central to the British administration of the Kingdom of Ireland for much of its history. Poynings&#x27; Law in particular meant that the Parliament of Ireland lacked an independent power of legislation, and the Crown kept control of executive authority in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant and its own appointees, rather than in the hands of ministers responsible to the Irish parliament.

In 1560, Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland ordered the Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Sussex, to appoint John Challoner of Dublin as Secretary of State for Ireland &quot;because at this present there is none appointed to be Clerk of our Council there, and considering how more meet it were, that in our realm there were for our honour one to be our Secretary there for the affairs of our Realm&quot;. The appointment of a Secretary was intended to both improve Irish administration, and to keep the Lord Lieutenant in line. The role of Secretary of State for Ireland and Chief Secretary of Ireland were originally distinct positions, Thomas Pelham being the first individual appointed to both offices concurrently in 1796.

Over time, the post of Chief Secretary gradually increased in importance, particularly because of his role as manager of legislative business for the Government in the Irish House of Commons, in which he sat as an MP. While the Irish administration was not responsible to the parliament, it nevertheless needed to manage and influence it in order to ensure the passage of legislation.

Chief Secretary Viscount Castlereagh played a key role in the enactment of the Act of Union which passed in the Irish Parliament on its second attempt in 1800 through the exercise of patronage and direct bribery. Upon the Union on 1 January 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland was merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Irish parliament ceased to exist. However, the existing system of administration in Ireland continued broadly in place, with the offices of Lord Lieutenant and Chief Secretary retaining their respective roles.

The last Chief Secretary to represent an Irish constituency while in office was Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue, MP for County Louth, who served from 1868 to 1871.

The last Chief Secretary was Sir Hamar Greenwood, who left office in October 1922. The Irish Free State, comprising the greater part of Ireland, would become independent on 6 December 1922. In Northern Ireland, a new Government of Northern Ireland was established, with a Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. This government was suspended in 1972, and the position of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was created as a position in the British cabinet.

==List of chief secretaries for Ireland==
This list includes holders of a key political office in the British administration in Ireland. Nominally subordinate to the Lord Lieutenant, from the late 18th century until the end of British rule he was effectively the government minister with responsibility for governing Ireland; usually it was the Chief Secretary, rather than the Lord Lieutenant, who sat in the British Cabinet. Exceptions were the periods from 29 June 1895 to 8 August 1902, when the Lord Lieutenant Lord Cadogan sat in the Cabinet and the Chief Secretaries Gerald Balfour until 9 November 1900 did not sit there and George Wyndham from that date also sat there, and from 28 October 1918 to 2 April 1921, when both the Lord Lieutenant Lord French and the Chief Secretaries Edward Shortt, Ian Macpherson and Sir Hamar Greenwood sat in the Cabinet.

<doc id="400734" wikidata="Q984347" url="?curid=400734" title="John Ross (Cherokee chief)">
<text>John Ross (; October 3, 1790 – August 1, 1866) was the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation from 1828 to 1866; he served longer in that position than any other person. Ross led the nation through such tumultuous events as forced removal to Indian Territory and the American Civil War.

Ross&#x27;s parents sent him for formal schooling to institutions that served other bicultural Cherokee people. At the age of twenty, Ross was appointed as a US Indian agent in 1811. During the War of 1812, he served as adjutant of a Cherokee regiment under the command of Andrew Jackson. After the end of the Red Stick War, Ross started a tobacco plantation in Tennessee. In 1816, he built a warehouse and trading post on the Tennessee River north of the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, and started a ferry service that carried passengers across the river. Concurrently, Ross developed a keen interest in Cherokee politics and attracted the attention of the Cherokee elders, especially Principal Chiefs Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks. Together with Major Ridge, they became his political mentors.

Ross first went to Washington, DC, in 1816 as part of a Cherokee delegation to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership, and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, he was elected to the National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross: wealthy, educated, English-speaking, and of mixed blood. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, which made the Cherokee the first tribe ever to do so. 

Both Pathkiller and Hicks died in January 1827. Hicks&#x27;s brother, William, was appointed interim chief. Ross and Major Ridge shared responsibilities for the affairs of the tribe. Because William did not impress the Cherokee as a leader, they elected Ross as permanent principal chief in October 1828, a position that he held until his death.

The problem of removal split the Cherokee Nation politically. Ross, backed by the vast majority, tried repeatedly to stop white political powers from forcing the nation to move. He led a faction that became known as the National Party. Twenty others, who came to believe that further resistance would be futile, wanted to seek the best settlement they could get and formed the &quot;Treaty Party,&quot; or &quot;Ridge Party,&quot; led by Major Ridge. Treaty Party negotiated with the United States and signed the Treaty of New Echota on December 29, 1835, which required the Cherokee to leave by 1838. Neither Chief Ross nor the national council ever approved this treaty, but the US government regarded it as valid. The majority, about two-thirds of Cherokee people, followed the National Party and objected to and voted against complying with the Treaty of New Echota. 

Forced removal spared no one, including Principal Chief Ross, who lost his first wife Quatie (Brown) Ross during the Trail of Tears. 

Removal and the subsequent coordinated executions of Treaty Party signers Major Ridge, John Ridge, and former editor of the Cherokee Phoenix Elias Boudinot on June 22, 1839 thrust the Cherokee Nation into a civil war. Despite the Act of Union signed by Old Settlers, (Cherokees who removed west earlier under the Treaties of 1817 and 1819) and the Eastern Emigrants (those forced to remove under Ross&#x27;s leadership) on July 12, 1839 and the new Cherokee Constitution that followed August 23, 1839, violent reprisals continued through 1846. 

Cherokee people continued to elect Ross as Principal Chief through the Civil War Era. Ross hoped to maintain neutrality during the Civil War, but a variety of conditions prevented him from doing so. First, Stand Watie, a political opponent, Treaty Party member, kin to the Ridges, and Boudinot&#x27;s brother raised a regiment on behalf of the Confederate army. Second, surrounding states seceded. Third, surrounding Native nations signed treaties with the confederacy. And finally, federal troops abandoned the Indian Territory, leaving the Nation to defend itself in violation of treaty commitments. Rather than see the Cherokee Nation divided against itself again, Ross, with the consent of council, signed a treaty with the Confederacy. 

For the Cherokee Nation, the Civil War represented the extended divisions created by Removal and the Trail of Tears. Ross supporters largely served under John Drew&#x27;s regiment. Treaty Party supporters largely served under Stand Watie. During the war, federal troops arrested Ross and removed him from Indian Territory. Many Cherokee people less committed to the Confederacy and more committed to the Cherokee Nation refused to engage in battles against other Native peoples, including those Muscogee Creek people under Opothleyahola seeking refuge in Kansas. 

Once outside the Indian Territory, Ross negotiated agreements with the Union for Cherokee support through Indian Home Guard Regiments. Many of those formerly fighting for the Confederacy but loyal to Ross, switched sides to support the Union through the Indian Home Guard. 

Ross&#x27;s absence from Indian Territory provided a political opening for Watie. While Ross was away, those loyal to Watie elected him Principal Chief. When Ross returned, an election was held re-electing him to the office. At those close of the war, those calling themselves the Southern Cherokees under Watie&#x27;s leadership stepped forward as the rightful negotiators of any treaty, as did Ross as the elected chief. 

The US required the Five Civilized Tribes to negotiate new peace treaties after the war. Ross made another trip to Washington, DC, for this purpose. Although Ross had negotiated with Lincoln during the war, his assassination enabled US commissioners to treat the Cherokee Nation as a defeated enemy. As Ross had feared, commissioners used the political divisions to extract greater penalties from the Cherokee Nation. Despite these setbacks, Ross worked to re-establish a unified Cherokee Nation and re-establish a nation-to-nation treaty with the US. He died in Washington, DC on August 1, 1866.

==Early life and education==

Ross (also known by his Cherokee name, &quot;Guwisguwi&quot;) was born in Turkeytown (in modern day Alabama), on the Coosa River, to Mollie (née McDonald) and her husband Daniel Ross, an immigrant Scots trader. His siblings who survived to adulthood included Jane Ross Coodey (1787–1844), Elizabeth Grace Ross Ross (1789–1876), Lewis Ross (1796–1870), Andrew &#x27;Tlo-s-ta-ma&#x27; Ross (1798–1840), Margaret Ross Hicks (1803–1862), and Maria Ross Mulkey (1806–1838).

===Genealogy===
Under the matrilineal kinship system of the Cherokee, Ross and his siblings were considered born to his mother&#x27;s family and Bird Clan. They gained their social status from her people. In such a system, typically the mother&#x27;s eldest brother had a major role in the children&#x27;s lives, especially for boys. His mother and grandmother were of mixed race, but also considered part of their mother&#x27;s Cherokee family and clan, and were brought up primarily in Cherokee culture. 

Ross&#x27;s great-grandmother Ghigooie, a full-blood Cherokee, had married William Shorey, a Scottish interpreter. Their daughter, Anna, married John McDonald, a Scots trader.
===Childhood and education===
Ross spent his childhood with his parents near Lookout Mountain. Educated in English by white men in a frontier American environment, Ross spoke the Cherokee language poorly. His bi-cultural background and fluency in English enabled him to represent the Cherokee to the United States government. Many full-blood Cherokee frequented his father&#x27;s trading company, so he encountered tribal members on many levels. As a child, Ross participated in tribal events, such as the Green Corn Festival.

The elder Ross insisted that John also receive a rigorous classical education. After being educated at home, Ross pursued higher studies with the Reverend Gideon Blackburn, who established two schools in southeast Tennessee for Cherokee children. Classes were in English and students were mostly of mixed race, like Ross. The young Ross finished his education at an academy in South West Point, near Kingston, Tennessee.

===Bicultural Background of John Ross===
Ross&#x27;s life of other bicultural people in the northern United States and Canada. Many Cherokee people intermarried with Scottish traders during the eighteenth century. Scots and English fur traders in North America were typically men of social status and financial standing who married high-ranking Native American women. Both sides believed these were strategic alliances, helping both the Native Americans and the traders. They educated their children in bi-cultural and multilingual environments. The bicultural children often married and rose to positions of stature in society, both in political and economic terms.

===Family life===
John Ross survived two wives and had several children. He married the widow Elizabeth &quot;Quatie&quot; (Brown) Henley (1791–1839) in 1812 or 1813. She was a Cherokee, born in 1791 and had one child from her marriage. Her late husband, Robert Henley, may have died during the War of 1812. Quatie Ross died in 1839 in Arkansas on the Trail of Tears as discussed below. She was survived by their children James McDonald Ross (1814–1864), William Allen Ross (1817–1891), Jane Ross Meigs-Nave (1821–1894), Silas Dean Ross (1829–1872) and George Washington Ross (1830–1870). 

John Ross remarried in 1844, to Mary Stapler (1826–1865), whom he survived by less than a year. Their surviving children were Annie Brian Ross Dobson (1845–1876) and John Ross Jr. (1847–1905).

==Careers==

===Indian agent===
At the age of twenty, having completed his education and with bilingual skills, Ross received an appointment as US Indian agent to the western Cherokee and was sent to their territory (in present-day Arkansas). During the War of 1812, he served as an adjutant in a Cherokee regiment. He fought under General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend against the British-allied Upper Creek warriors, known as the Red Sticks. They were traditionalists, who resisted the assimilationist tendencies of the Lower Creek. The latter had lived more closely with European Americans and adopted some of their practices. 

===Businessman and founder of Chattanooga===
Ross began a series of business ventures which made him among the wealthiest of all Cherokee. He derived the majority of his wealth from cultivating tobacco in Tennessee; it was the major commodity crop. He held about 20 enslaved African Americans to cultivate and process this labor-intensive crop.

In 1816 he founded Ross&#x27;s Landing, served by a ferry crossing. After the Cherokee were removed to Indian Territory in the 1830s, European-American settlers changed the name of Ross&#x27;s Landing to Chattanooga. In addition, Ross had established a trading firm and warehouse. In total, he earned upwards of $1,000 a year ($ in today&#x27;s terms). 

Under pressure from white settlers in Tennessee, many Cherokee migrated into northeast Georgia. In 1827 Ross moved to Rome, Georgia, to be closer to New Echota, the Cherokee capital. In Rome, Ross established a ferry along the headwaters of the Coosa River close to the home of Major Ridge, an older wealthy and influential Cherokee leader. By December 1836, Ross&#x27;s properties were appraised at $23,665 ($ today). He was ranked as one of the five wealthiest men in the Cherokee Nation.

===Political apprenticeship===
Between 1811 and 1827, Ross learned how to conduct negotiations with the United States and acquire leadership skills to run a national government. After 1814, Ross&#x27;s political career as a Cherokee legislator and diplomat progressed with the support of such individuals as the Principal Chief Pathkiller, Assistant Principal Chief Charles R. Hicks, and Casey Holmes, an elder statesman of the Cherokee Nation, as well as the women elders of his clan.

By 1813, as relations with the United States became more complex, older chiefs such as Pathkiller could not effectively defend Cherokee interests. Ross&#x27;s ascent showed that Cherokee leaders recognized the importance of having formally educated, English-speaking leaders to represent them. Both Pathkiller and Hicks trained Ross, who served as their clerk and worked on all financial and political matters of the nation. They also steeped him in Cherokee tradition. In a series of letters to Ross, Hicks outlined known Cherokee traditions.

In 1816, the chief&#x27;s council named Ross to his first delegation to American leaders in Washington, D.C. The delegation of 1816 was directed to resolve sensitive issues, including national boundaries, land ownership, and white encroachment on Cherokee land, particularly in Georgia. Only Ross was fluent in English, making him a central figure, although Cherokee society traditionally favored older leaders.

In November 1817, the Cherokee formed the National Council. Ross was elected to the thirteen-member body, where each man served two-year terms. The National Council was created to consolidate Cherokee political authority after General Andrew Jackson made two treaties with small cliques of Cherokee representing minority factions. Membership in the National Council placed Ross among the Cherokee ruling elite. The majority of the men were wealthy, of mixed-race, and English-speaking. Most Cherokee still spoke only Cherokee.

===President of the National Committee===
In November 1818, just before the General Council meeting with U.S. Indian agent Joseph McMinn, who was assigned to deal with the Cherokee, Ross became president of the National Committee, a position he would hold through 1827. The Council selected Ross for that leadership position because they believed he had the diplomatic skills necessary to rebuff American requests to cede Cherokee lands. He soon refused McMinn&#x27;s offer of $200,000 US, conditioned upon the Cherokee voluntarily removing to the west beyond the Mississippi.

In 1819, the Council sent Ross with a delegation to Washington, D.C. He assumed a larger leadership role. The delegation proposed to clarify the provisions of the Treaty of 1817—both to limit the ceded lands and clarify Cherokee right to the remaining lands. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun pressed Ross to cede large tracts of land in Tennessee and Georgia. Although he refused, the US government pressure continued and intensified. In October 1822, Calhoun requested that the Cherokee relinquish their land claimed by Georgia, in fulfillment of the United States&#x27; obligation under the Compact of 1802. Before responding to Calhoun&#x27;s proposition, Ross first ascertained the sentiment of the Cherokee people. They were unanimously opposed to further cession of land.

In January 1824, Ross traveled to Washington to defend the Cherokee possession of their land. Calhoun offered two solutions to the Cherokee delegation: either relinquish title to their lands and remove west, or accept denationalization and become citizens of the United States. Rather than accept Calhoun&#x27;s ultimatum, Ross directly petitioned Congress for the Cherokee cause on April 15, 1824. This fundamentally altered the traditional relationship between an Indian nation and the US government.

Never before had an Indian nation petitioned Congress with grievances. In Ross&#x27;s correspondence, what had previously been the tone of petitions by submissive Indians was replaced by assertive defenders. Ross was able to argue subtle points about legal responsibilities as well as whites. 

Some politicians in Washington recognized the change represented by Ross&#x27;s leadership. Future president John Quincy Adams wrote, &quot;[T]here was less Indian oratory, and more of the common style of white discourse, than in the same chief&#x27;s speech on their first introduction.&quot; Adams specifically noted Ross as &quot;the writer of the delegation&quot; and remarked that &quot;they [had] sustained a written controversy against the Georgia delegation with greate[sic] advantage.&quot; Georgia&#x27;s delegation indirectly acknowledged Ross&#x27;s skill: an editorial published in &quot;The Georgia Journal&quot; charged that &quot;the Cherokee delegation&#x27;s letters were fraudulent&quot; because &quot;too refined to have been written or dictated by an Indian&quot;.

==Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation==
In January 1827, Pathkiller, the Cherokee&#x27;s principal chief and last hereditary chief, and, two weeks later, Charles R. Hicks, Ross&#x27;s mentor, both died. Ross, as president of the National Committee, and Major Ridge, as speaker of the National Council, were responsible for the affairs of the tribe. In a letter dated February 23, 1827, to Colonel Hugh Montgomery, the Cherokee agent, Ross wrote that with the death of Hicks, he had assumed responsibility for all public business of The Nation. Charles Hicks&#x27;s brother William served briefly as interim chief until a permanent chief could be elected. Although believing he was the natural heir to his brother&#x27;s position, William Hicks had not impressed the tribe with his abilities. A majority of the people knew that during the year Ross, not Hicks, had taken care of all of the regular business of the tribe. On October 17, 1828, the Cherokee elected John Ross as principal chief.

Through the 1820s, the Cherokee Council passed a series of laws creating a bicameral national government, adopting structure from the US government. In 1822 they created the Cherokee Supreme Court, capping the creation of a three-branch government. In May 1827, Ross was elected to the twenty-four member constitutional committee. It drafted a constitution calling for a principal chief, a council of the principal chiefs, and a National Committee, which together would form the General Council of the Cherokee Nation, a constitutional republic. Although the constitution was ratified in October 1827, it did not take effect until October 1828, at which point Ross was elected principal chief. He was repeatedly reelected and held this position until his death in 1866. He was very popular, among both full-bloods, who comprised three-fourths of the population, and mixed-bloods.

The Cherokee had created a constitutional republic with delegated authority capable of formulating a clear, long-range policy to protect national rights.

===Supreme Court litigation===
Ross found support in Congress from individuals in the National Republican Party, such as senators Henry Clay (Kentucky), Theodore Frelinghuysen, and Daniel Webster (Massachusetts), and representatives Ambrose Spencer and David (Davy) Crockett. Despite this support, in April 1829, John H. Eaton, Secretary of War (1829–1831), informed Ross that President Jackson would support the right of Georgia to extend her laws over the Cherokee people.

On December 8, 1829, President Andrew Jackson made a speech announcing his intention to pass a bill through Congress by the following spring requiring Indian tribes living in the Southeastern states to move west of the Mississippi and cede their land claims in the East.

On December 19, 1829, the Georgia legislature, enacted a series of laws that greatly restricted the Cherokee Nation: they confiscated a large section of Cherokee occupied land, nullified Cherokee law within the confiscated area, banned further meetings of the Cherokee government in Georgia, declared contracts between Indians and whites null and void unless witnessed by two whites, disallowed Indians from testifying against a white person in court, and forbade Cherokee to dig for gold on their own lands. The laws were made effective June 1, 1830. These were calculated to force the Cherokee to move.

In May 1830, Congress endorsed Jackson&#x27;s policy of removal by passing the Indian Removal Act. Jackson signed the Act on May 23. It authorized the president to set aside lands west of the Mississippi to exchange for the lands of the Indian nations in the Southeast. In the summer of 1830, Jackson urged the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Creek to sign individual treaties accepting removal from their homelands. The Cherokee refused to attend a meeting in Nashville that Jackson proposed. The other tribes signed off on Jackson&#x27;s terms.

When Ross and the Cherokee delegation failed in their efforts to protect Cherokee lands through dealings with the executive branch and Congress, Ross took the radical step of defending Cherokee rights through the U.S. courts. In June 1830, at the urging of Senators Webster and Frelinghuysen, the Cherokee delegation selected William Wirt, US Attorney General in the Monroe and Adams administrations, to defend Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Wirt argued two cases on behalf of the Cherokee: &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; and &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;. In &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot;, Chief Justice John Marshall acknowledged that the Cherokee were a sovereign nation, stating, 
&quot;[T]he Cherokees as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others, capable of managing its own affairs and governing itself, has, in the opinion of a majority of the judges, been completely successful.&quot;But he did not compel President Jackson to take action that would defend the Cherokee from Georgia&#x27;s laws, because he did not find that the U.S. Supreme Court had original jurisdiction over a case in which a tribe was a party.

In 1832, the Supreme Court further defined the relation of the federal government and the Cherokee Nation. In &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;, the Court found that Georgia could not extend its laws to the Cherokee Nation because that was a power of the federal government. Marshall stated that 
&quot;the acts of Georgia are repugnant to the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States. They interfere forcibly with the relations established between the United States and the Cherokee nation, the regulation of which, according to the settled principles of our Constitution, are committed exclusively to the government of the Union.&quot;The Cherokee were considered sovereign enough to legally resist the government of Georgia, and they were encouraged to do so.

The court maintained that the Cherokee Nation was dependent on the federal government, much like a protectorate state, but still a sovereign entity. But the dispute was made moot when federal legislation in the form of the Indian Removal Act exercised the federal government&#x27;s legal power to handle the whole affair. The series of decisions embarrassed Jackson politically, as Whigs attempted to use the issue in the 1832 election. They largely supported his earlier opinion that the &quot;Indian Question&quot; was one that was best handled by the federal government, and not local authorities.

Meanwhile, the Cherokee Nation had encountered financial hard times. The U. S. government had stopped paying the agreed-upon $6,000 (~$ in ) annuity for previous land cessions, Georgia had effectively cut off any income from the gold fields in Cherokee lands, and the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s application for a federal government loan was rejected in February 1831. With great difficulty (and private donations), Ross was able to pay the Cherokee Nation&#x27;s legal bills.

===Ridge Party opposition===
In a meeting in May 1832, Supreme Court Justice John McLean spoke with the Cherokee delegation to offer his views on their situation. McLean&#x27;s advice was to &quot;remove and become a Territory with a patent in fee simple to the nation for all its lands and a delegate in Congress, but reserving to itself the entire right of legislation and selection of all officers.&quot; He agreed to send Ross a letter explaining his views. Ross was furious, believing that this was a form of treachery.

McLean&#x27;s advice precipitated a split within the Cherokee leadership as John Ridge and Elias Boudinot began to doubt Ross&#x27;s leadership. John Ridge introduced a resolution at the national council meeting in October 1832 to send a delegation to Washington to discuss a removal treaty with President Jackson. The council rejected Ridge&#x27;s proposal and instead selected Joseph Vann, John Baldridge, Richard Taylor, and John Ross to represent the Cherokee. In February 1833, Ridge wrote to Ross advocating that the delegation dispatched to Washington that month should begin removal negotiations with Jackson. Ridge and Ross did not have irreconcilable worldviews; neither believed that the Cherokee could fend off Georgian usurpation of Cherokee land. However, Ridge was furious that Ross had refused to consider Jackson&#x27;s offer to pay the Cherokee $3,000,000 for all their lands in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee.

In this environment, Ross led a delegation to Washington in March 1834 to try to negotiate alternatives to removal. Ross made several proposals; however, the Cherokee Nation may not have approved any of Ross&#x27;s plans, nor was there reasonable expectation that Jackson would settle for any agreement short of removal. These offers, coupled with the lengthy cross-continental trip, indicated that Ross&#x27;s strategy was to prolong negotiations on removal indefinitely. There was the possibility that the next President might be more favorably inclined.

Ross&#x27;s strategy was flawed because it was susceptible to the United States&#x27; making a treaty with a minority faction. On May 29, 1834, Ross received word from John H. Eaton, that a new delegation, including Major Ridge, John Ridge, Elias Boudinot, and Ross&#x27;s younger brother Andrew, collectively called the &quot;Ridge Party&quot; or &quot;Treaty Party&quot;, had arrived in Washington with the goal of signing a treaty of removal. The two sides attempted reconciliation, but by October 1834 still had not come to an agreement. In January 1835 the factions were again in Washington. Pressured by the presence of the Ridge Party, Ross agreed on February 25, 1835, to exchange all Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi for land west of the Mississippi, asking for $20 million (~$ in ) dollars. He made it contingent on the General Council&#x27;s accepting the terms.

===Treaty of New Echota and Trail of Tears===
Secretary of War Lewis Cass believed this was yet another ploy to delay action on removal for an additional year, and threatened to sign the treaty with John Ridge. On November 7, 1835, Ross and his guest, John Howard Payne, were arrested by the Georgia guard at Ross&#x27; home in Flint Springs in Bradley County, Tennessee, and taken to Spring Place, Georgia, where they were imprisoned. On December 29, 1835, the Treaty Party signed the Treaty of New Echota with the U.S. Most Cherokee thought the signatories unauthorized. However, Ross could not stop its enforcement. Under orders from President Martin Van Buren, General Winfield Scott and 7,000 Federal troops forced removal of Cherokee who did not emigrate to the Indian Territory by 1838. This forced removal came to be known as the Trail of Tears. Accepting defeat, Ross convinced General Scott to allow him to supervise much of the removal process.

Returning to his home at Head of Coosa late at night, Ross saw a man he did not recognize at his house. He told the man to feed his horse and put him away for the night. Instead, the stranger followed him to the door, identified himself as Stephen Carter and told Ross that he now owned the property and had papers to prove it. Ross then learned agents of Georgia had given Carter possession of the house earlier in the week, after evicting his family. Dispossessed by Georgia (and Carter), Ross was now homeless. The next day, Ross found that family members had given his wife Quatie refuge. Quatie died of pneumonia on February 1, 1839, on the Arkansas River near Little Rock, while aboard a steamboat owned by her husband. According to a popular legend, derived from a letter written by a former soldier named John Burnett, fifty-two years after the fact, Quatie became ill after giving her coat to a child who was crying because of the cold. There is, however, almost no evidence to support the claim. Quatie was originally buried in the Little Rock town cemetery; her remains were later moved to Mt. Holly Cemetery.

Because selling common lands was a capital crime under Cherokee law, treaty opponents assassinated Boudinot, Major Ridge and John Ridge after the migration to Indian Territory. Stand Watie, Boudinot&#x27;s brother, was also attacked but he survived. The assassins were never publicly identified nor tried in court. General Matthew Arbuckle, commander of Fort Gibson, claimed he knew their identities but never tried to arrest them. Some Cherokee, particularly those tied to the pro-treaty party, claimed that Chief John Ross knew about the assassinations beforehand. Many years later, Chief Ross&#x27;s son Allen, wrote that this was not so. Allen&#x27;s letter, is said to be in the possession of the Oklahoma State Historical Society. Afterward, there were years of violence between the two factions.

Given the controversy over the struggle over territory and Ross&#x27;s personal wealth, a vocal minority of Cherokee and a generation of political leaders in Washington considered Ross to be dictatorial, greedy, and an &quot;aristocratic leader [who] sought to defraud&quot; the Cherokee Nation. Ross also had influential supporters in Washington, including Thomas L. McKenney, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1824–1830). He described Ross as the father of the Cherokee Nation, a Moses who &quot;led...his people in their exodus from the land of their nativity to a new country, and from the savage state to that of civilization.&quot;

===Remarriage===
John Ross was introduced to the Stapler family of Brandywine Springs, Delaware, by Thomas McKenney in 1841. Ross had many common interests with John Stapler, a merchant and widower. His eldest daughter, Sarah, cared for her younger siblings and befriended Ross. However, her younger sister, Mary Brian Stapler, developed a real love for Ross and initiated a romantic attachment in May 1844. As the time came for Ross to return to the Indian Territory, their mutual love ripened. They married in Philadelphia on September 2, 1844.

===American Civil War===
The Civil War divided the Cherokee people. At first the majority supported the Confederacy, which protected their slaveholdings. Fearing that joining the Confederacy would void the earlier Cherokee treaties with the United States, Ross tried to persuade his people to remain neutral in the conflict, but eventually most chose sides. Full-bloods tended to favor maintaining relations with the United States. This group included over two thousand members of a traditionalist and abolitionist society, the Keetoowah Society. Members of this group were called &quot;Pins&quot; by non-members because they wore an emblem of crossed pins on their shirts.

Ross advocated that the Cherokee Nation remain neutral. It was a losing argument. At a general assembly on August 21, 1861, Ross ended his speech by announcing that in the interests of tribal and inter-Indian unity it was time to agree on an alliance with the Confederate States of America. Many of the well-armed mixed bloods, especially the wealthy led by Stand Watie, supported the Confederacy. Traditionalists and Cherokee who opposed the institution of slavery remained loyal to the Union. However, the majority of Cherokee may not have understood the nature of the new treaty.

After Ross departed to meet with President Lincoln in Washington, traditionalist Cherokee helped maneuver the selection of Ross supporter Thomas Pegg as Acting Principal Chief. Three or four of Ross&#x27;s own sons fought for the Union. However, Ross&#x27;s nephew by marriage, John Drew, had organized and served as Colonel of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles in the Confederate Army. Most of Drew&#x27;s regiment would later twice desert rather than follow Confederate orders to kill other Indians. Many leaders of the northern faction, still led by Ross, went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for the duration of the war.

By 1863, the flight of many Cherokee voters to refuge in Kansas and Texas provided the pro-Confederate Treaty Party an opportunity to elect Stand Watie as principal chief without them. Pro-Union National Council members declared the election invalid. Watie that fall raided Ross&#x27;s home, Rose Cottage. The home was looted and burned. Ross lost all his belongings. Ross&#x27;s daughter Jane and her husband, Andrew Nave, were living at Rose Cottage at the time. Nave was shot and killed. Only the prior intervention of Watie&#x27;s wife seems to have prevented the killing of additional Ross relatives. Ross&#x27;s oldest son, James, who had gone to Park Hill searching for supplies, was captured and sent to prison in the Confederacy, where he died. Ross remained in exile. However, within a week of the burning, the National Council convened and restored Ross as principal chief.

Ross took his wife Mary and the children to Philadelphia so she could see her family. Ross returned to Washington, where he had an inconclusive meeting with President Lincoln and other supporters. When he returned for Mary in 1865, he found her gravely ill with what was diagnosed as &quot;lung congestion&quot; (likely tuberculosis). She could not travel, so he remained with her for more than a month. Mary died of her illness on July 20, 1865. She was buried in her native Delaware. Ross returned to Indian Territory after her funeral.

After the war, the two factions of the Cherokee tried to negotiate separately with the US government Southern Treaty Commission. The commissioner of Indian Affairs, Dennis N. Cooley, was persuaded to believe allegations by Stand Watie and Elias Cornelius Boudinot that Ross was a dictator who did not truly represent the Cherokee people. Even though his health was worsening, Ross left Park Hill, where he was staying with his niece, on November 9, 1865, to meet with President Andrew Johnson. Johnson instructed Cooley to reopen negotiations with the Cherokee and to meet only with the pro-Union faction, headed by John Ross. Ross died on August 1, 1866, in Washington, D.C., while still negotiating a final treaty with the federal government. However, Ross had by then persuaded Johnson to reject a particularly harsh treaty version favored by Cooley.

==Death and legacy==
Initially, Ross was buried beside his second wife Mary in Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware. A few months later, the Cherokee Nation returned his remains to the Ross Cemetery at Park Hill, Indian Territory (now Cherokee County, Oklahoma) for interment.
John Ross&#x27;s great-great granddaughter, Mary G. Ross (August 9, 1908 – April 29, 2008) was the first Native American female engineer. She helped propel the world into an era of space travel while becoming of one of the nation&#x27;s most prominent women scientists of the space age.

John Ross&#x27;s descendant, atmospheric scientist Robbie Hood, led the Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration until retiring in 2017.

Several Cherokee Freedmen who were owned by Ross kept his last name. One of his former slaves, Stick Ross, later served in the Cherokee Legislature from 1893 to 1894.

===Namesake and monuments===
The City of Chattanooga named the Market Street Bridge in Ross&#x27;s honor, and a bust of Ross stands on the north side of the Hamilton County Courthouse lawn.

The city of Rossville, Georgia, located just south of the Tennessee state line, is named for Ross. It contains his former home, the John Ross House, where he lived from 1830 to 1838 until the state seized his lands near the Coosa River. One of the oldest surviving homes in the Chattanooga area, it has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

The city of Park Hill, Oklahoma, hosts a John Ross museum in a former schoolhouse located west of Ross Cemetery.

National Public Radio correspondent Steve Inskeep suggested that the US $20 bill be modified to carry images of both John Ross and Andrew Jackson, &quot;illustrating our democratic experience.&quot;

<text>Bert is Evil is the name of a parody website, founded by Dino Ignacio on March 30, 1997, which featured Bert, a character on the American children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In 1998, Dino Ignacio, Wout Reinders and Jasper Hulshoff Pol accepted the Webby Award and the People&#x27;s Voice Award for Best Weird Website at the Palace of Fine Arts auditorium in San Francisco.

The website featured manipulated images of the character consorting with notoriously nefarious figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong-il, Robert Mugabe, and Osama bin Laden, as well as being present at events, such as the JFK assassination, and Oklahoma City bombing, humorously offered as &quot;proof&quot; that Bert was no mere innocent children&#x27;s television character. The &quot;Evil Bert&quot; phenomenon was picked up by other humorists, who created their own images, linking Bert to current and historical atrocities.

In the summer of 1998, due to the website&#x27;s immense cult popularity, it became too expensive for Ignacio to continue running. Instead of shutting the site down, he offered to allow anyone who was willing to mirror his original website the opportunity to host it. As a result, dozens of mirrors appeared, increasing the website&#x27;s popularity and visibility.

==Osama bin Laden image==

The first mirror, maintained by Dennis Pozniak, continued in the same vein by adding new &quot;evidence&quot; of Bert&#x27;s evilness (such as Bert&#x27;s connection to the Ramsey Family and serial killer Jack the Ripper). At the end of 1998, Pozniak posted a contribution, submitted by humorist J Roen, digitally manipulated to depict the then relatively unknown international terrorist, Osama bin Laden, posing with Bert.

In October 2001, after the September 11 attacks, an undoctored Reuters news photograph was published showing a pro Osama bin Laden protest rally in Bangladesh. One protester is seen holding a large collage style poster of bin Laden with a small image of Bert over his right shoulderthe same image posted to the Bert mirror in 1998which prompted much confusion and joking among Western audiences. Being unaware of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Dhaka printer Mostafa Kamal had copied the collage from the World Wide Web, leaving the image of Bert in his collage.

After this photo was released on the news wires, the owners of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Sesame Workshop, raised the possibility of pursuing legal action against Ignacio. In response, he took down the &quot;Bert is Evil&quot; section of his website due to Sesame Workshop&#x27;s DMCA takedown notice, also stating that he did not want to undermine the character in the eyes of children who watched &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. &quot;I am doing this because I feel this has gotten too close to reality&quot;, he said.

Since the original Bert/Osama picture had been posted to Dennis Pozniak&#x27;s mirror, he too was bombarded by the international media seeking interviews. As a result of all the attention, Pozniak also closed his mirror.

<text>Milena Markovna &quot;Mila&quot; Kunis (born August 14, 1983) is an American actress. Born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, and raised in Los Angeles, she began playing Jackie Burkhart on the Fox television series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2006) at age 15. She has voiced Meg Griffin on the Fox animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; since 1999.

Kunis&#x27;s breakout film role was in the 2008 romantic comedy &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;. She gained critical acclaim for her performance in the psychological thriller &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), receiving nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other major films include the action films &quot;Max Payne&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010), the romantic comedy &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot; (2011), the fantasy film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013)—as the Wicked Witch of the West—and the comedies &quot;Ted&quot; (2012), &quot;Bad Moms&quot; (2016) and its sequel, &quot;A Bad Moms Christmas&quot; (2017).

==Early life and education==
Milena Markovna Kunis was born into a Jewish family on August 14, 1983, in Chernovtsy (now Chernivtsi), Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. Although Kunis&#x27;s parents have since retired, previously her mother, Elvira, was a physics teacher who ran a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, was a mechanical engineer who worked as a cab driver after the family emigrated. Kunis has an older brother, Michael. Her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian. While participating in &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Needs a Friend&quot; Kunis confirmed she does not speak Ukrainian, stating Russian was the main language at the time she was there. Children were not taught Ukrainian in school until they were in second grade which was the time she left to come to the United States. She stated in 2011 that her parents had &quot;amazing jobs&quot;, and that she &quot;was very lucky&quot; and the family was &quot;not poor&quot;; they had decided to leave the Soviet Union because they saw &quot;no future&quot; there for Mila and her brother. In 1991, when she was 7 years old, her family moved to Los Angeles under a religious-refugee visa, with . &quot;That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in L.A.&quot;

Kunis has cited antisemitism in the Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family&#x27;s move to the United States. She has stated that her parents &quot;raised [her] Jewish as much as they could&quot;, although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: &quot;I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn&#x27;t understand the culture. I didn&#x27;t understand the people. I didn&#x27;t understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, &#x27;Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.&#x27; And that&#x27;s kind of what it felt like moving to the States.&quot;

In Los Angeles, she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School. She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School, graduating in 2001. She briefly attended University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 

Kunis is a naturalized US citizen.

Kunis has said that a genealogical DNA test described her ethnicity as 96% to 98% Ashkenazi Jewish.

==Career==

===1994–2000: Career beginnings and television work===
At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager. On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial. Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line. Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on &quot;Baywatch&quot;. She had a minor role on the television shows &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; as well as supporting roles in the films &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot;, &quot;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&quot;, and the Angelina Jolie film &quot;Gia&quot;, as the young Gia Carangi.

At the age of 10, Kunis unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to North America in the film &quot;Make a Wish, Molly&quot;. Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive &quot;Young Star Awards&quot; as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.

In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: &quot;What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila—something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they&#x27;ll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work.&quot; Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in &quot;Family Guy Video Game!&quot;, released in 2006. Kunis described her character as &quot;the scapegoat&quot;.

===2001–2008: Transition to film===
In 2001, she appeared in &quot;Get Over It&quot; opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film &quot;American Psycho 2&quot; alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film &quot;American Psycho&quot;. &quot;American Psycho 2&quot; was poorly reviewed by critics, and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film. In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation &quot;Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007. Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;DVD talk&quot; concluded that &quot;fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place&quot;.

In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in &quot;Moving McAllister&quot;, which was not released theatrically until 2007. The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters. She followed up with &quot;After Sex&quot; starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in &quot;Get Over It&quot;. In October 2006, she began filming &quot;Boot Camp&quot; (originally titled &quot;Straight Edge&quot;). The film was not released in theaters in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.

Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, entailed improvisation on her part. The film garnered positive reviews, and was a commercial success, grossing worldwide. Kunis&#x27;s performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; praised her &quot;fresh beauty and focused energy&quot;, while James Berardinelli wrote that she is &quot;adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing&quot;. She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award. In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film &quot;Max Payne&quot;, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role. &quot;Max Payne&quot; was relatively successful at the box office, grossing worldwide but was poorly reviewed by critics, with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. Travis Estvold of &quot;Boise Weekly&quot; wrote that she was &quot;horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss&quot;. Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, &quot;Mila just bowled us over... She wasn&#x27;t an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park.&quot; She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.

===2009–2012: Film breakthrough and acclaim===

In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film &quot;Extract&quot; with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis &quot;brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility.&quot; Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film &quot;Rejected&quot;. Judge said: &quot;As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world.&quot; After seeing Kunis perform in &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in &quot;Extract&quot;: &quot;I just thought, &#x27;Wow, this girl&#x27;s perfect.&#x27; And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic.&quot; Kunis herself stated that &quot;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mike Judge&#x27;s from &quot;Office Space&quot;, so I was, like, &#x27;Okay, this is a very easy decision.&#x27; I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production—like craft service, or, say, acting.&quot;

In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film &quot;The Book of Eli&quot;. Although the film received mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office, grossing over worldwide. Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis&#x27;s performance, calling it a &quot;particularly strong piece of work&quot;. Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of &quot;Boxoffice&quot; magazine, who wrote that she&#x27;s &quot;ideally cast in the key female role&quot;. Even reviewers who did not necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that &quot;the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts&quot;, and Colin Covert of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, who wrote that she &quot;generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who&#x27;s not always in need of rescuing.&quot; Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; felt she was miscast, noting that &quot;she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial&quot;. Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance. Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film &quot;Date Night&quot;, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell. She garnered several positive reviews for her performance. Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it &quot;a shot in the arm.&quot;

Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film &quot;Black Swan&quot;. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman. She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20 pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week. During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder.

&quot;Black Swan&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film grossed over in the United States and Canada while grossing over worldwide. Reviews of Kunis&#x27;s performance were positive, with Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stating, &quot;Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman&#x27;s wide-eyed fearfulness.&quot; Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we&#x27;re as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness.&quot; Kunis&#x27;s performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and earned her Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.

Kunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the 2011 romantic comedy &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot;. Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind. &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot; achieved success at the box office, grossing over worldwide, and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she&#x27;s a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy&quot; and &quot;her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen&quot;.

In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in &quot;Ted&quot;, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg&#x27;s character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her. &quot;Ted&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing worldwide. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis &quot;brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been &#x27;the pushy girlfriend.

===2013–present: Comedic roles===
In 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; prequel, &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;. She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film. The film, and Kunis&#x27;s performance, received mixed reviews from critics. Kim Newman of &quot;Empire Magazine&quot; wrote that Kunis &quot;walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle&quot;. In contrast, Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found Kunis&#x27;s performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo. &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; was a commercial success, grossing over worldwide.

Also in 2013, Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller &quot;Blood Ties&quot; with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard.

The Paul Haggis-directed film &quot;Third Person&quot; co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival and had a limited release in 2014, but also received mostly negative reviews. Kunis&#x27;s performance was praised by some critics; Deborah Young of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that her role gives her &quot;enormous room to express her talent&quot; and she &quot;gives her story a shot of raw intensity&quot;. In October 2014, it was announced Kunis, along with her partners, had launched a new production company called Orchard Farm Productions. The company has a first-look deal with ABC Studios, where the company is based. Under the agreement, the team will develop and produce TV projects for broadcast and cable. In 2015, Kunis co-starred with Channing Tatum in the science fiction film &quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot;, directed by the Wachowskis. While the film grossed over on a budget, it received mostly negative reviews, with a consensus that the production was &quot;narratively befuddled&quot; and a &quot;visually thrilling misfire&quot;.

Kunis co-starred with Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy &quot;Bad Moms&quot;, which was released July 29, 2016. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could &quot;take full advantage of its assets&quot;. Chris Nashawaty from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Kunis manages to be both sympathetic and funny, and she has crack comedic timing&quot;. The film went on to earn more than with a budget of .

The video was a parody of the MTV show &quot;The Hills&quot; and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4 million views over the next ten years. Shawn Levy, director of &quot;Date Night&quot;, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the &quot;Funny or Die&quot; video.

Prior to this in 2008 Kunis stated, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to base your career on something other than being FHM&#x27;s top 100 number one girl. Your looks are going to die out, and then what&#x27;s going to be left?&quot; &quot;Maxim&quot; has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011 and number 3 in 2012. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine named her 2012&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Woman Alive&quot;.

==Personal life==

Kunis began dating actor Macaulay Culkin in 2002. During their relationship, there were rumors of the couple getting married, but Kunis denied them. On January 3, 2011, Kunis&#x27;s publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying, &quot;The split was amicable, and they remain close friends.&quot;

In January 2011, she revealed her struggle with chronic iritis that had caused temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she went through with the surgery that corrected the problem. Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, a condition in which the irises are different colors. Her left eye is brown, while her right eye is green.

On September 14, 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Kunis&#x27;s cellphone and email accounts, along with those of other celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson and Vanessa Hudgens. Christopher Chaney from Jacksonville, Florida, later pleaded guilty in federal court to nine counts of computer hacking.

In November 2011, Kunis was escorted by Sgt. Scott Moore to a U.S. Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. She had accepted Moore&#x27;s invitation in July after he posted it as a YouTube video while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, in Afghanistan&#x27;s Helmand province. The event celebrated the Marine Corps&#x27; 236th anniversary.

Kunis began dating her former &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; co-star Ashton Kutcher in 2012. They became engaged in February 2014, and were married in July 2015 in Oak Glen, California.

The family resides in a sustainable farmhouse, designed by the couple and architect Howard Backen, in Beverly Hills. 

In 2016, Kunis, while pregnant with her second child, undertook the surprise renovation of her parents&#x27; condominium, over a six-week period, which was documented for My HouzzTV.

In 2022, Kunis and Kutcher started a GoFundMe page to help two online companies (Airbnb and Flexport) to aid refugees fleeing the violence in Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. They exceeded their goal as of March 18, 2022. The couple promised to donate of their own money to the cause.

In 2023, after the conviction of &quot;That 70&#x27;s Show&quot; castmate Danny Masterson for rape, Kunis, along with Ashton Kutcher, wrote letters to the judge in support of Masterson. The letters stated that Masterson was a good person and that he treated people with &quot;decency, equality, and generosity&quot;. After the letters were made public, Kunis and Kutcher received immediate backlash and criticism for their support of Masterson, especially due to Kunis and Kutcher&#x27;s involvement in Thorn, a charity to expose the sexual exploitation of children. After the backlash, Kunis and Kutcher apologized in a video. In the video, the two claimed that the letters were only intended for the judge and not for the public. The apology was similarly criticized as &quot;performative and insincere&quot;.

==Political views==
Kunis is a supporter of the Democratic Party. In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: &quot;The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why do we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?&quot; In 2017, Kunis disclosed that she had been making monthly donations to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence&#x27;s name.

In 2021, Kunis signed a letter by the American organization Creative Community for Peace denouncing attempts by Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions to boycott the Tel Aviv International LGBTQ+ Film Festival.

<text>The Jubba River or Juba River (, ) is a river in southern Somalia which flows through the region of Jubaland. It begins at the border with Ethiopia, where the Dawa and Ganale Dorya rivers meet, and flows directly south to the Somali Sea, where it empties at the &quot;Goobweyn&quot; juncture. The Jubba basin covers an area of . The Somali regional state of Jubaland, formerly called &quot;Trans-Juba&quot;, is named after the river.

==History==
===Ajuran Empire===
The Jubba River has a rich history of a once-booming sophisticated civilization and trade network conducted by the powerful Somalis that held sway over the Jubba River.

During the Middle Ages Jubba River was under the Ajuran Empire of the Horn of Africa which utilized the Jubba River for its plantations and was the only hydraulic empire in Africa. A hydraulic empire that rose in the 13th century AD, Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the Jubba River and Shebelle. Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the limestone wells and cisterns of the state that are still operative and in use today. Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.

Through their control of the region&#x27;s wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as they were one of the few hydraulic empire in Africa. Large wells made out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruins and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.

With the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in Afgooye, Bardhere and other areas in the Jubba and Shebelle valleys increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as &quot;Kelliyo&quot; fed directly from the Shebelle River and Jubba River into the plantations where sorghum, maize, beans, grain and cotton were grown during the &quot;gu&quot; (Spring in Somali) and &quot;xagaa&quot; (Summer in Somali) seasons of the Somali calendar. This irrigation system was supported by numerous dikes and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with &quot;moos&quot;, &quot;taraab&quot; and &quot;guldeed&quot; being the terms used.

The urban centers of Mogadishu, Merca, Barawa, Kismayo and Hobyo and other respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the State. The Somali farming communities of the hinterland from Jubba and Shebelle valleys brought their crops to the Somali coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia, Persia, India, Venice, Egypt, Portugal, and as far away as Java and China.

===Modern Period===
Over two centuries passed until German explorer Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken ascended on the lower reaches of the river on the small steamship Welf in 1863. He wrecked the steamship in the rapids above Bardhere, where the party was attacked by local Somalis, ending in the deaths of the Baron and three others in his party. The first European to explore widely and complete the course of the river was the Italian explorer Vittorio Bottego attended by Commander F. G. Dundas British Navy. Bottego and his expedition sailed of the river in 1891. During his exploration Bottego changed the name of the main affluent of Jubba—the Ganale river—in Ganale Doria after the famous Italian naturalist Giacomo Doria.

==Overview==

The Jubba basin region is primarily savanna, and is, ecologically speaking, the richest part of the country due to its fertile farmland. Native wildlife includes giraffes, cheetahs, lions, leopards, hyenas, buffalos, hippopotamus, crocodiles, oryx, gazelles, camels, ostriches, jackals, and Somali wild asses.

The Jubba River gives its name to the Somali administrative regions of Upper Juba (Gedo, Bay, Bakool), Middle Juba and Lower Juba, as well as to the larger historical region of Jubaland. Major cities which the Jubba River passes by include Dolow, Luuq, Burdhubo, Beled&#x27;hawo, Bardhere, Buale, and Goobweyn near Kismaayo.

<text>Andrew Tyler Griggs (born August 13, 1973) is an American country music artist. He has released three albums for RCA Records Nashville (&quot;You Won&#x27;t Ever Be Lonely&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, and &quot;This I Gotta See&quot;) and a fourth (&quot;The Good Life&quot;) for Montage Music Group. These four albums have accounted for 13 singles and 6 Top Tens on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, the highest being &quot;You Won&#x27;t Ever Be Lonely&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s More&quot;, both of which peaked at #2. He also charted &quot;Grow Young With You&quot;, a cut from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;.

==Early life==
Griggs was born in West Monroe, Louisiana. His father, Darrell, died when Griggs was 10, and brother Mason served as the family&#x27;s father figure until he died of a heart attack at age 22.

He briefly attended Northeast Louisiana University before returning to his hometown in the early 1990s, where he became a youth minister and began a family with his wife. He continued to work on his musical skills, however, and by 1999, he signed to a contract with RCA Records Nashville.

==Musical career==
Griggs&#x27; debut album, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Ever Be Lonely&quot;, was issued in 1999 via RCA Records Nashville. Certified gold by the RIAA, the album accounted for five singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts. The first three singles — the title track, &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s More&quot; — were all Top Ten hits, peaking at number 2, number 10 and number 2 respectively. &quot;You Won&#x27;t Ever Be Lonely&quot; also had the sixth-longest chart run on the country charts in the 1990s decade, spending thirty-six weeks on the charts. Following &quot;She&#x27;s More&quot; was a non-album song, &quot;Grow Young With Me&quot;, recorded as a duet with Coley McCabe, and after that, &quot;Waitin&#x27; on Sundown&quot; at number 50 and &quot;You Made Me That Way&quot; at number 19. Also included on the album was a duet with Griggs&#x27; idol Waylon Jennings in the track &quot;Shine On Me&quot;, as well as a cover of Jennings&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Livin&#x27; Long Like This&quot;.

He released his second album, &quot;Freedom&quot;, in 2002. Although its lead-off single &quot;How Cool Is That&quot; peaked at number 22, the second single, &quot;Tonight I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, became his fourth Top Ten hit at number 7. Closing out this album was &quot;Practice Life&quot;, a number 33 duet with Martina McBride.

For 2003 and half of 2004, Griggs was absent from the country charts, although he, Montgomery Gentry, and Blake Shelton performed uncredited guest vocals on Tracy Byrd&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;The Truth About Men&quot;. Mid-2004 saw the release of &quot;She Thinks She Needs Me&quot;. Co-written by Shane Minor, this song was the first single release from Griggs&#x27; third album, &quot;This I Gotta See&quot;, also released in 2004. Although this song and follow-up &quot;If Heaven&quot; were both number 5 hits on the country charts, the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;This I Gotta See&quot;, stopped at number 58, and the fourth single (&quot;I Never Had a Chance&quot;) failed to chart at all. By 2005, he had left RCA&#x27;s roster, due to creative differences over his artistic control.

In 2007, Griggs signed to his second recording contract, this time with Montage Music Group. His first album for the label, &quot;The Good Life&quot;, produced two low-charting singles in &quot;Tattoo Rose&quot; (co-written by Cole Deggs, lead singer of Cole Deggs &amp; the Lonesome) and &quot;What If It&#x27;s Me&quot;. Three years later, he issued &quot;Can I Get an Amen&quot;.

==Personal life==
Griggs has been married twice, first to Stephanie Sullivan in February 1995, but they were eventually separated. In 2005 Griggs married Renee, but they also eventually separated. He now has a son named Mason.

<text>George Hege Hamilton IV (July 19, 1937 – September 17, 2014) was an American country musician. He began performing in the late 1950s as a teen idol, switching to country music in the early 1960s.

==Biography==
Hamilton was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States, on July 19, 1937, the son of Moravian parents George Hege Hamilton III and Mary Lilian (née Pendry). He was introduced to country music by his paternal grandfather, a railroad worker. His great-grandfather, the first George Hege Hamilton, was a farmer, of a family that came from Scotland to America in 1685.

George Hamilton IV attended Richard J. Reynolds High School, and is among several notable singers and songwriters to have attended that school, including Peter Holsapple and Greg Humphreys. While a 19-year-old student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Hamilton recorded &quot;A Rose and a Baby Ruth&quot; for a Chapel Hill record label, Colonial Records. The song, written by John D. Loudermilk, climbed to number six on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. By 1960, &quot;A Rose and a Baby Ruth&quot; had attained gold record status for ABC-Paramount (which had acquired the song from Colonial). The self-penned B-side of the record, &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know, I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Tell You&quot;, revealed Hamilton&#x27;s ambitions to be a rockabilly-country singer.

After a string of pop hits, Hamilton joined the Rockabilly Tour playing with Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers, Little Richard, and several others throughout the country. Hamilton was then invited to Washington, DC, to become a member of the cast of &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;, where he performed regularly with Patsy Cline and Jimmy Dean. He also appeared on Dick Clark’s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, and &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;. Hamilton went on to host his own national television musical/variety shows on ABC and CBS in the late 1950s. In late 1959, Hamilton moved his family to Nashville to further his work as a country musician. On February 8, 1960, Hamilton officially became a member of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. Later that same year, he began recording for RCA Records, having been signed by Chet Atkins.

Hamilton&#x27;s breakthrough hit was the 1961 song &quot;Before this Day Ends&quot;. His biggest hit came two years later with &quot;Abilene&quot;, another song penned by Loudermilk, along with Bob Gibson and Lester Brown. The song spent four weeks at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s country singles chart and reached the Top 20 of the Hot 100. The success of &quot;Abilene&quot; was followed with the song &quot;Fort Worth, Dallas or Houston&quot; (a top-ten hit in late 1964).

In 1962, Hamilton started the first Music City USA and Homes of the Stars Bus Tour in Nashville. By the mid-1960s, Hamilton&#x27;s music began showing a decidedly folk influence. This was especially evident with 1966&#x27;s &quot;Steel Rail Blues&quot; and &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot; (both by Gordon Lightfoot), and 1967&#x27;s &quot;Urge for Going&quot; penned by Joni Mitchell. Another 1967 hit was &quot;Break My Mind&quot; (by John D. Loudermilk). One more Hamilton song of this genre was a moderate hit in 1969—the Ray Griff-penned &quot;Canadian Pacific&quot;. His last top-five single came in 1970, with &quot;She&#x27;s a Little Bit Country&quot;.

After his American chart success declined in the early 1970s, Hamilton began touring the world, across the Soviet Union, Poland, Australia, the Middle East, and East Asia. Those widely acclaimed international performances earned Hamilton the nickname the International Ambassador of Country Music. In the 1970s, Hamilton was the first American country singer to have his own British TV series on BBC. He also hosted a successful TV series in Canada for six years in the late 1970s. In the 1990s, he played himself in the West End musical &quot;Patsy&quot;, based on the life of Patsy Cline.

In the 1980s, Hamilton appeared with Billy Graham on Ministry Tours throughout the United States and Canada, and including the UK tour &quot;Mission England&quot;.

In 2004, he recorded an acoustic gospel album with producer Dave Moody titled &quot;On a Blue Ridge Sunday&quot;, which earned Hamilton a Dove Award nomination in the &quot;Best Bluegrass Album of the Year&quot; category by the members of the Gospel Music Association. A single from the album, &quot;Little Mountain Church House&quot;, won nominee recognition in the &quot;Best Bluegrass Recorded Song&quot; category the following year.

Until the very late years of his life, Hamilton was a regular at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in Nashville and in country shows throughout the U.S. and the UK. Hamilton celebrated his 50th year as a &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; member in 2010. He mainly concentrated on gospel tours both at home and abroad. In 2007, he collaborated with Live Issue, a group from Northern Ireland, to record a live album based on the life of Joseph Scriven, who wrote the hymn &quot;What a Friend We Have in Jesus&quot;. The two also toured together again in 2009.

In 2008, at the height of the soaring U.S. gas prices, Hamilton released &quot;Gasoline&quot;, a parody of his classic hit &quot;Abilene&quot;. The acoustic single featured &quot;The Oil Spots&quot; (a.k.a. the Moody Brothers &amp; George Hamilton V) and became a hit with audiences during Hamilton&#x27;s Opry appearances. Hamilton was also a regular participant in the &quot;Country&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot; video series.

In 2010, Lamon Records released the album &quot;Old Fashioned Hymns&quot;, recorded transatlantic with producers Dave Moody in Nashville and Colin Elliott in Ireland. Hamilton was joined on the 28-track collection by a number of musical guests, including Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Gail Davies, Pat Boone, Del McCoury, Bill Anderson, Connie Smith, Tommy Cash, Cliff Barrows, and George Beverly Shea, among others.

== Personal life and death ==
Hamilton married his high school sweetheart Adelaide &quot;Tink&quot; Peyton and had two sons, George and Peyton, and one daughter, Mary. When Hamilton&#x27;s elder son George Hege Hamilton V was seven years old, he found one of his father&#x27;s guitars and began writing songs. He became a singer, using the name &quot;Hege V&quot; because his father and the actor, George Hamilton were already both using the same name. The younger Hamilton said his father &quot;never pushed me&quot;, but he eventually began playing in nightclubs. On his tours, which sometimes included his father, Hege V played rhythm guitar and sang harmony and occasionally the lead, including some of his father&#x27;s songs. George has four grandchildren including George Hege &quot;Nash&quot; Hamilton VI, Peyton McAlester Hamilton, Aubrey Elizabeth Arcure, and James Michael &quot;Mick&quot; Arcure.

Hamilton had a heart attack on September 13, 2014, and died on September 17 at Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital in Nashville. On September 24, the Ryman Auditorium hosted a memorial service, which included performances by Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs, the Whites, Jett Williams, Gail Davies, Connie Smith, Dave Moody, Jimmy Capps, Barry and Holly Tashian, the Babcocks, Andrew Greer, and Cindy Morgan. Those who shared stories of Hamilton&#x27;s life and career at the memorial service included English music historian and journalist Tony Byworth, music writer and author Frye Galliard, artists and songwriters John D. Loudermilk and Bill Anderson, Grand Ole Opry general manager Pete Fisher, and WSM announcer Eddie Stubbs. The service concluded with &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; performed on bagpipes by Nashville Pipes and Drums Pipe Sergeant David Goodman. George Hamilton IV is buried in God&#x27;s Acre Cemetery in Old Salem, North Carolina.

The George Hamilton IV Collection is located in the Southern Folklife Collection of the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Honors ==
Hamilton was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010.

The North Carolina Board of Transportation voted to name a bridge on Business 40 for Hamilton. The ceremony naming the bridge was held on July 19, 2016, which would have been Hamilton&#x27;s 79th birthday.

<doc id="400746" wikidata="Q311160" url="?curid=400746" title="Hussein-Ali Montazeri">
<text>Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri ( ; 24 September 1922 – 19 December 2009) was an Iranian Shia Islamic theologian, Islamic democracy advocate, writer, and human rights activist. He was one of the leaders of the Iranian Revolution and one of the highest-ranking authorities in Shīʿite Islam. He was once the designated successor to the revolution&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini; they had a falling-out in 1989 over government policies that Montazeri claimed infringed on people&#x27;s freedom and denied them their rights, especially after the 1988 mass execution of political prisoners. Montazeri spent his later years in Qom and remained politically influential in Iran but was placed in house arrest in 1997 for questioning &quot;the unaccountable rule exercised by the supreme leader&quot;, Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini. He was known as the most knowledgeable senior Islamic scholar in Iran, a &quot;grand marja&quot; (religious authority) of Shia Islam, and was said to be one of Khamenei&#x27;s teachers.

For more than two decades, Montazeri was one of the main critics of the Islamic Republic&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy. He had also been an active advocate of Baháʼí Faith rights, civil rights, and women&#x27;s rights in Iran. Montazeri was a prolific writer of books and articles. He was a staunch proponent of an Islamic state, and he argued that post-revolutionary Iran was not being ruled as an Islamic state.

==Early life and public career==
Born in 1922, Montazeri was from a peasant family in Najafabad, a city in Isfahan Province, 250 miles south of Tehran. His early theological education was in Isfahan. After Khomeini was forced into exile by the Shah, Montazeri &quot;sat at the center of the clerical network&quot;, which Khomeini had established to oppose Pahlavi rule. He became a teacher at the Faiziyeh Theological School. While there he answered Khomeini&#x27;s call to protest the White Revolution of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in June 1963 and was active in anti-Shah clerical circles. He was sent to prison in 1974 and released in 1978 in time to be active during the revolution. Montazeri then went to Qom where he studied theology.

==Iranian Revolution==

Montazeri was known as an Islamic jurist who was made to pay for his liberal-leaning beliefs. He supported a democratic republic as the best form of government; however in his ideal model for government, an Islamic jurist acts as a supervisor and advisor, what he, along with Ayatollah Khomeini, termed as velayat-e faqih. He was the author of &quot;Dirasāt fī wilāyah al-faqīh&quot;, a scholarly book advocating the supervision of the administration by Islamic jurists. He believed in the independence of the government and did not accept any executive and policy making role for the Islamic jurist. Montazeri asserted that the rule of the jurisprudent should not be an absolute rule; instead, it should be limited to the function of advisor to the rulers, who are elected by the people.

In 1979, following the overthrow of the Shah, he played a pivotal role in instituting Iran&#x27;s new constitution. He was one of the leaders of the movement to replace the democratic and secular draft constitution proposed for the Islamic Republic with one where the supervision of Islamic jurists was recognized. He distributed &quot;a detailed commentary and alternate draft&quot; for Iran&#x27;s new constitution. It included proposals to specify that Twelver Shi&#x27;ism—and not Islam in general—was the official religion of the state and to state that Islamic jurists should appoint judges with the right of veto over all laws and actions that are against the Islamic principles. Later he served on the Assembly of Experts (&quot;Majles-e-Khobregan&quot;) that wrote the constitution and that implemented many of his proposals.

During this time, Montazeri also served as Friday prayer leader of Qom, as a member of the Revolutionary Council and as deputy to Supreme Leader Khomeini. Khomeini began &quot;to transfer some of his power&quot; to Montazeri, in 1980. By 1983 &quot;all government offices hung a small picture&quot; of Montazeri next to that of Khomeini. In 1984, Montazeri became a grand ayatollah.

Montazeri initially rejected Khomeini&#x27;s proposal to make him his successor, insisting that the choice of successor be left to the democratically elected Assembly of Experts. Later, Montazeri relented, and following a session of the Assembly of Experts in November 1985, he was officially appointed Khomeini&#x27;s successor as Supreme Leader.

Some observers believe Khomeini chose him for this role solely because of his support for Khomeini&#x27;s principle of theocratic rule by Islamic jurists. Khomeini&#x27;s proposed form of administration called for the most learned, or one of the most learned, Islamic jurists to &quot;rule&quot;, and of all those who might be considered a leading Islamic jurist, only Montazeri supported theocracy. In Montazeri&#x27;s opinion, however the jurist would not act as an absolute ruler, instead, he would act as an advisor and consultant.

Montazeri fell short of the theological requirements of the supreme Faqih. He could not claim descent from the Prophet nor did he possess all the credentials of a revered scholar of Islamic law. His religious followers were few. And he lacked the all-important charisma. His selection had happened for one reason—he was the only one among the candidates for Faqih who totally endorsed Khomeini&#x27;s vision of Islamic government.

In addition, traditionalists did not approve Montazeri&#x27;s designation as successor due to several reasons, including his problematic persona in Shiite seminaries during the reign of the Shah and his support for Ali Shariati’s and for Nematollah Salehi Najaf Abadi&#x27;s works. Montazeri&#x27;s leadership qualifications were further hurt by not being a seyyed, or descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, traditionally wearing the black turban in Shiite Islam, like Khomeini and Khomeini&#x27;s successor Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the early years of the revolution, he was not as popular as he was in the last two decades of his life. The middle class and elites would mock him in those early years.

==Dispute with Khomeini and demotion==

Montazeri was one of Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s two favorite pupils. Khomeini trusted Montazeri with important responsibilities and referred to him as &quot;the fruit of his life&quot;. Likewise, Montazeri respected and admired Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;sheer determination and unshakable faith.&quot;

Mehdi Karrubi claims that the tensions between Montazeri and Khomeini began in around October 1986 when Montazeri sent a letter to the latter, criticising and questioning the foundation of the state. Montazeri&#x27;s troubles became further evident due to his association with Mehdi Hashemi who ran an organization out of Montazeri&#x27;s office which sought to export the Islamic revolution. Hashemi is thought to have embarrassed Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani by leaking information of his connection with the Iran-Contra affair. Subsequently Hashemi was arrested, convicted and executed in September 1987 on charges of counterrevolutionary activities.

In November 1987, Montazeri created more controversy when he called for the legalization of political parties, though under strict regulation. He followed this by calling for &quot;an open assessment of failures&quot; of the Revolution and an end to the export of revolution, saying that Iran should inspire by example, not train and arm allied groups. Khomeini responded the next February by criticizing Montazeri and a month later called for a meeting of the Assembly of Experts to &quot;discuss him.&quot;

Things came to a head following the mass execution of political prisoners in late summer and early autumn 1988, when Montazeri gave a series of lectures in which he indicated support for a &quot;far more open&quot; policy. In an interview published in &quot;Keyhan&quot; in early 1989, he criticized Khomeini in language that is said to have sealed &quot;his political fate&quot;:
The denial of people&#x27;s rights, injustice and disregard for the revolution&#x27;s true values have delivered the most severe blows against the revolution. Before any reconstruction [takes place], there must first be a political and ideological reconstruction... This is something that the people expect of a leader.
Still worse for him were the publication abroad and broadcast on the BBC of his letters condemning the post-war wave of executions in March 1989. Montazeri also criticized Khomeini&#x27;s fatwa ordering the assassination of author Salman Rushdie saying: &quot;People in the world are getting the idea that our business in Iran is just murdering people.&quot;

On 26 March 1989, Khomeini strongly denounced Montazeri&#x27;s actions, and two days later announced that Montazeri had resigned his post. Montazeri did not protest, issuing a message concluding, &quot;I ask all brothers and sisters not to utter a word in my support.&quot;

In addition to losing his position as designated heir, Montazeri&#x27;s title of Grand Ayatollah was withdrawn, publication of his lectures in the 
&quot;Kayhan&quot; newspaper and references to him on the state radio were stopped, his portraits were ordered by the then Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi to be removed from offices and mosques, and his security guards were withdrawn. Articles and editorials appeared in various newspapers aimed at &quot;dismantling&quot; Montazeri&#x27;s &quot;impeccable&quot; revolutionary credentials.

According to numerous sources, the amendment to Iran&#x27;s constitution removing the requirement that the Supreme Leader be a Marja was instituted to deal with the problem of the lack of any remaining Grand Ayatollahs willing to accept &quot;illimitable velayat-e faqih&quot;. However, others said the reason marjas were not elected was because of their lack of votes in the Assembly of Experts. For example, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpaygani had the backing of only thirteen members of the assembly. Furthermore, there were other marjas present who accepted &quot;illimitable velayat-e faqih&quot;.

==Later dissent and house arrest==
Khomeini died in June 1989 and another cleric, Seyed Ali Khamene&#x27;i, was selected by the Assembly of Experts to be the new Supreme Leader. Khamenei had been a high-ranking Hojatoleslam before Montazeri&#x27;s removal. His promotion was accepted by many Shi&#x27;a, among the exceptions being Montazeri.

In December 1989, Montazeri&#x27;s supporters in Qom distributed &quot;night letters&quot; questioning Khamenei&#x27;s qualifications to be a Marja e Taqlid (&quot;Source of Emulation&quot;), or in other words, an Ayatollah. In retaliation Revolutionary Guards &quot;detained and humiliated&quot; Montazeri, &quot;forcing him to wear his nightcap rather than his white turban.&quot;

In October 1997, after openly criticizing the authority of Khamenei, Montazeri was placed under house arrest under the pretext of protecting him from hardliners. He was freed from house arrest in 2003 after more than 100 Iranian legislators called on President Khatami to free him. Some thought that the government lifted the house arrest to avoid the possibility of a popular backlash if the ailing Montazeri died while in custody.

===Criticism of the government===
During the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners, Montazeri wrote to Khomeini saying &quot;at least order to spare women who have children ... the execution of several thousand prisoners in a few days will not reflect positively and will not be mistake-free ... A large number of prisoners have been killed under torture by interrogators ... in some prisons of the Islamic Republic young girls are being raped ... As a result of unruly torture, many prisoners have become deaf or paralysed or afflicted with chronic disease.&quot;

On 22 January 2007, Montazeri criticized former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his nuclear and economic policies.

While agreeing Iran had the right to develop nuclear energy, he called Ahmadinejad&#x27;s approach to the issue aggressive, saying, &quot;One has to deal with the enemy with wisdom, not provoke it, ... his (provocation) only creates problems for the country&quot; and asked, &quot;Don&#x27;t we have other rights too?&quot; referring to individual and human rights. Montazeri also criticized Iran’s economic performance under Ahmadinejad&#x27;s administration, noting the rate of inflation—including a 50% increase in housing costs—and arguing that a country cannot be run on &quot;slogans&quot;.

Montazeri, in a 2008 interview with Voice of America concerning the 29th anniversary of the revolution, stated that the revolution had given Islam a bad name, arguing &quot;Unfortunately, it is only by name that the revolution remains Islamic. Its content has changed, and what is taking place in the name of Islam gives a bad image of the religion. This is the religion of kindness and tolerance.&quot; He also issued a statement in 2008 in support of the rights of the persecuted Baháʼís in the Islamic Republic, saying that though Baháʼís were not People of the Book like Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, nonetheless: &quot;[T]hey are the citizens of this country, they have the right of citizenship and to live in this country. Furthermore, they must benefit from the Islamic compassion which is stressed in Quran and by the religious authorities.&quot;

Montazeri again spoke out against Ahmadinejad on 16 June 2009 during the protests against his reelection. Ahmadinejad was controversially reelected as president after a closely contested and disputed race, which involved many candidates, but whose front-runners were Ahmadinejad and former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi. The government reported that Ahmadinejad had won the election with 62 percent of the vote. Montazeri stated that &quot;No one in their right mind can believe&quot; the results were fairly counted. Montazeri called for three days of public mourning for the death of Neda Agha-Soltan and others killed during 20 June protests. He further declared that the then current ruling government was neither Islamic nor a republic, but military. In November 2009, on the day before the 30th anniversary celebration of the Iran hostage crisis, Montazeri said that the occupation of the American embassy in 1979 had been a mistake.

==Human rights and gender==
While Ayatollah Montazeri has been celebrated as a champion of the rights of political prisoners, and human rights associated with the public sphere, in an interview conducted in 2003 in Qom with the Iranian feminist academic Golbarg Bashi he said that while men and women enjoy the same dignity and respect in the eyes of God, women&#x27;s rights must remain strictly under the domain of Shi&#x27;i fiqh rather than international human rights conventions such as CEDAW.

In response to Golbarg Bashi, Ayatollah Montazeri said:

When Bashi informed him that currently (2003) in Iranian universities, &quot;some 60% of students are women&quot; and asked him &quot;so in future generations, when the number of professors, physicians, high-ranking experts, etc, will be mostly women, will Islam be able to have an ijtihad and modify these unjust laws because they no longer correspond with reality?&quot;, Ayatollah Montazeri responded: &quot;Those aspects of the Islamic law that are based on the very letter of the Qur&#x27;an, the answer is no. But certain other things yes, you can, and they can be subject to changing times. But those that are from the very letter of the Qur&#x27;an, no they cannot, and those have certain wisdom and subtleties in them.&quot;

==Reputation==
According to journalist Christopher de Bellaigue, Montazeri was regarded as &quot;brilliant&quot; by his allies, and even his opponents; de Bellaigue added that Montazeri &quot;lives plainly, and equates Islam with social justice&quot;. Montazeri&#x27;s detractors portrayed him as stubborn and naïve in his insistence that the Islamic republic find reconciliation with the &quot;hypocrites&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot; who are its &quot;internal enemies.&quot;

==Public image==
In late 1960s, Montazeri gained influence and popularity in Isfahan Province after his speeches criticizing the Shah, moving SAVAK to banish and subsequently imprison him.

In 1980s, Montazeri was known by the pejorative nickname &quot;Gorbeh Nareh&quot; (, the masculine cat) after the Cat, a character in the &quot;Pinocchio&quot; animated series. According to Elaine Sciolino, this was due to his &quot;poor public speaking skills, squeaky voice, round face and grizzled beard&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 4 September 1942, he married Mah-Sultan Rabbani (1926 – 26 March 2010) and had seven children, four daughters and three sons. One of his sons, Mohammad Montazeri, died in a bomb blast at Islamic Republican Party headquarters in 1981 which was carried out by the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran; another, Saeed Montazeri, lost an eye in the Iran-Iraq war in 1985. Another son, Ahmad Montazeri, is a cleric in Qom; during the 1970s Ahmad underwent military training in Fatah camps in Lebanon. The brother of Montazeri&#x27;s son-in-law, Mehdi Hashemi, was sentenced to death and executed after the 1979 revolution due to his alleged involvement in the murder of Ayatollah Abul Hassan Shams Abadi, who had been a critic of Montazeri, in Isfahan.

He was described by Ayatollah Mohammad Guilani as &quot;meticulous about, if not obsessed by, cleanliness.&quot;

==Death==
On 19 December 2009, Montazeri died in his sleep of heart failure at his home in Qom, at the age of 87. The Islamic Republic News Agency, the official news agency of Iran, did not use the Ayatollah title in its initial reports of his death and referred to him as the &quot;clerical figure of rioters&quot;. The state television and radio broadcasters were similar, showing the tension between the government and its opponents.

===Funeral and protests===

Montazeri&#x27;s funeral was said to have marked &quot;a new phase&quot; in Iran&#x27;s 2009 uprising.
====21 December====

On 21 December, hundreds of thousands of mourners and the Green Movement supporters from across Iran turned out in Montazeri&#x27;s funeral and turned the funeral to a massive protest against the Iranian government. The funeral service for him began at his house and funeral prayers were held at the Grand Mosque in Qom. After the special prayers by Ayatollah Mousa Shabiri Zanjani, his body was laid to rest in the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. He was buried alongside his son, Mohammad Montazeri.

The protesters chanted opposition slogans, including &quot;Our shame, our shame, our idiot leader&quot;, and “Dictator, this is your last message: the people of Iran are rising!”

Although the police mostly stayed clear of the funeral, there were some skirmishes between protesters and the Basij militia. Also on 21 December, inside the Qom shrine where Montazeri’s body was laid to rest, opposition activists gathered and chanted “Death to the dictator.” When one group of pro-government basiji militiamen came toward them, chanting “Death to the hypocrites,” the crowd changed to an anti-basiji slogan. Then they took out money, offering it to the basiji, and chanted that they were acting as paid mercenaries of the government: “Where is the oil money? Spent on the Basiji,” and “Basij’s great pride, rape in prison.” On the same day, Mir-Hossein Mousavi stepped out from the compound of Grand Ayatollah Saanei, a fellow reformist, to cross the street to Montazeri’s house in Qom. At that moment, a group of 30 bearded men, holding Montazeri pictures to blend into the crowd, dropped the portraits, started attacking Mousavi and shouted “death to the hypocrite.” The former candidate had to be hustled quickly into the Montazeri compound. The same thing happened when cleric Mehdi Karroubi stepped into the street. This time, groups of reformists were ready and pushed back the vigilantes, so that Karroubi could pass.

As the funeral procession ended, security forces poured into the city, blocking roads to the Ayatollah&#x27;s house and tearing down posters of the Ayatollah. Mourners were reported to have thrown stones at police who tried to stop them chanting pro-Montazeri slogans. Mourners responded defiantly when ordered by loudspeaker not to chant, breaking into shouts of &quot;Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein&quot; in support of Mir Hossein Mousavi. When a crowd of pro-government supporters chanted back: &quot;I will give my life for the supreme leader,&quot; they were booed by mourners, a witness said. The security forces prevented the Ayatollah&#x27;s family from holding a planned memorial ceremony in the grand mosque of Qom following the funeral.

According to the reformist website Kalameh, men on motorbikes, believed to be Ahmadinejad supporters, attacked the car carrying Mir Hossein Mousavi back from Qom to Tehran. They insulted Mousavi, smashed the back window and injured one of his aides.

There were also protests in Najafabad, birthplace of Ayatollah Montazeri. Internet videos showed protesters waving green banners and chanting, “Dictator, dictator, Montazeri is alive!” and “Oh Montazeri, your path will be followed even if the dictator shoots us all!”

====22 and 23 December====
On 22 December, Ahmadinejad continued his quest to strip his opponents of their last vestiges of political power. He interrupted a visit to Shiraz to return to Tehran and remove Mir Hossein Mousavi, the main opposition leader he defeated in the presidential election, as head of the state Academy of Arts and Culture- a post he had held for ten years. Hardliners also wanted Mousavi arrested for his role in inciting unrest since the disputed June election.

On 23 December, Iranian security forces clashed with tens of thousands of opposition supporters in the city of Isfahan, according to opposition website reports. Activists said police used tear gas, pepper spray and batons to disperse people gathering to commemorate Grand Ayatollah Montazeri in the Seyed mosque. People had gathered at the main mosque for the memorial service, but when they arrived the doors were closed and security forces told them to leave. Afterwards, security forces began beating people, including women and children with batons, chains and stones, used tear gas and pepper spray and arrested at least 50 people, including four journalists and a cleric, Masoud Abid, who was to deliver the sermon. Many were also injured. One witness said, &quot;They took people in the shops and beat them up mostly out of public vision although some beatings happened outside on the streets.&quot; Security forces also sealed off the home of Ayatollah Jalal Al-Din Taheri, who organised the service and used to lead Friday prayers in Isfahan until he resigned in 2002 in protest at the government’s growing authoritarianism.

Meanwhile, footage sent to the BBC from Najafabad showed crowds chanting &quot;Criminals, rapists, death to the leadership&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re not afraid, we&#x27;re not afraid&quot; as security men watched from rooftops.

Police severely attacked mourners and protesters in several cities, with many wounded and arrested. The government also announced that banknotes with anti-government annotation, which recently spread across the country, will be forbidden starting from 8 January.

====24 December====
On 24 December, opposition web sites reported that police in Tehran and the northwestern city of Zanjan clashed with protesters defying an order by the Iranian government banning memorial services for Montazeri. Protesters marched in Imam Khomeini Square in southern Tehran in a sign of mourning for Montazeri. The protesters chanted, &quot;Today is a mourning day; the green nation of Iran is mourning today&quot;—a reference to the trademark color of the opposition. The police attacked the protesters with clubs and tear gas. Older women tried to prevent the arrest of young men by throwing themselves on them, and were severely beaten by officers who intended to drag the young men away.

Meanwhile, the police in Zanjan, a city of mostly Turkish speakers, tried to prevent a mourning ceremony for Montazeri by locking the mosque where the ceremony was to be held and attacking mourners who chanted outside it. It was mentioned that: “The police beat people with such violence that many suffered from broken legs, arms and noses.” There were also many arrests.

====26 December====
Witnesses and opposition websites reported the following incidents:
*There were protests in several areas of the capital, including the poorer areas of south Tehran, and government forces were using tear gas to try to disperse demonstrators.
*Clashes were reported in northern Tehran near Jamaran mosque (where Khomeini used to address people), between thousands of opposition supporters (who shouted anti-government slogans) and riot police. Reformist ex-President Mohammad Khatami had been due to speak at the mosque to mark the Shiite holy day of Ashura. However, security officials cancelled the Ashura speech to be given by Khatami and also surrounded the mosque. A reformist website reported about 50 plainclothes forces breaking into Jamaran mosque and attacking people. Riot police also fired tear gas during the incident. Protesters shouted, &quot;death to this dictatorship&quot; and &quot;if Khomeini was alive, he would sure be with us,&quot; according to witnesses. A witness also said, &quot;Police told them they have five minutes to leave and, when they were still shouting slogans and persisted, policemen on motorbikes drove through the crowds and fired teargas.&quot; Riot police and members of the Basij also chased demonstrators into the nearby bustling Niavaran street and fired paintballs at them. The security forces also arrested several protesters. Clashes were also reported between police and protesters near another north Tehran mosque, Dar al-Zahra, which is known to host reformist clerics.
*Opposition supporters had gathered in groups along a stretch of a main Tehran city centre route several kilometres long, but police were out in force and were not letting them join each other. Earlier, there were clashes at several points along Enghelab Street, a main thoroughfare where months earlier hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had staged protest marches after Ahmadinejad&#x27;s disputed re-election. Police also stopped and arrested the passengers of a bus near Enghelab Square because they were chanting pro-opposition slogans. Some protesters were reported to have chanted: &quot;The dictator must know that he will soon be overthrown.&quot;
*Tension was running high at rallies in which protesters were chanting anti-government slogans in three areas of central Tehran. Government forces, including soldiers of the elite Revolutionary Guard and the paramilitary Basiji, are said to have reacted aggressively—beating protesters with batons, firing warning shots into the air to disperse demonstrators, using teargas and pepper spray and smashing the windscreens of cars that were hooting in protest, as well as making numerous arrests.
*Security forces chased protesters into a building housing the offices of the ISNA news agency, where some demonstrators had sought shelter during the clashes, ISNA said, adding one of its reporters had been injured when security forces had attacked the building. An eyewitness said at least two people were injured when police chased after protesters into the building. “They fractured the skull of one ISNA person and badly beat up another employee,” the witness said. ISNA&#x27;s news service appeared to be working normally and it later issued a report on the incident, saying one of its reporters had been injured without specifying who was to blame.
*An elderly woman travelling on a city bus in the area was heard urging passengers to chant slogans such as &quot;Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein&quot; in support of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, a witness said. The witness said passengers on the packed bus also chanted &quot;Our Neda is not dead, it is the government which is dead,&quot; referring to protester Neda Agha Soltan, who bled to death during a 20 June protest in shocking scenes caught on video and viewed by millions around the world.
*Witnesses said riot police fired warning shots in several areas of Tehran to deter demonstrators, many of whom chanted slogans increasingly against the country&#x27;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran&#x27;s most powerful figure, rather than President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
*Clashes were reported in cities including Isfahan, Kermanshah and Shiraz, as opposition supporters used the Tasua and Ashura ceremonies to take to the streets.

====Later events====
In 2010, the office of Montazeri that had been run by his son Ahmad was closed on the orders of Ali Khamenei.

<text>David A. Drake (September 24, 1945 – December 10, 2023) was an American author of science fiction and fantasy literature. A Vietnam War veteran, he worked as a lawyer before becoming a writer in the military science fiction genre.

==Biography==
Drake graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Iowa, majoring in history (with honors) and Latin. His studies at Duke University School of Law were interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served as an enlisted interrogator with the 11th Armored Cavalry (the Black Horse Regiment) in Vietnam and Cambodia. After the war, from 1972 to 1980 he worked as the assistant town attorney in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In 1981 he transitioned to full-time writing of science fiction literature. With Karl Edward Wagner and Jim Groce, he was one of the initiators of Carcosa, a small press company. He lived in Pittsboro, North Carolina.

In 2019, he announced that he may be suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. On November 17, 2021 he announced he was retiring from writing novels, due to unspecified cognitive health problems. Drake died on December 10, 2023, at the age of 78.

==Works==
His best-known solo work is the Hammer&#x27;s Slammers series of military science fiction. His newer RCN Series was a space opera inspired by the Aubrey–Maturin novels. In 1997, Drake began his largest fantasy series, &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, using elements of Sumerian religion and medieval technology. In 2007, Drake finished the series with its ninth volume.

Drake co-authored novels with authors such as Karl Edward Wagner, S.M. Stirling, and Eric Flint. Typically Drake provided plot outlines (5,000–15,000 words) and the co-author did &quot;the real work of developing the outline into a novel&quot;. He did not &quot;consider [his] involvement to be that of a real co-author.&quot; Drake also contributed to the &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; series.

A common element in most of his works was the focus on military, in particular, lives of regular soldiers. Drake&#x27;s plots often use history, literature, and mythology; in his foreword to &quot;The Lord of the Isles&quot;, Drake explained that while he had an academic background in history, he regarded himself as an antiquarian rather than a historian and that this perspective informed his approach to writing. Starting with &quot;Northworld&quot; in 1990, he generally explained the background of each book in an afterword or preface. Additionally, Drake&#x27;s plots frequently involve a contest of political systems.

Some of Drake&#x27;s works are available for free download in the Baen Free Library.

<doc id="400753" wikidata="Q1273153" url="?curid=400753" title="E-gold">
<text>E-gold or eGold was a digital gold currency operated by Gold &amp; Silver Reserve Inc. (G&amp;SR) that allowed users to make payments, which it called &quot;spends&quot;, in grams of gold, silver, and other precious metals. E-gold was launched in 1996 and grew to five million accounts by 2009, when transfers were suspended due to legal issues. At its peak in 2006, e-gold processed more than US$2 billion worth of spends per year, backed by over 85 million worth of gold, about . e-gold Ltd. was incorporated in Nevis, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and its operations were based in Florida.

==Beginnings==

E-gold was founded by Douglas Jackson, an oncologist, and Barry Downey, an attorney, in 1996. The pair originally backed e-gold accounts with gold coins stored in a safe deposit box in Melbourne, Florida. When e-gold was at its peak, the company stored its gold and platinum in bank vaults in London and Dubai.

By 1998, G&amp;SR was an affiliate member of NACHA and a full member of NACHA&#x27;s Internet council. The company experienced exponential growth starting in 2000. In a July 13, 1999 article in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Tim Jackson (no relation to Douglas) described e-gold as &quot;the only electronic currency that has achieved critical mass on the web&quot;. In 2001, the company said that e-gold had more than 200,000 accounts and more than $14 million of digital gold currency in circulation. By 2004, there were over a million accounts.

By the early 2000s, the capability of immediate settlement, as implemented by e-gold, was recognized as key to the emergence of systems for peer-to-peer transfers of digital rights such as &quot;smart contracts&quot;.

E-gold was a founding member of the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography. In 2005 and 2006, the company took effective action to combat child exploitation.

==Criminal abuse==
E-gold was a target of financial malware and phishing scams by criminal syndicates and was used for illegal activities. In December 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided G&amp;SR&#x27;s offices, seizing files and hardware, as part of an investigation into e-gold&#x27;s use in criminal activities. A month later, no charges had been filed against Jackson or his businesses.

===Hackers===
Because of e-gold&#x27;s hard money and non-repudiation policies, it was an early and particularly attractive target of phishing attacks against its users. Attackers also exploited flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating systems and Internet Explorer web browser to collect account details from millions of computers to compromise online accounts, including e-gold accounts. In the first half of 2004, e-gold implemented one-time passwords to improve its security.

Jackson said that e-gold is a book entry system with account histories, making it possible to identify users who had engaged in illicit activity. e-gold accounts were pseudonymous, allowing an account&#x27;s creator to use any name. Law enforcement could use e-gold&#x27;s account and transaction records, cross-referenced with data from exchangers, to identify criminal users of the service.

===Fraud===

In a lengthy article in &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;″s January 9, 2006 issue, a reporter wrote that online payment systems, including e-gold, have become popular among merchants engaged in carding, identity theft, and money laundering. Jackson said that his company has an investigative staff that responds to inquiries from law enforcement agencies, and that his company does not cater to criminals.

The Western Express Cybercrime Group, a five-man fraud syndicate based in Eastern Europe, engaged in carding, selling illegally obtained goods and using e-gold and other digital currencies to store the proceeds.

==Prosecution and closure==

In 2007, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted e-gold, accusing it of money laundering, conspiracy, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, stating that it knew its service was being abused by identity thieves and child pornographers but did not do enough to stop them. The company denied the charges. In July 2008, the company and its three directors entered into a plea agreement. Douglas Jackson pleaded guilty to operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. In November 2008, Jackson was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, a $200 fine, and three years of supervision, including six months of electronically monitored home detention. Jackson had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. Judge Rosemary Collyer opted for a much more lenient sentence because of Jackson&#x27;s significant personal debt. &quot;Dr. Jackson has suffered, will continue to suffer, and may never be successful with e-Gold,&quot; said the judge.

Reid Jackson, Douglas&#x27;s brother, and Barry Downey, a company director, were each sentenced to three years of probation and 300 hours of community service, and ordered to pay a $2,500 fine and a $100 assessment.

E-gold&#x27;s plea agreement included a forfeiture of about $1.2 million to the government, a $300,000 fine, and a condition that Douglas Jackson impose know your customer (KYC) rules on e-gold customers. Customers who lived in high-risk countries or who had not completed KYC verification were limited to low or no transaction rates. e-gold announced a claims process in December 2010, and launched it in June 2013, for account holders to access the funds they had deposited. As of November 2013, users could not use e-gold&#x27;s web site for other purposes. Jackson told the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in a November 2013 article that he had hoped to resurrect e-gold himself, but that he had not been able to obtain the licenses required in most US states.

<text>Ifẹ̀ (, &quot;Ilé-Ifẹ̀&quot;) is an ancient Yoruba city in south-western Nigeria founded sometime between the years 1000 BC and 500 BC. By 900 AD, the city had become an important West African emporium producing sophisticated art forms. The city is located in present-day Osun State. Ifẹ̀ is about 218 kilometers northeast of Lagos with a population of over 500,000 people, which is the highest in Osun State according to population census of 2006.

According to the traditions of the Yoruba religion, Ilé-Ifẹ̀ was founded by the order of the Supreme God Olódùmarè by Obatala. It then fell into the hands of his brother Oduduwa, which created enmity between the two. Oduduwa created a dynasty there, and sons and daughters of this dynasty became rulers of many other kingdoms in Yorubaland. The first Ọọ̀ni of Ifẹ̀ is a descendant of Oduduwa, which was the 401st Orisha. The present ruler since 2015 is Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, Ọọ̀ni of Ifẹ̀ who is also a Nigerian accountant. Named as the city of 401 deities, Ifẹ̀ is home to many devotees/votaries of these deities and is where they are routinely celebrated through festivals.

Ilé-Ifẹ̀ is famous worldwide for its ancient and naturalistic bronze, stone and terracotta sculptures, dating back to between 1200 and 1400 CE.

==History==

===Origin of Ife: Creation of the world===
According to Yoruba religion, Olodumare, the Supreme God, ordered Obatala to create the earth, however on his way he over indulged in palm wine and got drunk. Thence, a contemporary Orisha to the former, Oduduwa, took the items of creation from him, descended from the abode of the Orisha on a chain and cast the handful of earth on the primordial ocean. The earth rose and became a mound called Oke Ora. He then put a five-toed cockerel on this primordial mound so that it would scatter the earth around, thus creating the land on which Ile Ife, the first city would be built. Oduduwa planted a palm nut in a hole in the newly formed land and from there sprang a great tree with sixteen branches, a symbolic representation of the 16 clans of the early Ife pre-urban confederation; &quot;Elu Merindinlogun&quot;, (Thirteen initial and 3 later ones). 

The usurpation of creation by Oduduwa, gave rise to an ever-lasting conflict between him and his contemporaneous rival Orisha, Obatala. This symbolic rivalry is still re-enacted in the modern era by the votary groups of the two divinities during the Itapa New Year festival. On account of his creation of the world, Oduduwa became the ancestor of the first divine king of the Yoruba, while Obatala is believed to have created the first Yoruba people out of clay. The meaning of the word &quot;Ife&quot; in Yoruba is &quot;expansion&quot;; &quot;Ile-Ife&quot; is therefore in reference to the myth of origin as &quot;The Land of Expansion&quot; (the word, Ile, as pronounced in modern Yoruba language, means house or home, which would make the name of the city mean &quot;The Home of Expansion&quot;).

===Origin of the regional states: Dispersal from the holy city===
Oduduwa had sons, daughters, and grandchildren, who went on to found their own kingdoms and empires, namely; Ila Orangun, Owu, Ketu, Sabe, Egba, Popo and Oyo. Oranmiyan, Oduduwa&#x27;s last born, was one of his father&#x27;s principal ministers and overseer of the nascent Edo kingdom after Oduduwa granted the plea of the Edo people for his governance. When Oranmiyan decided to go back to Ile Ife, after a period of service in Benin, he left behind a child named Eweka that he had in the interim with an indigenous princess of Benin, Erinmwinde, daughter of the King (Ogie) of Egor, a neighbouring settlement to nascent Benin. The young boy went on to become the first widely accepted ruler and Oba of the second Edo dynasty that has ruled what is now Benin from that day to this. Oranmiyan later migrated northwestwards into the savanna plains to found the Oyo. Oyo later became an empire that stretched at its height from the western or right bank of the Niger River to the eastern or left banks of the Volta River. It would become known as one of the most powerful of Africa&#x27;s medieval states, prior to its collapse in the mid 19th century.

==Traditional setting==
===The King (&quot;Ooni&quot; of Ile-Ife)===

The Oòni (or king) of Ife is a descendant of the godking Oduduwa, and is counted as the spiritual leader among the Yoruba kings however he does not reign supreme over the other descendants of Oduduwa . He is traditionally considered the 401st spirit (&quot;Orisha&quot;), the only one that speaks. In fact, the royal dynasty of Ife traces its origin back to the founding of the city more than ten thousand years before the birth of Jesus Christ. The present ruler is Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi (Ojaja II). The Ooni ascended his throne in 2015. Following the formation of the Yoruba Orisha Congress in 1986, the Ooni acquired an international status the likes of which the holders of his title hadn&#x27;t had since the city&#x27;s colonisation by the British. Nationally he had always been prominent amongst the Federal Republic of Nigeria&#x27;s company of royal Obas, being regarded as the &quot;chief priest and custodian of the holy city&quot; of all the Yorubas. In former times, the palace of the Ooni of Ife was a structure built of authentic enameled bricks, decorated with artistic porcelain tiles and all sorts of ornaments. At present, it is a more modern series of buildings. The current Ooni, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, Ooni of Ife, (born October 17, 1974) is a Nigerian accountant and the 51st Ooni of Ife. He succeeded the late Oba Okunade Sijuwade(Olubuse II) who was the 50th ooni of Ife, and who had died on July 28, 2015.

===Cults of Divinities===
Ife is well known as the city of 401 deities (also known as irumole or orishas). It is said that every day of the year the traditional worshippers celebrate a festival of one of these deities. Often the festivals extend over more than one day and they involve both priestly activities in the palace and theatrical dramatisations in the rest of the kingdom. Historically the King only appeared in public during the annual Olojo festival (celebration of the new dawn); other important festivals here include the Itapa festival for Obatala and Obameri, the Edi festival for Moremi Ajasoro and the Ugbo with their Igare (Oluyare) masqueraders.

Kings and gods were often depicted with large heads because the artists believed that the &quot;Ase&quot; was held in the head, the &quot;Ase&quot; being the inner power and energy of a person. Both historic figures of Ife and the offices associated with them are represented. One of the best documented among this is the early king Obalufon II who is said to have invented bronze casting and is honored in the form of a naturalistic copper life-size mask.

The city was a settlement of substantial size between the 12th and 14th centuries, with houses featuring potsherd pavements. Ilé-Ifè is known worldwide for its ancient and naturalistic bronze, stone and terracotta sculptures, which reached their peak of artistic expression between 1200 and 1400 CE In the period around 1300 CE the artists at Ife developed a refined and naturalistic sculptural tradition in terracotta, stone and copper alloy—copper, brass, and bronze—many of which appear to have been created under the patronage of King Obalufon II, the man who today is identified as the Yoruba patron deity of brass casting, weaving and regalia. After this period, production declined as political and economic power shifted to the nearby kingdom of Benin which, like the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, developed into a major empire.

Bronze and terracotta art created by this civilization are significant examples of naturalism in pre-colonial African art and are distinguished by their variations in regalia, facial marking patterns, and body proportions. Ancient Ife also was famous for its glass beads which have been found at sites as far away as Mali, Mauritania, and Ghana.

== Shrines, altars, and temples ==
Igbo Olokun: Igbo Olokun used to be a forested, sacred grove (igbo) that housed shrines at which the goddess Olokun was worshipped. Igbo Olokun in the city of Ile-Ife, in south-western Nigeria, was said to have a history of glass makers with unique manufacturing techniques in West Africa. Glass beads and associated production materials were found there during excavation. Analysis of the composition of the artefacts and preliminary dating of the site puts the main timing of glass-working between the 11th and 15th centuries AD. The results of these studies suggest that glass bead manufacture at this site was largely independent of glass-making traditions documented farther afield, and that Igbo Olokun may represent one of the earliest known glass-production workshops in West Africa. The location is not divulged except on request and permission of the keepers of the shrine because it is a sacred grove.

Oduduwa Shrine and Grove: The shrine of the progenitor of the Yoruba race. Worshippers and initiates flood the place seeking blessings and paying obeisance to the originator of their civilization.

Agbonniregun Temple: The grove of Ọrunmila, an Orisha. He is the Orisha of wisdom, knowledge, and divination. This source of knowledge is believed to have a keen understanding of the human form and of purity, and is therefore praised as often being more effective than other remedies.

==Archaeology==
Burnt pipes (or tuyere), stone tools, broken calabash, decorated potsherds, and pottery (e.g., rimsherd, plane-sherd body, broken, and washed pottery) were excavated at Iyekere. Iron smelting, charcoal utilized in the process of smelting, and iron slags involved in pitting were also discovered.

Iron smelting occurred in the Ife region. The yield and efficiency were quite high as the iron smelting process yielded ore grade near 80 percent iron oxide, lean slag possessed less than 60 percent iron oxide, and no greater than the required amount of iron oxide in the slag was left for slag formation. While more excavation is needed to produce a more accurate estimate for the age of the smelting site, it can be approximated to likely being precolonial, during the Late Iron Age.

Igbo Olokun, also known as Olokun Grove, may be one of the earliest workshops for producing glass in West Africa. Glass production may have begun during, if not before, the 11th century. The 11th - 15th century were the peak of glass production. High lime, high alumina (HLHA) and low lime, high alumina (LLHA) glass are distinct compositions that were developed using locally sourced recipes, raw materials, and pyrotechnology. The presence of HLHA glass beads discovered throughout West Africa (e.g., Igbo-Ukwu in southern Nigeria, Gao and Essouk in Mali, and Kissi in Burkina Faso), after the ninth century CE, reveals the broader importance of this glass industry in the region and shows its participation in regional trade networks (e.g., trans-Saharan trade, trans-Atlantic trade). Glass beads served as “the currency for negotiating political power, economic relations, and cultural/spiritual values” for “Yoruba, West Africans, and the African diaspora.”

In Osun Grove, the distinct glassmaking technology produced by the Yoruba persisted into the seventeenth century.

==Government==
The main city of Ife is divided into two local government areas: Ife East, headquartered at Oke-ogbo and Ife central at Ajebandele area of the city. Both local governments are composed of a total of 21 political wards. The city has an estimated population of 355,813 people.

<doc id="400768" wikidata="Q1859043" url="?curid=400768" title="List of Roman imperial victory titles">
<text>This is a list of victory titles assumed by Roman Emperors, not including assumption of the title &quot;Imperator&quot; (originally itself a victory title); note that the Roman Emperors were not the only persons to assume victory titles (Maximinus Thrax acquired his victory title during the reign of a previous Emperor). In a sense, the Imperial victory titles give an interesting summary of which wars and which adversaries were considered significant by the senior leadership of the Roman Empire, but in some cases more opportunistic motifs play a role, even to the point of glorifying a victory that was by no means a real triumph (but celebrated as one for internal political prestige).

Multiple grants of the same title were distinguished by ordinals, e.g. &quot;Germanicus Maximus IV&quot;, &quot;great victor in Germania for the fourth time&quot;.

<text>Hendrik Willem van Loon (January 14, 1882 – March 11, 1944) was a Dutch-American historian, journalist, and children&#x27;s book author.

==Life==
Van Loon was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the son of Hendrik Willem van Loon and Elisabeth Johanna Hanken. He immigrated to the United States in 1902 to study at Harvard University and then Cornell University, where he received his AB in 1905. In 1906 he married Eliza Ingersoll Bowditch (1880–1955), daughter of a Harvard professor, by whom he had two sons, Henry Bowditch and Gerard Willem. The newlyweds moved to Germany, where van Loon received his Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1911 with a dissertation that became his first book, &quot;The Fall of the Dutch Republic&quot; (1913). He was a correspondent for the Associated Press during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and again in Belgium in 1914 at the start of World War I. He lectured at Cornell University from 1915 to 1916; in 1919 he became an American citizen. 

Van Loon had two later marriages, to Eliza Helen (Jimmie) Criswell in 1920 and playwright Frances Goodrich Ames in 1927, but after a divorce from Ames he returned to Criswell (it is debatable whether or not they remarried); she inherited his estate in 1944.

Van Loon was a dog lover. His most famous pet was named Mungo, after Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s dog, grew too large to handle and was sent back to Newfoundland where he was adopted as a mascot by Lieut. Nick Robson. Mungo was photographed on base with Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen, and flew onboard missions seeking to bomb Nazi U-boats during World War II.

==Career==

From the 1910s until his death, Van Loon wrote many books, illustrating them himself. Best remembered among these is &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; (1921), a history of the world intended for children, which won the first Newbery Medal in 1922. The book was later updated by Van Loon, then again by his son, and later still by other historians. 

He wrote many popular books aimed at young adults. As a writer he was known for emphasizing crucial historical events and giving a full picture of individual characters, as well as the role of the arts in history. He had an informal and thought-provoking style which, particularly in &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot;, included personal anecdotes. As an illustrator of his own books, he was known for his lively black-and-white drawings and his chronological diagrams. 

In 1923 and 1924, he was a professor of history at Antioch College.

After having revisited Germany many times in the 1920s, he was banned from the country when the Nazis came to power. In the summer of 1938, during an extended visit to Scandinavia, Van Loon met with refugees who had recently fled Nazi Germany and who gave him first-hand accounts of the terror that they had experienced. His book &quot;Our Battle, Being One Man&#x27;s Answer to &quot;My Battle&quot; by Adolf Hitler&quot; (1938) earned him the respect of Franklin D. Roosevelt, in whose 1940 presidential campaign he worked, calling on Americans to fight totalitarianism.

==Honors and distinctions==

Van Loon was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1922 for his book &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot;.

Van Loon was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1942.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>Rutland is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 9,049 at the 2020 census. Rutland is the geographic center of Massachusetts; a tree, the Central Tree, located on Central Tree Road, marks the general spot.

==History==
The town was first settled by Europeans in 1666 and was originally called &quot;Naquag,&quot; a name which came from Nipmuc. Officially incorporated in 1713, the Town of Rutland was made up of Barre, Hubbardston, Oakham, Princeton, and the northern half of Paxton. In Northern Rutland there are prison camps used during the Revolutionary War used for captured Hessian mercenaries hired by the British. The town&#x27;s most famous citizen is Rufus Putnam, who was George Washington&#x27;s chief engineer in the American Revolutionary War. He held various town offices in Rutland and served as Representative to the General Court. Later, he led a group of Revolutionary War veterans west to settle in the Northwest Territory and Putnam became known as the &quot;Father of Ohio.&quot; The Rufus Putnam House still stands, and is now a B&amp;B. It is depicted on the town seal.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.16%, is water.

Rutland is bordered by Princeton on the northeast, Holden on the east, Paxton on the southeast, Oakham on the southwest, and Barre and Hubbardston on the northwest. Rutland has five villages within its limits: New Boston, West Rutland, Muschopauge, North Rutland, and Turkey Hill.

Rutland is approximately northwest of Worcester, west of Boston, and northeast of New York City. Rutland is the highest town between The Berkshires and the Atlantic. The town common is above sea level. Rutland is the geographical center of Massachusetts.

==Demographics==

== Politics ==

Internally, Rutland uses a town meeting style system of governance. As of 2019, the Board of Selectmen is composed of Lyndon S. Nichols, Jeffrey A. Stillings, Mitchell Ruscitti, Leah M. Whiteman, and Leroy &quot;Skip&quot; Clark. Terms for the board of selectmen are staggered.

==Arts and culture==

Each year, Rutland holds a four-day-long Fourth of July celebration, beginning on July 1. Events include performances by area musicians, a lip-sync concert, chicken barbecue hosted by the local Fire Brigade, a Historical Society Lemonade Social, and an acclaimed fireworks show. On the Fourth, Rutland holds a parade with floats made by local organizations and special guests including local and regional politicians.

August also brings in the Central Tree Chowder Chili Challenge, an event hosted and sponsored by the Rutland Fire Brigade. Area restaurants compete for local bragging rights for having the best area clam chowder. With two ways to &quot;win&quot;, restaurants compete for both the people&#x27;s choice as well as the votes of their peers and competitors.

While the main draw to the day is the clam chowder, the event has evolved into a family-oriented day. There is no admission fee except for those who wish to sample the chowder. However, there are also pony rides, face painting, &quot;exotic&quot; animal exhibits, inflatable rooms for kids, a free &quot;train ride&quot; (a lawn tractor towing three cars around the local athletic track), as well as miscellaneous vendors, both local and from surrounding towns. 
Proceeds go to the local Fire Brigade, which uses the money for restoration of the town&#x27;s original fire station, and also to help supplement the expenses of the Fire Department by purchasing much needed equipment that would otherwise have to wait for town funding.

==Education==

Rutland is a part of the Wachusett Regional School District.

There are two elementary schools; Naquag Elementary, which houses grades K through 2nd. The second elementary school is Glenwood Elementary, which contains grades 3rd through 5th.

Naquag Elementary is located on Main Street. As of the 2024-2025 school year, the school has 22 full-time teachers and 344 students.

The middle school in the town is Central Tree Middle School. Central Tree contains grades 6 through 8 and houses 365 students and 25 full-time teachers. The average reading and math proficiency in the school is above the state average with a 53% Reading proficiency and 41% Math proficiency.

The public high schools are Wachusett Regional High School in Holden, and Bay Path Regional Vocational Technical High School in Charlton.

Rutland is also home to the residential treatment facility, Devereux School. Devereux provides educational and psychological services to youth aged 6–21.

===Library===

The Rutland public library was founded . In fiscal year 2008, the town of Rutland spent 1.16% ($159,360) of its budget on its public library—some $20.17 per person, per year ($26.58 adjusted for inflation to 2022).

<doc id="400772" wikidata="Q259567" url="?curid=400772" title="Vivisection">
<text>Vivisection () is surgery conducted for experimental purposes on a living organism, typically animals with a central nervous system, to view living internal structure. The word is, more broadly, used as a pejorative catch-all term for experimentation on live animals by organizations opposed to animal experimentation, but the term is rarely used by practicing scientists. Human vivisection, such as live organ harvesting, has been perpetrated as a form of torture.

==Animal vivisection==
=== Regulations and laws ===

Research requiring vivisection techniques that cannot be met through other means is often subject to an external ethics review in conception and implementation, and in many jurisdictions use of anesthesia is legally mandated for any surgery likely to cause pain to any vertebrate.

In the United States, the Animal Welfare Act explicitly requires that any procedure that may cause pain use &quot;tranquilizers, analgesics, and anesthetics&quot; with exceptions when &quot;scientifically necessary&quot;. The act does not define &quot;scientific necessity&quot; or regulate specific scientific procedures, but approval or rejection of individual techniques in each federally funded lab is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which contains at least one veterinarian, one scientist, one non-scientist, and one other individual from outside the university.

In the United Kingdom, any experiment involving vivisection must be licensed by the Home Secretary. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 &quot;expressly directs that, in determining whether to grant a licence for an experimental project, &#x27;the Secretary of State shall weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue.

In Australia, the Code of Practice &quot;requires that all experiments must be approved by an Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee&quot; that includes a &quot;person with an interest in animal welfare who is not employed by the institution conducting the experiment, and an additional independent person not involved in animal experimentation.&quot;

=== Anti-vivisection movement ===

Anti-vivisectionists have played roles in the emergence of the animal welfare and animal rights movements, arguing that animals and humans have the same natural rights as living creatures, and that it is inherently immoral to inflict pain or injury on another living creature, regardless of the purpose or potential benefit to mankind.

==== 19th century ====
At the turn of the 19th century, medicine was undergoing a transformation. The emergence of hospitals and the development of more advanced medical tools such as the stethoscope are but a few of the changes in the medical field. There was also an increased recognition that medical practices needed to be improved, as many of the current therapeutics were based on unproven, traditional theories that may or may not have helped the patient recover. The demand for more effective treatment shifted emphasis to research with the goal of understanding disease mechanisms and anatomy. This shift had a few effects, one of which was the rise in patient experimentation, leading to some moral questions about what was acceptable in clinical trials and what was not. An easy solution to the moral problem was to use animals in vivisection experiments, so as not to endanger human patients. This, however, had its own set of moral obstacles, leading to the anti-vivisection movement.

===== François Magendie (1783–1855) =====

One polarizing figure in the anti-vivisection movement was François Magendie. Magendie was a physiologist at the Académie Royale de Médecine in France, established in the first half of the 19th century. Magendie made several groundbreaking medical discoveries, but was far more aggressive than some of his contemporaries in the use of animal experimentation. For example, the discovery of the different functionalities of dorsal and ventral spinal nerve roots was achieved by both Magendie, as well as a Scottish anatomist named Charles Bell. Bell used an unconscious rabbit because of &quot;the protracted cruelty of the dissection&quot;, which caused him to miss that the dorsal roots were also responsible for sensory information. Magendie, on the other hand, used conscious, six-week-old puppies for his own experiments. While Magendie&#x27;s approach would today be considered an abuse of animal rights, both Bell and Magendie used the same rationalization for vivisection: the cost of animal experimentation being worth it for the benefit of humanity.

Many viewed Magendie&#x27;s work as cruel and unnecessarily torturous. One note is that Magendie carried out many of his experiments before the advent of anesthesia, but even after ether was discovered it was not used in any of his experiments or classes. Even during the period before anesthesia, other physiologists expressed their disgust with how he conducted his work. One such visiting American physiologist describes the animals as &quot;victims&quot; and the apparent sadism that Magendie displayed when teaching his classes. Magendie&#x27;s experiments were cited in the drafting of the British Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 and Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822, otherwise known as Martin&#x27;s Act. The latter bill&#x27;s namesake, Irish MP and well known anti-cruelty campaigner Richard Martin, called Magendie a &quot;disgrace to Society&quot; and his public vivisections &quot;anatomical theatres&quot; following a prolonged dissection of a greyhound which attracted wide public comment. Magendie faced widespread opposition in British society, among the general public but also his contemporaries, including William Sharpey who described his experiments aside from cruel as &quot;purposeless&quot; and &quot;without sufficient object&quot;, a feeling he claimed was shared among other physiologists.

===== David Ferrier and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 =====

The Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 in Britain determined that one could only conduct vivisection on animals with the appropriate license from the state, and that the work the physiologist was doing had to be original and absolutely necessary. The stage was set for such legislation by physiologist David Ferrier. Ferrier was a pioneer in understanding the brain and used animals to show that certain locales of the brain corresponded to bodily movement elsewhere in the body in 1873. He put these animals to sleep, and caused them to move unconsciously with a probe. Ferrier was successful, but many decried his use of animals in his experiments. Some of these arguments came from a religious standpoint. Some were concerned that Ferrier&#x27;s experiments would separate God from the mind of man in the name of science. Some of the anti-vivisection movement in England had its roots in Evangelicalism and Quakerism. These religions already had a distrust for science, only intensified by the recent publishing of Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Evolution in 1859.

Neither side was pleased with how the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 was passed. The scientific community felt as though the government was restricting their ability to compete with the quickly advancing France and Germany with new regulations. The anti-vivisection movement was also unhappy, but because they believed that it was a concession to scientists for allowing vivisection to continue at all. Ferrier would continue to vex the anti-vivisection movement in Britain with his experiments when he had a debate with his German opponent, Friedrich Goltz. They would effectively enter the vivisection arena, with Ferrier presenting a monkey, and Goltz presenting a dog, both of which had already been operated on. Ferrier won the debate, but did not have a license, leading the anti-vivisection movement to sue him in 1881. Ferrier was not found guilty, as his assistant was the one operating, and his assistant did have a license. Ferrier and his practices gained public support, leaving the anti-vivisection movement scrambling. They made the moral argument that given recent developments, scientists would venture into more extreme practices to operating on &quot;the cripple, the mute, the idiot, the convict, the pauper, to enhance the &#x27;interest&#x27; of [the physiologist&#x27;s] experiments&quot;.

==== 20th century ====
In the early 20th-century the anti-vivisection movement attracted many female supporters associated with women&#x27;s suffrage. The American Anti-Vivisection Society advocated total abolition of vivisection whilst others such as the American Society for the Regulation of Vivisection wanted better regulation subjected to surveillance, not full prohibition. The Research Defence Society made up of an all-male group of physiologists was founded in 1908 to defend vivisection. In the 1920s, anti-vivisectionists exerted significant influence over the editorial decisions of medical journals.

==Human vivisection==
It is possible that human vivisection was practised by some Greek anatomists in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE. Celsus in &quot;De Medicina&quot; states that Herophilos of Alexandria vivisected some criminals sent by the king. The early Christian writer Tertullian states that Herophilos vivisected at least 600 live prisoners, although the accuracy of this claim is disputed by many historians.

In the 12th century CE, Andalusian Arab Ibn Tufail elaborated on human vivisection in his treatise called &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&quot;. In an extensive article on the subject, Iranian academic Nadia Maftouni believes him to be among the early supporters of autopsy and vivisection.

Unit 731, a biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Imperial Japanese Army, undertook lethal human experimentation during the period that comprised both the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Second World War (1937–1945). In the Filipino island of Mindanao, Moro Muslim prisoners of war were subjected to various forms of vivisection by the Japanese, in many cases without anesthesia.

Nazi human experimentation involved many medical experiments on live subjects, such as vivisections by Josef Mengele, usually without anesthesia.

<text>Pater Patriae (plural &quot;Patres Patriae&quot;) was an honorific title in ancient Rome. In Latin, it means &quot;father of the country&quot;, or more literally, &quot;father of the fatherland&quot;.

The title was granted by the Roman Senate. During the Roman Republic, it was given only two times: to Camillus and Cicero. Under the Roman Empire, it was exclusively granted to the Roman emperor, usually after many years of successful rule. Not all emperors were offered the title, while others were offered it but refused to accept. A total of 23 emperors received the title.

During the early modern and late modern periods, the same Latin title was granted to several national leaders by their subjects or parliaments. More recently, the equivalent title has been father of the nation, translated into the national language.

== Roman history ==
The honor of being called &quot;pater patriae&quot; was conferred by the Roman Senate. It was first awarded to Roman general Marcus Furius Camillus in 386 BC, for his role in liberating the city after the Gallic sack of Rome. It reflected the popular view that Camillus was effectively a second founder of the city, after Romulus, who was retrospectively considered to be &quot;pater patriae&quot;.

Three centuries later, it was awarded to the orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero, for his part in the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy in 63 BC. 
A similar title, Parens Patriae, of similar but lesser connotation, was awarded to Julius Caesar, who had become &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Rome as perpetual dictator. Caesar had packed the Senate with his own supporters, who voted him the title in 45 BC for having ended the civil wars that he had started himself.

The Roman Republic was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 BC, and thereafter the title was exclusively held by the emperor. The first emperor, Augustus, was not awarded the title until 2 BC, after several decades of peaceful rule. The title was therefore not considered necessary for the legitimacy of succeeding emperors. Nor did it convey any legal powers. As such, it did not become a regular part of the imperial honors that were routinely conferred on a new emperor.

The title could be declined. According to the historian Suetonius, Augustus&#x27; successor Tiberius was offered this title, but refused it as premature and inappropriate. The following emperor, Caligula, did accept the title, as did his successor Claudius. The next emperor, Nero, declined when it was offered by the Senate during the first year of his reign, on the basis that he was too young for such a title. The Senate offered it again the following year, which Nero accepted.

It thereafter became usual for the Senate to convey the title on emperors only after many years of successful rule. As a result, many emperors with short reigns never received the title. In some cases (such as Nerva) it was granted rapidly, if the new emperor was particularly esteemed by the senators when they acceded. As a sign of humility, several emperors deferred their use of the title for some time even after it was conferred by the Senate. For example, Hadrian deferred it for eleven years.

The title fell out of use in the fourth century AD, during the Christianisation of the empire. The last emperor known to have used the title was Julian, who was also the last pagan emperor.

== Chronological list of holders ==

== Later use by other countries ==

The Latin honorific was later used for several national leaders during the early modern period and late modern period. It was awarded by national parliaments or loyal subjects to: George Washington, the first President of the United States; King Gustav I of Sweden; the Dutch Stadtholder William of Orange; Pedro II, the last Emperor of Brazil; and the four leaders of Italian unification: Camillo Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini and King Victor Emmanuel II.

The Latin title has since fallen into disuse, being replaced by the title father of the nation translated into each the relevant national language.

<doc id="400776" wikidata="Q1635930" url="?curid=400776" title="Propaganda of the deed">
<text>Propaganda of the deed, or propaganda by the deed, is a type of direct action intended to influence public opinion. The action itself is meant to serve as an example for others to follow, acting as a catalyst for social revolution.

It is primarily associated with acts of violence perpetrated by proponents of insurrectionary anarchism in the late 19th and early 20th century, including bombings and assassinations aimed at the state, the ruling class in a spirit of anti-capitalism, and church arsons targeting religious groups, even though propaganda of the deed also had non-violent applications. These acts of terrorism were intended to ignite a &quot;spirit of revolt&quot; by demonstrating the state, the middle and upper classes, and religious organizations were not omnipotent as well as to provoke the State to become escalatingly repressive in its response. The 1881 London Social Revolutionary Congress gave the tactic its approval.

==Theoretical development==
===Formulation===
The foundations of propaganda of the deed were first laid in the early 19th century, when members of the student counterculture began to call for revolutionary action. An early invocation of propaganda by the deed () was first outlined by the Italian socialist Carlo Pisacane in 1857. Pisacane rejected &quot;propaganda of the idea&quot;, as he believed that &quot;ideas result from deeds&quot; and that &quot;people will not be free when they are educated, but educated when they are free.&quot; To Pisacane, all citizens of a country ought to cooperate with social revolution; he specified conspiracies and assassination attempts as examples of ways citizens could contribute to a social revolution. The theory of propaganda by the deed was formalised in 1869 by the Russian revolutionaries Mikhail Bakunin and Sergey Nechayev, who favoured insurrectionary direct action over &quot;pointless propaganda&quot; which had no basis in reality. In August 1870, Bakunin called for revolutionaries to put their ideas into practice, propagating revolutionary principles through deeds, rather than words. He believed that revolutionary actors ought to focus on acts of destruction, which he considered a necessary prelude to any social revolution. 

===Elaboration by Italian anarchists===

In the wake of the suppression of the Paris Commune and rising political repression against the left-wing, during the 1870s, many European anarchists became impatient with gradualist methods such as education and industrial action. They instead turned towards propaganda by the deed, which they saw as a means to accelerate social change and bring about a revolution. When Italian activists such as Carlo Cafiero, Andrea Costa and Errico Malatesta joined the nascent anarchist movement, they organised political demonstrations and strike actions, with the aim of inciting an uprising that would escalate into a generalised insurrection. In 1874, Costa and Malatesta planned an insurrection in Bologna, but they were arrested by the &quot;Carabinieri&quot; before they made it to the city.

After the defeat of the Bologna insurrection, Cafiero and Malatesta adopted the doctrine of propaganda by the deed. They believed that symbolic actions could drive workers and peasants towards revolution, and encouraged members of the international anarchist movement to engage in violent action. At the 1876 Bern Congress of the Anti-authoritarian International, Malatesta argued that revolutions were driven by deeds, not words. He proposed that, every time class conflict erupted, revolutionary socialists were obliged to extend their support to the workers&#x27; movement. Among the people convinced by Malatesta&#x27;s arguments was the French anarchist Paul Brousse, who became a leading proponent of propaganda of the deed, causing conflict between him and the moderate James Guillaume. Brousse called for workers to seize the means of production, peasants to occupy agricultural land, and for people to rise up in insurrection and establish a free association of producers.

Three months after the Bern Congress, Malatesta and Cafiero sought to define propaganda of the deed in the Jura Federation&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin&quot;; they declared that actions which affirmed socialist principles were the most effective form of propaganda. At a subsequent national congress of Italian anarchists, held in Florence, Cafiero and Malatesta passed a resolution confirming the insurrectionary character of the Italian anarchist movement. A series of actions affirming propaganda by the deed were carried out over the subsequent years. On 18 March 1877, the sixth anniversary of the Paris Commune, Paul Brousse led a political demonstration in which he carried a red flag through the streets of Bern; he saw this as an act of propaganda of the deed, through which he aimed to raise class consciousness. In April 1877, Cafiero and Malatesta carried out another insurrection in the southern province of Benevento, hoping to incite a revolution through propaganda by the deed. After putting two small villages under an armed occupation, they burned tax registers and proclaimed the overthrow of the Kingdom of Italy. Despite being welcomed by local peasants, they did not receive their active support, so the insurrection was quickly suppressed. Cafiero and Malatesta were driven into exile, the Anti-authoritarian International was banned in Italy and its former members turned to acts of terrorism; in 1878, the new King Umberto I survived a stabbing by an Italian anarchist.

===International debates===
During the late 1870s, debates over propaganda of the deed intensified. These discussions sought to analyse the relationship between individual actions and wider society, as symbolic rebellious acts were intended to trigger a generalised revolution. Debates were also had over whether propaganda by the deed was supplementary to educational work or if it was intended as a replacement for the written and spoken word. In August 1877, Brousse wrote an article for the Jura Federation&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin&quot;, in which he proposed that propaganda of the deed was intended to set an example, educate people and incite further action. Cafiero himself proposed that revolutionary ends justified any means. In an article published in &quot;Le Révolté&quot; in December 1880, he called for anarchists to use any means necessary to incite permanent revolution, whether it be by writing and public speaking, by violent attacks, or by voting. Cafiero&#x27;s remarks in &quot;Le Révolté&quot; led to a wider debate within the anarchist movement on issues of strategy and the use of violence. At the time, propaganda by the deed was defined as any act of rebellion against the existing system, even those that were not carried out to gain support for the anarchist movement; it did not yet have the inherent implication of violence that it would later assume.

While the Italian anarchists advocated for propaganda of the deed, other anarchists, including the Russian &quot;narodnik&quot; Peter Kropotkin, continued to advocate for education. Kropotkin believed that small groups of revolutionaries should enter into larger workers&#x27; organisations, particularly trade unions, and agitate for social revolution. He was ambivalent towards revolutionary violence, rejecting Bakunin&#x27;s conspiratorial methods and preferring methods of peaceful propaganda. However, he was not outright opposed to violent actions, so long as they were carried out as part of a larger revolutionary movement, had a clear purpose and were directed against a specific oppressive structure. He refused to condemn anarchists that engaged in terrorism, emphasising state terrorism as a motivating factor in all acts of individual terrorism. Although he was also personally repulsed by violence, he believed it to be necessary in some cases, so long as they were directed against economic forces and not individual targets. Kropotkin personally objected to Cafiero&#x27;s definition of propaganda by the deed and preferred not to use the term.
By the turn of the 1880s, the French ecologist Élisée Reclus was advocating for propaganda by the deed, although he personally preferred propaganda by the word. Reclus believed that any revolt against oppression was inherently good and that the means were inherently neutral. He considered individual terrorism acceptable if it weakened the state, declaring that &quot;all revolutionary acts are, by their very nature, essentially anarchical, whatever the power which seeks to profit from them&quot;. Meanwhile, in the United States, the German anarchist Johann Most became a fervent promoter of propaganda by the deed, which he believed could raise the class consciousness of the American working class. He toured the country giving speeches inciting revolutionary violence against Wall Street and the capitalist ruling class, during which he gained notoriety for claiming that every criminal was an anarchist. Most learned how to make bombs while working at an explosives factory and published a pamphlet detailing how to manufacture various kinds of bombs. He also believed that revolutionary ends justified any means, including assassinations against individual targets, which he considered a valid method to remove oppressive officials. Although Most himself never acted according to his own espoused doctrine, he inspired many revolutionaries to carry out propaganda by the deed. For a time he was considered the most dangerous man in America, a characterisation he delighted in, although he would distance himself from his advocacy of violence after the Haymarket affair.

== Later debates ==
State repression (including the infamous 1894 French &quot;lois scélérates&quot;) of the anarchist and labor movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many &quot;communards&quot; to penal colonies, favored individualist political expression and acts.

Later anarchist authors advocating &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; included the German anarchist Gustav Landauer, and the Italians Errico Malatesta and Luigi Galleani. For Gustav Landauer, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society.
The anarchist Luigi Galleani, perhaps the most vocal proponent of &quot;propaganda by the deed&quot; from the turn of the century through the end of the First World War, took undisguised pride in describing himself as a subversive, a revolutionary propagandist and advocate of the violent overthrow of established government and institutions through the use of &quot;direct action,&quot; i.e., bombings and assassinations. Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only against symbols of the government and the capitalist system, such as courthouses and factories, but also through direct assassination of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;: capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and policemen. He had a particular interest in the use of bombs, going so far as to include a formula for the explosive nitroglycerine in one of his pamphlets advertised through his monthly magazine, &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;. By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and advocate of his policy of violent action, attracting a number of devoted Italian-American anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanisti. Carlo Buda, the brother of Galleanist bombmaker Mario Buda, said of him, &quot;You heard Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you saw.&quot;

===Relationship to revolution===
Propaganda of the deed thus included stealing (in particular bank robberies – named &quot;expropriations&quot; or &quot;revolutionary expropriations&quot; to finance political activity), rioting and general strikes which aimed at creating the conditions of an insurrection or even a revolution. These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression. 

As early as 1911, Leon Trotsky condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. &quot;The anarchist prophets of the &#x27;propaganda by the deed&#x27; can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses,&quot; he wrote in 1911, &quot;Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise.&quot; Vladimir Lenin largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination to serve as a catalyst for revolution, but they distinguished between the &quot;ad hoc&quot; bombings and assassinations carried out by proponents of the propaganda of the deed and organized violence coordinated by a professional revolutionary vanguard utilized for that specific end.

== Notable actions ==
This timeline lists some significant actions that have been described as &quot;Propaganda of the deed&quot; since the 19th century.
* 17 February 1880 – Stepan Khalturin successfully blows up part of the Winter Palace in an attempt to assassinate Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Although the Tsar escapes unharmed, eight soldiers are killed and 45 wounded. Referring to the 1862 invention of dynamite, historian Benedict Anderson observed that with the attack on the Winter Palace, &quot;Nobel&#x27;s invention had now arrived politically.&quot; Khalturin is hanged on the orders of Alexander&#x27;s son and successor, Alexander III, in 1882, after the assassination of a police official.
*  – Tsar Alexander II of Russia is killed in a bomb blast by Narodnaya Volya.
* 23 July 1892 – Alexander Berkman tries to kill American industrialist Henry Clay Frick in retaliation for the hiring of Pinkerton detectives to break up the Homestead Strike, resulting in the deaths of seven striking members of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. Although badly wounded, Frick survives, and Berkman is arrested and eventually sentenced to 22 years in prison.

* 7 November 1893 – The Spanish anarchist Santiago Salvador throws two Orsini bombs into the orchestra pit of the Liceu Theater in Barcelona during the second act of the opera &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, killing some twenty people and injuring scores of others.
* 9 December 1893 – Auguste Vaillant throws a nail bomb in the French National Assembly, injuring one. He is then sentenced to death and executed by the guillotine on 4 February 1894, shouting &quot;Death to bourgeois society and long live anarchy!&quot; (&quot;À mort la société bourgeoise et vive l&#x27;anarchie!&quot;). During his trial, Vaillant declares that he had not intended to kill anybody but only to injure several deputies in retaliation against the execution of the anarchist Ravachol, who was executed for four bombings.
* 12 February 1894 – Émile Henry, intending to avenge Auguste Vaillant, sets off a bomb in Café Terminus (a café near the Gare Saint-Lazare train station in Paris), killing one and injuring twenty. During his trial, when asked why he wanted to harm so many innocent people, he declares, &quot;There is no innocent bourgeois.&quot; This act is one of the rare exceptions to the rule that propaganda of the deed targets only specific powerful individuals. Henry is convicted and executed by guillotine on 21 May.

<text>In economics, hot money is the flow of funds (or capital) from one country to another in order to earn a short-term profit on interest rate differences and/or anticipated exchange rate shifts. These speculative capital flows are called &quot;hot money&quot; because they can move very quickly in and out of markets, potentially leading to market instability.

==Illustration of hot money flows==
The following simple example illustrates the phenomenon of hot money: In the beginning of 2011, the national average rate of one year certificate of deposit in the United States is 0.95%. In contrast, China&#x27;s benchmark one year deposit rate is 3%. The Chinese currency (renminbi) is seriously undervalued against the world&#x27;s major trading currencies and therefore is likely to appreciate against the US dollar in the coming years. Given this situation, if an investor in the US deposits his or her money in a Chinese bank, the investor would get a higher return than if he or she deposits money in a US bank. This makes China a prime target for hot money inflows. This is just an example for illustration. In reality, hot money takes many different forms of investment.
The following description may help further illustrate this phenomenon: &quot;One country or sector in the world economy experiences a financial crisis; capital flows out in a panic; investors seek a more attractive destination for their money. In the next destination, capital inflows create a boom that is accompanied by rising indebtedness, rising asset prices and booming consumption - for a time. But all too often, these capital inflows are followed by another crisis. Some commentators describe these patterns of capital flow as &#x27;hot money&#x27; that flows from one sector or country to the next and leaves behind a trail of destruction.&quot;

==Types of hot money==
As mentioned above, capital in the following form could be considered hot money:
* Short-term foreign portfolio investments, including investments in equities, bonds and financial derivatives
* Short-term foreign bank loans
* Foreign bank loans with short-term investment horizon
The types of capital in the above categories share common characteristics: the investment horizon is short, and they can come in quickly and leave quickly.

== Estimates of total value ==
There is no well-defined method for estimating the amount of hot money flowing into a country during a period of time, because hot money flows quickly and is poorly monitored. In addition, once an estimate is made, the amount of hot money may suddenly rise or fall, depending on the economic conditions driving the flow of funds. One common way of approximating the flow of hot money is to subtract a nation&#x27;s trade surplus (or deficit) and its net flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) from the change in the nation&#x27;s foreign reserves.

Hot money (approx) = Change in foreign exchange reserves - Net exports - Net foreign direct investment

== Sources and causes ==

Hot money usually originates from the capital-rich, developed countries that have lower GDP growth rate and lower interest rates compared to the GDP growth rate and interest rate of emerging market economies such as India, Brazil, China, Turkey, Malaysia etc. Although the specific causes of hot money flow are somewhat different from period to period, generally, the following could be considered as the causes of hot money flow: 
* a sustained decline of interest rates in the highly industrialized, developed countries. The lower interest rates in the developed nations attract investors to the high investment yields and improving economic prospects in Asia and Latin America.
* a general trend towards international diversification of investments in major financial centers and towards growing integration of world capital markets.
* Emerging market countries began to adopt sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as market-oriented reforms including trade and capital market liberalization. Such policy reforms, among others, have resulted in a credible increase in the rate of return on investments.

As described above, hot money can be in different forms. Hedge funds, other portfolio investment funds and international borrowing of domestic financial institutions are generally considered as the vehicles of hot money. In the 1997 East Asian Financial Crisis and in the 1998 Russian Financial Crisis, the hot money chiefly came from banks, not portfolio investors.

== Impact==

Capital flows can increase welfare by enabling households to smooth out their consumption over time and achieve a higher level of consumption. Capital flows can help developed countries achieve a better international diversification of their portfolios.

However, large and sudden inflows of capital with a short-term investment horizon have negative macroeconomic effects, including rapid monetary expansion, inflationary pressures, real exchange rate appreciation and widening current account deficits. Especially, when capital flows in volume into small and shallow local financial markets, the exchange rate tends to appreciate, asset prices rally and local commodity prices boom. These favorable asset price movements improve national fiscal indicators and encourage domestic credit expansion. These, in turn, exacerbate structural weakness in the domestic bank sector. When global investors&#x27; sentiment on emerging markets shift, the flows reverse and asset prices give back their gains, often forcing a painful adjustment on the economy.

The following are the details of the dangers that hot money presents to the receiving country&#x27;s economy:

* Inflow of massive capital with short investment horizon (hot money) could cause asset prices to rally and inflation to rise. The sudden inflow of large amounts of foreign money would increase the monetary base of the receiving country (if the central bank is pegging the currency), which would help create a credit boom. This, in turn, would result in such a situation in which &quot;too much money chases too few goods&quot;. The consequences of this would be inflation.

Furthermore, hot money could lead to exchange rate appreciation or even cause exchange rate overshooting. And if this exchange rate appreciation persists, it would hurt the competitiveness of the respective country&#x27;s export sector by making the country&#x27;s exports more expensive compared to similar foreign goods and services.

* Sudden outflow of hot money, which would always happen, would deflate asset prices and could cause the collapse value of the currency of respective country. This is especially so in countries with relatively scarce internationally liquid assets. There is growing agreement that this was the case in the 1997 East Asian Financial Crisis. In the run-up to the crises, firms and private firms in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia accumulated large amounts of short-term foreign debt (a type of hot money). The three countries shared a common characteristic of having large ratio of short term foreign debt to international reserves. When the capital started to flow out, it caused a collapse in asset prices and exchange rates. The financial panic fed on itself, causing foreign creditors to call in loans and depositors to withdraw funds from banks. All of these magnified the illiquidity of the domestic financial system and forced yet another round of costly asset liquidations and price deflation. In all of the three countries, the domestic financial institutions came to the brink of default on their external short term obligations.

However, some economists and financial experts argue that hot money could also play positive role in countries that have relatively low level of foreign exchange reserves, because the capital inflow may present a useful opportunity for those countries to augment their central banks&#x27; reserve holdings.

== Control ==
Generally speaking, given their relatively high interest rates compared with that of the developed market economies, emerging market economies are the destination of hot money. Although the emerging market countries welcome capital inflows such as foreign direct investment, because of hot money&#x27;s negative effects on the economy, they are instituting policies to stop hot money from coming into their country in order to eliminate the negative consequences.

Different countries are using different methods to prevent massive influx of hot money. The following are the main methods of dealing with hot money.

* Exchange rate appreciation: the exchange rate can be used as a tool to control the inflow of hot money. If the currency is believed to be undervalued, that would be a cause of hot money inflow. In such circumstance, economists usually suggest a significant one-off appreciation rather than a gradual move in the exchange rate, as a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate would attract even more hot money into the country. One downside of this approach is that exchange rate appreciation would reduce the competitiveness of the export sector.
* Interest rate reduction: countries that adopt this policy would lower their central bank&#x27;s benchmark interest rates to reduce the incentive for inflow. For example, on December 16, 2010, the Turkish Central Bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates at a time of rising inflation and relatively high economic growth. Erdem Basci, deputy bank governor of Turkish Central Bank argued that gradual rate cuts were the best way to prevent excessive capital inflows fuelling asset bubbles and currency appreciation. On February 14, 2011, Mehmet Simsek, the Turkish Finance Minister said: &quot;more than $8 billion in short-term investment had exited the country after the central bank cut rates and took steps to slow credit growth. The markets have got the message that Turkey does not want hot money inflows.&quot;
* Capital controls: some capital control policies adopted by China belong to this category. For example, in China, the government does not allow foreign funds to invest directly in its capital market. Also, the central bank of China sets quotas for its domestic financial institutions for the use of short-term foreign debt and prevent banks from overusing their quotas. In June 1991, the Chilean government instituted a non-remunerated (non-paid) 20 percent reserve requirement to be deposited at the Central Bank for a period of one year for liabilities in foreign currency, for firms which are borrowing directly in foreign currency.
* Increasing bank reserve requirements and sterilization: some countries pursue a fixed exchange rate policy. In the face of large net capital inflow, those countries would intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent exchange rate appreciation. Then sterilize the monetary impact of intervention through open market operations and through increasing bank reserves requirements. For example, when hot money originated from the U.S. enters China, investors would sell US dollars and buy Chinese yuan in the foreign exchange market. This would put upward pressure on the value of the yuan. In order to prevent the appreciation of the Chinese currency, the central bank of China print yuan to buy US dollars. This would increase money supply in China, which would in turn cause inflation. Then, the central bank of China has to increase bank reserve requirements or issue Chinese government bonds to bring back the money that it has previously released into the market in the exchange rate intervention operation. However, like other approaches, this approach has limitations. The first, the central bank can&#x27;t keep increasing bank reserves, because doing so would negatively affect bank&#x27;s profitability. The second, in the emerging market economies, the domestic financial market is not deep enough for open market operations to be effective.
* Fiscal tightening: the idea is to use fiscal restraint, especially in the form of spending cuts on nontradables, so as to lower aggregate demand and curb the inflationary impact of capital inflow.

<text>Esther Elizabeth Rolle (November 8, 1920 – November 17, 1998) was an American actress. She is best known for her role as Florida Evans, on the CBS television sitcom &quot;Maude,&quot; for two seasons (1972–1974), and its spin-off series &quot;Good Times&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1976. In 1979, Rolle won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Special for the television film &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;.

==Early life==
Esther Rolle was born on November 8, 1920, in Pompano Beach, Florida to Bahamian immigrants Jonathan Rolle (1883–1953), a farmer, and Elizabeth Iris Rolle (née Dames; 1887–1947). Her parents were both born and raised in Nassau, New Providence, The Bahamas and moved to Florida some time after their marriage. She was the tenth of 18 children (children who included siblings and fellow actresses Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter). Rolle graduated from Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach. She initially studied at Spelman College in Atlanta, before moving to New York City. While in New York, she attended Hunter College before transferring to The New School and then Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. For many years, Rolle worked in a traditional day job in New York City&#x27;s garment district.

==Career==
===Dance and theater===
Rolle was a member of Asadata Dafora&#x27;s dance troupe, Shogolo Oloba (later renamed the Federal Theater African Dance Troupe). She became the troupe&#x27;s director in 1960. Rolle&#x27;s earliest roles were on the stage; her New York stage debut was in the 1962 play &quot;The Blacks&quot;. She was often cast in plays produced by Robert Hooks and the Negro Ensemble Company. She also appeared in productions of &quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;Blues for Mr. Charlie&quot;. Rolle&#x27;s most prominent early role was as Miss Maybell in the Melvin Van Peebles 1972 Broadway musical &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap&quot;, and its subsequent 1973 film adaptation. In 1977, Rolle portrayed Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles&#x27; Haitian-influenced version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Henry Street New Federal Theater in Manhattan.

===Television===
Rolle is best known for her television role as Florida Evans, the character she played on two 1970s sitcoms. The character was introduced as Maude Findlay&#x27;s housekeeper on &quot;Maude&quot;, and was spun off in the show&#x27;s second season into &quot;Good Times&quot;, a show about Florida&#x27;s family. Rolle was nominated in 1975 for the Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy Golden Globe Award for her role in &quot;Good Times&quot;. Rolle was 19 years older than the actor (John Amos) who played her husband James (named Henry on &quot;Maude&quot;) Evans. The James Evans character was only added after Rolle fought hard for a father figure and husband to be added to the show. Rolle had fought for the father character on the show, more relevant themes and scripts and was unhappy with the success of Jimmie Walker&#x27;s character, J.J. Evans, which she believed took the show in a frivolous direction. John Amos agreed with Rolle about Walker&#x27;s character and was fired from the show after the third season ended. Later on, in a stand-off with &quot;Good Times&quot; producer Norman Lear, Rolle also quit when her contract ended. Although the show continued without her for the fifth season, she returned for the show&#x27;s final season. In 1979 she won an Emmy for her role in &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;, a made-for-television movie.

Among her guest-starring roles was one on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot;, in which she played a taxicab business owner. In the 1990s, Rolle was a surprise guest on RuPaul&#x27;s VH-1 talk show. Her &quot;Maude&quot; co-star Bea Arthur was the guest, and Rolle was brought out to surprise Arthur. The two had not seen each other in years, Arthur said, and embraced warmly. Rolle also appeared in a series of psychic hotline TV commercials in the 1990s. &quot;Tell them Esther sent you,&quot; was her trademark line.

===Music and film===
Rolle released an album of music titled &quot;The Garden of My Mind&quot; in 1975. Rolle&#x27;s first screen appearance is a small, uncredited role in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962), and she later appeared in Gordon Parks&#x27; &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; (1969). Her sister, actress Estelle Evans, appeared in both films as well. Esther Rolle appeared early in her career in the film &quot;Nothing But a Man&quot; (1964). After &quot;Good Times&quot; ended, she appeared in a number of made-for-television movies as well as films, including &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; and &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot;. A memorable role was that of Aunt Sarah in the film &quot;Rosewood&quot; (1997). She had a major role in &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; based on Maya Angelou&#x27;s memoir of the same name, and has the distinction of having won the first Emmy Award for the category Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, in 1979, for her work in the television movie &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;. She is also credited for her role in the film &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; (1989), starring Denzel Washington and Sheryl Lee Ralph, and featuring Robert Townsend. Her last film, &quot;Train Ride&quot;, was released in 2000 despite being filmed in 1998.

==Personal life==

Rolle was married to Oscar Robinson from 1955 until their divorce in 1975. She had no children, but did have one ex-stepdaughter, Sherley Mae Robinson (born 1936), from Oscar&#x27;s previous marriage.

==Death==
Rolle died on November 17, 1998, in Culver City, California, from complications of diabetes, at the age of 78. A devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Rolle requested that her funeral be held at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in her hometown of Pompano Beach, Florida. 

She is buried in Westview Community Cemetery in Pompano Beach. The cemetery is a historically black burial ground created in 1952, a time when the laws and customs of Florida did not permit white people and black people to be buried in the same cemetery.

==Legacy==
===Collection of Esther Rolle&#x27;s personal works===
Rolle&#x27;s family donated over 100 items of hers to the African-American Research Library and Cultural Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The collection includes gowns, a black Raggedy Andy doll she endorsed, a recording of poems recited by Rolle, and awards such as the 1974 NAACP Eighth Image Award for Best Actress in a Series and her 1979 Emmy for her role in &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;.

<doc id="400797" wikidata="Q1313063" url="?curid=400797" title="Happy Gilmore">
<text>Happy Gilmore is a 1996 American sports comedy film directed by Dennis Dugan, produced by Robert Simonds, and starring Adam Sandler in the title role, Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay and Carl Weathers.

The film follows the namesake failed ice hockey player who seeks to gather enough money to stop the foreclosure of his grandmother&#x27;s house. Happy discovers a talent for golf and competes in paid tournaments, causing upset in the golf community as he gains a following for his skill and unconventional behavior.

The screenplay was written by Sandler and his writing partner Tim Herlihy, in their second feature collaboration after the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Billy Madison&quot;. The film also marks the first of several collaborations between Sandler and Dugan.

&quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; was released in theaters on February 16, 1996, by Universal Pictures. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a commercial success, earning $41.2 million on a $12 million budget, and it won an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight for Sandler and Bob Barker. A sequel is set for release in 2025.

==Plot==

Happy Gilmore dreams of becoming an ice hockey player, but despite a powerful slapshot learned from his late father, his poor skating skills and short temper limit his professional prospects. One day, Happy learns that his grandmother, who raised him after his father&#x27;s death, owes the IRS $270,000 in back taxes; she has 90 days to pay off the debt or face foreclosure on her house. Happy sends Grandma to a retirement home until he can figure out a way to pay off the debt; unbeknownst to Happy, the residents are mistreated and forced to work in a sweatshop.

While challenging a pair of movers repossessing his grandfather&#x27;s old golf clubs, Happy discovers that his unorthodox slapshot-style swing can drive a ball 400 yards. He begins hustling golfers at a driving range, where he meets Chubbs Peterson, a former pro golf star who lost a hand in an alligator attack. Chubbs urges Happy to enter the Waterbury Open, the winner of which will earn an automatic spot on the PGA Tour, as well as a sizable cash reward. Desperate to reclaim his grandmother&#x27;s house, Happy agrees, and wins the Open. Learning that he needs to supply his own caddy on the tour, Happy hastily hires a homeless man named Otto.

Happy quickly becomes a fan favorite thanks to his extraordinarily long drives and unorthodox antics. Though his driving is incredible, Happy&#x27;s putting is terrible, and his on-course profane meltdowns and lack of golf etiquette soon draw the ire of tour officials. Citing improved television ratings with a broader spectrum of viewers, higher attendance, and new sponsorship offers, tour public relations head Virginia Venit intervenes on Happy&#x27;s behalf and promises to help him with his anger. With Virginia&#x27;s support, Happy improves his performance and behavior, and the two form a romantic connection.

Shooter McGavin, the tour&#x27;s arrogant presumed favorite, views Happy as a threat, and bribes a heckler named Donald to taunt him at a pro-am event. The heckling causes Happy to play poorly, and a subsequent fistfight with his celebrity partner Bob Barker leads to a $25,000 fine and one-month suspension. Virginia secures Happy a lucrative endorsement deal with Subway to make up for the lost revenue, giving Happy the $270,000 he needs to pay Grandma&#x27;s taxes. However, he is too late to stop the house from being put up for auction, and Shooter spitefully outbids Happy in an attempt to force him to quit the tour. Virginia encourages Happy not to quit, and he makes a deal with Shooter: if Happy wins the Tour Championship, Shooter will return the house to Grandma, but if Shooter wins, Happy will quit golf.

Knowing he must improve his short game to defeat Shooter, Happy seeks out Chubbs, who helps Happy improve his putting by practicing at a miniature golf course and gifts him with a custom putter in the shape of a hockey stick. As thanks, Happy presents Chubbs with the head of the alligator that took his hand, startling him and causing him to fall out of a nearby window to his death.

Happy is paired with Shooter for the Tour Championship, where he takes an early lead. Desperate to finally win a Championship jacket, Shooter again bribes Donald, who drives a car onto the course and runs over Happy, impairing his long-drive ability and focus. Shooter takes the lead, but Happy, encouraged by Grandma, rallies to tie him.

On the 18th and final hole, Shooter&#x27;s tee shot lands in the crowd, but, despite having to play the ball off the foot of Happy&#x27;s imposing ex-boss, Mr. Larson, he manages to save par with a long putt. A television tower damaged by Donald&#x27;s car falls onto the green and blocks Happy&#x27;s line to a winning putt. Shooter insists Happy play the ball &quot;as it lies,&quot; and, with Chubbs&#x27; divine intervention, Happy uses the tower as a Rube Goldberg machine to sink his putt for the win. Enraged, Shooter tries to steal Happy&#x27;s gold jacket and is chased and beaten by a mob of fans led by Larson. Back at Grandma&#x27;s house, Happy celebrates with Virginia, Grandma, and Otto. Happy sees a vision of Abraham Lincoln, along with a two-handed Chubbs; having made peace with the alligator, waving to him in the heavens above.

==Cast==
Additionally, Ben Stiller is uncredited for his role as abusive orderly Hal. Robert Smigel plays the IRS agent who informs Happy that Grandma is delinquent on taxes, and Will Sasso and Dee Jay Jackson appear as the movers who challenge Happy at golf.

Jared Van Snellenberg portrays Happy Gilmore&#x27;s caddy at the Waterbury Open and Kevin Nealon plays Gary Potter, an eccentric professional golfer and Happy&#x27;s partner at the AT&amp;T Open. Professional golfers Lee Trevino and Mark Lye, sportscaster Verne Lundquist, and game show host Bob Barker all play themselves.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; was directed by Dennis Dugan, and written by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) alumni Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler. Herlihy and Sandler were roommates in college and wrote stand-up comedy together, before moving on to screenplays. After Sandler was fired from &quot;SNL&quot; in 1995, he moved on to films. He and Herlihy wrote &quot;Billy Madison&quot; (1995), which proved successful for distributor Universal Pictures. As such, Herlihy and Sandler began a new project. In an office during a brainstorming session, they came up with a high-concept premise for a film about a &quot;hockey player who smacks a 400 yard drive&quot;. Judd Apatow performed a script rewrite, although he went uncredited.

The Happy Gilmore character is loosely based on Sandler&#x27;s childhood friend Kyle McDonough, who played ice hockey and would golf with Sandler as they grew up. Sandler could never hit the ball as far as McDonough, and figured that McDonough&#x27;s hockey skills gave him an edge. Meanwhile, Chubbs Peterson&#x27;s missing hand is an in-joke referencing actor Carl Weathers&#x27; film &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), which depicts his character losing his arm. Herlihy and Sandler included any joke that made them laugh and do not remember who came up with which, although Herlihy takes credit for Shooter McGavin&#x27;s &quot;I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast&quot; line. In a 1994 interview, Sandler cited the golf comedy &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980), a film he and Herlihy bonded over in college, as inspiration.

Former pro golfer Mark Lye served as a consultant on the script, and told Herlihy and Sandler after seeing their initial ideas, &quot;You gotta be crazy. You cannot do a movie like that.&quot; According to Lye, the initial drafts featured Happy winning the Masters Tournament: &quot;They had the green jacket. They were desecrating the USGA. Making fun of Augusta National.&quot; He suggested that Happy win a fictional tournament, and Herlihy and Sandler changed the jacket&#x27;s color from green to gold. Lye also disliked the unrealistic nature of early drafts, which depicted Happy repeatedly making 400-yard drives, so he took the crew to a PGA Tour event so they could understand the atmosphere of golf. The final script, the one Lye gave approval, was Herlihy and Sandler&#x27;s fifth draft.

Dugan became attached to direct through Sandler. Years earlier, Dugan had attempted to cast Sandler in one of his films, but the producers did not let him because Sandler was not well-known. &quot;A couple of years later, [Sandler] is big&quot;, Dugan said. &quot;I wanted to be hired to direct &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; with him. I walk in the room, and he says: &#x27;You&#x27;re the guy who wanted to give me that part. I don&#x27;t need to know anything else, I want to work with you.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; was produced on a budget of $12 million and filmed entirely at locations in British Columbia. Most scenes taking place at golf courses were filmed at Pitt Meadows at the Swan-e-set Bay Resort &amp; Country Club, while interior shots, such as those in the broadcast booth, took place in an abandoned Vancouver hospital. Arthur Albert served as cinematographer, while Mark Lane was the set decorator. Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh composed the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

===Casting===
Christopher McDonald declined the role of Shooter McGavin twice because he was tired of playing villains and wanted to spend more time with his family. Kevin Costner was approached but turned it down in favor of another 1996 golf-themed comedy, &quot;Tin Cup&quot;, while Bruce Campbell lobbied hard for the part. McDonald became interested in the role after winning a round of golf, and decided to take it after he met with Sandler. According to McDonald, Dugan &quot;didn&#x27;t want to see the Bad Guy 101 again&quot; and gave McDonald the freedom to improvise on set.

&quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; features appearances from Richard Kiel, known for playing Jaws in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series; Bob Barker, the host of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;; and Verne Lundquist, a golf sportscaster.

According to Lundquist, he filmed his scenes in the abandoned hospital as production wrapped. Sandler&#x27;s New York University roommate Jack Giarraputo sat next to Lundquist in every shot, as Sandler wanted him to appear in the film. In 2016, Lundquist stated he still gets a monthly $34 check from the Screen Actors Guild for his appearance in the film.

According to Sandler, Ed McMahon was originally hired to do the fight scene instead of Bob Barker, but McMahon changed his mind when he learned about the movie&#x27;s crude humor and didn&#x27;t want to lose the fight, so Bob Barker was chosen because Chuck Norris was Barker&#x27;s neighbor and taught him karate and Sandler rewrote the script to make Barker win the fight.

===Filming===
Filming took place from July 6 to September 1, 1995, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; was a commercial success, ranking number two at the U.S. box office on its debut weekend with $8.5 million in revenue, behind &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. The film was made for $12 million and grossed a total of $41.2 million worldwide, with $38.8 million of that at the North American domestic box office.

=== Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; has an approval rating of 62% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Those who enjoy Adam Sandler&#x27;s schtick will find plenty to love in this gleefully juvenile take on professional golf; those who don&#x27;t, however, will find it unfunny and forgettable.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The general tone nevertheless makes it difficult to elevate the gags beyond an occasional chuckle&quot;. Lowry only noted a few scenes he found inspired, including the fight scene with Bob Barker and when Happy attempts to find his &quot;Happy Place&quot; which was described as &quot;Felliniesque&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, stating that Adam Sandler&#x27;s character &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a pleasing personality: He seems angry even when he&#x27;s not supposed to be, and his habit of pounding everyone he dislikes is tiring in a PG-13 movie&quot;. Ebert also noted the film&#x27;s product placement stating that he &quot;probably missed a few, but I counted Diet Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Subway, Budweiser (in bottles, cans, and Bud-dispensing helmets), Michelob, Visa cards, Bell Atlantic, AT&amp;T, Sizzler, Red Lobster, Wilson, &quot;Golf Digest&quot;, the ESPN sports network, and Top-Flite golf balls&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade &quot;D+&quot; calling it &quot;A one-joke &quot;Caddyshack&quot; for the blitzed and jaded,&quot; although he did praise Sandler&#x27;s confident performance.

Darren Bignell of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote: &quot;The real surprise is that it&#x27;s a lot of fun, with Sandler becoming more personable as the film progresses, and a couple of truly side-splitting scenes.&quot;

===Among golfers===

The film has developed a cult following in the golf community, with Golf.com, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, and &quot;Golf Digest&quot; praising the film, predominantly praising the villain Shooter McGavin.

The &quot;Happy Gilmore swing&quot;, featuring a walking or running approach, is often imitated or attempted for fun, including by touring golf professionals. Three-time major champion Pádraig Harrington is particularly well known for his impression and even uses the technique in training. The TV series &quot;Sport Science&quot; has featured Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Happy Gilmore swing&quot;, demonstrating how it can indeed generate additional distance, though at the cost of accuracy.

Long drive champion and professional golfer Jamie Sadlowski, also a former hockey player who can hit golf balls over 400 yards, has been called &quot;the real-life version of Happy Gilmore&quot;.

Lee Trevino regretted his appearance in the film and said he would not have done it if he had known how much swearing there would be in the movie.

In 2020, McDonald reprised his role as Shooter in the trailer for the video game &quot;PGA Tour 2K21&quot;.

===Bob Barker fight===
The scene with Barker beating up Gilmore increased interest in &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; among younger demographics, particularly young men. Barker said that someone in the audience asked him about &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; almost every day. Barker parodied the &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; fight in a 2014 episode of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, where he fought Wyatt Spencer after arguing with him.

In 2015, Sandler and Barker reenacted their fight for the Comedy Central &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot; fundraiser in aid of autism charities.

The fight scene was also highlighted in special primetime episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, as well as various news articles that announced Barker&#x27;s death on August 26, 2023, at the age of 99.

===Accolades===


==Sequel==

In September 2022, Sandler stated that he hoped to eventually make a sequel, saying he had been creating ideas for what a follow-up film would be, while stating the character would be involved in a senior golf tour.

In March 2024, Christopher McDonald stated in an interview that he had been shown a first draft of the script of the sequel by Sandler, reviving speculation of a sequel being made. On May 15, 2024, Netflix confirmed a sequel was in development. Filming began in New Jersey on September 9th, 2024. Travis Kelce is expected to have a cameo in the film.

<doc id="400814" wikidata="Q202163" url="?curid=400814" title="Luzhniki Stadium">
<text>The Grand Sports Arena of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, commonly known as
Luzhniki Stadium, is the national stadium of Russia, located in its capital city, Moscow. Its total seating capacity of 78,011 makes it the largest football stadium in Russia and the ninth-largest stadium in Europe. The stadium is a part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, and is located in Khamovniki District of the Central Administrative Okrug of Moscow city. The name &quot;Luzhniki&quot; derives from the flood meadows in the bend of Moskva River where the stadium was built, translating roughly as &quot;The Meadows&quot;. The stadium is located at Luzhniki Street, 24, Moscow.

Luzhniki was the main stadium of the 1980 Olympic Games, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as some of the competitions, including the athletics and final of the football tournament. A UEFA Category 4 stadium, Luzhniki hosted the UEFA Cup final in 1999 and UEFA Champions League final in 2008. The stadium also hosted such events as Summer Universiade, Goodwill Games and World Athletics Championships. It was the main stadium of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and hosted 7 matches of the tournament, including the opening match and the final.

In the past, its field has been used as the home ground for many years of football rivals Spartak Moscow and CSKA Moscow. It is currently used for some matches of the Russia national football team, as well as being used for various other sporting events and for concerts. Luzhniki Stadium is currently the temporary home ground of FC Torpedo Moscow.

==Location==
The stadium is located in Khamovniki District of the Central Administrative Okrug of Moscow city, south-west of the city center. The name &quot;Luzhniki&quot; derives from the flood meadows in the bend of Moskva River where the stadium was built, translating roughly as &quot;The Meadows&quot;. It was necessary to find a very large plot of land, preferably in a green area close to the city center that could fit into the transport map of the capital without too much difficulty.

According to one of the architects: &quot;On a sunny spring day of 1954, we, a group of architects and engineers who were tasked with designing the Central stadium, climbed onto a large paved area on the Lenin Hills [which after the Soviet era would revert to their old name, the Sparrow Hills ]... the proximity of the river, green mass of clean, fresh air – this circumstance alone mattered to select the area of the future city of sports... In addition, Luzhniki is located relatively close to the city center and convenient access to major transport systems with all parts of the capital&quot;.

==Playing surface==
It was one of the few major European football stadia to use an artificial pitch, having installed a FIFA-approved FieldTurf pitch in 2002. However, a temporary natural grass pitch was installed for the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final. The game between Chelsea and Manchester United was the first UEFA Champions League final held in Russia. On the match day, UEFA gave Luzhniki its elite status.

In August 2016 a permanent hybrid turf was installed, consisting of 95 percent natural grass reinforced with plastic.

==History==
===Background and early years===
On 23 December 1954, the Government of the USSR adopted a resolution on the construction of a stadium in the Luzhniki area in Moscow. The decision of the Soviet Government was a response to a specific current international situation: By the early 1950s, Soviet athletes took to the world stage for the first time after World War II (rus. the Great Patriotic War), participating in the Olympic Games. The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki brought the Soviet team 71 medals (of which 22 gold) and second place in the unofficial team standings.

It was a success, but the increased athletic development of the Soviet Union, which was a matter of state policy, required the construction of a new sports complex. The proposed complex was to meet all modern international standards and at the same time serve as a training base for the Olympic team and arena for large domestic and international competitions.

The stadium was built in 1955–56 as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium. The design began in January 1955 and was completed in 90 days by the architects Alexander Vlasov, Igor Rozhin, Nikolai Ullas, Alexander Khryakov and engineers Vsevolod Nasonov, Nikolai Reznikov, Vasily Polikarpov. Building materials came from Leningrad and the Armenian SSR, electrical and oak beams for the spectator benches from the Ukrainian SSR, furniture from Riga and Kaunas, glass was brought from Minsk, electrical equipment from Podolsk in Moscow Oblast, and larch lumber from Irkutsk in Siberia. It was necessary to demolish a whole area of dilapidated buildings (including the Trinity Church, which is supposed to be restored). Because the soil was heavily waterlogged, almost the entire area of the foundations of the complex had to be raised half a meter. 10,000 piles were hammered into the ground and dredgers reclaimed about 3 million cubic metres of soil. The total area of the stadium occupies 160 hectares. Eight thousand people moved home to make place for the stadium. The Church Tikhvin, an architectural monument of the 18th century was moved, too.

The stadium was officially opened on 31 July 1956, with a friendly football match between the RSFSR and China. 100 thousand spectators welcomed the event. The stadium was built in just 450 days. It was the national stadium of the Soviet Union, and is now the national stadium of Russia. In 1960 a 26-foot bronze statue of Lenin by sculptor Matvei Manizer, which was created for Expo 58 in Brussel, was placed on the square in front of the main stadium entrance.

On 10, 11 and 12 June 1958, the first motorcycle speedway races to be held in the Soviet Union were conducted at the stadium. However, the stadium became better known for hosting ice speedway and it held the final of the Individual Ice Speedway World Championship in 1966, 1967, 1975 and 1984.

=== 1980 Summer Olympics ===

In 1976–1979 the sports complex was repaired for the first time. The stadium was the chief venue for the 1980 Summer Olympics, the spectator capacity being 103,000 at that time. The events hosted in this stadium were the opening and closing ceremonies, athletics, football finals, and the individual jumping grand prix.
Then General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet Leonid Brezhnev declared the XXII Summer Olympic Games open.

===1982 Luzhniki disaster===
On 20 October 1982, disaster struck during a UEFA Cup match between FC Spartak Moscow and HFC Haarlem. 66 people died in the crowd crush, which made it Russia&#x27;s worst sporting disaster and most infamous cover-up at the time.

===1990s and 2000s===

In the spring of 1992, the state enterprise, including the sports complex, was privatized and renamed the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, and by June of the same year, Lenin&#x27;s name was removed. An extensive renovation in 1996 saw the construction of a roof over the stands, and the refurbishment of the seating areas, resulting in a decrease in capacity. Till the renovation, the stadium could accommodate 81 thousand people.

In 1998, the stadium was listed by UEFA in the list of 5-star European football stadiums.

The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Cup Final in which Parma defeated Marseille in the second UEFA Cup final to be played as a single fixture.

The Luzhniki Stadium was chosen by the UEFA to host the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final won by Manchester United who beat Chelsea in the first all-English Champions League final on 21 May. The match passed incident-free and a spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow said, &quot;The security and logistical arrangements put in place by the Russian authorities have been first-rate, as has been their cooperation with their visiting counterparts from the UK.&quot;

In August 2013, the stadium hosted the World Athletics Championships.

===Renovation for FIFA World Cup===
The original stadium was demolished in 2013 to give a way for the construction of a new stadium. However, the self-supported cover was retained. The facade wall was retained as well, due to its architectural value, and was later reconnected to the new building. Construction of the new stadium was completed in 2017. The total cost of repairs was 24 billion rubles.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup was held in Russia with the Luzhniki Stadium selected as the venue for the opening match and also the final, which was held on 15 July 2018. For the 2018 World Cup the stadium organized six checkpoints with 39 inspection lanes and seven pedestrian points with 427 points for the passage of spectators. About 900 scanners, 3000 cameras and monitors were installed. Special seats were provided for fans with disabilities. The stadium&#x27;s capacity was increased from 78,000 to 81,000 seats, partly caused by the removal of the athletics track around the pitch. In 2018 FIFA named the stadium as best arena in the world.

The stadium joins Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico, London&#x27;s old Wembley Stadium, Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion and Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion as the only stadiums to have hosted the finals of the FIFA World Cup and UEFA&#x27;s European Cup/Champions League and featured as a main stadium of the Summer Olympic Games. Saint Denis&#x27; Stade de France is scheduled to become another in 2024.

<doc id="400815" wikidata="Q3428047" url="?curid=400815" title="Ballard, Seattle">
<text>Ballard is a neighborhood in northwestern Seattle, Washington, United States. Formerly an independent city, the City of Seattle&#x27;s official boundaries define it as bounded to the north by Crown Hill (N.W. 85th Street), to the east by Greenwood, Phinney Ridge and Fremont (along 3rd Avenue N.W.), to the south by the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and to the west by Puget Sound&#x27;s Shilshole Bay. Other neighborhood or district boundaries existed in the past; these are recognized by various Seattle City Departments, commercial or social organizations, and other Federal, State, and local government agencies.

Landmarks of Ballard include the Ballard Locks, the National Nordic Museum, the Shilshole Bay Marina, and Golden Gardens Park. The neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfares running north–south are Seaview, 32nd, 24th, Leary, 15th, and 8th Avenues N.W. East–west traffic is carried by N.W. Leary Way and N.W. 85th, 80th, 65th, and Market Streets. The Ballard Bridge carries 15th Avenue over Salmon Bay to the Interbay neighborhood, and the Salmon Bay Bridge carries the BNSF Railway tracks across the bay, west of the Ballard Locks.

Ballard is located entirely within Seattle City Council District 6, which also includes the neighborhoods of Crown Hill, Green Lake and Phinney Ridge, as well as most of Fremont, North Beach/Blue Ridge, and Wallingford. Ballard is part of the Seattle Public Schools and the Washington State Legislature&#x27;s 36th legislative district. At the federal level, Ballard is part of the United States House of Representatives&#x27;s 7th congressional district.

==History==

===Early settlement===
The area now called Ballard was settled by the Dxʷdəwʔabš (Duwamish) Tribe after the last glacial period. There were plentiful salmon and clams in the region. The Shilshole area was home to a settlement that has since been excavated; its artifacts are in the collection of the Burke Museum in the University District. According to oral traditions from before European contact, the group living around Shilshole may have been in decline due to a &quot;great catastrophe&quot;. The remaining dozen or fewer families were evicted by non-Coast Salish settlers in the mid-19th century. One source suggests that the decline of the Shilshole dwelling Salish might have been due to raids from other groups from farther north (Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Island) and that these raids also alarmed non-Native settlers. The last member of the Shilshole native group, named HWelch’teed or &quot;Salmon Bay Charlie&quot;, was forcibly removed to allow construction of the Hiram Chittenden Locks in 1915 or 1916.

The first European resident in the area, homesteader Ira Wilcox Utter, moved to his claim in 1853. Utter hoped to see a rapid expansion of population, but when this did not happen, he sold the land to Thomas Burke, a judge. Thirty-six years later, Judge Burke, together with John Leary and railroader Daniel H. Gilman, formed the West Coast Improvement Company to develop Burke&#x27;s land holdings in the area. They anticipated the building of the Great Northern Railway along the Salmon Bay coastline on the way to Interbay and central Seattle. The partners also built a spur from Fremont&#x27;s main line of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway. Today three miles (5 km) of this line, running along Salmon Bay from N.W. 40th Street to the BNSF Railway mainline at N.W. 67th, are operated as the Ballard Terminal Railroad.

During the late 19th century Captain William Rankin Ballard, owner of land adjoining Judge Burke&#x27;s holdings, joined the partnership with Burke, Leary, and Gilman. Then, in 1887 the partnership was dissolved and the assets divided, but no one wanted the land in Salmon Bay so the partners flipped a coin. Capt. Ballard lost the coin-toss and ended up with the &quot;undesirable&quot; tract.

The railroad to Seattle ended at Salmon Bay because the railroad company was unwilling to build a trestle to cross the bay. From the stop at &quot;Ballard Junction,&quot; (as the terminus was called) passengers could walk across the wagon bridge and continue the journey to Seattle. In addition to gaining notoriety as the end of the railway line, the fledgling town of Ballard benefited economically from the railway because the railroad provided a way to bring supplies into the area and also to export locally manufactured products. Ability to ship products spurred the growth of mills of many types. Ballard&#x27;s first mill, built in 1888 by Mr. J Sinclair was a lumber mill; the second mill, finished the same year was a shingle mill. After the Great Seattle Fire in 1889 the mills provided opportunities for those who had lost jobs in the fire, which in turn spurred the growth of the settlement as families moved north to work in the mills. Ballard experienced an influx of Scandinavian immigrants during this period, and Scandinavian culture and traditions would be influential on Ballard as it developed.

===City of Ballard===

With the rapid population growth, residents realized that there might soon be a need for laws to keep order, a process that would require a formal government. In the late summer of 1889, the community discussed incorporating as a town but eventually rejected the idea of incorporation. The issue pressed, however, and several months later, on November 4, 1889, the residents again voted on the question and this time they voted to incorporate. The first mayor of Ballard was Charles F. Treat. A municipal census, conducted shortly after the passing vote showed that the new town of Ballard had more than 1500 residents, allowing it to be the first &quot;third-class town&quot; to be incorporated in the newly-admitted State of Washington.

By 1900, Ballard&#x27;s population had grown to 4,568, making it the seventh-largest city in Washington, and the town was faced with many of the problems common to small towns. Saloons had been a problem since the beginning, and in 1904, the drinking and gambling had become so bad that the mayor ordered the City of Ballard officially closed for the day to prevent gambling. The city also faced problems with loose livestock and so the Cow Ordinance of 1903 made allowing cows to graze south of present-day 65th St. a punishable offense. The city faced more serious problems, however, with two of the most difficult being the lack of both a proper water supply and a sewer system. The one weakness of the location on Salmon Bay was the lack of nearby freshwater springs, which meant that water came from local ground water wells. Lack of a proper sewage system contaminated the ground water, compounding the problem.

The town continued to grow and reached 17,000 residents by 1907 to become the second-largest city in King County. However Ballard, like many of the other small cities surrounding Seattle continued to be plagued by water problems. The rapid population growth had overwhelmed the city&#x27;s ability to provide services, particularly safe drinking water and sewers, and Ballard&#x27;s city government had tried unsuccessfully to deal with the crises. That made the citizens begin to consider asking Seattle to annex the town. In 1905, the question was voted on and the residents voted against annexation since they hoped for a solution, but the problems refused to go away. In July 1906, the Supreme Court of Washington ruled that Seattle was not allowed to provide water service to surrounding communities. Ballard had been dependent on a water sharing agreement with Seattle, but the Supreme Court decision left it with inadequate water and forced a second vote on the annexation question. By then, the residents realized the inability of local resources to cope with their situation and the majority of residents voted in favor of annexation. On May 29, 1907 at 3:45 a.m, the City of Ballard officially became part of Seattle. On that day, Ballard citizens showed their mixed feelings about the handover by draping their city hall with black crepe and flying the flag at half mast.

===Modern history===


During the early 20th century, the Ballard area was home to the Ballard shipbuilding company, which produced ships for the US Navy during World War II as well as ships for civilian purposes. The area was also home to a significant number of fisheries and canneries. These marine industries formed the backbone of the Ballard economy for much of the 20th century.

At the end of the 20th century Ballard began to experience a real-estate boom. By early 2007, nearly 20 major apartment/retail projects were under construction or had just been completed within a five-block radius of downtown Ballard. The new developments would add as many as 2500 new households to the neighborhood. This growth in urban density is the result of the neighborhood plan created by former Seattle Mayor Norm Rice. Mayor Rice&#x27;s plan aimed to reduce suburban sprawl by targeting certain Seattle areas, including Ballard, for high-density development.

Over the years, Ballard has added venues for live music, including bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Each month the Ballard Chamber of Commerce sponsors the Second Saturday Artwalk.

Downtown Ballard is also home to the Majestic Bay Theater, which was the oldest operating movie theater on the West Coast prior to its closure in 1997. In 1998, it was renovated and transformed from a bargain single-screen theater to a well-appointed triplex. Downtown Ballard also boasts a variety of restaurants and local shops. The Deep Sea Fishermen&#x27;s Union, which represents commercial fishermen, is based in Ballard.

==Ballard Historical Society==
The Ballard Historical Society is a volunteer-run non-profit historical society located in the Ballard neighborhood. The organization does not have any traditional exhibition space, but maintains a community presence through its self-guided historical tours, historical markers, lectures, community events, and collections. The Ballard Historical Society&#x27;s collections include memorabilia, historical archives, photographs, and other objects relating to Ballard History. The society has made its photo archives available online. The organization has 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.

Formed in 1988 with encouragement from the Ballard Centennial Committee in celebration of the Washington state centennial in 1989, the organization&#x27;s establishment coincided with the publication of &quot;Passport to Ballard&quot;, a collection of essays on the neighborhood&#x27;s history from pre-European settlement up through the 1980s. In April 2007, the Ballard Historical Society unveiled its Historic Markers, which can be seen on buildings in the Ballard Avenue Historic District.

The organization also co-produced, along with the Nordic Heritage Museum and Swedish-Finn Historical Society, &quot;Voices of Ballard: Immigrant Stories from the Vanishing Generation&quot; (2001), a book collecting oral histories from long-time Ballard residents who have made the neighborhood home since before the 1960s. The Ballard Walking Tour, a self-guided tour created by the organization, highlights 20 different historic sites on and around Ballard Avenue. The most recent illustrated Tour Brochure was released in February 2009.

Every three years the Ballard Historical Society organizes the Ballard Classic Homes Tour and features a different set of vintage homes in Ballard during each parade of houses.

Ballard is the traditional center of Seattle&#x27;s ethnically Scandinavian seafaring community, who were drawn to the area because of the salmon fishing opportunities. The neighborhood&#x27;s unofficial slogan, &quot;Uff da&quot;, comes from an &quot;Almost Live!&quot; sketch that made fun of its Scandinavian culture. In recent years the proportion of Scandinavian residents has decreased but the neighborhood is still proud of its heritage. Ballard is home to the National Nordic Museum, which celebrates both the community of Ballard and the local Scandinavian history. Scandinavians unite in organizations such as the Sons of Norway Leif Ericson Lodge and the Norwegian Ladies Chorus of Seattle. Each year the community celebrates the Ballard SeafoodFest and Norwegian Constitution Day (also called Syttende Mai) on May 17 to commemorate the signing of the Norwegian Constitution.

Locals once nicknamed the neighborhood &quot;Snoose Junction,&quot; a reference to the Scandinavian settlers&#x27; practice of using snus.

The Majestic Bay Theatre on Market Street is on the same location as the former Bay and Majestic theaters. Before closing for the new construction the Bay Theatre was the longest continuously operating movie theatre on the west coast after the closure of the Cameo in Los Angeles.

The neighborhood is home to a namesake soccer team, Ballard FC, which was founded in 2022 and plays in the fourth-division USL League 2. The semi-professional team is owned by a group led by former Seattle Sounders FC player Lamar Neagle and plays in nearby Interbay at the 1,000-seat Interbay Soccer Stadium.

==Schools and libraries==

The public schools in the neighborhood are part of the citywide Seattle Public Schools district. Ballard High School, located in the neighborhood, is the oldest continuously-operating high school in the city. The original building was demolished in the late 1990s. The new school building is now one of the largest in the district and houses a biotechnology magnet program that attracts students from all over Seattle. The high school has been supported by Amgen, Zymogenetics, G. M. Nameplate, the Youth Maritime Training Association, North Seattle Community College, Seattle City Light, and Swedish Hospital.

There are several elementary schools and one alternative school located in the neighborhood. The closest middle school is Whitman Middle School, which is located north of Ballard in the Crown Hill neighborhood.

* Adams Elementary School (K-5)
* Loyal Heights Elementary School (K-5)
* Matheia School (K-5, private independent)
* North Beach Elementary School (K-5)
* Salmon Bay School (K-8)
* St. Alphonsus School (K-8, Catholic)
* West Woodland Elementary School (K-5)
* Whittier Elementary School (K-5)

The Ballard Public Library was first created as the Carnegie Free Public Library in 1904. In 1907, after annexation, the library became part of the Seattle Public Library system. The original Carnegie building on Market Street was replaced with new construction on 24th Avenue NW in 1963. 42 years later, in 2005, a new library building on 22nd Avenue NW designed by architectural firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, was opened as part of the Seattle Public Library&#x27;s &quot;Libraries for All&quot; initiative. The original Carnegie building on Market Street is a restaurant.

The Seattle Metaphysical Library, originally opened in the Pike Place Market in 1961, is now on Market Street in Ballard, and is open to the public and lends books to members.

<doc id="400821" wikidata="Q189062" url="?curid=400821" title="List of states with nuclear weapons">
<text>Eight sovereign states have publicly announced successful detonation of nuclear weapons. Five are considered to be nuclear-weapon states (NWS) under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In order of acquisition of nuclear weapons, these are the United States, Russia (the successor of the former Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, France, and China. Of these, the three NATO members, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, are sometimes termed the P3.

Other states that have declared nuclear weapons possession are India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, these three states were not parties to the Treaty and have conducted overt nuclear tests. North Korea had been a party to the NPT but withdrew in 2003.

Israel is also generally understood to have nuclear weapons, but does not acknowledge it, maintaining a policy of deliberate ambiguity. Israel is estimated to possess somewhere between 90 and 300 nuclear warheads. One possible motivation for &quot;nuclear ambiguity&quot; is deterrence with minimum political friction.

States that formerly possessed nuclear weapons are South Africa, which developed nuclear weapons but then disassembled its arsenal before joining the NPT, and the former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, whose weapons were transferred to Russia.

According to the Federation of American Scientists there are approximately 3,880 active nuclear warheads and 12,119 total nuclear warheads in the world as of 2024. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated in 2024 that the total number of nuclear warheads acquired by nuclear states reached 12,121. Approximately 9,585 are kept with military stockpiles. About 3,904 warheads are deployed with operational forces. 2,100 warheads, which are primarily from Russia and the United States, are maintained for high operational alerts.

== Statistics and force configuration ==

The following is a list of states that have acknowledged the possession of nuclear weapons or are presumed to possess them, the approximate number of warheads under their control, and the year they tested their first weapon and their force configuration. This list is informally known in global politics as the &quot;Nuclear Club&quot;. With the exception of Russia and the United States (which have subjected their nuclear forces to independent verification under various treaties) these figures are estimates, in some cases quite unreliable estimates. In particular, under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty thousands of Russian and US nuclear warheads are inactive in stockpiles awaiting processing. The fissile material contained in the warheads can then be recycled for use in nuclear reactors.

From a high of 70,300 active weapons in 1986, there are approximately 3,880 active nuclear warheads and 12,119 total nuclear warheads in the world. Many of the decommissioned weapons were simply stored or partially dismantled, not destroyed.

Additionally, since the dawn of the Atomic Age, the delivery methods of most states with nuclear weapons have evolved—with four acquiring a nuclear triad, while others have consolidated away from land and air deterrents to submarine-based forces.

== Recognized nuclear-weapon states ==

These five states are known to have detonated a nuclear explosive before 1 January 1967 and are thus nuclear weapons states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. They also happen to be the UN Security Council&#x27;s (UNSC) permanent members with veto power on UNSC resolutions.

=== United States ===

The United States developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada as part of the Manhattan Project, out of the apprehension that Nazi Germany would develop them first. It tested the first nuclear weapon on 16 July 1945 (&quot;Trinity&quot;) at 5:30 am, and remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war, having bombed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the closing stages of World War II. The project expenditure through 1 October 1945 was reportedly $1.845–$2billion, in nominal terms, roughly 0.8 percent of the US GDP in 1945 and equivalent to about $billion today.

The United States was the first nation to develop the hydrogen bomb, testing an experimental prototype in 1952 (&quot;Ivy Mike&quot;) and a deployable weapon in 1954 (&quot;Castle Bravo&quot;). Throughout the Cold War it continued to modernize and enlarge its nuclear arsenal, but from 1992 on has been involved primarily in a program of stockpile stewardship. The US nuclear arsenal contained 31,175 warheads at its Cold War height (in 1966). During the Cold War, the United States built more nuclear weapons than all other nations at approximately 70,000 warheads.

=== Russia (successor to the Soviet Union) ===

The Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon (&quot;RDS-1&quot;) in 1949. This crash project was developed partially with information obtained via the atomic spies at the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project during and after World War II. The Soviet Union was the second nation to have developed and tested a nuclear weapon. It tested its first megaton-range hydrogen bomb (&quot;RDS-37&quot;) in 1955. The Soviet Union also tested the most powerful explosive ever detonated by humans, (&quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;), with a theoretical yield of 100 megatons, reduced to 50 when detonated. After its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet weapons entered officially into the possession of its successor state, the Russian Federation. The Soviet nuclear arsenal contained some 45,000 warheads at its peak (in 1986), more than any other nation had possessed at any point in history; the Soviet Union built about 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949.

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon (&quot;Hurricane&quot;) in 1952. The UK had provided considerable impetus and initial research for the early conception of the atomic bomb, aided by Austrian, German and Polish physicists working at British universities who had either fled or decided not to return to Nazi Germany or Nazi-controlled territories. The UK collaborated closely with the United States and Canada during the Manhattan Project, but had to develop its own method for manufacturing and detonating a bomb as US secrecy grew after 1945. The United Kingdom was the third country in the world, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to develop and test a nuclear weapon. Its programme was motivated to have an independent deterrent against the Soviet Union, while also maintaining its status as a great power. It tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1957 (Operation Grapple), making it the third country to do so after the United States and Soviet Union.

The British Armed Forces maintained a fleet of V bomber strategic bombers and ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) equipped with nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The Royal Navy currently maintains a fleet of four ballistic missile submarines equipped with Trident II missiles. In 2016, the UK House of Commons voted to renew the British nuclear weapons system with the , without setting a date for the commencement of service of a replacement to the current system.

=== France ===
France tested its first nuclear weapon in 1960 (&quot;Gerboise Bleue&quot;), based mostly on its own research. It was motivated by the Suez Crisis diplomatic tension in relation to both the Soviet Union and its allies, the United States and United Kingdom. It was also relevant to retain great power status, alongside the United Kingdom, during the post-colonial Cold War (see: Force de frappe). France tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1968 (&quot;Opération Canopus&quot;). After the Cold War, France has disarmed 175 warheads with the reduction and modernization of its arsenal that has now evolved to a dual system based on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range air-to-surface missiles (Rafale fighter-bombers). However, new nuclear weapons are in development and reformed nuclear squadrons were trained during Enduring Freedom operations in Afghanistan.

France acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992. In January 2006, President Jacques Chirac stated a terrorist act or the use of weapons of mass destruction against France would result in a nuclear counterattack. In February 2015, President François Hollande stressed the need for a nuclear deterrent in &quot;a dangerous world&quot;. He also detailed the French deterrent as &quot;fewer than 300&quot; nuclear warheads, three sets of 16 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and 54 medium-range air-to-surface missiles and urged other states to show similar transparency.

=== China ===
China tested its first nuclear weapon device (&quot;596&quot;) in 1964 at the Lop Nur test site. The weapon was developed as a deterrent against both the United States and the Soviet Union. Two years later, China had a fission bomb capable of being put onto a nuclear missile. It tested its first hydrogen bomb (&quot;Test No. 6&quot;) in 1967, 32 months after testing its first nuclear weapon (the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history). China is the only NPT nuclear-weapon state to give an unqualified negative security assurance with its &quot;no first use&quot; policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/1995/265&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992. As of 2016, China fielded SLBMs onboard its JL-2 submarines. As of February 2024, China had an estimated total inventory of approximately 500 warheads.

According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China is in the middle of a significant modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal. Its nuclear stockpile is expected to continue growing over the coming decade and some projections suggest that it will deploy at least as many intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as either Russia or the US in that period. However, China&#x27;s overall nuclear warhead stockpile is still expected to remain smaller than that of either of those states. The Yearbook published by SIPRI in 2024 revealed that China&#x27;s nuclear warheads stockpile increased by 90 in 2023, reaching 500 warheads.

US Department of Defense officials estimate that the Chinese had more than 600 operational nuclear warheads as of December 2024, and it was on track to posess 1,000 nuclear weapons by the year 2030.

== States declaring possession of nuclear weapons ==

=== India ===
India is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Indian officials rejected the NPT in the 1960s on the grounds that it created a world of nuclear &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot;, arguing that it unnecessarily restricted &quot;peaceful activity&quot; (including &quot;peaceful nuclear explosives&quot;), and that India would not accede to international control of their nuclear facilities unless all other countries engaged in unilateral disarmament of their own nuclear weapons. The Indian position has also asserted that the NPT is in many ways a neo-colonial regime designed to deny security to post-colonial powers.

The country tested what is called a &quot;peaceful nuclear explosive&quot; in 1974 (which became known as &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;). The test was the first test developed after the creation of the NPT, and created new questions about how civilian nuclear technology could be diverted secretly to weapons purposes (dual-use technology). India&#x27;s secret development caused great concern and anger particularly from nations that had supplied its nuclear reactors for peaceful and power generating needs, such as Canada. After its 1974 test, India maintained that its nuclear capability was primarily &quot;peaceful&quot;, but between 1988 and 1990 it apparently weaponized two dozen nuclear weapons for delivery by air. In 1998 India tested weaponized nuclear warheads (&quot;Operation Shakti&quot;), including a thermonuclear device, and declared itself as a nuclear state. India adopted a &quot;no first use&quot; policy in 1998.

In July 2005, US President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a civil nuclear cooperation initiative that included plans to conclude an Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. This initiative came to fruition through a series of steps that included India&#x27;s announced plan to separate its civil and military nuclear programs in March 2006, the passage of the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement by the US Congress in December 2006, the conclusion of a US–India nuclear cooperation agreement in July 2007, approval by the IAEA of an India-specific safeguards agreement, agreement by the Nuclear Suppliers Group to a waiver of export restrictions for India, approval by the US Congress and culminating in the signature of US–India agreement for civil nuclear cooperation in October 2008. The US State Department said it made it &quot;very clear that we will not recognize India as a nuclear-weapon state&quot;. The United States is bound by the Hyde Act with India and may cease all cooperation with India if India detonates a nuclear explosive device. The US had further said it is not its intention to assist India in the design, construction or operation of sensitive nuclear technologies through the transfer of dual-use items. In establishing an exemption for India, the Nuclear Suppliers Group reserved the right to consult on any future issues which might trouble it. As of June 2024, India was estimated to have a stockpile of 172 warheads.

=== Pakistan ===
Pakistan is also not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pakistan covertly developed nuclear weapons over decades, beginning in the late 1970s. Pakistan first delved into nuclear power after the establishment of its first nuclear power plant near Karachi with equipment and materials supplied mainly by western nations in the early 1970s. Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto promised in 1971 that if India could build nuclear weapons then Pakistan would too, according to him: &quot;We will develop Nuclear stockpiles, even if we have to eat grass.&quot;

It is believed that Pakistan has possessed nuclear weapons since the mid-1980s. The United States continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess such weapons until 1990, when sanctions were imposed under the Pressler Amendment, requiring a cutoff of US economic and military assistance to Pakistan. In 1998, Pakistan conducted its first six nuclear tests at the Ras Koh Hills in response to the five tests conducted by India a few weeks before.

In 2004, the Pakistani metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan, a key figure in Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons program, confessed to heading an international black market ring involved in selling nuclear weapons technology. In particular, Khan had been selling gas centrifuge technology to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Khan denied complicity by the Pakistani government or Army, but this has been called into question by journalists and IAEA officials, and was later contradicted by statements from Khan himself.

As of early 2013, Pakistan was estimated to have had a stockpile of around 140 warheads, and in November 2014 it was projected that by 2020 Pakistan would have enough fissile material for 200 warheads. As of 2024, SIPRI estimated that Pakistan had a stockpile of around 170 warheads.

=== North Korea ===
North Korea was a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but announced a withdrawal on 10 January 2003, after the United States accused it of having a secret uranium enrichment program and cut off energy assistance under the 1994 Agreed Framework. In February 2005, North Korea claimed to possess functional nuclear weapons, though their lack of a test at the time led many experts to doubt the claim. In October 2006, North Korea stated that, in response to growing intimidation by the United States, it would conduct a nuclear test to confirm its nuclear status. North Korea reported a successful nuclear test on 9 October 2006 (see 2006 North Korean nuclear test). Most US intelligence officials believed that the test was probably only partially successful with a yield of less than a kiloton. North Korea conducted a second, higher-yield test on 25 May 2009 (see 2009 North Korean nuclear test) and a third test with still-higher yield on 12 February 2013 (see 2013 North Korean nuclear test).

North Korea claimed to have conducted its first hydrogen-bomb test on 5 January 2016, though measurements of seismic disturbances indicate that the detonation was not consistent with a hydrogen bomb. On 3 September 2017, North Korea detonated a device, which caused a magnitude 6.1 tremor, consistent with a low-powered thermonuclear detonation; NORSAR estimates the yield at 250 kilotons of TNT. In 2018, North Korea announced a halt in nuclear weapons tests and made a conditional commitment to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula; however, in December 2019, it indicated it no longer considered itself bound by the moratorium.

Kim Jong Un officially declared North Korea a nuclear weapons state during a speech on 9 September 2022, the country&#x27;s foundation day.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), North Korea&#x27;s military nuclear programme remains central to its national security strategy and it may have assembled up to 30 nuclear weapons and could produce more. North Korea conducted more than 90 ballistic missile tests during 2022, the highest number it has ever undertaken in a single year.

== States believed to possess nuclear weapons ==

=== Israel ===
Israel is generally understood to have been the sixth country to develop nuclear weapons, but does not acknowledge it. It had &quot;rudimentary, but deliverable,&quot; nuclear weapons available as early as 1966. Israel is not a party to the NPT. Israel engages in strategic ambiguity, saying it would not be the first country to &quot;introduce&quot; nuclear weapons to the Middle East without confirming or denying that it has a nuclear weapons program or arsenal. This policy of &quot;nuclear opacity&quot; has been interpreted as an attempt to get the benefits of deterrence with a minimal political cost. Due to a US ban on funding countries that have weapons of mass destruction, Israel would lose around $2 billion a year in military and other aid from the US if it admitted to possessing nuclear weapons.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Federation of American Scientists, Israel likely possesses around 80–400 nuclear weapons. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Israel has approximately 90 intact nuclear weapons, of which 50 are thought to be assigned for delivery by land-based Jericho ballistic missiles and 30 are gravity bombs for delivery by F-16I or F-15 aircraft. SIPRI also reports that Israel operates five German-built Dolphin-class (Dolphin-I and Dolphin-II) diesel–electric submarines. The submarines are based at Haifa on the Mediterranean coast. There are unconfirmed reports that all or some of the submarines have been equipped to launch an indigenously produced nuclear-armed sea-launched variant of the Popeye cruise missile, giving Israel a sea-based nuclear strike capability.

On 7 November 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu said during a radio interview that a nuclear strike would be &quot;one way&quot; to deal with Gaza, which commentators and diplomats interpreted as a tacit admission that Israel possesses such a capability. His remarks were criticized by the United States and Russia, and Eliyahu was subsequently suspended from the Israeli cabinet.

== Launch authority ==

The decision to use nuclear weapons is always restricted to a single person or small group of people. The United States and France require their respective presidents to approve the use of nuclear weapons. In the US, the Presidential Emergency Satchel is always handled by a nearby aide unless the President is near a command center. The decision rests with the Prime Minister in the United Kingdom. Information from China is unclear, but &quot;the launch of nuclear weapons is commonly believed to rest with the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party.&quot; Russia grants such power to the President but may also require approval from the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the General Staff. The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces has authority in North Korea. India, Pakistan and Israel have committees for such a decision.

Some countries are known to have delegated launch authority to military personnel in the event that the usual launch authority is incapacitated; whether or not the &#x27;pre-delegated&#x27; authority exists at any particular time is kept secret. In the United States, some military commanders have been delegated authority to launch nuclear weapons &quot;when the urgency of time and circumstances clearly does not permit a specific decision by the President.&quot; Russia has a semi automated Dead Hand system which may allow military commanders to act based on certain pre-defined criteria. British nuclear-armed submarine commanders are issued with &quot;letters of last resort&quot; written by the Prime Minister containing secret instructions which may or may not give them delegated launch authority.

== Nuclear weapons sharing ==

=== Nuclear weapons shared by the United States ===
Under NATO nuclear weapons sharing, the United States has provided nuclear weapons for Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey to deploy and store. This involves pilots and other staff of the &quot;non-nuclear&quot; NATO states practicing, handling, and delivering the US nuclear bombs, and adapting non-US warplanes to deliver US nuclear bombs. However, since all US nuclear weapons are protected with Permissive Action Links, the host states cannot easily arm the bombs without authorization codes from the US Department of Defense. Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga acknowledged the presence of US nuclear weapons in Italy. US nuclear weapons were also deployed in Canada as well as Greece from 1963. However, the United States withdrew three of the four nuclear-capable weapons systems from Canada by 1972, the fourth by 1984, and all nuclear-capable weapons systems from Greece by 2001. , the United States maintained around 100 nuclear weapons in Europe, as reflected in the accompanying table.

=== Nuclear weapons shared by Russia ===

, the leaders of Russia and Belarus have claimed that a &quot;number of&quot; nuclear weapons are located on Belarusian territory while remaining in Russian possession. Sources hostile to these countries have confirmed that nuclear warheads have been delivered to Belarus, but claim that the first transfers were instead made in August 2023. Russia&#x27;s stated intention is to provide Belarus with two delivery systems: dual-capable Iskander-M missile systems and necessary training and modifications for Belarusian Su-25 aircraft to carry nuclear weapons.

The deployment of Russian weapons to Belarus was framed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as being equivalent to the deployments of American nuclear weapons to NATO Allies in Europe under international law.

=== Criticism of nuclear weapons sharing ===
Members of the Non-Aligned Movement have called on all countries to &quot;refrain from nuclear sharing for military purposes under any kind of security arrangements.&quot; The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) has criticized the arrangement for allegedly violating Articles I and II of the NPT, arguing that &quot;these Articles do not permit the NWS to delegate the control of their nuclear weapons directly or indirectly to others.&quot; NATO has argued that the weapons&#x27; sharing is compliant with the NPT because &quot;the US nuclear weapons based in Europe are in the sole possession and under constant and complete custody and control of the United States.&quot;

== States formerly possessing nuclear weapons ==
Nuclear weapons have been present in many nations, often as staging grounds under control of other powers. However, in only one instance has a nation given up nuclear weapons after being in full control of them. The fall of the Soviet Union left several former Soviet republics in physical possession of nuclear weapons, although not operational control which was dependent on Russian-controlled electronic Permissive Action Links and the Russian command and control system. Of these, Kazakhstan and Ukraine continue to have neither their own nuclear weapons nor another state&#x27;s nuclear weapons stationed in their territory whereas Belarus does again claim to have Russian-owned nuclear weapons stationed on its territory since 2023.

=== South Africa ===

South Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s.

In 1979, there was a detection of a putative covert nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, called the Vela incident. It has long been speculated that it was a test by Israel, in collaboration with and with the support of South Africa, though this has never been confirmed. South Africa could not have constructed such a nuclear bomb by itself until November 1979, two months after the &quot;double flash&quot; incident.

South Africa acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.

=== Former Soviet republics ===

* Kazakhstan had 1,400 Soviet-era nuclear weapons on its territory and transferred them all to Russia by 1995, after Kazakhstan acceded to the NPT.
* Ukraine had as many as 3,000 nuclear weapons deployed on its territory when it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, equivalent to the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world. At the time Ukraine acceded to the NPT in December 1994, Ukraine had agreed to dispose of all nuclear weapons within its territory. The warheads were removed from Ukraine by 1996 and disassembled in Russia. Despite Russia&#x27;s subsequent and internationally disputed annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine reaffirmed its 1994 decision to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon state.
* Belarus, which since 2023 has resumed hosting Russian nuclear weapons, also had single warhead missiles stationed on its territory into the 1990s while a constituent of the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, 81 single warhead missiles were stationed on newly Belarusian territory, but were all transferred to Russia by 1996. Belarus was a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) from May 1992 through February 2022, when it held a constitutional referendum resulting in the cessation of its non-nuclear status.

In connection with their accession to the NPT, all three countries received assurances that their sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity would be respected, as stated in the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. These assurances have been flouted by Russia since the Russo-Ukrainian War began in 2014, during which Russia claimed to annex Crimea, occupied Eastern Ukraine, and in 2022, launched a full-scale invasion, with limited responses by the other signatories.

=== Stationed countries ===
Up until the 1990s the US had stationed nuclear weapons outside of its territories and sharing countries.

==== South Korea ====
==== Philippines ====
During the Cold War, specifically during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos from 1965 to 1986, American nuclear warheads were secretly stockpiled in the Philippines.

==== Taiwan ====
Taiwan was developing capacities to construct nuclear weapons up until 1988. Before 1974, the United States stationed some of its arsenal in Taiwan.

==== Japan ====
After World War II the US had nuclear weapons stationed in Japan until the 1970s.

==== Canada ====
The US stationed nuclear weapons at CFB Goose Bay in Labrador between 1964 and 1984.

Greece

The US stationed nuclear weapons in Greece until they were removed in 2001.

<text>Wavel () is a Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Baalbeck in Lebanon. It was originally a French army barrack, but in 1948 refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli war found shelter there. In 1952, UNRWA took over responsibility for providing services in the camp.

==Wavel today==
As of 2013, there were 8806 registered refugees in the camp. In 2009 there were approximately 3000 refugees within the camp and a similar number living outside the camp. There are also two UNRWA schools, including a secondary school and one health centre. Major issues affecting the camp are harsh living conditions, high school drop-out rate and limited employment opportunities

<doc id="400845" wikidata="Q246303" url="?curid=400845" title="Anthony Boucher">
<text>William Anthony Parker White (August 21, 1911 – April 29, 1968), better known by his pen name Anthony Boucher (), was an American author, critic, and editor who wrote several classic mystery novels, short stories, science fiction, and radio dramas. Between 1942 and 1947, he acted as reviewer of mostly mystery fiction for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. In addition to &quot;Anthony Boucher&quot;, White also employed the pseudonym &quot;H. H. Holmes&quot;, which was the pseudonym of a late-19th-century American serial killer; Boucher would also write light verse and sign it &quot;Herman W. Mudgett&quot; (the murderer&#x27;s real name).

In a 1981 poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, his novel &quot;Nine Times Nine&quot; was voted as the ninth best locked room mystery of all time.

==Background==
White was born in Oakland, California, and went to college at the University of Southern California. He later received a master&#x27;s degree from the University of California, Berkeley.

After a friend told him that &quot;William White&quot; was too common a name, he used &quot;H. H. Holmes&quot; to write and review mysteries and &quot;Anthony Boucher&quot; for science fiction and fantasy. He pronounced &quot;Boucher&quot; phonetically, &quot;to rhyme with voucher&quot;.

== Fiction writing and editing ==
Boucher (as he was more commonly known) wrote mystery, science fiction, and horror. He was also an editor, including science fiction anthologies, and wrote mystery reviews for many years in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was one of the first English translators of Jorge Luis Borges, translating &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; for &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. He helped found the Mystery Writers of America in 1946 and, in the same year, was one of the first winners of the MWA&#x27;s Edgar Award for his mystery reviews in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. He was a founding editor (with J. Francis McComas) of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; from 1949 to 1958, and attempted to make literary quality an important aspect of science fiction. He won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine in 1957 and 1958. Boucher also edited the long-running &quot;Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; anthology series, from 1952 to 1959.

Among Boucher&#x27;s critical writing was also contributing annual summaries of the state of speculative fiction for Judith Merril&#x27;s &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best SF&quot; series; as editor, he published the volumes in E. P. Dutton&#x27;s &quot;The Best Detective Stories of the Year&quot; annual volumes published in 1963–1968, succeeding Brett Halliday and followed, after his death, by Allen J. Hubin in that task.

Boucher&#x27;s first short story saw print when he was fifteen years old in the January 1927 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Titled &quot;Ye Goode Olde Ghoste Storie,&quot; it was the only story to appear under his real name, William A. P. White. Boucher went on to write short stories for many pulp fiction magazines in America, including &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Astounding&quot;, &quot;Black Mask&quot;, &quot;Ed McBain&#x27;s Mystery Book&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;The Master Detective&quot;, &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot; and &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

His short story &quot;The Quest for Saint Aquin&quot; was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories of all time. As such, it was published in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964&quot;.

Boucher was the friend and mentor of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick and others. His 1942 novel &quot;Rocket to the Morgue&quot;, in addition to being a classic locked room mystery, is also something of a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about the Southern California science fiction culture of the time, featuring thinly veiled versions of personalities such as Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard and rocket scientist/occultist/fan Jack Parsons.

==Radio==
Boucher also scripted for radio and was involved in many other activities, as described by William F. Nolan in his essay &quot;Who Was Anthony Boucher?&quot;:
With respect to his scripting of the Sherlock Holmes radio dramas, Nigel Bruce, who played Dr. Watson, said that Boucher &quot;had a sound knowledge of Conan Doyle and a great affection for the two characters of Holmes and Watson.&quot;

== &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; years ==
Boucher left dramatic radio in 1948, &quot;mainly because I was putting in a lot of hours working with J. Francis McComas in creating what soon became &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. We got it off the ground in 1949 and saw it take hold solidly by 1950. This was a major creative challenge and although I was involved in a lot of other projects, I stayed with &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; into 1958.&quot;

Throughout his years with the magazine, Boucher was involved in many other projects. He wrote fiction for the SF and mystery markets (primarily short stories). He taught an informal writing class from his home in Berkeley. He continued his Sunday mystery columns for the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, while also writing crime-fiction reviews for &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot; as Holmes (he also reviewed SF and fantasy (as H. H. Holmes) for the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;) and functioning as chief critic for &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. He edited &quot;True Crime Detective&quot;, supervised the Mercury Mystery Line and (later) the Dell Great Mystery Library; hosted &quot;Golden Voices&quot;, his series of historical opera recordings for Pacifica Radio, and served (in 1951) as president of Mystery Writers of America.

As part of his reviews of mystery novels, he published a list of Best Crime Fiction of the Year from 1949 to 1967, listing from 12 to 15 titles each year. He published his list as Anthony Boucher.

Boucher was a poker player, a political activist, a sport fan (football, basketball, track, gymnastics and rugby), a Sherlockian in The Baker Street Irregulars and a chef. He was also an expert collector of recordings of early operatic singers.

==Television==
In 1964-1965 Boucher worked as a story consultant for the &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;.

==Death==
Boucher died of lung cancer on April 29, 1968, at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland.

==Bouchercon==
Bouchercon, the &quot;Anthony Boucher Memorial World Mystery Convention&quot;, was named in his honor, as are their annual Anthony Awards. Descriptions of those conventions from the first, in 1970, until that in 2004, appear in Marvin Lachman&#x27;s &quot;The Heirs of Anthony Boucher&quot;.

<doc id="400848" wikidata="Q5516319" url="?curid=400848" title="Gaddi Vasquez">
<text>Gaddi Holguin Vasquez (born January 22, 1955) was the 8th United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture, in Rome, Italy. He was nominated by President George W. Bush and unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on June 29, 2006. Vasquez was sworn into office on September 7, 2006, by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and served in the position until 2009. Prior to that, he was the first person of Hispanic ancestry to head the Peace Corps.

==Early life and education==
Born in Carrizo Springs, Texas, Vasquez is a Mexican-American and the son of migrant workers. Vasquez grew up in poverty. He kept a photo of him and his father on his desk at the Peace Corps. &quot;I have this here as a reminder every day,&quot; said Vasquez. &quot;I lived in Third World conditions without having to go overseas.&quot; Vasquez&#x27;s family lived in a trailer in Watsonville, California, and worked as migrant workers until Vasquez went to first grade. &quot;I remember that when I was very young, people who were homeless - they were called hobos then - would come up and bang on the door and literally ask for a meal. My mother would tell them to wait on the porch or wait outside and she would cook them a burrito, notwithstanding our own limitations. I watched this over and over again,&quot; he said, so much so that it became known, &quot;If you needed a meal, go down to the Vasquez house.&quot; The family moved to Orange County, California, where his father went to work in a furniture factory in Los Angeles and eventually to the Apostolic Church in Orange, where he served as Pastor until his passing. Vasquez went to Orange High School in Orange, to Santa Ana College and then on to the University of Redlands. &quot;I was the first one to graduate college,&quot; Vasquez said.

Vasquez has been awarded five honorary doctorate degrees and has served as a Trustee/Professor at Chapman University, Orange, California. He has served as commencement speaker at Chapman University, Vanguard University, University of Wisconsin at Madison, James Madison University, University of La Verne, University of San Diego, California State University, Fullerton, California State University San Marcos, Walsh University, Houghton College, University of Redlands, Concordia University, Irvine and Chaminade University in Hawaii.

==Orange County official==
Vasquez worked in the public sector for 22 years before his Peace Corps nomination, starting as a police officer for the city of Orange, California. He later worked as deputy appointments secretary for Governor George Deukmejian, followed by service as Chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Vasquez resigned this position in 1994 after the county&#x27;s bankruptcy. The Orange County bankruptcy changed the course of his political ambitions, eventually leading Vasquez to reach out to his Republican colleagues for help in re-creating his career.

In 1988 Vasquez addressed the Republican national convention and said that Hispanics shouldn&#x27;t support Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis for President just because Dukakis spoke Spanish. The Democratic nominee spoke Spanish, Vasquez said, but because of his liberal policies, &quot;he doesn&#x27;t speak our language.&quot;

==Peace Corps Director==
=== Controversy over appointment as Director===
Appointed as Director of Peace Corps under George W. Bush, Vasquez had donated $100,000 to Bush&#x27;s campaign and was criticized by former Volunteers for lacking experience with, or previous membership in, Peace Corps. Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post and New York Times editorialized against Vasquez&#x27;s nomination and returned Peace Corps volunteers signed a petition opposing his nomination. However Vasquez cleared the United States Senate Foreign Relations committee by a vote of 14–4, and was accepted in the full Senate on a voice vote.

===Accomplishments as Director===
Vasquez&#x27;s major initiatives and accomplishments as Peace Corps Director include: an agreement with Mexico in 2003 to host volunteers, emphasis on recruitment of minorities and of community college graduates, upgrading Peace Corps&#x27; infrastructure, especially IT upgrades in the online application tracking process, the Volunteer Delivery System, an emphasis on safety and security of volunteers (including the creation of a Situation Room at Peace Corps Headquarters), modifying Peace Corps&#x27; &quot;Five Year Rule&quot; for employment, and the expansion of the Peace Corps to one of its highest levels in 30 years. Vasquez visited 60 countries during his tenure as Director, meeting with volunteers in the field to advance the agency&#x27;s mission and goals of promoting world peace and friendship.

===Minority recruitment===
Vasquez placed a high priority on recruitment of minorities. During his confirmation hearings Vasquez said &quot;We all recognize that the face of America looks vastly different today than 40 years ago - or even 10 years ago. In step with those changes, I consider it a high priority to expand the diversity of the Peace Corps so that it becomes a true reflection of America. Diversity of ethnic backgrounds, life experiences and beliefs has strengthened our country in countless ways. And in doing so we achieve an opportunity to engage a broader segment of the American population in one of our nation&#x27;s greatest programs.&quot; Vasquez had a personal experience when he was visiting Morocco as Peace Corps Director that brought home to him the importance of his diversity initiatives. A young man stopped Vasquez and said, &quot;You don&#x27;t look like an American.&quot; And Vasquez answered, &quot;What do you mean, I don&#x27;t look like an American? Why do you say I don&#x27;t look like an American?&quot; He said, &quot;The color of your skin. You don&#x27;t look like an American.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, my grandparents came from Mexico to the United States, pursuing dreams and opportunities.&quot; By the end of Vasquez&#x27;s tenure, 16 percent of the 7,810 volunteers were minorities — the highest percentage since the agency began collecting data on volunteer diversity.

===National Call to Service program===
Portions of the sometimes controversial expansion were successfully challenged by the Returned Peace Corps Volunteer community when former volunteers and the National Peace Corps Association raised objections to the continued inclusion of Peace Corps in the National Call to Service program, which had been used to allow military service members with at least three years and three months of military service completed, to finish their service obligation in the Peace Corps. Vasquez argued unsuccessfully for continued inclusion of the Peace Corps in that program, and the Peace Corps was removed from the National Call to Service program on December 22, 2005, when the United States Senate completed congressional action on the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006.

===Political briefings at Peace Corps Headquarters===
On July 24, 2007, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that during the tenure of Gaddi Vasquez as Peace Corps Director a &quot;general political briefing&quot; occurred at the Peace Corps headquarters after the 2002 midterm elections. Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is seeking to determine whether the meetings complied with Hatch Act of 1939 that bars the use of federal resources—including office buildings, phones and computers—for partisan purposes. On July 25, 2007, in Senate subcommittee hearings chaired by Senator Chris Dodd, Peace Corps Director Ron Tschetter disclosed that approximately fifteen Peace Corps officials including then Director Gaddi Vasquez attended one of the political briefings at Peace Corps Headquarters. In testimony before the committee, Tschetter said that he did not condone the meetings and that in his opinion they should not have happened. Dodd concluded by saying that &quot;The reputation of this institution suffers when that happens. We have a reputation and we have a good one over the years and to have it soiled because people want to turn it into a political operation is something that I am not going to tolerate at all and I will call for heads if there are still people there involved in this. They should know better than this, to engage in that kind of activity.&quot;

==Ambassador to FAO==

Vasquez resigned as Peace Corps Director September 7, 2006, after he was confirmed as the new United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture in Rome, Italy. &quot;The first day I went to work at the U.N., I was led into the governing council&#x27;s meeting room for my first meeting,&quot; said Vasquez. &quot;You see the nameplates around the table – France. U.K. Italy. United States of America. That&#x27;s one of those moments you stop in your tracks and reflect on where you&#x27;ve been and what you&#x27;re doing,&quot; Vasquez said. &quot;I am fortunate, and blessed.&quot;

To publicize work done by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Programme to help reduce poverty and make agriculture more productive, Ambassador Vasquez accompanied journalists on media tours to Mali in December, 2006 and to Guatemala and Honduras in May, 2007. His trips aim to increase visibility for the anti-hunger efforts of the United States and the international community around the world.

Vasquez has also spoken out on hunger to groups in the United States. In an address to the Orange Rotarians in Orange County, California on January 24, 2008, Vasquez talked about the $1 billion that the United States spends on food aid every year and how part of Vasquez&#x27;s job is to make sure that money is spent as wisely as possible. &quot;Over 840 million people suffer from chronic malnutrition,&quot; Vasquez said. &quot;My hope is to raise your awareness. Consider how you can contribute to this effort.&quot;

The Daily Titan reported on April 21, 2008, that Vasquez had been the keynote speaker at the &#x27;Connecting Worlds&quot; conference at California State Fullerton speaking to about 250 conference members about global hunger. Vasquez said his life had been transformed while Director of the Peace Corps by the things he had witnessed traveling all over the world and recounted that once while in the Caribbean he had encountered a boy to whom he gave a piece of candy. The boy broke the candy in three, ate one piece and sold the other two. &quot;This is the desperation some parts of the world are reaching,&quot; Vasquez said.

In October 2008, Vasquez visited Colombia accompanied by seven Latin American journalists. Vasquez visited a small sausage factory built with support from USAID that now employs 12 people and is providing food to the community. &quot;It&#x27;s a small thing but very significant, because it is sustainable entrepreneurship and is providing jobs,&quot; Vasquez said.
