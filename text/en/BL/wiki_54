<text>The Danish People&#x27;s Party (DPP; , DF) is a nationalist and right-wing populist political party in Denmark. It was formed in 1995 by former members of the Progress Party (FrP).

The party saw a period of significant growth after its founding and lent its support to the –Conservative People&#x27;s Party coalition government that ruled from the general election of 2001 until the 2011 election defeat. While not part of the cabinet, DF cooperated closely with the governing coalition on most issues and received support for key political stances in return, to the point that the government was commonly referred to as the &quot;VKO-government&quot; (O being DF&#x27;s election symbol). It also provided parliamentary support to Lars Løkke Rasmussen&#x27;s cabinets from 2016 to 2019, again without participating in it. In the 2014 European Parliament election in Denmark, DF secured 27% of the vote as part of the European Conservatives and Reformists group. This was followed by receiving 21% of the vote in the 2015 general election, becoming the second largest party in Denmark for the first time.

However, since 2015, the party has since seen a decline in support, falling to 3rd place and 10.8% of the vote in the 2019 European Parliament election in Denmark, and to just 8.7% in the 2019 Danish general election, resulting in a loss of 21 seats and a return to opposition. The party would later lose over half of its seats in the 2021 Danish local elections, losing 130 of the 221 it held before the election, achieving just 4.1% of the vote. Some commentators attributed the losses to internal conditions within the party and conflicts with the leadership, its perceived indecisiveness in government and rival parties adopting many of its policy ideas. The DF would also suffer a number of defections during 2022 following the rise of the Denmark Democrats party which many former DF members and supporters joined. It would receive its worst general election result ever in 2022, when it only won five seats. , due to defections from Nye Borgerlige, DF now has seven of the seats in the Danish Folketing.

==History==
The party&#x27;s popularity has grown since its inception, taking 25 seats in the 179-member Folketing in the 2007 parliamentary election (13.8% of the vote, remaining the third largest party in Denmark). In the 2011 parliamentary election, while maintaining its position as the third largest party, DF received 12.3% of the vote, marking its first electoral decline.

=== Kjærsgaard leadership (1995–2012) ===

==== Early years (1995–2001) ====

The Danish People&#x27;s Party was founded on 6 October 1995, after Pia Kjærsgaard, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, broke out from the Progress Party. Its first national convention was held in Vissenbjerg on 1 June 1996, where Pia Kjærsgaard was unanimously elected as the party&#x27;s chairman. The party was established in protest over the &quot;anarchistic conditions&quot; of the Progress Party, and its &quot;all or nothing&quot; policies. It was initially seen by many as a &quot;clone&quot; of the Progress Party, but this was soon proved false. In a struggle to be respected as a responsible party able to cooperate with others and distance it from the conditions in the Progress Party, the leadership of the party struck down criticism from its members by means of expulsions. The party saw a highly centralized party leadership as necessary, as it would not tolerate internal conflicts and disagreements with the official strategy.

The party was the first successful parliamentary party in the Nordic countries to relate philosophically more closely to the French &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;, than to the previous Nordic form of right-wing populism. DF represented a synthesis of several political currents: the Lutheran movement &quot;Tidehverv&quot; and its related journal, an intellectual nationalist right from the &quot;Danish Association&quot; (&quot;Den Danske Forening&quot;) and conservative populists from the Progress Party.

In 1997, the party won about 7% in the municipal elections, and did very well in traditional left-wing municipalities, potentially rivaling the Social Democrats. By 1998, the party had 2,500 registered members. The party made its electoral debut in the 1998 Danish parliamentary election, winning 13 seats and 7.4% of the vote. The party was, however, left with no influence in the formation of a government; it was shut out in large part due to the perception that it was not &quot;t&quot; (i.e. not acceptable or &quot;housebroken&quot;).

==== Venstre-Conservative coalitions (2001–2011) ====

In the 2001 election, the party won 12% of the vote and 22 seats in parliament. It became the third largest party in the parliament, giving them a key position, as they would have a parliamentary majority together with the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and . DF was favoured by these parties, as it had supported the candidate for Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, during the election campaign. Eventually, it gave its parliamentary support for a -Conservative coalition government, headed by Prime Minister Rasmussen, in exchange for the implementation of some of their key demands, first and foremost stricter policies on immigration. The party had a key role in writing the rules and conditions for immigration in the immigration law that was established by the government in May 2002, which it called &quot;Europe&#x27;s strictest&quot;.

In the 2005 election, the party further increased their vote, and won 13.2% of the vote and 24 seats. With young first-time voters the party was even more popular, receiving one fifth of their votes. The party continued to support the government, and developed a broader policy base, as it made welfare policies its core issue, together with immigration policies.

In 2006, the party&#x27;s popularity rose dramatically in opinion polls following the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy, at the expense of the Social Democrats. The average of all monthly national polls showed DF gaining seven seats in parliament from January to February, with the Social Democrats losing an equal number. This effect, however, somewhat waned with the falling media attention to the cartoons controversy.

In the 2007 parliamentary election, DF won 13.9% and 25 seats, and again continued to support the Conservative-Liberal government. Thus, in every election since its founding the party has had a steady growth, although the growth rate has stagnated somewhat in recent years. Parties in the political centre, particularly the newly founded New Alliance had sought to become the kingmaker and be able to isolate the immigration policies of DF, but eventually failed. The party was a member of the Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy (MELD).

In the 2009 elections for the European Parliament, the prime candidate for the party, Morten Messerschmidt, won his seat in a landslide with 284,500 personal votes (most votes for any single candidate by any party); thus giving the party a second seat (which went to Anna Rosbach Andersen). The party made a breakthrough from its previous results in European elections, more than doubling its vote to 15.3%, and receiving 2 MEPs.

On 15 September 2012, Kristian Thuesen Dahl succeeded Kjærsgaard as chairman.

=== Thulesen Dahl leadership (2012–2022) ===
During the 2015 election, the DF won 21.08% of the national vote under the leadership of Kristian Thulesen Dahl, the highest since its founding and gained 37 seats putting the party in second place. In the aftermath, the party entered negotiations with to again provide parliamentary support in return for stricter policies on immigration and the EU. A minority government headed by Lars Løkke Rasmussen was subsequently formed with the DF, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party providing support.

The party suffered a major defeat in the 2019 election, recording its worst result since 1998. It won just 8.7% of the vote and 16 seats, a net loss of 21 seats since 2015; it fell to third place, just narrowly outpolling the Social Liberals. Some journalists and political commentators opined that the DF&#x27;s loss in support was as a result of the party&#x27;s refusal and indecisiveness on taking direct part in government and the main parties including the Social Democrats adopting many of the DF&#x27;s policies on immigration and integration.

In January 2022, Dahl stood down as leader and was replaced by Morten Messerschmidt in a leadership election where he won 499 out of the 828 delegators&#x27; votes against two other candidates. After Messerschmidt, a total of 11 out of 16 MPs had in June left the party including Thuelsen Dahl who was the only one of them who passed on his seat to the next in line.

=== Messerschmidt leadership (2022–present) ===
At the 2022 election, the party suffered its worst election result ever with 2.6% of the vote, equal to 5 seats. In December 2022, Morten Messerschmidt was acquitted of all charges related to prior allegations of misuse of EU funds according to several political analysts and commentators, paving the way for a restoration of the party. During January and February 2023, Mikkel Bjørn and Mette Thiesen, who were both elected for Nye Borgerlige, joined the Danish People&#x27;s Party, increasing its seat count to seven.

As of September 2024 the Danish People&#x27;s Party has seen its support increased to around 4% in the polls.

== Ideology and policies ==

DF is a nationalist and right-wing populist party. It is positioned on the right-wing to far-right of the political spectrum. The DF&#x27;s stated goals are to protect the freedom and cultural heritage of the Danish people, including the family, the monarchy and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark, to enforce a strict rule of law, to work against Denmark becoming a multi-cultural society by limiting immigration and promoting cultural assimilation of admitted immigrants, to maintain a strong welfare system for those in need, and to promote entrepreneurship and economic growth by strengthening education and encouraging people to work, to protect the environment and natural resources, and to protect Danish sovereignty against the European Union. In comparison to its predecessor, the Progress Party, the DF focuses more on immigration, while at the same time being more pragmatic on other topics. While overall considered part of the radical right, its policies on most economic issues would rather place the party in the centre to centre-left. The party&#x27;s former leader, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, once declared DF an anti-Muslim party.

===Immigration===

DF is opposed to immigration. The party holds that Denmark is not naturally a country of immigration. The party also does not accept a multi-ethnic transformation of Denmark, and rejects multiculturalism. Former party leader Pia Kjærsgaard stated she did &quot;not want Denmark as a multiethnic, multicultural society&quot;, and that a multiethnic Denmark would be a &quot;national disaster&quot;. The party seeks to drastically reduce non-Western immigration and favors cultural assimilation of immigrants from all religions. In 2010, the party proposed to put a complete stop to all immigration from non-Western countries, a continuation of a proposal the month before to toughen the 24-year rule. They do, however, make the distinction between immigrants, those who intend to stay in Denmark permanently, and refugees, those that will only be in Denmark for the duration of the conflict, but ultimately intend to return home. The party has stated that it is more than happy to help those in need, but have a moral responsibility to the people of Denmark to keep Denmark Danish.

Cooperation with the Conservative-Liberal coalition government resulted in the implementation of some of their key demands, most importantly strong restrictions in immigration policies, which have resulted in what is often described as Europe&#x27;s strictest immigration laws. The new government enacted rules that prevented Danish citizens and others from bringing a foreign spouse into the country unless both partners were aged 24 or above, passed a solvency test showing the Dane had not claimed social security for 12 months, and could lodge a bond of 60,011 kroner (about US$10,100). One declared aim of this was to fight arranged marriages. These new rules had the effect that while about 8,151 family reunification permits were granted in 2002, the number had fallen to 3,525 by 2005. Some social benefits for refugees were also cut by 30-40% during their first seven years in power. Ordinary unemployment benefits were replaced by a reduced &quot;start-up aid&quot;. Whereas the government coalition&#x27;s declared aim with this was to improve integration by inciting people to work, immigration spokesman Søren Krarup of DF has expressed his content in that the start-up aid has decreased the number of economic refugees greatly, showing them that &quot;one does not find gold on the street, as has been told out in the third world&quot;. Nevertheless, total immigration increased post implementation of the migration reforms.

=== Domestic policy ===
The party advocates stricter punishments for crimes such as rape, violence, sexual abuse, reckless driving, and cruelty to animals. It supports grants for specific research into terrorism, Islamism, and Cold War history as well as increased defense spending. It also wants to maintain the Danish monarchy and the current Danish constitution, and to abolish the &#x27;hate speech&#x27; clause in the Danish criminal code.

===Economy===
The party is considered to be the first pure example of a radical right-wing populist (RRP) party in Denmark; as such the party was described as the &quot;pioneer of welfare chauvinism&quot;. According to &quot;Scandinavian Political Studies&quot;, the success of the party in the 2015 election was not based only on its hardline stance towards immigration, but also its support for pro-welfare, redistributive policies that voters considered highly neglected by the Social Democrats. This made &quot;economic insecurity, marginalization, regional core–periphery divides&quot; the decisive factors of the 2015 election. In the 2019 Danish general election, Social Democrats were then able to regain voters they lost to Danish People&#x27;s Party by sharply turning left on welfare and redistribution, as well as shifting right on social issues by adopting &quot;left-conservative&quot; stances. DPP was therefore classified as economically left and socially right-wing, as it shares its voter base with a “left conservative” social democratic party, which Social Democrats became between 2015 and 2019. 

Despite its right-wing orientation, Danish People&#x27;s Party stands to the left of center on the issues of economic and welfare, favouring staunchly left-wing policies towards the elderly. However, the party also has a strong welfare chauvinist policy, and has some conservative inclinations on income benefits. While the populist nature of the party could make its program appear blurry and constantly oscillating between the economic centre and economic left, its economic stance is much closer to Social Democrats and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party than the centre-left Danish Social Liberal Party. DPP largely tried to imitate the traditionally left-wing economic policies; this made DPP a &quot;working-class party&quot; that was able to attract manual workers at odds with the stance of left-wing Danish parties on socio-cultural issues. Prior to 2015, these voters would still vote for traditional left-wing parties as long as they identified with their economic positions and saw them as defenders of the working class.

Norwegian political scientist Anders Ravik Jupskås described Danish People&#x27;s Party as a unique right-wing populist party that appeals to &quot;authoritarian working class&quot; and presents a platform that is &quot;a combination of left-wing economics and nativist immigration policies&quot;. The party described itself as the &quot;true defender of the Danish welfare state&quot; and campaigned on excluding immigrants from the Danish welfare state as the best way to protect it. However, the party also spoke in favour of increasing spending for Danish pensions and healthcare, and it was found that the party&#x27;s voteres &quot;most unanimously favour increasing expenditures, even in comparison with social democrats and left wing voters&quot;. The party warned against the creeping market liberalisation and attacked neoliberalism and globalization on both economic and social perspectives, which allowed it to make inroads with working-class voters. The party also promised to empower trade unions and entered cooperation agreements with minor unions and workers&#x27; associations. The party wants to improve conditions for the elderly and disabled.

Under Messerschmidt&#x27;s leadership, the party has moved in a more economic liberal direction, advocating tax cuts.

=== Foreign policy ===

The party supported Danish participation in France&#x27;s Operation Serval against Islamist fighters in Mali. However, it opposed proposals for Danish involvement in the Syrian Civil War.

==== Europe ==== 
The party opposes a cession of Denmark&#x27;s sovereignty to the European Union and opposes further EU integration and Eurofederalism. It also opposes the Euro currency and wants to maintain the Danish krone. It is also against the potential accession of Turkey to the European Union. DF is Eurosceptic.

In 2007, the party opposed the Danish government&#x27;s plan to recognise the independence of Kosovo, and maintained the territorial integrity of Serbia. 

Although the party supports Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War, it has stated that its support has an &quot;expiration date&quot;, and expressed opposition to Ukrainian EU membership, criticising the Ukrainian government&#x27;s approach to rule of law. In July 2024, the party&#x27;s MEP Anders Vistisen proposed a motion stating there is &quot;no military solution to the conflict and that peace is the only viable and sustainable solution&quot;, urging Ukraine and Russia to conduct peace talks. In 2025, party leader Morten Messerschmidt called for a scaling back of Danish military support for Ukraine, advocated for Ukraine to make territorial concessions to secure peace and expressed opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership while it remains in a state of war.

==== NATO ====
The DF also supports Danish membership of NATO. The party initially voted in favour of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but in 2014, the foreign affairs spokesman Søren Espersen said this support had been mistaken and that the rule of former dictator Saddam Hussein was &quot;far preferable&quot; to the events that followed. He claimed the party had &quot;blindly followed&quot; Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen at the time of the invasion.

The party supported Danish enforcement of a no-fly zone during the 2011 military intervention in Libya, but was initially sceptical of proposals for direct Danish military involvement. The party later supported the decision out of solidarity with NATO. The party leadership subsequently supported extending the Danish mission in Libya, despite the disagreement of its defense spokesman Ib Poulsen. Three years after the intervention, foreign affairs spokesman Espersen stated the party&#x27;s support for the intervention was a &quot;mistake&quot; and predicated on a misunderstanding of the ideology of the Libyan rebels.

==== Middle East ====
The DF is supportive of Israel and opposes the recognition of Palestine on the grounds that there is no effective Palestinian state, and wants to move the Danish embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. 

==== Asia ====
The party seeks international recognition of Taiwan and supports Taiwan in its disputes with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Analysis of vote==

* An analysis by the trade union SiD after the 2001 election stated that among unskilled workers aged under 40, 30% voted for DF and only 25% for the Social Democrats.
* Decreased importance of &quot;economic cleavage&quot;: Several authors believe that the political &quot;cleavages&quot; of European societies have changed over recent decades Contemporary Western European democracies are characterized by two major cleavage dimensions: the economic cleavage dimension, which pits workers against the capital, and which concerns the degree of state involvement in the economy, and the socio-cultural cleavage dimension.
* Referendums brought the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty and the Euro. The DF has managed to harness this scepticism more effectively than others.

One feature, compared to other Danish parties, is that the Danish People&#x27;s Party is usually underrepresented by about 1-1.5% in opinion polls. Election researchers have suggested that the party&#x27;s voters may be less interested in politics, and therefore declining to talk to pollsters, or that voters are reluctant to reveal their support for the party to pollsters.

== Organization == 
=== Leaders ===
The party has had the following leaders since its foundation:


===International affiliations===
The Danish People&#x27;s Party distanced itself from the Sweden Democrats until 2010, when Pia Kjærsgaard travelled to Sweden to support the Sweden Democrats&#x27; election campaign. Danish People&#x27;s Party foreign affairs spokesman Søren Espersen subsequently hosted the Sweden Democrats and said both parties would work together in the Nordic Council, with the parties ultimately forming the Nordic Freedom group in 2012.

In the European Parliament, the Danish People&#x27;s Party was initially part of Union for Europe of the Nations group from 1999 to 2009, alongside parties like the Polish Law and Justice and the Italian Lega Nord and National Alliance, as well as the associated Alliance for Europe of the Nations pan-European political party. In 2009, it joined the UK Independence Party-led Europe of Freedom and Democracy group and the associated Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy alliance, alongside its Nordic ally, the Finns Party. In 2014, along with the Finns Party, it moved to the British Conservative Party-dominated European Conservatives and Reformists group, and threatened to cut ties with the Sweden Democrats if they continued negotiations to join a new group involving the French National Front (FN) and the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). Despite this, in 2019, the DF itself announced it would join a new European Parliament group led by the Lega Nord&#x27;s Matteo Salvini called Identity and Democracy (ID), which also involved the FN and FPÖ. During a 2024 bid by the FN&#x27;s successor, the National Rally, to exclude Alternative for Germany (AfD) from the ID Group, the DF stated that the AfD could only remain in the group if it expelled Maximilian Krah, and later joined the RN in voting to expel the AfD. After the 2024 European Parliament election, the DF joined the Patriots for Europe group, which was founded by the Hungarian Fidesz, the FPÖ and the Czech ANO 2011.

In September 2024, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella visited Copenhagen to address the party conference and establish a &quot;working partnership&quot; with the DF.

<text>The basset horn (sometimes hyphenated as basset-horn) is a member of the clarinet family of musical instruments.

==Construction and tone==
Like the clarinet, the instrument is a wind instrument with a single reed and a cylindrical bore. However, the basset horn is larger and has a bend or a kink between the mouthpiece and the upper joint (older instruments are typically curved or bent in the middle), and while the clarinet is typically a transposing instrument in B or A (meaning a written C sounds as a B or A), the basset horn is typically in F (less often in G). Finally, the basset horn has additional keys for an extended range down to written C, which sounds F at the bottom of the bass staff. In comparison, the alto clarinet typically extends down to written E♭, which sounds G♭, one semitone higher than the basset horn. The timbre of the basset horn is similar to the alto clarinet&#x27;s, but darker. Basset horns in A, G, E, E, and D were also made; the first of these is closely related to the basset clarinet.

The basset horn is not related to the horn, or other members of the brass family (Sachs-Hornbostel classification 423.121.2 or 423.23); it does, however, bear a distant relationship to the hornpipe and cor anglais. Its name probably derives from the resemblance of early, curved versions to the horn of some animal.

Some of the earliest basset horns, which are believed to date from the 1760s, bear an inscription &quot;ANT et MICH MAYRHOFER INVEN. &amp; ELABOR. PASSAVII&quot;, which has been interpreted to mean they were made by Anton and Michael Mayrhofer of Passau.

Modern basset horns can be divided into three basic types, distinguished primarily by bore size and, consequently, the mouthpieces with which they are played:

*The small-bore basset horn has a bore diameter in the range of (still somewhat larger than a soprano clarinet bore, though it is often erroneously thought to be the same; even a large bore English clarinet, such as the old B&amp;H 1010 design has a smaller bore of ). It is played with a B/A clarinet mouthpiece. Only the Selmer Company (Paris) and Stephen Fox (Canada) currently make this model.
*The medium-bore basset horn has a bore diameter in the region of or slightly less. This is the most common type made by German-system manufacturers (e.g., Otmar Hammerschmidt (Austria)). Since no French-style mouthpiece with an appropriate bore is mass-produced, this model requires a matching German basset-horn mouthpiece. (This model is not usually recognized in North America, where it is confused with the large-bore type described below.) Stephen Fox currently makes this model also.
*The large-bore basset horn, with a bore diameter of about and played with an alto-clarinet mouthpiece, is in constructional terms an alto clarinet pitched in F and with the extra basset notes. The Leblanc basset horns (bores about ) are of this type.

The current Buffet basset horn could be called a hybrid &quot;medium-large bore&quot; model, since it uses an alto-clarinet mouthpiece but has a bore diameter around .

== Historical instruments ==

==Repertoire==
A number of composers of the classical period wrote for the basset horn, and the famous 18th-century clarinettist Anton Stadler, as well as his younger brother Johann, played it. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was by far the most notable composer for the basset horn, including three basset horns in the &quot;Maurerische Trauermusik&quot; (Masonic Funeral Music), K. 477, and two in both the &quot;Gran Partita&quot;, K. 361, and the &quot;Requiem&quot;, K. 626, and several of his operas, such as &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, &quot;La Clemenza di Tito&quot; which features Vitellia&#x27;s great aria &quot;Non più di fiori&quot; with basset-horn &quot;obbligato&quot;, and &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, where they prominently accompany the &quot;March of the Priests&quot;, as well as chamber works. He wrote dozens of pieces for basset horn ensembles. (His Clarinet Concerto in A Major, KV 622, however, appears originally to have been written for a clarinet with an extended lower range, a basset clarinet in A, though there is an earlier version of part of the first movement, KV 621b in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart&#x27;s works, scored for G basset horn and pitched a major second lower, in the key of G major.) The Clarinet Quintet in A major (K. 581) has also been performed on basset horn by Teddy Ezra with other members of the Else Ensemble.

Other early works for basset horn include a concerto for basset horn in G and small orchestra by Carl Stamitz, which has been arranged for conventional basset horn in F (it has been recorded on this instrument by Sabine Meyer), and a concerto in F by Heinrich Backofen.

In the 19th century Felix Mendelssohn wrote two pieces for basset horn, clarinet, and piano (opus 113 and 114). These were later scored for string orchestra. Franz Danzi wrote a Sonata in F, for basset horn and piano, Op. 62 (1824) Antonín Dvořák attempted a half-hearted revival, using the instrument in his Czech Suite (1879), in which he specifies that an English horn (cor anglais) may be used instead, but the instrument was largely abandoned until Richard Strauss took it up once more in his operas &quot;Elektra&quot; (1909), &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, &quot;Daphne&quot;, &quot;Die Liebe der Danae&quot;, and &quot;Capriccio&quot;, and several later works, including two wind sonatinas (Happy Workshop and Invalid&#x27;s Workshop). Franz Schreker also employed the instrument in a few works including the operas &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot; and &quot;Irrelohe&quot;. Roger Sessions included a basset horn in the orchestra of his Violin Concerto (1935), where it opens the slow movement in a lengthy duet with the solo violin. In the last quarter of the 20th century and first decade of the 21st, Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote extensively for basset horn, giving it a prominent place in his cycle of operas &quot;Licht&quot; and other pieces.

===Other works===
*&quot;Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind&quot; for solo clarinetist (soprano clarinets, basset horn, and bass clarinet) and string quartet by Osvaldo Golijov; later arranged for solo clarinetist and string orchestra.
*Serenade on Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s Oberon for basset horn and two guitars, op. 28, written by Heinrich Neumann.
*Etudes for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 39 (1992) by Peter Schat calls for 3 basset horns in the orchestra.
*Serenade for 12 Instruments, Op. 61b (1915) by Josef Holbrooke calls for both corni di bassetto and oboe d&#x27;amore.

== Basset horn soloists and ensembles ==

The Lotz Trio performs on replicas of the basset-horns made by the 18th-century instrument maker Theodor Lotz of Pressburg (Bratislava) and Vienna. The ensemble presents a repertoire of popular 18th-century &quot;wind harmonias&quot; (known in German as &quot;Harmoniemusik&quot;) represented predominantly by Mozart&#x27;s music. However, the ensemble also performs music by other central-European composers – Georg Druschetzky, Martín I Soler, Anton Stadler, Vojtech Nudera, Johann Josef Rösler and Anton Wolanek.

The Prague Trio of Basset-horns, based in the Czech Republic, has a repertoire of music written or transcribed for three basset horns, by composers including Mozart, Scott Joplin, and Paul Desmond.

Suzanne Stephens was a leading basset-horn specialist in contemporary music. Starting in 1974, the German Karlheinz Stockhausen composed many new works for her, including a large number for basset-horn with a solo rolo in his opera &quot;LIGHT&quot;. Other interprets of Stockhausens music are among others the Dutch Fie Schouten and the Italian Michele Marelli.

==Alternative usage==
The Italian name for the instrument, &quot;corno di bassetto&quot;, was used by Bernard Shaw as a pseudonym when writing music criticism.

==See also==
*Alto clarinet (a somewhat similar instrument that does not have the lower extension keys and has a bass range that typically begins one semitone higher, more commonly used in concert bands than as a solo instrument, in chamber music, or in orchestras)

<doc id="403165" wikidata="Q2585642" url="?curid=403165" title="Maximum flow problem">
<text>In optimization theory, maximum flow problems involve finding a feasible flow through a flow network that obtains the maximum possible flow rate.

The maximum flow problem can be seen as a special case of more complex network flow problems, such as the circulation problem. The maximum value of an s-t flow (i.e., flow from source s to sink t) is equal to the minimum capacity of an s-t cut (i.e., cut severing s from t) in the network, as stated in the max-flow min-cut theorem.

==History==
The maximum flow problem was first formulated in 1954 by T. E. Harris and F. S. Ross as a simplified model of Soviet railway traffic flow.
In 1955, Lester R. Ford, Jr. and Delbert R. Fulkerson created the first known algorithm, the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm. In their 1955 paper, Ford and Fulkerson wrote that the problem of Harris and Ross is formulated as follows (see p. 5):Consider a rail network connecting two cities by way of a number of intermediate cities, where each link of the network has a number assigned to it representing its capacity. Assuming a steady state condition, find a maximal flow from one given city to the other.In their book &quot;Flows in Networks&quot;, in 1962, Ford and Fulkerson wrote:It was posed to the authors in the spring of 1955 by T. E. Harris, who, in conjunction with General F. S. Ross (Ret.), had formulated a simplified model of railway traffic flow, and pinpointed this particular problem as the central one suggested by the model [11].where [11] refers to the 1955 secret report &quot;Fundamentals of a Method for Evaluating Rail net Capacities&quot; by Harris and Ross (see p. 5).

Over the years, various improved solutions to the maximum flow problem were discovered, notably the shortest augmenting path algorithm of Edmonds and Karp and independently Dinitz; the blocking flow algorithm of Dinitz; the push-relabel algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan; and the binary blocking flow algorithm of Goldberg and Rao. The algorithms of Sherman and Kelner, Lee, Orecchia and Sidford, respectively, find an approximately optimal maximum flow but only work in undirected graphs.

In 2013 James B. Orlin published a paper describing an formula_1 algorithm.

In 2022 Li Chen, Rasmus Kyng, Yang P. Liu, Richard Peng, Maximilian Probst Gutenberg, and Sushant Sachdeva published an almost-linear time algorithm running in formula_2 for the minimum-cost flow problem of which for the maximum flow problem is a particular case. For the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem with negative weights another particular case of minimum-cost flow problem an algorithm in almost-linear time has also been reported. Both algorithms were deemed best papers at the 2022 Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science.

==Definition==
First we establish some notation:
* Let formula_3 be a network with formula_4 being the source and the sink of formula_5 respectively. 
* If formula_6 is a function on the edges of formula_5 then its value on formula_8 is denoted by formula_9 or formula_10

Definition. The capacity of an edge is the maximum amount of flow that can pass through an edge. Formally it is a map formula_11

Definition. A flow is a map formula_12 that satisfies the following:
*&quot;Capacity constraint&quot;. The flow of an edge cannot exceed its capacity, in other words: formula_13 for all formula_14
* &quot;Conservation of flows.&quot; The sum of the flows entering a node must equal the sum of the flows exiting that node, except for the source and the sink. Or:
::formula_15

&quot;Remark&quot;. Flows are skew symmetric: formula_16 for all formula_14

Definition. The value of flow is the amount of flow passing from the source to the sink. Formally for a flow formula_18 it is given by:
:formula_19

Definition. The maximum flow problem is to route as much flow as possible from the source to the sink, in other words find the flow formula_20 with maximum value.

Note that several maximum flows may exist, and if arbitrary real (or even arbitrary rational) values of flow are permitted (instead of just integers), there is either exactly one maximum flow, or infinitely many, since there are infinitely many linear combinations of the base maximum flows. In other words, if we send formula_21 units of flow on edge formula_22 in one maximum flow, and formula_23 units of flow on formula_22 in another maximum flow, then for each formula_25 we can send formula_26 units on formula_22 and route the flow on remaining edges accordingly, to obtain another maximum flow. If flow values can be any real or rational numbers, then there are infinitely many such formula_28 values for each pair formula_29.

==Algorithms==
The following table lists algorithms for solving the maximum flow problem.
Here, formula_30 and formula_31 denote the number of vertices and edges of the network.
The value formula_32 refers to the largest edge capacity after rescaling all capacities to integer values
(if the network contains irrational capacities, formula_32 may be infinite).

For additional algorithms, see .

==Integral flow theorem==
The integral flow theorem states that
: If each edge in a flow network has integral capacity, then there exists an integral maximal flow.

The claim is not only that the value of the flow is an integer, which follows directly from the max-flow min-cut theorem, but that the flow on &quot;every edge&quot; is integral. This is crucial for many combinatorial applications (see below), where the flow across an edge may encode whether the item corresponding to that edge is to be included in the set sought or not.

==Application==

===Multi-source multi-sink maximum flow problem===

Given a network formula_3 with a set of sources formula_35 and a set of sinks formula_36 instead of only one source and one sink, we are to find the maximum flow across formula_5. We can transform the multi-source multi-sink problem into a maximum flow problem by adding a &quot;consolidated source&quot; connecting to each vertex in formula_38 and a &quot;consolidated sink &quot;connected by each vertex in formula_39 (also known as &quot;supersource&quot; and &quot;supersink&quot;) with infinite capacity on each edge (See Fig. 4.1.1.).

===Maximum cardinality bipartite matching===

Given a bipartite graph formula_40, we are to find a maximum cardinality matching in formula_41, that is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges. This problem can be transformed into a maximum flow problem by constructing a network formula_42, where
# formula_43 contains the edges in formula_41 directed from formula_45 to formula_46.
# formula_47 for each formula_48 and formula_49 for each formula_50.
# formula_51 for each formula_52 (See Fig. 4.3.1).

Then the value of the maximum flow in formula_5 is equal to the size of the maximum matching in formula_41, and a maximum cardinality matching can be found by taking those edges that have flow formula_55 in an integral max-flow.

===Minimum path cover in directed acyclic graph===
Given a directed acyclic graph formula_56, we are to find the minimum number of vertex-disjoint paths to cover each vertex in formula_30. We can construct a bipartite graph formula_58 from formula_41, where
# formula_60
# formula_61
# formula_62.

Then it can be shown that formula_63 has a matching formula_64 of size formula_65 if and only if formula_41 has a vertex-disjoint path cover formula_67 containing formula_65 edges and formula_69 paths, where formula_70 is the number of vertices in formula_41. Therefore, the problem can be solved by finding the maximum cardinality matching in formula_63 instead.

Assume we have found a matching formula_64 of formula_63, and constructed the cover formula_67 from it. Intuitively, if two vertices formula_76 are matched in formula_64, then the edge formula_78 is contained in formula_67. Clearly the number of edges in formula_67 is formula_65. To see that formula_67 is vertex-disjoint, consider the following:
# Each vertex formula_83 in formula_63 can either be &quot;non-matched&quot; in formula_64, in which case there are no edges leaving formula_86 in formula_67; or it can be &quot;matched&quot;, in which case there is exactly one edge leaving formula_86 in formula_67. In either case, no more than one edge leaves any vertex formula_86 in formula_67.
# Similarly for each vertex formula_92 in formula_63 – if it is matched, there is a single incoming edge into formula_86 in formula_67; otherwise formula_86 has no incoming edges in formula_67.
Thus no vertex has two incoming or two outgoing edges in formula_67, which means all paths in formula_67 are vertex-disjoint.

To show that the cover formula_67 has size formula_69, we start with an empty cover and build it incrementally. To add a vertex formula_22 to the cover, we can either add it to an existing path, or create a new path of length zero starting at that vertex. The former case is applicable whenever either formula_8 and some path in the cover starts at formula_86, or formula_105 and some path ends at formula_86. The latter case is always applicable. In the former case, the total number of edges in the cover is increased by 1 and the number of paths stays the same; in the latter case the number of paths is increased and the number of edges stays the same. It is now clear that after covering all formula_70 vertices, the sum of the number of paths and edges in the cover is formula_70. Therefore, if the number of edges in the cover is formula_65, the number of paths is formula_69.

===Maximum flow with vertex capacities===
Let formula_3 be a network. Suppose there is capacity at each node in addition to edge capacity, that is, a mapping formula_112 such that the flow formula_113 has to satisfy not only the capacity constraint and the conservation of flows, but also the vertex capacity constraint

:formula_114

In other words, the amount of flow passing through a vertex cannot exceed its capacity. To find the maximum flow across formula_5, we can transform the problem into the maximum flow problem in the original sense by expanding formula_5. First, each formula_117 is replaced by formula_118 and formula_119, where formula_118 is connected by edges going into formula_86 and formula_119 is connected to edges coming out from formula_86, then assign capacity formula_124 to the edge connecting formula_118 and formula_119 (see Fig. 4.4.1). In this expanded network, the vertex capacity constraint is removed and therefore the problem can be treated as the original maximum flow problem.

===Maximum number of paths from s to t===
Given a directed graph formula_56 and two vertices formula_128 and formula_129, we are to find the maximum number of paths from formula_128 to formula_129. This problem has several variants:

1. The paths must be edge-disjoint. This problem can be transformed to a maximum flow problem by constructing a network formula_3 from formula_41, with formula_128 and formula_129 being the source and the sink of formula_5 respectively, and assigning each edge a capacity of formula_55. In this network, the maximum flow is formula_138 iff there are formula_138 edge-disjoint paths.

2. The paths must be independent, i.e., vertex-disjoint (except for formula_128 and formula_129). We can construct a network formula_3 from formula_41 with vertex capacities, where the capacities of all vertices and all edges are formula_55. Then the value of the maximum flow is equal to the maximum number of independent paths from formula_128 to formula_129.

3. In addition to the paths being edge-disjoint and/or vertex disjoint, the paths also have a length constraint: we count only paths whose length is exactly formula_138, or at most formula_138. Most variants of this problem are NP-complete, except for small values of formula_138.

=== Closure problem ===

A closure of a directed graph is a set of vertices &quot;C&quot;, such that no edges leave &quot;C&quot;. The closure problem is the task of finding the maximum-weight or minimum-weight closure in a vertex-weighted directed graph. It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.

==Real world applications==

===Baseball elimination===

In the baseball elimination problem there are &quot;n&quot; teams competing in a league. At a specific stage of the league season, &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number of wins and &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the number of games left to play for team &quot;i&quot; and &quot;r&quot;ij is the number of games left against team &quot;j&quot;. A team is eliminated if it has no chance to finish the season in the first place. The task of the baseball elimination problem is to determine which teams are eliminated at each point during the season. Schwartz proposed a method which reduces this problem to maximum network flow. In this method a network is created to determine whether team &quot;k&quot; is eliminated.

Let &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) be a network with being the source and the sink respectively. One adds a game node&quot;ij&quot; – which represents the number of plays between these two teams. We also add a team node for each team and connect each game node with &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; to &quot;V&quot;, and connects each of them from &quot;s&quot; by an edge with capacity &quot;r&quot;&quot;ij&quot; – which represents the number of plays between these two teams. We also add a team node for each team and connect each game node with two team nodes &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; to ensure one of them wins. One does not need to restrict the flow value on these edges. Finally, edges are made from team node &quot;i&quot; to the sink node &quot;t&quot; and the capacity of is set to prevent team &quot;i&quot; from winning more than .
Let &quot;S&quot; be the set of all teams participating in the league and let 
:formula_150. 
In this method it is claimed team &quot;k&quot; is not eliminated if and only if a flow value of size &quot;r&quot;(&quot;S&quot; − {&quot;k&quot;}) exists in network &quot;G&quot;. In the mentioned article it is proved that this flow value is the maximum flow value from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;t&quot;.

===Airline scheduling===
In the airline industry a major problem is the scheduling of the flight crews. The airline scheduling problem can be considered as an application of extended maximum network flow. The input of this problem is a set of flights &quot;F&quot; which contains the information about where and when each flight departs and arrives. In one version of airline scheduling the goal is to produce a feasible schedule with at most &quot;k&quot; crews.

To solve this problem one uses a variation of the circulation problem called bounded circulation which is the generalization of network flow problems, with the added constraint of a lower bound on edge flows.

Let &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) be a network with as the source and the sink nodes. For the source and destination of every flight &quot;i&quot;, one adds two nodes to &quot;V&quot;, node &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; as the source and node &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; as the destination node of flight &quot;i&quot;. One also adds the following edges to &quot;E&quot;:
# An edge with capacity [0, 1] between &quot;s&quot; and each &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
# An edge with capacity [0, 1] between each &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;t&quot;.
# An edge with capacity [1, 1] between each pair of &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
# An edge with capacity [0, 1] between each &quot;d&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;s&quot;&quot;j&quot;, if source &quot;s&quot;&quot;j&quot; is reachable with a reasonable amount of time and cost from the destination of flight &quot;i&quot;.
# An edge with capacity [0, ∞] between &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;.

In the mentioned method, it is claimed and proved that finding a flow value of &quot;k&quot; in &quot;G&quot; between &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; is equal to finding a feasible schedule for flight set &quot;F&quot; with at most &quot;k&quot; crews.

Another version of airline scheduling is finding the minimum needed crews to perform all the flights. To find an answer to this problem, a bipartite graph is created where each flight has a copy in set &quot;A&quot; and set &quot;B&quot;. If the same plane can perform flight &quot;j&quot; after flight &quot;i&quot;, is connected to . A matching in induces a schedule for &quot;F&quot; and obviously maximum bipartite matching in this graph produces an airline schedule with minimum number of crews. As it is mentioned in the Application part of this article, the maximum cardinality bipartite matching is an application of maximum flow problem.

===Circulation–demand problem===
There are some factories that produce goods and some villages where the goods have to be delivered. They are connected by a networks of roads with each road having a capacity for maximum goods that can flow through it. The problem is to find if there is a circulation that satisfies the demand.
This problem can be transformed into a maximum-flow problem.
# Add a source node and add edges from it to every factory node with capacity where is the production rate of factory .
# Add a sink node and add edges from all villages to with capacity where is the demand rate of village .
Let &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) be this new network. There exists a circulation that satisfies the demand if and only if :
: formula_151.
If there exists a circulation, looking at the max-flow solution would give the answer as to how much goods have to be sent on a particular road for satisfying the demands.

The problem can be extended by adding a lower bound on the flow on some edges.

=== Image segmentation ===
In their book, Kleinberg and Tardos present an algorithm for segmenting an image. They present an algorithm to find the background and the foreground in an image. More precisely, the algorithm takes a bitmap as an input modelled as follows: &quot;ai&quot; ≥ 0 is the likelihood that pixel &quot;i&quot; belongs to the foreground, &quot;bi&quot; ≥ 0 in the likelihood that pixel &quot;i&quot; belongs to the background, and &quot;pij&quot; is the penalty if two adjacent pixels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are placed one in the foreground and the other in the background. The goal is to find a partition (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) of the set of pixels that maximize the following quantity

:formula_152,

Indeed, for pixels in &quot;A&quot; (considered as the foreground), we gain &quot;ai&quot;; for all pixels in &quot;B&quot; (considered as the background), we gain &quot;bi&quot;. On the border, between two adjacent pixels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, we loose &quot;pij&quot;. It is equivalent to minimize the quantity

:formula_153

because

:formula_154

We now construct the network whose nodes are the pixel, plus a source and a sink, see Figure on the right. We connect the source to pixel &quot;i&quot; by an edge of weight &quot;ai&quot;. We connect the pixel &quot;i&quot; to the sink by an edge of weight &quot;bi&quot;. We connect pixel &quot;i&quot; to pixel &quot;j&quot; with weight &quot;pij&quot;. Now, it remains to compute a minimum cut in that network (or equivalently a maximum flow). The last figure shows a minimum cut.

== Extensions ==
1. In the minimum-cost flow problem, each edge (&quot;u&quot;,v) also has a cost-coefficient &quot;auv&quot; in addition to its capacity. If the flow through the edge is &quot;fuv&quot;, then the total cost is &quot;auvfuv.&quot; It is required to find a flow of a given size &quot;d&quot;, with the smallest cost. In most variants, the cost-coefficients may be either positive or negative. There are various polynomial-time algorithms for this problem.

2. The maximum-flow problem can be augmented by disjunctive constraints: a &quot;negative disjunctive constraint&quot; says that a certain pair of edges cannot simultaneously have a nonzero flow; a &quot;positive disjunctive constraints&quot; says that, in a certain pair of edges, at least one must have a nonzero flow. With negative constraints, the problem becomes strongly NP-hard even for simple networks. With positive constraints, the problem is polynomial if fractional flows are allowed, but may be strongly NP-hard when the flows must be integral.

<text>The Washington State Department of Corrections (WADOC) is a department of the government of the State of Washington. WADOC is responsible for administering adult corrections programs operated by the state. This includes state correctional institutions and programs for people supervised in the community. Its headquarters are in Tumwater, Washington.

==History==
The modern Washington Department of Corrections is a relatively young state agency. Agency oversight of correctional institutions in Washington State went through several transitions during the 20th century before the WADOC&#x27;s creation in 1981.

Prior to the 1970s, state correctional facilities were managed by the Washington Department of Institutions. governor Daniel J. Evans consolidated the Department of Institutions, Department of Public Assistance &amp; Vocational Rehabilitation, and other related departments into the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) in the 1970s.

On July 1, 1981, the Washington State Legislature transferred the administration of adult correctional institutions from the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, Division of Adult Corrections (DSHS) to the newly created Washington State Department of Corrections as part of the 1981 Corrections Reform Act.

==Organizational structure==
The Washington Department of Corrections organizational structure includes six major divisions:
*Women’s Prisons
*Men’s Prisons
*Community Corrections
*Administrative Operations
*Health Services
*Reentry

Each division has an assistant secretary who oversees the division&#x27;s operations.

The secretary of corrections is the executive head of the department. The secretary is appointed by the governor with the consent of the state Senate.

==Department facilities==

===Prisons===
The department currently operates 12 adult prisons, of which 10 are male institutions and two are female institutions. The department confines over 12,000 people in these facilities, with each varying in size and mission across the state.

===Work releases===
The department currently has 12 work release facilities. All but two of these facilities are operated by contractors, who manage the daily safety and security and have oversight of the facilities full-time (24 hours a day, 7 days per week). Department staff are located on site to assist in supervision, monitoring, and case management of those under supervision, as well as monitoring of the contracts.

Formerly incarcerated people housed in work release facilities have progressed from full confinement to partial confinement, and are required to seek, secure, and maintain employment in the community, as well as pay for their room and board. This model is designed to provide some foundation for employment and housing when the formerly incarcerated are released to communities. However, a 2015 Washington Supreme Court Minority and Justice Commission symposium revealed that reentry resources for formerly incarcerated people in Washington State are still severely underfunded and disconnected.

===Field offices===
Community Supervision occurs at 86 varied locations in the community to include: field offices, community justice centers, Community Oriented Policing (COP) Shops and outstations. Activities of supervised people in the community are monitored, which includes home visits, by a Community Corrections Officer to ensure compliance with court, or known as the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board, which was the Washington State Board of Prison Terms and Paroles (ISRB), only those individuals who have been deemed rehabilitated by the ISRB are placed on Parole and department conditions of supervision, such as Community Supervision and/or Community Custody.

==Death row==

In 2014, Governor Jay Inslee announced a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty in Washington State. According to Inslee, &quot;Equal justice under the law is the state&#x27;s primary responsibility. And in death penalty cases, I&#x27;m not convinced equal justice is being served. The use of the death penalty in this state is unequally applied, sometimes dependent on the budget of the county where the crime occurred.&quot; The moratorium means that if a death penalty case comes to the governor&#x27;s desk for action, he will issue a reprieve. However, this action does not commute the sentences of those on death row or issue any pardons. The majority of Washington&#x27;s death penalty sentences are overturned and those convicted of capital offenses are rarely executed, indicating questionable sentencing in many cases. Since 1981, the year Washington State&#x27;s current capital laws were put in place, 32 defendants have been sentenced to die. Of those, 18 have had their sentences converted to life in prison and one was set free.

Prior to Inslee&#x27;s moratorium, Washington&#x27;s capital punishment law required that capital punishment imposed by the state&#x27;s courts be carried out at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Procedures for conducting executions are supervised by the Penitentiary Superintendent. Washington utilizes two methods of execution: lethal injection and hanging. Lethal injection is used unless the inmate under sentence of death chooses hanging as the preferred execution method.

Within 10 days of a trial court entering a judgment and sentence imposing the death penalty, male defendants under sentence of death are transferred to the Penitentiary, where they remain in a segregation unit [Intensive Management Unit North (IMU-N) at the prison] pending appeals, and until a death warrant is issued setting the date for the execution. Female defendants under sentence of death are housed at the Washington Corrections Center for Women near Gig Harbor before being transferred to the Penitentiary no later than 72 hours prior to a scheduled execution, also housed in IMU North, although the execution chamber is located in Unit 6.

78 persons have been executed in Washington since 1904, the most recent being Cal Coburn Brown, in 2010.

==Correctional Industries==
The Washington Department of Corrections revenue-generating, industry job training, and factory food production branch is Washington State Correctional Industries. It is a member of the National Correctional Industries Association.

Correctional Industries began centralizing food production at the Airway Heights Correctional Center in 1995. In the years since, freshly cooked food for incarcerated people in Washington prisons has gradually and in large part been replaced by factory processed, prepackaged food.

==Private contracts==
===Private prisons===
On May 21, 2015, The GEO Group announced the signing of a contract with the Washington Department of Corrections for the out-of-state housing of up to 1,000 prisoners at the company-owned North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan, with a contract term of five years inclusive of renewal option periods.

===Food vendors===
Under the Washington state Food Umbrella Contract, WA DOC&#x27;s Correctional Industries procures products from Food Services of America, Liberty Distributing, Medosweet Farms, Spokane Produce, Terry Dairy&#x27;s, Triple &quot;B&quot; Corporations, and Unisource. WA DOC also contracts with Evergreen Vending, Coca-Cola, and other private food vendors for its facility vending machines.

===Communications===
WA DOC contracts with JPay, a private company that charges the incarcerated and their families for electronic mail, photo-sharing, money transfer, and video visiting services. Phone services for the incarcerated and their families are through WA DOC&#x27;s contract with Global Tel Link.

==Secretary of Corrections==

The secretary of corrections in Washington State is a cabinet level position appointed by the state governor. This position differs from the historical director of the Washington Department of Institutions in its educational requirements. In the 1950s and 1960s, Washington law mandated that directors of the Department of Institutions were required to hold graduate degrees. The modern Washington Department of Corrections has no such requirements for its secretary of corrections.

===Amos Reed===
Amos Reed, appointed by Governor John Spellman, served as the first Washington state secretary of corrections from 1981 to 1986.

Prior to his position as secretary, Reed served as an administrator in the Oregon Department of Corrections from 1969 to 1975.

===Chase Riveland===
Chase Riveland was appointed Secretary of Corrections by Governor Booth Gardner in 1986. He retired in 1997. Riveland drew criticism from Republican lawmakers who felt he was not harsh enough on incarcerated people. However, his cautions against politically-driven policies have proven prescient in the mass incarceration decades that followed his time as secretary. By 2008, the number of people incarcerated in Washington had more than tripled since the time Riveland first came to WADOC.

===Joseph D. Lehman===
Joe Lehman was a graduate of St. Martin&#x27;s College and Pacific Lutheran University. He spent 21 years as a probation and parole officer and deputy secretary in Washington&#x27;s prison system. Lehman was appointed secretary of Corrections by Governor Gary Locke in 1997, and served until 2005. Prior to serving as WADOC secretary, Lehman oversaw Pennsylvania&#x27;s largest prison expansion in state history and then worked for the Maine correctional system. In 1994, Lehman won the Association of State Correctional Administrators Francke Award. Lehman&#x27;s starting salary as WADOC secretary was $93,659 He oversaw WADOC at a time when the department had a budget of $765 million, with 12,825 incarcerated people and 6,300 employees]

===Harold Clarke===
Harold Clarke, appointed by Governor Christine Gregoire, served as Secretary of Corrections from 2005 until his resignation in late 2007. Prior to his appointment, he directed the Nebraska Department of Corrections, where he had climbed through the ranks for over twenty years. He resigned as WADOC secretary amid controversy over probation supervision to take a position as commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections.

===Eldon Vail===
Eldon Vail returned from retirement after 31 years with WADOC to serve as Acting Secretary of Corrections until his formal appointment as Secretary by Governor Christine Gregoire in 2008. Vail resigned amid controversy over an affair with a subordinate in 2011.

===Bernard Warner===
Bernard Warner was appointed by Governor Christine Gregoire as Secretary of Corrections in 2011. Warner resigned in 2015 to take a position at a private Salt Lake City corrections industry.

===Dan Pacholke===
Governor Jay Inslee appointed Dan Pacholke Secretary of Corrections in 2015. Pacholke began his career in WADOC in 1982 as a correctional officer at McNeil Island Corrections Center. He worked his way through the ranks until he was appointed secretary. Pacholke resigned after a short tenure amid controversy over a WADOC computer glitch that caused the somewhat early release of approximately 3,000 incarcerated people over more than a decade. Some formerly incarcerated people who had established new lives upon early release were reincarcerated in response to public and political outcry over the early releases. The early release scandal became an expression of more complex political relationships in anticipation of the 2016 Washington State election season. In a resignation email to Senator Mike Padden—one of the most conservative members of the Washington State Senate&#x27;s Law and Justice Committee—Pacholke wrote, &quot;I notify you now of my resignation. I hope it helps meet your need for blood. I hope it gives you fodder for the press and fulfills your political needs so you can let this agency, our agency, heal.&quot; Former secretary of corrections Bernie Warner told the media he did not know about the computer glitch until notified by Governor Jay Inslee&#x27;s general counsel. However, Pacholke told the media that Warner&#x27;s assistant secretary knew of the mistaken early release of prisoners as early as 2012. At least two people were killed in homicides linked to prisoners who had mistakenly been released early, and families of the deceased in each of those cases went on to file wrongful death lawsuits against the agency. One of those lawsuits resulted in a $3.25 million settlement paid out by the DOC.

Since leaving WADOC, Pacholke has become the co-director at Segregation Solutions.

He served in the role of secretary until January 12, 2017. Morgan had previously served as a member of the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board and of the Washington Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.

===Jody Becker-Green===
Former Washington State Department of Social and Health Services employee Jody Becker-Green was appointed by Governor Jay Inslee as acting secretary from January 10, 2017 to April 25, 2017, becoming the first woman to serve in this role.

===Stephen Sinclair===
Stephen Sinclair was appointed WA DOC secretary by Governor Jay Inslee on April 25, 2017. He began his career at the agency as a correctional officer and gained progressively greater responsibilities as investigator, sergeant, associate superintendent, superintendent and assistant secretary.

As superintendent of the Washington State Penitentiary, Sinclair created the Sustainable Practices Lab. In addition to his role as secretary, he was the DOC co-director of the Sustainability in Prisons Project at The Evergreen State College.

===Cheryl Strange===

==Staff==

===Paramilitary culture===
WADOC is a paramilitary organization and values respect for chain of command and seniority. The department recruits much of its correctional staff from Joint Base Lewis–McChord career fairs.

===Labor union===
Non-management positions in the Washington Department of Corrections are negotiated by the Teamsters Local 117 labor union. and the Washington Federation of State Employees.

===Honor guard===
WADOC Honor Guard protocols are governed by WADOC Policy 870.440. Individual WADOC correctional facilities are not required to maintain an Honor Guard. As of 2013, only five of WADOC&#x27;s 12 facilities maintained an active Honor Guard. Facility superintendents and Chiefs of Emergency Operation are responsible for selecting Honor Guard members and approving Honor Guard participation in local events.

===Line of duty deaths===
The most well-known line of duty death in recent WADOC history was that of Jayme Biendl in 2011. This incident has been called &quot;the Washington Department of Corrections 9/11&quot;, as it resulted in dramatic changes to WADOC security protocols and programs for incarcerated people. An annual Behind the Badge memorial run is held in honor of Biendl&#x27;s service.

===Key issues===
In 2012, WADOC correctional officers advocated for improved uniforms in keeping with the standards of uniforms of other Washington law enforcement agencies. Prior to 2012, correctional officer uniforms were made by incarcerated people in industry job positions. This provided 100 jobs for incarcerated people, as well as eight supervisory correctional officer positions. This bill removed the requirement that correctional officer uniforms come from Correctional Industries. WADOC Policy 870.400 lists detailed requirements for staff uniforms.

==Ombudsman==
In 2007, the Washington Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) spearheaded legislative efforts to create an independent ombudsman position that would provide an alternative avenue of mediation between WADOC, WADOC staff, incarcerated people, and family members of the incarcerated. The resulting bill, SB 5295—sponsored by state Senators Jim Kastama, Dan Swecker, Karen Fraser, Jeanne Kohl-Welles, Chris Marr, Debbie Regala, Marilyn Rasmussen, and Rosemary McAuliffe—was not successful. In the years since, many other community groups have added their support for these legislative efforts. Annual attempts to pass an independent ombudsman bill began in 2013 with SB 5177, sponsored by Senators Mike Carrell and Steve Conway. In 2014, Senators Conway, Jeannie Darneille, Steve O&#x27;Ban, Jeanne Kohl-Welles, and Annette Cleveland sponsored SB 6399. In 2015, Senators Jeannie Darneille, Rosemary McAuliffe, Jeanne Kohl-Welles, Steve O&#x27;Ban, Maralyn Chase, Bob Hasegawa, Karen Keiser, Kirk Pearson, Steve Conway, and David Frockt sponsored SB 5505, with Representatives Luis Moscoso, Roger Goodman, Eric Pettigrew, Sherry Appleton, Tina Orwall, Timm Ormsby, and Laurie Jinkins sponsoring companion bill HB 2005.

In the 2016 legislative session, Senators Mark Miloscia, Christine Rolfes, Kirk Pearson, Steve O&#x27;Ban, Steve Conway, and Rosemary McAuliffe sponsored unsuccessful SB 6154, with Representatives Luis Moscoso, Eric Pettigrew, Sherry Appleton, Tina Orwall, David Sawyer, Cindy Ryu, Derek Stanford, Gerry Pollet, Teri Hickel, Steve Bergquist, and Sharon Tomiko Santos sponsoring companion HB 2817.

In the 2017-2018 legislative session an ombudsman bill, HB 1889, passed both chambers of the legislature.

WADOC opposed these legislative efforts. In 2016, WADOC created its own internal ombudsman position. Carlos Lugo, who had previously worked on a special WADOC project concerning visitation access for Latino incarcerated people, was hired as the first WADOC ombudsman.

==Contraband==
The WADOC Intelligence and Investigations Unit asked the FBI to become involved in the investigation of employee contraband smuggling at WADOC&#x27;s Monroe Correctional Complex smuggling in December 2015. A correctional officer was arrested on September 29, 2016. FBI agents determined the officer was accepting bribes of up to $1,000 to smuggle contraband into the prison.

In August 2016 a 23-year-old incarcerated man at Monroe Correctional Complex died from a drug overdose, causing renewed concerns statewide about contraband entering WADOC prisons.

==Sustainability in Prisons Project==
At Cedar Creek Corrections Center in 2003, the Washington State Department of Corrections and The Evergreen State College founded the Sustainability in Prisons Project (SPP). Dan Pacholke was Cedar Creek Correctional Center&#x27;s superintendent at the time, and started composting and water catchment programs to save money and create meaningful work for the men incarcerated at the minimum security facility. Dr. Nalini Nadkarni, a member of the faculty at Evergreen, asked for incarcerated people to join her in a study to grow native mosses, and Cedar Creek welcomed her proposal. From here, the partnership between Evergreen and WADOC strengthened and expanded. In the decade plus since, SPP has expanded to several other WADOC prisons. Incarcerated people raise endangered species and carry out impressive composting operations using recycled construction materials.

<text>The Progressive Democratic Party (, &#x27;; ), also referred to by its acronymPDP, was a secular liberal political party in Tunisia.

==History and profile==
The Progressive Democratic Party was founded under the name of Progressive Socialist Rally in 1983. It gained legal recognition on 12 September 1988 and was renamed Progressive Democratic Party in 2001. Under the rule of Ben Ali it was a legal opposition party, but it was subjected to political repression. After the Tunisian revolution it was one of the major left-leaning secular political forces. It was led by Ahmed Najib Chebbi and Maya Jribi. On 9 April 2012, it merged into the Republican Party.

The Progressive Democratic Party had a newspaper, &quot;Al-Mawqif&quot;.

==Under the Ben Ali rule==
In its beginnings, the Progressive Socialist Rally (now PDP) gathered a broad range of currents from Marxists and pro-democracy activists to progressive Muslims. During the Ben Ali rule, Najib Chebbi and the PDP were harassed by the police for years, and verbally attacked by state-run media. After unsuccessfully participating in elections from 1989 to 1999, the party decided to boycott the elections of 2004 and 2009. Therefore, it was unrepresented in the Tunisian parliament. After the Ben Ali administration announced to force the party to move their headquarters from Tunis, its leaders Najib Chebbi and Maya Jribi engaged in a 20-day hunger strike, which earned the party attention and prompted the administration to revoke their decision.

==After the Tunisian revolution==
Following the 2010–2011 Tunisian protests, shootings outside PDP&#x27;s headquarters were reported on 16 January 2011. The next day, on 17 January, party leader Najib Chebbi, was named Regional Development Minister in the interim government. Ahead of the Constituent Assembly election, the PDP evolved into a main exponent of the centre-left secular camp and rival of the Islamist Ennahda Movement. In the run-up to the elections, the Progressive Democrats have received quite an amount of financial support which enabled the party for a lavish campaign. Critics claim that an important part of the funding came from businesspeople close to the old Ben Ali power elite.

In the election for a constituent assembly, the PDP won 3.9% of the popular vote and 16 of 217 seats in the National Constituent Assembly, putting it at the fifth place. As the party had categorically ruled out any collaboration with the victorious Islamist Ennahda Movement, the Progressive Democrats went into opposition and belong to the outspoken critics of the governing coalition of the Islamists with the secular CPR and Ettakatol parties. After the electoral defeat, the PDP launched talks with other secularist and liberal parties to form a &quot;big party of the centre&quot;. The merger was realised on the PDP&#x27;s fifth congress on 9 April 2012. The new party is called the Republican Party and comprises, in addition to the PDP, the Afek Tounes party, several extra-parliamentary parties and independents.

<text>Ad-Dawr () is a small agricultural town in Saladin Governorate, Iraq, near Tikrit. It includes a great number of people from four tribes, al-Shuwaykhat, al-Mawashet, al-Bu Haydar and al-Bu Mdallal. Al-Mawashet tribe is famous for supporting Saddam Hussein.

==History==
===Structures===
Ad-Dawr is home to a housing complex called &quot;Saad 14&quot;, which was built in the 1980s by Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, a major South Korean construction company.

===Iraq War===
In May 2003, the 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery, a part of the United States Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division, along with the 534th Signal Company, established a Forward Operating Base just south of the town, called &quot;FOB Arrow&quot;. On May 15, 2003, troops from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division raided the town, arresting more than 260 suspected Ba&#x27;ath Party supporters. 

The vast majority were soon released but five Iraqi special security forces officers were reported captured, including two Iraqi army generals and a general from Saddam&#x27;s security forces who had disguised himself as a shepherd. 

On August 13, 2003, a U.S. Army soldier was killed near FOB Arrow when his vehicle hit an anti-tank mine.

An attack by insurgents near Ad-Dawr killed three American soldiers and injured three on September 18, 2003.

The 4th Battalion 42nd Field Artillery, along with 3rd Platoon 534th Signal Company, adopted Nasiba Primary School for Girls in the town and completed its refurbishment in November 2003.

On December 13, 2003, the 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s 1st Brigade Combat Team conducted Operation Red Dawn and found Saddam Hussein hiding in a spider hole in front of a hut occupied by a man believed to be his former cook, Qais Namuk.

==Notables from ad-Dawr==
• Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri

• One of the most well-known Arab historical scholars, Professor-Doctor Abdul Aziz Al-Douri (b. 1918 – d. 2010), was a native of ad-Dawr; he served as the chancellor of Baghdad University during the 1960s.

==History==
&quot;Suz&quot; is one of the 26 Sporadic groups and was discovered by as a rank 3 permutation group on 1782 points with point stabilizer G2(4). It is not related to the Suzuki groups of Lie type. The Schur multiplier has order 6 and the outer automorphism group has order 2.

==Complex Leech lattice==
The 24-dimensional Leech lattice has a fixed-point-free automorphism of order 3. Identifying this with a complex cube root of 1 makes the Leech lattice into a 12 dimensional lattice over the Eisenstein integers, called the complex Leech lattice. The automorphism group of the complex Leech lattice is the universal cover 6 · Suz of the Suzuki group. This makes the group 6 · Suz · 2 into a maximal subgroup of Conway&#x27;s group Co0 = 2 · Co1 of automorphisms of the Leech lattice, and shows that it has two complex irreducible representations of dimension 12. The group 6 · Suz acting on the complex Leech lattice is analogous to the group 2 · Co1 acting on the Leech lattice.

==Suzuki chain==
The Suzuki chain or Suzuki tower is the following tower of rank 3 permutation groups from , each of which is the point stabilizer of the next.

<doc id="403178" wikidata="Q3117686" url="?curid=403178" title="Higman–Sims group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Higman–Sims group HS is a sporadic simple group of order
:   44,352,000 = 293253711
: ≈ 4.

The Schur multiplier has order 2, the outer automorphism group has order 2, and the group 2.HS.2 appears as an involution centralizer in the Harada–Norton group.

==History==
HS is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by . They were attending a presentation by Marshall Hall on the Hall–Janko group J2. It happens that J2 acts as a permutation group on the Hall–Janko graph of 100 points, the stabilizer of one point being a subgroup with two other orbits of lengths 36 and 63. Inspired by this they decided to check for other rank 3 permutation groups on 100 points. They soon focused on a possible one containing the Mathieu group M22, which has permutation representations on 22 and 77 points. (The latter representation arises because the M22 Steiner system has 77 blocks.) By putting together these two representations, they found HS, with a one-point stabilizer isomorphic to M22.

HS is the simple subgroup of index two in the group of automorphisms of the Higman–Sims graph. The Higman–Sims graph has 100 nodes, so the Higman–Sims group HS is a transitive group of permutations of a 100 element set. The smallest faithful complex representation of HS has dimension 22.

 independently discovered the group as a doubly transitive permutation group acting on a certain &quot;geometry&quot; on 176 points.

==Construction==
GAP code to build the Higman-Sims group is presented as an example in the GAP documentation itself.

The Higman-Sims group can be constructed with the following two generators:

and

==Relationship to Conway groups==
 identified the Higman–Sims group as a subgroup of the Conway group Co0. In Co0 HS arises as a pointwise stabilizer of a 2-3-3 triangle, one whose edges (differences of vertices) are type 2 and 3 vectors. HS thus is a subgroup of each of the Conway groups Co0, Co2 and Co3.

 (p. 208) shows that the group HS is well-defined. In the Leech lattice, suppose a type 3 point v is fixed by an instance of Co3. Count the type 2 points w such that the inner product v·w = 2 (and thus v-w is type 3). He shows that their number is and that this Co3 is transitive on these w.

In fact, , and there are instances of HS including a permutation matrix representation of the Mathieu group M22.

If an instance of HS in Co0 fixes a particular point of type 3, this point is found in 276 triangles of type 2-2-3 that this copy of HS permutes in orbits of 176 and 100. This fact leads to Graham Higman&#x27;s construction as well as to the Higman–Sims graph. HS is doubly transitive on the 176 and rank 3 on the 100.
A 2-3-3 triangle defines a 2-dimensional subspace fixed pointwise by HS. The standard representation of HS can thus be reduced to a 22-dimensional one.

===A Higman-Sims graph===
 (p. 210) gives an example of a Higman-Sims graph within the Leech lattice, permuted by the representation of M22 on the last 22 coordinates:
* 22 points of shape (1, 1, −3, 121)
* 77 points of shape (2, 2, 26, 016)
* A 100th point (4, 4, 022)

Differences of adjacent points are of type 3; those of non-adjacent ones are of type 2.

Here, HS fixes a 2-3-3 triangle with vertices , , and z the origin. x and y are of type 3 while is of type 2. Any vertex of the graph differs from x, y, and z by vectors of type 2.

===Two classes of involutions===
An involution in the subgroup M22 transposes 8 pairs of co-ordinates. As a permutation matrix in Co0 it has trace 8. It can shown that it moves 80 of the 100 vertices of the Higman-Sims graph. No transposed pair of vertices is an edge in the graph.

There is another class of involutions, of trace 0, that move all 100 vertices. As permutations in the alternating group A100, being products of an odd number (25) of double transpositions, these involutions lift to elements of order 4 in the double cover 2.A100. HS thus has a double cover 2.HS, which is not related to the double cover of the subgroup M22.

==Maximal subgroups==
 found the 12 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of HS as follows:


==Conjugacy classes==
Traces of matrices in a standard 24-dimensional representation of HS are shown. Listed are 2 permutation representations: on the 100 vertices of the Higman–Sims graph, and on the 176 points of Graham Higman&#x27;s geometry.

==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==
Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster group, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For HS, the McKay-Thompson series is formula_1 where one can set (),

:formula_2

In 2000, she won the FIFA Female Player of the Century along with Michelle Akers. Sun won both the Golden Ball (top player) and Golden Boot (top scorer) for her performance at the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. She is considered one of the all-time greats of the women&#x27;s game.

After the retirement, she became vice-president of the Chinese Football Association in 2019.

== Early life ==
Sun began playing football around the age of ten. Her father, Sun Zonggao, was a recreational football player who took Sun with him to watch matches in the Chinese men&#x27;s league. Sun credits him for influencing her foray into the sport.

Sun studied Chinese literature at the University of Shanghai.

Sun played for the Shanghai team in the Chinese women&#x27;s league.

==== Atlanta Beat ====
Sun played for the Atlanta Beat of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association from 2001 to 2002. She was the first overall pick of the WUSA&#x27;s Inaugural Draft, but a knee and ankle injury limited her first season with the Beat to 13 games with five starts. During the league&#x27;s semifinal match against the Philadelphia Charge, the Beat were down 2–0; however, Sun scored on a penalty kick and then provided the assist on the equalizer goal with a corner kick headed in by Cindy Parlow. The Beat would go on to win the match 3–2. She then notched the Beat&#x27;s third goal in the Founders Cup, helping the team to an eventual 3–3 tie during regulation. The San Jose CyberRays won the title in a penalty kick shootout.

During the 2002 season, Sun played in 18 games, making 10 starts. She scored four goals as the Beat earned another chance at the playoffs, but the Beat were eliminated in the semifinals.

In 1999, she had 10 goals in her World Cup career, leaving her tied for second place on an all-time scoring list.

Sun helped the national team win the Asian Cup in 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1997.

Sun led China to a silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Athens, Georgia. During the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Sun scored seven goals and earned the Golden Ball (top player) and Golden Boot (top scorer) at the tournament.

She returned to the Chinese women&#x27;s team from a two-year retirement on 15 December 2005. Due to injury reasons, Sun retired again after winning AFC Women&#x27;s Asian Cup in 2006.

<text>The West Virginia Division of Corrections is an agency of the U.S. state of West Virginia within the state Department of Homeland Security that operates the state&#x27;s prisons, jails, and juvenile detention facilities. The agency has its headquarters in the state&#x27;s capital of Charleston. The state incarcerates 273 women per 100,000 population, the highest rate of female incarceration in the world, ahead of all other states and foreign nations.

==History==
On January 1, 1986 a two-day riot began at the West Virginia State Penitentiary resulted in three inmate deaths.

The Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg, the first of the state&#x27;s 10 regional jails opened in May 1989. The regional jails would gradually replace the 55 county jails.

The former Salem Industrial Home for Youth was converted into an adult prison, the Salem Correctional Center, in 2015.

All of the division&#x27;s facilities are overcrowded and understaffed. Press reports in late 2017 indicated the division was short three hundred correctional officers. Press reports in early 2018 showed that pay for correctional officers in the state ranked 49th in the nation. New correctional officers started at $24,664, about twelve dollars an hour.

From February to July 2018, National Guard troops supplemented the overworked officers. At the end of that period, the Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office continued to support the division.

Until July 1, 2018, the agency was simply the &quot;West Virginia Division of Corrections&quot; and only operated the adult prisons. On July 1, 2018 the agency absorbed the former West Virginia Division of Juvenile Services and the former West Virginia Regional Jail Authority and assumed its current name.

<doc id="403190" wikidata="Q541679" url="?curid=403190" title="Democrats of the Left">
<text>The Democrats of the Left (, DS) was a social-democratic political party in Italy. Positioned on the centre-left, the DS, successor of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and the Italian Communist Party, was formed in 1998 upon the merger of the PDS with several minor parties. A member of The Olive Tree coalition, the DS was successively led by Massimo D&#x27;Alema, Walter Veltroni, and Piero Fassino, and merged with Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy and a number of minor centre-left parties to form the Democratic Party in October 2007.

==History==
At its 20th congress in 1991, the Italian Communist Party (PCI) was transformed into the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), responding to the Revolutions of 1989 in eastern Europe by re-orienting the party towards the European democratic socialist tradition. Under the leadership of Massimo D&#x27;Alema, the PDS merged with some minor centre-left movements (Labour Federation, Social Christians, Republican Left, Movement of Unitarian Communists, Reformists for Europe, and Democratic Federation) on 13 February 1998.

The DS&#x27; symbol lacked the hammer and sickle, which was present in the PDS&#x27; one and was instead replaced by the red rose of European social democracy as used by the Party of European Socialists (PES). Massimo D&#x27;Alema became Prime Minister of Italy in October 1998, the first former Communist to hold the post. D&#x27;Alema was replaced as the leader of DS by Walter Veltroni. During the party&#x27;s first national congress in January 2000, Veltroni received the support of the 79.9% of delegates, while the left wing of the party, at the time led by three women (Anna Finocchiaro, Fulvia Bandoli, and Pasqualina Napoletano), had the support of 20.1% of delegates.

===Leadership of Piero Fassino===
During the party&#x27;s second national congress in November 2001, Piero Fassino, a mainstream social democrat, was elected secretary with 61.8% of party members&#x27; votes. In the event, Giovanni Berlinguer, endorsed by left-wingers, democratic socialists, and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) trade union, gained 34.1%, while Enrico Morando, from the liberal right-wing, got 4.1%. Contextually, D&#x27;Alema was elected president. During the third national congress in February 2005, Fassino was re-elected with 79.0% of the vote. While no one stood against Fassino, left-wing candidates ran for congressional delegates: the &quot;DS Left – returning to win&quot; motion/list won 14.6% of the vote; &quot;DS Left for Socialism&quot;, 4.0%; and the &quot;Ecologist Left&quot;, 2.4%.

===2006 general election===
In the 2006 Italian general election, the DS endorsed Romano Prodi for Prime Minister and were part of The Olive Tree electoral list, along with Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy (DL) and the European Republicans Movement (MRE), for the Chamber of Deputies, while fielding its own list for the Senate of the Republic. The DS–DL–MRE joint list obtained 31.2% of the vote and 220 deputies, while the DS list 17.2% and 62 senators. The party&#x27;s dismal result and the razor-thin win of The Union coalition over the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition prompted a discussion on the party&#x27;s future. By the end of 2006, the party leadership was committed to a merger with DL. Nine Ministers of the Prodi II Cabinet were affiliated to the DS, notably including D&#x27;Alema who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy and Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Giorgio Napolitano, another DS member, was elected President of Italy in May 2006 and re-elected in April 2013 for a second term.

===Fourth national congress and split===
The party&#x27;s fourth national congress was held in 19–21 April 2007. During local congresses, Fassino and his motion named &quot;For the Democratic Party&quot;, backed by most leading members (D&#x27;Alema, Pier Luigi Bersani, and Antonio Bassolino, among others), received the support of 75.6% by party members. The left wing of Fabio Mussi, Cesare Salvi, Fulvia Bandoli, and Valdo Spini (&quot;To the Left. For European Socialism&quot;) scored 15.0%; this motion was instead opposed to the merger of the DS with DL. A third motion (&quot;For a New, Democratic and Socialist Party&quot;), signed by Gavino Angius, Mauro Zani, and originally Giuseppe Caldarola, took 9.3% of the vote; its members (gathered in the new Socialists and Europeans faction) supported the creation of a new party only within the PES, which was opposed by the DL. As a result, the DS approved the formation of a Democratic Party, along with DL and minor parties. Most supporters of the two motions which had opposed the merger left the DS right after the congress and launched the Democratic Left on 5 May 2007, which aimed to unite the heterogeneous Italian left.

The Democratic Party (PD) was formed in October 2007 and its first secretary was Walter Veltroni, a former DS leader who was elected leader of the new party through a leadership election, which saw the participation of over 3,5 million Italian voters in which Veltroni won 75.8% of the vote.

==Factions==
Inside the DS, there was often a somewhat simplistic distinction between reformists (&quot;riformisti&quot;) and radicals (&quot;radicali&quot;), indicating respectively the party&#x27;s mainstream and its left wing. The party also included several organised factions. The social-democratic majority was loosely organised, while including several organised movements: the Labourites – Liberal Socialists and Sicily&#x27;s Reformist Movement, both splinter groups of the Italian Socialist Party; Reformist Europe, a splinter group of the Democratic Union led by Giorgio Benvenuto (previously named Reformists for Europe); the Social Christians, which had emerged from the left wing of Christian Democracy; the Republican Left, from the left wing of the Italian Republican Party; and the Liberal Left, from the left wing of the Italian Liberal Party. A dissident group left the Labourites in order to launch Socialists and Europeans as a vehicle to oppose the party&#x27;s merger with DL. On the party&#x27;s right, the Liberal DS had a moderate Third Way or radical centrist political agenda and joined the party&#x27;s majority in latter years.

Before the party&#x27;s last congress in 2007, the left-wing opposition was led by the &quot;DS Left – Returning to win&quot;, a democratic-socialist grouping, with other smaller groups including &quot;DS Left – for Socialism&quot; and the &quot;Ecologist Left&quot;. Before that, some DS leading members, including Pietro Ingrao, Achille Occhetto, and Pietro Folena, had left the party in order to join the Communist Refoundation Party, which at its sixth congress held in January 2005 moved toward a more heterogeneous, non-sectarian, and strongly pacifist variety of leftism.

==Popular support==
The electoral results of DS (PDS until 1998) in general (Chamber of Deputies) and European Parliament elections from 1992 to 2006 are shown in chart below. The result for the 2006 general election refers to the election for the Senate (the DS contested the election for the Chamber of Deputies in a joint list with the DL).

The electoral results of the DS (PDS until 1998) in the 10 most populated regions of Italy are shown in the table below.

<text>The Whisky a Go Go (informally nicknamed The Whisky) is a historic nightclub in West Hollywood, California, United States. It is located at 8901 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip, corner North Clark Street, opposite North San Vicente Boulevard, northwest corner. The club played a central role in the Los Angeles music scene from the 1960s through the 1990s.

==History==
In 1958, the first Whisky a Go Go in the United States opened in Chicago, Illinois, on the corner of Rush and Chestnut streets. It has been called the first real American discothèque. A franchise was opened in 1966 on M Street in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., by restaurateur Jacques Vivien.

It owes its name to the first discothèque, the Whisky à Gogo, (, meaning, in French, &quot;in abundance&quot;, &quot;galore&quot;), established in Paris in 1947 by Paul Pacini (d. 2017), which itself took the name from the movie &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; based on the British novel &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; which was released in France as &quot;Whisky a Gogo&quot;.

The Sunset Strip Whisky was founded by Elmer Valentine, Phil Tanzini, Shelly Davis, and attorney Theodore Flier and opened on January 16, 1964. In 1966, Valentine, Lou Adler, and others founded The Roxy Theatre. In 1972, Valentine, Adler, Mario Maglieri and others started the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill on the Sunset Strip. Lou Adler bought into the Whisky in the late 1970s. Valentine sold his interest in the Whisky a Go Go in the 1990s but retained an ownership in the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill and the Roxy Theatre until his death in December 2008.

Although the club was billed as a discothèque, suggesting that it offered only recorded music, the Whisky a Go Go opened with a live band led by Johnny Rivers and DJ Rhonda Lane, spinning records between sets from a suspended cage at the right of the stage. Shortly after opening, the club began booking live rock groups upon suggestion from their publicist, Ronnie Haran. Haran eventually hired The Doors as the Whisky house band, where they performed seven nights a week. In September 1969, the group Gypsy took over as the house band at the club until April 1971.
The Whisky a Go Go was one of the places that popularized go-go dancing. Elmer Valentine, in a 2006 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, recalled arranging to have a female DJ play records between Rivers&#x27; sets so patrons could continue dancing. But because there was not enough room on the floor for a DJ booth, he had a glass-walled booth mounted high above the floor. A contest was held for the female DJ job but when the young winner called Valentine on the night of the opening and tearfully said her mother forbade her from doing it, Valentine recruited the club&#x27;s cigarette girl, Patty Brockhurst. Valentine quickly hired two more female dancers, one of whom, Joanna Labean, designed the official go-go-girl costume of fringed dress and white boots.

Rivers rode the Whisky-born go-go craze to national fame with records recorded partly &quot;Live at the Whisky&quot;. In addition, The Miracles recorded the song &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; in 1966 (which was covered in 1982 by The Rolling Stones), and Whisky a Go Go franchises sprang up all over the country. Arguably, the rock and roll scene in Los Angeles was born when the Whisky started operation; because of its status as a historic music landmark, the venue was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.
The Whisky played an important role in many musical careers, especially for bands based in Southern California. The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Smokestack Lightnin&#x27;, and Love were regulars, and the Doors were the house band for a while. Van Morrison&#x27;s band Them had a two-week residency in June 1966, with the Doors as the opening act. On the last night they all jammed together on &quot;Gloria.&quot; Frank Zappa&#x27;s the Mothers of Invention got their record contract based on a performance at the Whisky. The Turtles performed there when their newest (and biggest-selling) single &quot;Happy Together&quot; was becoming a hit, only to lose their new bassist, Chip Douglas (who had arranged the song), to the Monkees; guitarist Michael Nesmith invited him to become their producer (he returned to the Turtles a year later, to produce them). Neil Diamond also played at the Whisky on occasion. Metallica bassist Cliff Burton was recruited by the band after they watched him play a show there with his band Trauma. At one point, singer and actress E.G. Daily had a residency at the Whisky. On February 15, 1977, the Ramones played for the first time on this stage.
Arthur Lee of Love immortalized the Whisky in the song &quot;Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale&quot;. &quot;Here they always play my songs,&quot; he would sing on the side-two opener of &quot;Forever Changes&quot;. The Whisky was located on the strip between the streets Clark and Hilldale. British rockers Status Quo also referenced the venue in their 1978 song &quot;Long Legged Linda&quot; with the lines, &quot;Well, if you&#x27;re ever in Los Angeles and you&#x27;ve got time to spare / Take a stroll up Sunset Boulevard, you&#x27;ll find the Whisky there.&quot; Loggins and Messina sang about the club in their tune &quot;Whiskey&quot;, found on their 1972 album &quot;Loggins and Messina&quot;.

In 1966, the Whisky was one of the centers of what fans call the Sunset Strip police riots. In the mid-1970s, the Whisky hosted stage presentations, including the long-running show &quot;The Cycle Sluts&quot;. During the early 1990s, the Whisky hosted a number of Seattle-based musicians who would be a part of the grunge movement, including Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Melvins, Fitz of Depression and 7 Year Bitch. Tracks recorded from a February 12, 1992 concert of Hole appear on their EP, &quot;Ask for It&quot; (1995). In 1994, Oasis played a controversial set at the Whisky, with frontman Liam Gallagher visibly intoxicated. Immediately following the gig, lead songwriter Noel Gallagher temporarily left the group out of frustration, fleeing to San Francisco, where he penned the song &quot;Talk Tonight&quot;. In 1997, System of a Down played at the Whisky. The band were unsigned at the time, and played songs from their early demo tapes, in particular containing the band&#x27;s only live performance of the song &quot;Blue&quot;.

===Today===
On September 12, 2016, Whisky a Go Go launched an official TV channel on the Roku Connected TV platform. The Whisky a Go Go channel opens the Whisky&#x27;s doors to a global audience with live music videos, full concerts and related content spanning its 60-year history.

==Honors==
A gene that codes for a subunit of a common potassium ion channel was named for the establishment in the 1960s by William D. Kaplan and William E. Trout. The human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) was so named because when Drosophila flies with mutations in the Ether-à-go-go gene are anaesthetised with ether, their legs start to shake, like the dancing at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub.

==In popular culture==
The 2013 videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; features a nightclub known as Tequi-la-la, which is based on Whisky a Go Go.

The 2019 song &quot;Kiss the Go-Goat&quot; by Ghost is named so because the band&#x27;s fictional history consists of the band performing the song at the Whiskey a Go Go in 1969.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Party (; ) is a communist party in Tunisia. Legalized only in 2011, it participates in the Popular Front coalition, which is represented in the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. The party&#x27;s long-term leader is general secretary Hamma Hammami.

Founded in 1986, the party was known as the Tunisian Workers&#x27; Communist Party (; , PCOT) until 2012. After the rename it remained a member of the Hoxhaist International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity &amp; Struggle).

==History==
The party was outlawed until the Tunisian Revolution, when in a failed attempt to shore up the state framework it and another banned parties were invited to participate in a national unity government. Subsequently, the party and other opposition elements refused this attempt to co-opt the ongoing revolution by installing a government composed at its senior levels by associates of the former regime.

It was founded on 3 January 1986 and has a youth wing the &quot;Union of Communist Youth of Tunisia&quot; (UJCT).

Amnesty International reports that in 1998 five students were charged with belonging to PCOT and given 4-year prison sentences after student demonstrations.

After their involvement in the uprising against Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, PCOT held their first conference as a legal party on 22–24 July, with up to 2000 attending. Removing the word &quot;communist&quot; from the party&#x27;s name was among the topics debated. In the end, party spokesperson Abed Jabbar Bdouri stated the party decided &quot;not to make any changes since we&#x27;re currently too busy with the electoral campaign&quot;.

In the 2011 Constituent Assembly election, the candidates of PCOT&#x27;s electoral formation ran by the name &quot;Revolutionary Alternative&quot; ( &quot;; &quot;) and won 3 of the 217 seats, in Sfax, Kairouan and Siliana. Member Chrif Khraief has stated the party was dissatisfied with the result, as &quot;3 seats in the CA doesn&#x27;t reflect at all the real weight of the party on the streets&quot;; PCOT issued a statement condemning the use of political donations and electoral violations during the campaign.

In July 2012, the PCOT decided to remove the word &quot;communist&quot; from its name to avoid the stereotype associated with this term.

<text>Thomas Alan Shippey (born 9 September 1943) is a British medievalist, a retired scholar of Middle and Old English literature as well as of modern fantasy and science fiction. He is considered one of the world&#x27;s leading academic experts on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien about whom he has written several books and many scholarly papers. His book &quot;The Road to Middle-Earth&quot; has been called &quot;the single best thing written on Tolkien&quot;.

Shippey&#x27;s education and academic career have in several ways retraced those of Tolkien: he attended King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, became a professional philologist, occupied Tolkien&#x27;s professorial chair at the University of Leeds, and taught Old English at the University of Oxford to the syllabus that Tolkien had devised.

He has received three Mythopoeic Awards and a World Fantasy Award. He participated in the creation of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, assisting the dialect coaches. He featured as an expert medievalist in all three of the documentary DVDs that accompany the special extended edition of the trilogy, and later also that of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogy.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Thomas Alan Shippey was born in 1943 to the engineer Ernest Shippey and his wife Christina Emily Kjelgaard in Calcutta, British India, where he spent the first years of his life. He studied at King Edward&#x27;s School in Birmingham from 1954 to 1960.

Like J. R. R. Tolkien, Shippey became fond of Old English, Old Norse, German and Latin, and of playing rugby. He gained a B.A. from Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, in 1964, his M.A. in 1968, and a PhD in 1970.

=== Medievalist ===

Shippey became a junior lecturer at the University of Birmingham, and then a Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he taught Old and Middle English. In 1979, he was elected to the Chair of English Language and Medieval English Literature at Leeds University, a post once held by Tolkien. In 1996, after 14 years at Leeds, Shippey was appointed to the Walter J. Ong Chair of Humanities at Saint Louis University&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences, where he taught, researched, and wrote books. He has been a visiting professor at Harvard University, the University of Texas, and Signum University.

He has published over 160 books and articles, and has edited or co-edited scholarly collections such as the 1998 &quot;Beowulf: The Critical Heritage&quot; and in 2005 &quot;The Shadow-walkers: Jacob Grimm&#x27;s Mythology of the Monstrous&quot;. Among several influential articles on the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; are an analysis of its principles of conversation, a much-cited discussion of the &quot;obdurate puzzle&quot; of the &quot;Modthrytho Episode&quot; (&quot;Beowulf&quot; 1931b–1962), which seems to describe a cruel irrational queen who then becomes a model wife, and an analysis of &quot;Names in Anglo-Saxon and Beowulf&quot;, with special reference to those elsewhere unrecorded. He has also written on Arthurian legend, including its reworkings in medieval and modern literature. His medieval studies have extended as far as to write a book on the lives and deaths of the great Vikings &quot;as warriors, invaders and plunderers&quot;, exploring their &quot;heroic mentality&quot;, with special reference to the pervasive Norse Bad Sense of Humour.. The Swedish author Lars Lönnroth commented that nothing like Shippey&#x27;s &quot;eminently readable book&quot; had been attempted since Thomas Bartholin&#x27;s 1677 history of Danish antiquity, even if Shippey&#x27;s use of legendary sources meant that the materials used could not be relied upon as history, only as indications of a shared mindset. See further &quot;Vikings: Legend, History, Mindset&quot;, online at academia.edu

Since his retirement and his return to England, he has continued his research His retirement in 2008 was marked by a &quot;festschrift&quot;, &quot;Constructing Nations, Reconstructing Myth&quot;, edited by Andrew Wawn, Graham Johnson and John Walter, with contributions from former students and former colleagues. His Tolkien scholar colleagues including Janet Brennan Croft, John D. Rateliff, Verlyn Flieger, David Bratman, Marjorie Burns, and Richard C. West marked his 70th birthday with a further &quot;festschrift&quot;, &quot;Tolkien in the New Century&quot;, while another volume of essays by former colleagues and students, &quot;Literary Speech Acts of the Medieval North&quot;: &quot;essays inspired by the works of T.A. Shippey&quot;, came out in 2020, edited by Eric Bryan and Alexander Ames.

=== Modern fantasy and science fiction ===

A fan and follower of science fiction from teenage years, in the early 1980s Shippey worked with Brian Aldiss with the concept of world-building in his Helliconia trilogy.

Under the pseudonym of &quot;John Holm&quot;, he was the co-author, with Harry Harrison, of &quot;The Hammer and the Cross&quot; trilogy of alternate history novels, consisting of &quot;The Hammer and the Cross&quot; (1993), &quot;One King&#x27;s Way&quot; (1995), and &quot;King and Emperor&quot; (1996). For Harrison&#x27;s 1984 &quot;West of Eden&quot;, Shippey helped with the constructed language, Yilanè.

Shippey has edited both &quot;The Oxford Book of Science Fiction Stories&quot;, and &quot;The Oxford Book of Fantasy Stories&quot;. For ten years he reviewed science fiction for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and still contributes literary reviews to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.
In 2009, he wrote a scholarly 21-page introduction to &quot;Flights of Eagles&quot;, a collection of James Blish&#x27;s works. He has given many invited lectures on Tolkien and other topics. In 2008 he brought out a collection of articles on SF and fantasy, &quot;Hard Reading: Learning from Science Fiction,&quot; freely available from academia.edu.

=== Tolkien scholarship ===

Shippey&#x27;s interest in Tolkien began when he was 14 years old and was lent a copy of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Shippey comments on his interest in Tolkien that

On 11 November 1969, he delivered a lecture on &quot;Tolkien as philologist&quot; at a Tolkien day organised by the Adult Education Department at the University of Birmingham. Joy Hill, Tolkien&#x27;s private secretary, was in the audience and afterward, she asked him for the script, for Tolkien to read. On 13 April 1970, Shippey received a letter from Tolkien in response; he records that it took him 30 years to decode the &quot;specialised politeness-language of Old Western Man&quot; in which Tolkien replied to Shippey&#x27;s interpretations of his work, even though, Shippey writes, he speaks the same language himself. Tolkien wrote, hinting that Shippey was &quot;&quot;nearly&quot; (italics supplied by Shippey) always correct but that Tolkien had not had the time to tell him about his design as it &quot;may be found&quot; in a large &quot;finished&quot; work, and the &quot;actual&quot; events or experiences as seen or felt by the waking mind &quot;in the course of actual composition&quot; [i.e. Tolkien&#x27;s then-unpublished legendarium]&quot;; Shippey used the phrase &quot;Course of actual composition&quot; as the title of the final chapter of &quot;The Road to Middle-earth&quot;.

Shippey and Tolkien met later in 1972 when Shippey was invited for dinner by Norman Davis, who had succeeded Tolkien as the Merton Professor of English Language. When he became a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College that same year, Shippey taught Old and Middle English using Tolkien&#x27;s syllabus.

Shippey&#x27;s first printed essay on Tolkien, &quot;Creation from Philology in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;, expanded on his 1970 lecture. In 1979, he was elected into a former position of Tolkien&#x27;s, the Chair of English Language and Medieval English Literature at Leeds University. He noted that his office at Leeds, like Tolkien&#x27;s, was just off Woodhouse Lane, a name that in his view Tolkien would certainly have interpreted as a trace of the woodwoses, the wild men of the woods &quot;lurking in the hills above the Aire&quot;.

His first Tolkien book, &quot;The Road to Middle-earth&quot;, was published in 1982. In this he attempted to set Tolkien in the tradition of comparative philology, a discipline founded by Jacob Grimm, which he regarded as the major source of Tolkien&#x27;s inspiration. In 2000, however, he published &quot;Tolkien: Author of the Century, i&quot;n which he attempted also to set Tolkien in the context of his own time: &quot;writing fantasy, but voicing in that fantasy the most pressing and most immediately relevant issues of the whole monstrous twentieth century – questions of industrialised warfare, the origin of evil, the nature of humanity&quot;. This would include writers affected by war like Kurt Vonnegut, William Golding, and George Orwell. An enlarged third edition of &quot;Road to Middle-earth&quot; was published in 2005; in its preface Shippey states that he had assumed (wrongly) that the 1982 book would be his last word on the subject, and in the text he sets out his view, stated at more length in &quot;Author of the Century&quot;, that &quot;the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; in particular is a war-book, also a post-war book&quot;, comparing Tolkien&#x27;s writing to that of other twentieth-century authors. &quot;Road&quot; rigorously refutes what was then the long-running literary hostility to Tolkien, and explains to instinctive lovers of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; why they are right to like it. It has been described as &quot;the single best thing written on Tolkien&quot;, and &quot;the seminal monograph&quot;. The book has received over 900 scholarly citations. Both &quot;Road&quot; and &quot;Author&quot; have been often reprinted and translated. In 2000, Michael Drout and H. Wynne looked back at Shippey&#x27;s books as landmarks in Tolkien research; they comment that &quot;The real brilliance of &quot;Road&quot; was in method: Shippey would relentlessly gather small philological facts and combine them into unassailable logical propositions; part of the pleasure of reading &quot;Road&quot; lies in watching all these pieces fall into place and Shippey&#x27;s larger arguments materialize out of the welter of interesting detail.&quot;

As an acknowledged expert on Tolkien, Shippey served for a while on the editorial board of &quot;Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review&quot;. Gergely Nagy, reviewing Shippey&#x27;s &quot;festschrift&quot;, wrote that Shippey &quot;has been (and still is) an enabler for all of us in Tolkien Studies: author of the seminal &quot;The Road to Middle-earth&quot; (first published in 1983) and countless insightful articles, he is the veritable pope of the field.&quot;

=== Family life ===

Shippey married Susan Veale in 1966; after that marriage ended, he married Catherine Elizabeth Barton in 1993. He has three children. He retired in 2008, and now lives in Dorset.

== Film and television ==

Shippey has appeared in several television documentaries, in which he spoke about Tolkien and his Middle-earth writings:

* 1984: &quot;Tolkien Remembered&quot;
* 1996: &quot;J.R.R.T.: A Film Portrait of J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;

* 2002: &quot;Page to Screen: The Lord of the Rings&quot; 
* 2003: &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien: Origins of Middle-Earth&quot;

He participated in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, for which he assisted the dialect coaches. He was featured on all three of the documentary DVDs that accompany the special extended edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, and later also that of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogy. He summarized his experiences with the film project as follows:

<doc id="403207" wikidata="Q20916" url="?curid=403207" title="Liberty Korea Party">
<text>The Liberty Korea Party () was a conservative political party in South Korea that was described variously as right-wing, right-wing populist, or far-right. Until February 2017, it was known as the Saenuri Party (), and before that as the Hannara Party (; also called Grand National Party; GNP) from 1997 to 2012, both of which are still colloquially used to refer to the party. The party formerly held a plurality of seats in the 20th Assembly before its ruling status was transferred to the Democratic Party of Korea on 27 December 2016, following the creation of the splinter Bareun Party by former Saenuri members who distanced themselves from President Park Geun-hye in the 2016 South Korean political scandal.

In February 2020, the Liberty Korea Party merged with Onward for Future 4.0 and the New Conservative Party, launching the United Future Party to contest the 2020 South Korean legislative election.

==History==
===1997: Foundation of Grand National Party===

The party was founded in 1997, when the United Democratic Party and New Korea Party merged.

Its earliest ancestor was the Democratic Republican Party under the authoritarian rule of Park Chung Hee in 1963. On Park&#x27;s death, and at the beginning of the rule of Chun Doo-hwan in 1980, it was reconstituted and renamed as the Democratic Justice Party. In 1988, party member Roh Tae-woo introduced a wide range of political reforms including direct presidential elections and a new constitution.

The party was renamed in 1993, during the presidency of Kim Young-sam, with the merger of other parties to form the Democratic Liberal Party (&quot;Minju Jayudang&quot;). It was renamed as the New Korea Party (&quot;Sinhangukdang&quot;) in 1995, and it then became the Grand National Party in November 1997 following its merger with the smaller United Democratic Party and various conservative parties.

===1998–2007: Lost ten years===

Three months later, in 1998, with the election of Kim Dae-jung of the National Congress for New Politics as president, the conservative party&#x27;s governing role came to an end, and it began its first ever period in opposition, which would last ten years. In October 2012, the Advancement Unification Party merged with the Saenuri Party.

Following the 2000 parliamentary elections, it was the single largest political party, with 54% of the vote and 133 seats out of 271. The party continued to control the National Assembly.
The party was defeated in the parliamentary election in 2004 following the attempted impeachment of President Roh Moo-hyun, gaining only 121 seats out of 299. The party&#x27;s defeat reflected public disapproval of the attempted impeachment, which was instigated by the party. This was the first time in its history the party had not won the most seats. It gained back five seats in by-elections, bringing it to 127 seats as of 28 October 2005.

===2008–2012: Recovering position of the ruling party and Lee Myung-bak government===
On 19 December 2007, the GNP&#x27;s candidate, former Seoul mayor Lee Myung-bak won the presidential election, ending the party&#x27;s ten-year period in opposition.

In the April 2008 general election, the GNP secured a majority of 153 seats out of 299 and gained power in the administration and the parliament as well as most local governments, despite low voter turnout.

One of the main bases of popular support of the party originates from the conservative, traditionalist elite and the rural population, except for farmers. It is strongest in the Gyeongsang Province region. Former party head, and 2007 presidential candidate, Park Geun-hye is the daughter of former President Park Chung Hee who ruled from 1961 to 1979. Although Representative Won Hee-ryeong and Hong Jun-pyo ran for the party primary as reformist candidates, former Seoul mayor and official presidential candidate Lee Myung-bak gained more support (about 40%) from the Korean public.

The GNP suffered a setback in the 2010 local elections, losing a total of 775 local seats throughout the counties, but remained with the most seats in the region.

GNP-affiliated politician, Oh Se-hoon, lost his mayoral position in Seoul after the Seoul Free Lunch Referendum.

The Grand National Party celebrated its 14th anniversary on 21 November 2011, amid uncertainties from intra-party crises.

The DDoS attacks during the October 2011 by-election have become a central concern of the GNP as it could potentially disintegrate the party leadership.

===2012–2016: Renaming to Saenuri Party and Park Geun-hye government===
====Emergency Response Commission====
The Hong Jun-pyo leadership system collapsed on 9 December 2011, and the GNP Emergency Response Commission was launched on 17 December 2011, with Park Geun-hye as commission chairperson, to prepare for the forthcoming Legislative Election 2012 on 11 April 2012, and the Presidential Election 2012 on 19 December 2012.

There was a debate with Commission members about whether to transform the Grand National Party into a non-conservative political party or not, but Park said the GNP would never become non-conservative and will follow the real values of conservatism.

===2016–2019: 2016 South Korean political scandal and impeachment===

The party&#x27;s leader and South Korean President Park Geun-hye was impeached and convicted for her role in a corruption scandal.

===Dissolution===
The Liberty Korea Party merged with Onward for Future 4.0 and the New Conservative Party on 17 February, launching the United Future Party in time for the upcoming 2020 South Korean legislative election.

==Official color==
In February 2012, the party changed its political official color from blue to red. This was a change from the previous 30 years where blue was usually the symbol of the conservative parties.

==Ideology and policies==

The party supports free trade and neoliberal economic policies. It favors maintaining strong cooperation with the United States and Japan, and also believes that each Korean first level province needs to have a sustainable economy. The party is also conservative on social issues such as opposition to legal recognition of same-sex couples. The party supports equality between man and woman, as quoted, &quot;and ensure that both men and women are equally guaranteed opportunities&quot;.

===Four major rivers project===
One of the party&#x27;s important policies is to financially secure The Four Major Rivers Project since President Lee Myung-bak was in office. This project&#x27;s budget disputes have sparked controversial political motions in the National Assembly for three consecutive years.

===Sejong City project===
The party has been less inclined toward the creation of a new capital city for South Korea, to be called Sejong City than the previous administration. As of 2012, the Saenuri Party has indicated that some governmental offices will be relocated to the new city, but not all.

===Human rights activism===
The party has been very active in promoting the North Korean Human Rights Law, which would officially condemn the use of torture, public executions and other human rights violations in North Korea.

Party representative Ha Tae Kyung is the founder of Open Radio for North Korea, an NGO dedicated to spreading news and information about democracy, to which citizens of North Korea have little access due to their government&#x27;s isolationist policies. In April 2012, Saenuri member Cho Myung-Chul became the first North Korean defector elected to the National Assembly. In spring 2012, several Saenuri representatives took part in the Save My Friend protests, organized to oppose China&#x27;s policy of repatriating North Korean defectors, and expressed their solidarity with Park Sun-young&#x27;s hunger strike.

==Controversy==
===Online sockpuppetry===
The party has records of secretly hiring and paying university students to generate online replies favorable to the GNP. GNP member Jin Seong-ho () formally apologized on 2 July 2009, for making a remark that &quot;the GNP occupied Naver,&quot; one of the biggest South Korean internet portals.

===8 December 2010, controversial bill-passing===
The party passed a bill relating to the year 2011 national budget without the opposition parties&#x27; input on 8 December 2010. It had caused legislative violence before. This process of passing the budget bill sparked controversy over potential illegality. Due to this incident, many South Korean political, academic and citizen groups expressed their outrage against current mainstream politics. The reason for forceful passing of the bill was due mainly to the budget disputes over the controversial Four Major Rivers Project. Many Buddhists in South Korea criticized the budget bill for neglecting the national Temple Stay program. This has led the Jogye Order, the largest Buddhist order in South Korea, to sever ties with the GNP and becoming financially independent without any funding from the government. The interns and the staff working in the National Assembly officially complained on 17 December that their salary was unpaid after the passing of this bill.

===Views of Individual Party Members===
Certain members of the Liberty Korea Party have faced criticism for expressing anti-refugee, homophobic views and advocacy of authoritarian rules of the October Restoration.

<text>The Kansas Department of Corrections (KDOC) is a cabinet-level agency of Kansas that operates the state&#x27;s correctional facilities, both juvenile and adult, the state&#x27;s parole system, and the state&#x27;s Prisoner Review Board. It is headquartered in Topeka.

==Correctional facilities==
The Kansas Department of Corrections operates eight adult correctional facility sites, three satellite correctional facility sites, and one juvenile correctional facility.
* El Dorado Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 1955)
* Ellsworth Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 913)
* Hutchinson Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 1862)
* Kansas Juvenile Correctional Complex (offender capacity 270)
* Lansing Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 1906)
* Larned Correctional Mental Health Facility (inmate capacity 626)
* Norton Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 975)
*Topeka Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 903) – Women&#x27;s facility
* Winfield Correctional Facility (inmate capacity 554)
* Wichita Work Release Facility (inmate capacity 250)

==Community &amp; Field Services==
The community and field services division has two units - parole and community corrections.

==Victim Services==
The Office of Victim Services (OVS) provides confidential support and information to victims, survivors, and witnesses if the offender in the crime was sentenced to incarceration in the Kansas Department of Corrections. Services provided include victim notification, safety planning, victim restitution, parole comment session advocacy, Victim/Offender Dialogue (VOD) program, facility tours, and apology letters.

==Kansas Correctional Industries==
The department uses inmate labor to produce products such as office furniture, park equipment, and clothing for state government.

==Staffing==
The department has suffered staff shortages for many years. In 2017, press reports indicated a turnover among KDOC officers of 46% per year. A 10% pay raise increased the hourly wage for uniformed employees to $14.66, but did not include non-uniformed staff. The El Dorado facility was authorized a staff of 682, but about a quarter of the positions were vacant.

By 2019, the department was forced to contract with CoreCivic to move six hundred prisoners to Arizona due to staff shortages. At that time, the department reported an overall inmate population of 10,002 indicating about ten percent of the population was to be moved out of state.

<doc id="403214" wikidata="Q488952" url="?curid=403214" title="Democratic Party (South Korea, 2000)">
<text>The Democratic Party (DP; ) was a political party in South Korea. Formerly named Millennium Democratic Party (; MDP), it was renamed on 6 May 2005. After its dissolution, its members joined the Uri Party or the successor Democratic Party.

== History ==

In 2000, the party officially founded, after it merged of National Congress for New Politics and New People Party led by Lee In-je and a number of conservative minded politicians joined it. In the 2000 Parliamentary election the party came second winning 115 seats.

Roh Moo-hyun was elected as president in 2002, but he subsequently left the party after he inaugurated as president and his supporters formed the Uri Party in 2003.

The MDP lost majority when Roh was impeached in March 2004 by the National Assembly for illegal electioneering and incompetence charges with support from the Grand National Party, losing 53 seats to a total of only 9 seats in the 2004 parliamentary election. Roh Moo-hyun was later re-instated by the Constitutional Court, and served as president until the end of his term.

By June 2007, much of the party joined the Uri Party, while the New People faction merged the party with the Central Reform United New Party to form a new Democratic Party.

== Political position ==
The Democratic Party is a political party led by Kim Dae-jung individual charisma and is generally classified as &quot;liberalism&quot; () or &quot;conservative liberalism&quot; (). Later in 2017, South Korea&#x27;s centre-right conservative politician Ha Tae-keung said of Kim Dae-jung, &quot;He devoted his life to democracy and the market economy in Korea&quot;, adding, &quot;He is a big adult in the conservative camp&quot;.

South Korean centrist conservative-liberal politician Sohn Hak-kyu said &quot;the (Democratic Party of Korea&#x27;s) DJ period was a complete &#x27;centrist&#x27;, but the Roh Moo-hyun government and the Moon Jae-in government were on the &#x27;left-leaning&#x27; side&quot;. (For your information, &quot;DJ&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Dae-jung&quot;.)

Kim Dae-jung and the Democratic Party enacted the &#x27;Domestic Violence Prevention Act&#x27; () and the &#x27;Anti Male and Female Discrimination Act&#x27; (), and established the &#x27;Ministry of Gender Equality&quot; (). Also, Kim Dae-jung himself was a feminist. On the other hand, he pursued a typical conservative economic agenda and was called a &quot;Neoliberal Revolutionist&quot; (). Kim Dae-jung also was a supporter of the New Labour In the United Kingdom and of the Third Way and an Neo-developmental state.

<text>The Constitutionalist Liberal Party () is a political party in Nicaragua.
==History==

The Constitutionalist Liberal Party is the political successor of the Democratic Party, a faction which has existed since Nicaragua became independent during the 1830s. After being defeated by the Legitimists (future members of the Conservative Party) in a civil war in the 1850s, the Democratic Party returned to power in 1893 under President José Santos Zelaya, who lost power in 1909.

Under pressure from American troops who had occupied Nicaragua, the Democrats lost power the following year, and remained out of power until 1926 when, following another revolt, they forced the Conservatives into a coalition government. Some factions of the Democratic Party, along with some factions of the Conservative Party, supported Anastasio Somoza García, who gained power in the 1930s, defeating another Democratic faction led by Augusto Sandino, who continued fighting after the 1926 coalition agreement. The Democrats and Conservatives were both marginalized by the Somoza family, who formed the Nationalist Liberal Party, and continued to be out of power when the Somozas were overthrown by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in 1979.

In 1968, Ramiro Sacasa Guerro, a relative of the Somozas and education minister, opposed Anastasio Somoza Debayle&#x27;s re-election bid and formed the Constitutionalist Liberal Movement (MLC) faction within the Nationalist Liberal Party. The formation of this faction, which believed in opposing Somoza by political means instead of through armed struggle, led to Somoza dismissing Sacasa from his position. After the Sandinista victory in 1979, the MLC earned a seat on the Council of State which was founded following the end of Somoza&#x27;s rule, but that seat was soon revoked following the FSLN&#x27;s accusations of the MLC&#x27;s lack of representation. After Sacasa&#x27;s death in a car accident, the MLC became a political party in 1983, and again gained a seat in the Council of State, occupied by Public Prosecutor Julio Centeno.

The Democratic Party had by this time split into many Liberal groups, many of whom supported the United Nicaraguan Opposition which successfully opposed the Sandinistas in the 1990 elections. By the late 1990s, led by Arnoldo Alemán, most of the Democratic/Liberal groups consolidated to form the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, which was at first known as the Liberal Alliance. In 1996 Alemán won the presidential election and served as president until 2002, while the party won 42 of the 93 seats in the 1996 congressional elections, more than any other party. At the November 2001 elections, the party gained a majority in Congress, winning 47 of 92 seats. The same day, its candidate Enrique Bolaños won the presidential elections.

Though still a strong force in Nicaragua, there have been many disputes within it since 2001 which, by 2006, had caused it to lose its majority in Congress and the presidency. Bolaños broke with the PLC to form the Alliance for the Republic. José Rizo was nominated as the presidential candidate and José Antonio Alvarado was nominated as the vice-presidential candidate for the November 2006 elections. Eduardo Montealegre, another presidential candidate for the elections, was a former member of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party and formed the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance which includes other former PLC members. Montealegre and Rizo were both defeated, as Sandinista Daniel Ortega finished far enough ahead of both of them to avoid a runoff. Rizo came in third place with 26% of the vote. The party came in second place in the congressional elections, winning 25 of 92 seats in the National Assembly.

The party was a member of the Liberal International, but left that organization in 2005.

For the 2011 Nicaraguan general election, the PLC nominated Arnoldo Alemán for president again, who had been acquitted for fraud and corruption charges, after nobody else ran in the party&#x27;s primaries. Alemán was able to collect 80,000 signatures in support of his candidacy. With Alemán as the PLC&#x27;s candidate for president, the party went on to have its worst electoral result ever since it started participating in elections in 1990, ending up with slightly under 6% of the votes. In the National Assembly, the party lost 23 seats.

For the 2016 Nicaraguan general election, the party nominated congressman Maximino Rodríguez for the presidency, who distanced himself from former president Alemán. Rodríguez had said that &quot;there were no conditions to hold elections&quot;, but ultimately decided to participate in the elections anyway. The party had a better showing in these elections, winning slightly over 15% of the votes.

In the lead-up to the 2021 Nicaraguan general election, the party registered Walter Espinoza as its presidential candidate, following a controversial series of events. Espinoza had been involved with the PLC ever since the 1990s, starting in the party&#x27;s youth wing. Initially, Espinoza participated in the party&#x27;s primary elections but later withdrew his nomination. Subsequently, he supported PLC leader María Haydée Osuna in requesting the cancellation of the Citizens for Liberty party&#x27;s legal status, a move that effectively eliminated Nicaragua&#x27;s only significant opposition party. This led to the resignation of the PLC&#x27;s original candidate, Milton Arcia, in protest, after which Espinoza was registered as the new candidate. Espinoza ultimately received over 14% of the votes, in an election that was regarded by international observers as a sham.

<doc id="403223" wikidata="Q7601169" url="?curid=403223" title="Star Wars Trading Card Game">
<text>Star Wars: The Trading Card Game is an out-of-print collectible card game produced by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). The original game was created by game designer Richard Garfield, the creator of the first modern trading card game, &quot;&quot;. After its initial release in April 2002, the game was &#x27;put on indefinite hold&#x27; by WotC in late 2005. The Star Wars Trading Card Game Independent Development Committee was created by a group of fans to continue development of the game. They design new cards that are available as free downloads at their website.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Star Wars: TCG&quot; focuses on gaining control of in-game arenas. In this two-player game, each player controls units which battle in the arenas. The main way to win is to take control of two of the three arenas. Some cards also add new win conditions for the game. 

The three arenas are Space, Ground and Character, and feature units from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, such as Star Destroyers, starfighters, AT-ATs, armies, and characters like Luke Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker, Padmé Amidala, Mara Jade, and Darth Vader. There is also a build zone, a draw pile (for your deck), and a discard pile. The two sides to the game are the Dark side and the Light side, representing the two sides of the Force. There are also neutral cards, which can be used by either side. 

There are several types of cards. They are:
*Units: these can control arenas and are the most plentiful card in any deck. Each unit can only be placed in a certain arena designated by color and subtype. All units have several statistics including: build cost, speed, power, health, alignment. Units must be built.
**Space: These units have a blue border and represent the space ships throughout the Star Wars films and books.
**Ground: These units have a green border and represent the ground forces in the Star Wars films and books.
**Character: These units have a purple border and represent the people and aliens found throughout the Star Wars films and books.
*Battle: These cards have special one time use effects and can only be used while your units are doing battle. They don&#x27;t need to be built and some can be enhanced for an extra cost to give the user a better effect.
*Mission: These cards are like battle cards, but must be built. Their effects differ and must be played in the build step.
*Location: This type of card affects its arena until it is replaced with another Location card. Most location cards are colored like units and can only be placed in specific arenas. Some locations can be placed in any arena and are not colored like any normal unit.
*Equipment:This card type represents the weapons and vehicle upgrades in the Star Wars universe. These cards have a silver border and enhance the unit they are equipped to.

==Abilities==
*Activated Abilities
These are abilities that units have on them and are used by paying a cost (usually force).
*Static Abilities
These abilities are on as long as the unit is in its arena (e.g. A unit has &quot;Each of your other characters get +10 speed&quot;, as long as that unit is in its arena, all your characters gain 10 speed).
*Triggered Abilities
These abilities contain a &quot;when&quot; or &quot;whenever&quot; (e.g. a unit has &quot;When this unit is discarded draw three cards.&quot; &quot;When this unit is discarded&quot; is the trigger, and &quot;draw three cards&quot; is the ability).

==TCG Sets==


==Playing the game==
This is a two-player game. The following is recommended for each player, but can be shared among friends and opponents in casual play:
*two sixty-card decks (one Light side, one Dark side)
*several dice (six sided)
*a method of tracking Force points (counters, pen and paper, or a twenty sided die)
*damage counters
*build counters (can be the same as damage counters)

<text>Neumarkt () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Nürnberger Land, Amberg-Sulzbach, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Kelheim, Eichstätt and Roth.

==History==
In early medieval times the region was ruled by the counts of Wolfstein, while the city of Neumarkt was directly subordinate to the emperor and hence independent from the Wolfstein family. In the 14th century, the counts of Wolfstein, as well as the city of Neumarkt, became subordinate to the Electorate of the Palatinate, and in 1628 to Bavaria.

Below is an outline of the history of Neumarkt, from its founding in the 12th century to its destruction in World War II. The town&#x27;s development can be divided into 5 periods:

The beginnings of Neumarkt:
The &quot;new market&quot; is founded on an important long-distance trade route. Neumarkt falls under the rule of the Wittelsbach dynasty and is allotted to the Palatinate on the Rhine with the partitioning of the territory in 1329.

Neumarkt as seat of the Palatinate Counts:
In the 15th century, Neumarkt become the seat of collateral lines of the Palatinate Counts. Count Palatine Frederick II transferred his residence from Amberg to Neumarkt and had constructed a palace.

The Reformation in Neumarkt:
Neumarkt converts to the Lutheran faith. The introduction of Calvinism causes disturbance.

The rise of industry in Neumarkt:
Reflecting the general development in Bavaria, the transition of Neumarkt from a country town to an industrial center during the 19th century proceeds rather slowly and in small steps.

The destruction of Neumarkt in World War II:
On 23 February and 11 April 1945, Neumarkt is heavily bombed. The resistance of the SS results in the destruction of the town.

The district in its present shape was established in 1972, when the city of Neumarkt lost its status as an urban district and was incorporated into the district.

==Geography==
The district is located in the mountains of the Franconian Jura. The southern parts are occupied by the Altmühl Valley Nature Park.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays three lions.&lt;br&gt;The yellow lion was the heraldic animal of the Electorate of the Palatinate.&lt;br&gt;The red lions were the arms of the Wolfstein dynasty.

<text>The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American gothic stop motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of Halloween Town, who stumbles upon Christmas Town and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix and Ed Ivory.

&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of &quot;Vincent&quot; that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton&#x27;s thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film&#x27;s gothic tone would be &quot;too dark and scary for kids&quot;.

&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box-office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film; it lost to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Thirteen years after its initial release, the film was reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and supernatural beings. Jack Skellington, the well-respected Pumpkin King, leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. This year however, Jack grows tired of the same routine and longs for something new. Upon discovering trees containing doors to other holiday-themed worlds, Jack stumbles through the one leading to Christmas Town and is fascinated by the unfamiliar holiday.

Jack returns home and shares his discovery with his friends and neighbors, but they struggle to grasp the concept of Christmas, although there is one character in Christmas Town they can relate to, a mighty lobster-like king, who is known as &quot;Sandy Claws&quot;. After several futile attempts at finding a way to rationally explain Christmas, Jack decides to &quot;improve&quot; the holiday instead. He announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, to various residents.

Sally, the creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision predicting that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa; however, he orders them not to involve their superior Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling, in their plot.

When Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town, Jack, surprised that he is not the clawed man he expected, tells Santa that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, they disobey Jack&#x27;s orders and bring Santa to Oogie, who plots to play a game with Santa&#x27;s life at stake. As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world, Sally (after failing to stop Jack from carrying out his plans) attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie, only to be captured herself.

Jack&#x27;s presents terrify the real world&#x27;s populace, who contact the local authorities and are instructed to lock down their homes for protection. The military is alerted and Jack is shot out of the sky, leading Halloween Town&#x27;s populace to believe he is dead. It is revealed that he survived and has crashed into a cemetery. Bemoaning the trouble that he has caused, Jack realizes he nonetheless enjoyed the experience and that it gave him new ideas for celebrating Halloween, reigniting his love for the holiday.

Upon returning home, Jack rescues Santa and Sally, confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the bugs inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Though displeased with Jack for his foolish actions and not listening to Sally earlier, Santa makes amends with Jack and resumes his yearly duties, replacing Jack&#x27;s presents with genuine ones.

All of Halloween Town celebrates Jack&#x27;s return. Santa brings a snowfall to the town, thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it, while Jack and Sally finally declare their love for each other on top of the Spiral Hill.

==Voice cast==


* Chris Sarandon (speaking voice) and Danny Elfman (singing voice) as Jack Skellington, a skeleton known as the &quot;Pumpkin King&quot; of Halloween Town. Elfman was initially cast as Jack&#x27;s singing voice and, after the songs were recorded, Sarandon was cast to match Elfman&#x27;s voice style.
** Elfman also voices:
*** Barrel, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie.
*** The Clown with the Tear-Away Face, a demonic entity disguised as a unicycle-riding clown.
* Catherine O&#x27;Hara as:

* Glenn Shadix as the Mayor of Halloween Town, an enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings. His double-sided head spins between a &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;sad&quot; face, mirroring his wild mood swings; where some career politicians are described as figuratively two-faced, the mayor is literally so. Shadix and Burton had previously worked on &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.

The cast also features Debi Durst, Greg Proops, Kerry Katz, Randy Crenshaw, Sherwood Ball, Carmen Twillie, Glenn Walters, and John Morris voicing various characters.

Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album.

==Production==
===Development===

As writer Tim Burton&#x27;s upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. &quot;Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn&#x27;t there before,&quot; Burton would later recall. After completing his short film &quot;Vincent&quot; in 1982, Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, drawing inspiration from television specials of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; and the poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children&#x27;s book. He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs&#x27; works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of &quot;Vincent&quot; in 1982, Disney started to consider developing &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project&#x27;s development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed &quot;too weird&quot; to the company. As Disney was unable to &quot;offer his nocturnal loners enough scope&quot;, Burton was fired from the studio in 1984 and went on to direct the commercially successful films &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) and &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) for Warner Bros. Pictures.
Over the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film expanding on the poem&#x27;s storyline with the latter as director. Selick chose not to work with MTV for a series based on his short film &quot;Slow Bob in the Lower Dimensions&quot; to direct this film. Burton&#x27;s own success with live-action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio&#x27;s streak of recent successes in feature animation. Disney was looking forward to &quot;Nightmare&quot; &quot;to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.&quot; Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney&#x27;s image, elaborating &quot;we can think outside the envelope. We can do different and unusual things.&quot;

&quot;Nightmare&quot; marked Burton&#x27;s third consecutive film with a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and he did not want to be involved with &quot;the painstakingly slow process of stop motion&quot;. To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film&#x27;s songs. Elfman found writing &quot;Nightmare&quot;″s eleven songs to be &quot;one of the easiest jobs I&#x27;ve ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington.&quot; Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay. With Thompson&#x27;s screenplay, Selick stated, &quot;there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline&#x27;s. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually.&quot; Thompson clashed with Burton and he also destroyed the editing machine after she said she wanted to redraft the film&#x27;s ending.

===Filming===
Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, &quot;When we reach Halloween Town, it&#x27;s entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it&#x27;s an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the &#x27;Real World&#x27;, everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.&quot; Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film&#x27;s prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, &quot;It&#x27;s as though [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn&#x27;t involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like &#x27;a Tim Burton film&#x27;, which is not so different from my own films.&quot; When asked about Burton&#x27;s involvement, Selick claimed, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.&quot; Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with digital effects and some second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult, because he was simultaneously filming &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and in pre-production for &quot;Ed Wood&quot;.

The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having &quot;around four hundred heads&quot;, allowing the expression of every possible emotion. Sally&#x27;s mouth movements &quot;were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, […] only Sally&#x27;s face &#x27;mask&#x27; was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements.&quot; The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack.

==Soundtracks==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records. The film&#x27;s soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart. For the film&#x27;s 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc that contained covers of five of the film&#x27;s songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple, and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included. On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album &quot;Nightmare Revisited&quot;, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T&#x27;s, The All-American Rejects, and many more.

American gothic rock band London After Midnight featured a cover of &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot; on their 1998 album &quot;Oddities&quot;. LiLi Roquelin performed a French cover of &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot; on her album &quot;Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life?&quot; in 2010. Pentatonix released a cover of &quot;Making Christmas&quot; for their 2018 Christmas album &quot;Christmas Is Here!&quot;.

In 2003, the Disneyland &quot;Haunted Mansion Holiday&quot; soundtrack CD was released. Although most of the album&#x27;s songs are not original ones from the film, one song is a medley of &quot;Making Christmas&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This?&quot;, and &quot;Kidnap the Sandy Claws&quot;. Other songs included are original holiday songs changed to incorporate the theme of the film. However, the last song is the soundtrack for the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday ride.

==Release==
&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup (as was advertised as Walt Disney Pictures in the behind the scenes sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;), but Disney decided to release the film under the studio&#x27;s adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be &quot;too dark and scary for kids,&quot; Selick remembered. &quot;Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.&quot; To convey Burton&#x27;s involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as &quot;Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas.&quot; According to Selick, the decision was made approximately three weeks before the film went into wide release. Burton explained that, &quot;…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I&#x27;m not quite sure about.&quot; The film made its world premiere on the opening day celebration of the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993.

=== Reissues and re-releases ===

Industrial Light &amp; Magic assisted in the process. It subsequently re-released on October 19, 2007, October 24, 2008, and October 23, 2009. The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010. The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema.

In October 2020, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was re-released in 2,194 theaters. It grossed $1.3 million over the weekend, finishing fourth behind &quot;Tenet&quot;.

The film was once again theatrically re-released on October 11, 2024, including RealD 3D and Disney Digital 3-D formats.

===Home media===
With years of successful home video sales, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; later achieved the ranks of a cult film. Touchstone Home Video first released the film on VHS and LaserDisc (in both deluxe CAV and widescreen editions) on September 30, 1994, and on DVD on December 2, 1997. &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; was released on DVD a second time on October 3, 2000, as a special edition. The release included an audio commentary by Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik, a 28-minute making-of documentary, a gallery of concept art, storyboards, test footage and deleted scenes. Burton&#x27;s &quot;Vincent&quot; (1982) and &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984) were also included. Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases. The film was released on UMD for PlayStation Portable on October 25, 2005.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued the DVD (this time with an anamorphic transfer) and on Blu-ray Disc (for the first time) on August 26, 2008, as a two-disc digitally remastered &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot;, but still containing the same special features.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; on Blu-ray 3D on August 30, 2011. The release included a Blu-ray 3D disc, Blu-ray disc and a DVD that includes both a DVD and digital copy.

In 2018, a sing-along version, accompanied by the theatrical cut and a Movies Anywhere copy, as a single-disc version for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The singalong version was also released on Disney+ on September 30, 2022.

In celebration of its 30th anniversary, the film was remastered in 4K and was released on 4K Blu-ray, including extra content, on August 22, 2023.

===Marketing===
Disney has extensively marketed the film and its characters across many forms of media and memorabilia, including action figures, books, games, art crafts, and fashion products. Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into bendable figures, while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art. Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume.

Various Disneyland and the branching theme parks host attractions featuring &quot;Nightmare&quot; characters, particularly during Halloween and Christmas seasons. Since 2001, Disneyland has given its Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction a &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; theme for the holiday season. It features characters, decorations and music from the film, in addition to Mickey&#x27;s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party and Mickey&#x27;s Halloween Party featuring the film&#x27;s characters. Additionally, Jack hosts the &quot;Halloween Screams&quot;, HalloWishes, and &quot;Not So Spooky Spectacular!&quot; fireworks shows at Magic Kingdom (where the host is Ghost Host) and Disneyland (where the host is Jack himself), as well as the Frightfully Fun Parade.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Around the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, &quot;I hope &quot;Nightmare&quot; goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn&#x27;t, that doesn&#x27;t negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn&#x27;t have to earn &quot;Aladdin&quot;-sized grosses to satisfy us.&quot; The film earned $50 million in the United States in its initial theatrical run and was regarded as a moderate sleeper hit.

&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; made an additional $11.1 million in box office gross in its 2006 reissue. The 2007, 2008, 2009, 2020, and 2023 reissues earned $15.8 million, $2.5 million, $2.3 million, and $10 million, respectively, increasing the film&#x27;s total box office gross to $107.8 million. It would also finish in top 10 during the first three-day weekend of its 2024 re-release, grossing $2.4 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; holds a rating of 95% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert praised the film&#x27;s visual inventiveness: &quot;One of the many pleasures of &quot;Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; is that there is not a single recognizable landscape in it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform.&quot; He wrote that it presented a world &quot;that is as completely new as the worlds we saw for the first time in such films as &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. What all of these films have in common is a visual richness, so abundant they deserve more than one viewing.&quot; He wrote that &quot;The songs by Danny Elfman are fun too, a couple of them using lyrics so clever they could be updated from Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. And the choreography, liberated from gravity and reality, has an energy of its own, as when the furniture, the architecture, and the very landscape itself gets in on the act.&quot; He notes that &quot;some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children, but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a restoration of &quot;originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. … It&#x27;s 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.&quot; James Berardinelli stated &quot;&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it&#x27;s a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it&#x27;s an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; does what it intends to: entertain.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; enjoyed the film&#x27;s similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; and other German Expressionist films.

Michael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch&#x27;s dog. Philip Nel writes that the film &quot;challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters&quot;, contrasting Jack as a &quot;good trickster&quot; with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Seuss&#x27; Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose &quot;degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that … they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on.&quot; This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan. Yvonne Tasker notes &quot;the complex characterization seen in &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;&quot;.

Negative or mixed reviews of the film were generally similar in theme to the positive ones but said that the interesting concept and &quot;wonderful&quot; special effects did not make up for the &quot;superficial&quot; plot, &quot;weak&quot; screenplay and &quot;one-dimensional&quot; characters.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. &quot;Nightmare&quot; won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, while Elfman won Best Music. Selick and the animators were also nominated for their work. Elfman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Most recently, the film ranked #1 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; &quot;Top 25 Best Christmas Movies&quot; list.

== Legacy ==
Blink-182&#x27;s 2003 song &quot;I Miss You&quot; makes reference to the film.

The third and fourth episodes of the fifth season of &quot;Fargo&quot; feature a group of characters that wear masks depicting characters from the movie, including Jack Skellington.

==Possible sequel==

In 2001, Disney began to consider producing a sequel, but rather than using stop motion, they wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. &quot;I was always very protective of [&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;], not to do sequels or things of that kind,&quot; Burton explained. &quot;You know, Jack visits Thanksgiving world or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it, because it&#x27;s a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.&quot; The 2004 video game &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie&#x27;s Revenge&quot; did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom&#x27;s crew of developers going after Burton for advice and having the collaboration of the film&#x27;s art director, Deane Taylor. In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.

In February 2019, it was reported that a new &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; film was in the works with Disney considering either a stop-motion sequel or live-action remake. In October 2019, Chris Sarandon expressed interest on reprising his role as Jack Skellington if a sequel film ever materializes.

On February 22, 2021, Disney Publishing announced that a sequel was given to the 1993 film in the form of a young adult novel, released as &quot;Long Live the Pumpkin Queen&quot;. It was written by Shea Ernshaw and features Sally as the main character, told through her point-of-view, with events taking place after the film. The book was released on August 2, 2022.

In October 2023, Selick stated that he would like to do a prequel film about how Jack became king of Halloween Town. The following month, however, Burton said that he did not want to see any further projects in that universe. In August 2024, Selick expressed doubt that a sequel would ever materialize, not wanting to &quot;beat [the film] to death.&quot;

<text>The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) is the code department of the Illinois state government that operates the adult state prison system. The IDOC is led by a director appointed by the Governor of Illinois, and its headquarters are in Springfield.

The IDOC was established in 1970, combining the state&#x27;s prisons, juvenile centers, and parole services. The juvenile corrections system was split off into the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice on July 1, 2006.

==Facilities==

Crossroads and North Lawndale Adult Transition Centers are operated by the Safer Foundation.

===Closed prisons===

* Alton Military Prison: open 1833 through 1857, replaced by Joliet; operated as a military prison during the Civil War
* Decatur Adult Transition Center; closed 2012
* Dwight Correctional Center: closed in 2013; maximum security
* Hardin County Work Camp; closed 2015; low minimum
* Jesse &#x27;Ma&#x27; Houston Adult Transition Center: closed 2011; transitional facility
* Joliet Prison: closed in 2002; south of Stateville Correctional Center
* Kankakee Minimum-Security Unit; low minimum, closed 2010
* Southern Illinois Adult Transition Center; closed 2012
* Tamms Correctional Center: closed in 2013; maximum security
** Tamms Minimum Security Unit: low minimum
* Thomson Correctional Center, a maximum security facility built in 2001 near Thomson, Illinois, was sold by the state to the federal government in 2012, and was subsequently renamed the Administrative United States Penitentiary, Thomson (AUSP Thomson). In January 2019, the prison facility was fully activated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In March 2020, the prison facility was renamed the United States Penitentiary, Thomson (USP Thomson).

===Security levels===
The Illinois Department of Corrections uses a three level security designation system that encompasses three points of data. The initial classification is performed at one of the reception facilities located throughout the state. Classification reviews are performed periodically on offenders at their assigned facilities. The primary points of data are security level, offender grade, and escape level. Within each security level there are additional specifics that separate each security level into additional levels.

Security Levels: 1 – Maximum, 2 – Medium, 3 – Minimum, P – Pending (Reception/Classification Status)

Offender Grades: A, B, C

Escape Level: (L)ow, (M)oderate, (H)igh, (E)xtremely High, (P)ending (Reception/Classification Status)

The offender classification is designated in the example below:

2 (Security Level); A (Offender Grade); L (Escape Risk Level)

Within the Medium and Minimum security levels there are multiple levels of security as shown in the list of facilities above. There are several factors which determine the level of security at a facility level. A table below will highlight some of the most important distinctions. An offender can be housed at a facility one level lower than his current security classification for a limited period of time if located in the Segregation Unit while a transfer is pending after reclassification.

Offender grades are part of the discipline system utilized within the facilities. Offenders are initially assigned to A grade and afforded all privileges. B grade is a transitional grade for offenders moving back to A grade after demotion to C grade. C grade restricts telephone usage, commissary purchases to cosmetic/legal items, and prohibits many work and school assignments.

The escape risk system utilizes a metric to indicate the likelihood that an offender would attempt escape. Several factors are used to determine this metric including but not limited to crime of conviction, criminal history, history of escape attempts, and outstanding warrants. An oddity within the Moderate Escape Risk designation should be noted. This escape level is used for two completely different purposes. In one case this level is assigned to offenders who would otherwise be a low risk when placed in a higher security facility. For example, Dixon Correctional Center houses the majority of offenders with serious health problems. Offenders serving long sentences who are moved to this Level 3 facility will usually be assigned the moderate escape risk level as part of the reclassification performed to assign an offender with medical problems to this facility where they would otherwise remain at Level 1/2. The other use for this escape level is where an offender has an outstanding warrant or has absconded from parole or work release during the last 24 months. Offender identification cards indicate the escape level by utilizing a color coded background. Low escape risks have a white background, moderate escape risks have a blue background, high escape risks have a red background, and extremely high escape risks have a green background. Additionally, extremely high escape risks wear a green shirt and have a green stripe down their pant legs.

Offenders with special security clearances, such as outside clearance, special assignment clearances, or multi-level facility indicators (SMC for example at Dixon) will have data on the back of their offender identification cards.

==Death row==

Illinois had the death penalty until it was abolished in 2011. Illinois&#x27;s last execution was Andrew Kokoraleis, on March 17, 1999.

Pontiac Correctional Center housed the male death row, while Dwight Correctional Center housed the female death row. Prior to the January 11, 2003 commutation of death row sentences, male death row offenders were housed at Pontiac, Menard, and Tamms correctional centers. The execution chamber was located at Tamms Correctional Center. Previously, inmates had been executed at Stateville Correctional Center. In March 1998, the site of executions was moved from Stateville Correctional Center to Tamms Correctional Center in Tamms, Illinois.

<doc id="403232" wikidata="Q7594827" url="?curid=403232" title="St Michael (brand)">
<text>St Michael was a brand owned and used by British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer between 1927 and 2000.

==History==
In 1875, the firm of N. Corah and Sons of Leicester registered &quot;St Margaret&quot; as a brand name for their hosiery products. The name originated because their factory, which became one of the largest hosiery factories in Europe, was in the parish of St Margaret in Leicester. In 1926, Corahs entered into an agreement to supply Marks &amp; Spencer directly rather than through a wholesaler, and this had the potential to bring them into conflict with the Wholesale Textile Association. In order to protect their other distribution channels, Corahs sought to develop an alternative brand name for their goods sold through Marks &amp; Spencer. The name agreed by Simon Marks was St Michael, possibly after his father and co-founder of Marks &amp; Spencer, Michael Marks because it could be linked in the public mind with the St Margaret brand which had a reputation for quality.

The name was introduced in 1927 and registered as a trademark in 1928. At first it applied only to products produced by Corahs, but by 1950 and for the next fifty years, almost all goods sold by Marks &amp; Spencer used the St Michael brand.

The brand was dropped in 2000 as part of a general rebranding. For the next few years, the St Michael name was adopted as the &#x27;St Michael Quality Promise&#x27; on the back of food products, on the side of delivery vehicles and on in-store receipts.

In September 2021 Marks &amp; Spencer announced they would begin selling clothes using the brand again, after it gained popularity on vintage clothing resale websites.

As of 2007 Arizona had exported more than 2000 prisoners to privately run facilities in Oklahoma and Indiana, a number that would have been higher if not for a riot of Arizona prisoners at the GEO Group&#x27;s New Castle Correctional Facility on April 27, 2007, protesting the practice. As of 2013, the states of Vermont, California and Hawaii export prisoners to facilities in Arizona.

<text>The Socialist Party (, , PS) is a social-democratic political party in Portugal. It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the German city of Bad Münstereifel by militants who were at the time with the Portuguese Socialist Action (). The PS is a member of the Socialist International, Progressive Alliance and Party of European Socialists, and has eight members in the European Parliament within the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group during the 10th European Parliament.

The party won the 1976 general election and formed the first constitutional government after the 1974 revolution, with Mário Soares as prime minister. However, the government was unstable and fell in 1978. The PS lost the 1979 election, but returned to power in 1983, forming, with the Social Democratic Party, a Central Bloc coalition. It lasted two years and in 1985, the party was defeated and went back to opposition, remaining there for 10 years and losing the two following general elections. Under António Guterres, the party won the 1995 general election and returned to power, lasting until 2002, upon the resignation of Guterres. The party made a comeback and won a historic absolute majority in the 2005 general election under the leadership of José Sócrates. By 2011, the economic crisis led the party to lose the 2011 snap election and the party returned to the opposition. Despite losing the 2015 election, the party formed an agreement with the Left Bloc and the Unitary Democratic Coalition and managed to appoint António Costa as Prime Minister. Costa remained in office for 9 years, until 2024, and during his term won two elections, the last one, in 2022, with an absolute majority. After Costa&#x27;s resignation, the party narrowly lost the 2024 election, thus, returning to opposition.

A party of the centre-left, the PS is one of the two major parties in Portuguese politics; its rival is the Social Democratic Party (PSD), a centre-right, conservative party. The current leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, was elected in December 2023.

== History ==
===Portuguese Socialist Action (1964–1973)===
The Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP) was founded in November 1964, in Geneva, Switzerland, by Mário Soares, Manuel Tito de Morais and Francisco Ramos da Costa. The ASP was founded in exile by several Socialist members as political organizations during Salazar&#x27;s Estado Novo regime were forbidden. In 1964, Mário Soares was elected leader of the ASP and the core principles and values of the ASP were approved.

Inspired by May 68 events, the Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of the Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP) on 19 April 1973, in Bad Münstereifel in West Germany:

The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of socialism and political freedom, making an explicit reference to a classless society and with Marxism as a source of principal inspiration. However, seven delegates voted against the idea of creating a party, including Mário Soares&#x27; wife Maria Barroso.

===Socialist Party (1973–present)===

On 25 April 1974, the Carnation Revolution brought down the authoritarian regime of the Estado Novo, established in 1933, and democracy was restored. Mário Soares, the party&#x27;s General-Secretary, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France and became Minister of Foreign Affairs, and António de Almeida Santos was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments. After the revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the PS won the 1975 election for the Constituent Assembly and the 1976 elections for the National Assembly, then losing to the Democratic Alliance (AD) in the 1979 legislative election. In 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance, called the Republican and Socialist Front (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the Left-wing Union for the Socialist Democracy (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.

They won the 1983 general election but without an absolute majority, and the PS formed a grand coalition with the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD), creating a Central Bloc. The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the European Economic Community (EEC). In 1985, the Central Block broke down and the PS, at the time led by António de Almeida Santos, lost the 1985 legislative election. Cavaco Silva&#x27;s PSD won the 1985 elections, and again in 1987 and 1991 with an absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.

In the 1995 legislative election, the PS, then led by the already prominent António Guterres, won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in the 1999 election failed to obtain what would have been a historic absolute majority for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Guterres resigned as prime minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the 2002 general election by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the People&#x27;s Party (CDS–PP). During this time, it has been argued that the Socialist Party moved towards the centre and adopted the Third Way.

In the early 2000s, the party cleaned up its membership database, resulting in a reduction of registered members from 120,000 in 2001 to 77,000 in 2002.

In June 2004, the PS won the 2004 European elections by a landslide, and a few weeks later, Durão Barroso, leader of the PSD and prime minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, Jorge Sampaio, President of the Republic, called fresh elections for February 2005. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. José Sócrates, leader of the PS, became Prime Minister of Portugal.

In 2009, after years in power, the PS lost the 2009 European Parliament elections to the PSD. However, they won the general election held on 27 September 2009 but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the previous general election. The PS later introduced and legislated same-sex marriage. The Eurozone crisis and financial crisis of 2011 hit Portugal very hard, prompting Sócrates&#x27; government to impose harsh austerity measures. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Sócrates resigned as prime minister and a snap election took place on 5 June 2011. In the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1 percent of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS–PP. Sócrates resigned as General-Secretary on election night after the PS&#x27;s worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, António José Seguro was elected as Sócrates&#x27; successor.

Under the leadership of Seguro, the PS won the 2013 local elections making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the European elections in May 2014 but this time only just. They won 31.5 percent of the vote against almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS–PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many PS members and supporters and on 27 May António Costa, the then-mayor of Lisbon announced that he would stand for the leadership of the PS. Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a primary election, to be held on 28 September, to elect the party&#x27;s candidate for prime minister in the 2015 general elections. Costa, being endorsed by the left faction of the party and people like Mário Soares, Ana Catarina Mendes and Pedro Nuno Santos, easily defeated Seguro, who was supported by the more moderate and centrist wing of the party, by a 67% to 31% margin.

In the 2015 legislative elections, the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32 percent of the votes against the 38.6 percent of the PSD/CDS–PP electoral alliance Portugal Ahead. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in the Portuguese parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged a confidence and supply agreement with Left Bloc and Unitary Democratic Coalition to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became prime minister.

In order to avoid bankruptcy due to mounting debt, in 2017, the party, alongside the PSD, the Portuguese Communist Party, BE and the ecologist party PEV, voted in favour of abolishing party fundraising limits, thereby opening all Portuguese parties to private political donorship, that they are not obligated to disclose. The new proposal was reluctantly approved by the Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

Costa led a very successful first term as prime minister with a growing economy, low unemployment, and deficit cuts. Although he led a more left-leaning PS, Costa started to shift the party back to the centre in 2018, something that a younger and more left-wing faction, led by minister Pedro Nuno Santos, contested. In the 2019 European elections, the PS won a significant victory by achieving 33.4 percent, against the 22 percent of the PSD. The PS also won the October 2019 general election with 36 percent of the votes, against the 28 percent of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected. The Second Costa cabinet was sworn in on 26 October 2019.

In October 2020, the PS lost power in the Azores region after the Socialists lost their majority in the region&#x27;s 2020 October elections. The PS only got 39 percent of the votes, a drop of 7 pp, and 25 seats. The right-wing parties PSD, CDS, PPM, CHEGA, and IL won a majority of one seat over the whole left wing, and a few weeks after the election, they forged a deal that led the PSD to government. , the PS is now in opposition in both autonomous regions of the country.

For the 2021 Portuguese presidential election, Costa endorsed the incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, something that made some party members unsatisfied. Former PS MEP Ana Gomes, a critic of Costa and a member of the left faction of the party, ran for the presidency, declaring herself the candidate of democratic socialism and progressivism, stating that she has been disappointed with the leadership of the party for not having an official candidate. With the support of the left faction of the party and some more moderate members worried about corruption, Gomes finished in a disappointing second place behind de Sousa, who had many endorsements of party leaders like Lisbon&#x27;s Mayor Fernando Medina, Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, and Carlos César.

The party suffered a setback in the 2021 local elections by losing several cities to the PSD. However, the main defeat was the loss of Lisbon to the PSD candidate, Carlos Moedas, who defeated Fernando Medina by a narrow 34 to 33 percent margin. After the local elections, tensions between the PS and its left-wing allies, BE and CDU, led to the rejection of the 2022 budget which forced the calling of a snap election for January 2022. Despite polls predicting a close race between the PS and PSD, the Socialists won a surprise absolute majority, only the second in their history, with 41 percent of the votes against the 29 percent of the PSD, and winning 120 (52%) of the 230 seats in the Portuguese parliament.

In November 2023, António Costa resigned as prime minister and party leader following the Operation Influencer investigation, which investigates suspected corruption activities in the awarding of contracts for the lithium and hydrogen businesses. Following Costa&#x27;s decision, an early election was called for 10 March 2024. A leadership election was called for 15 and 16 December 2023, which was won by Pedro Nuno Santos with almost 61 percent of the votes.

On the 10 March 2024 election, the Socialist Party was narrowly defeated by the &quot;Democratic Alliance&quot; (AD), headed by the Social Democratic Party, losing 42 seats and gathering 28 percent of the votes. Three months later, in the 2024 European Parliament elections, the Socialist Party narrowly defeated the AD coalition, by a 32 to 31 percent margin.

== Ideology and factions ==
The PS is a mainstream centre-left social democratic party with many internal factions, ranging from democratic socialism to social liberalism and centrism. It supports Keynesianism, Europeanism, and progressivism. Like many mainstream social democratic parties, it has previously adopted a Third Way outlook. 

Historically, during its first years, the party has also had far-left factions. The most notable figures of this factions include the marxist Manuel Serra, who opposed Mário Soares leadership from the left and won 44% of the votes against him, leaving the party and creating the People&#x27;s Socialist Front afterwards; as well as the MPs Carmelinda Pereira and António Aires Rodrigues, who were the most notable examples of a &quot;trotskyist infiltration on the party&quot;, it is noted that this faction represented 25% of the delegates elected to the socialist national congress of 1976.

<doc id="403242" wikidata="Q735233" url="?curid=403242" title="Constantine II, King of Armenia">
<text>Constantine II (), (also Constantine IV; Western Armenian transliteration: &quot;Gosdantin&quot;; died 17 April 1344), born Guy de Lusignan, was elected the first Latin King of Armenian Cilicia of the Poitiers-Lusignan dynasty, ruling from 1342 until his death in 1344.

==Life==
Guy de Lusignan was the son of Isabella, daughter of Leo II of Armenia, and Amalric, a son of Hugh III of Cyprus, and was governor of Serres from 1328 until 1341. When his cousin Leo IV, the last Hethumid monarch of Cilicia, was murdered by the barons, the crown was offered to his younger brother John, who urged Guy to accept it. Guy was reluctant — his mother and two of his brothers had been murdered by the Armenian regent Oshin of Corycos — but he eventually accepted and took the name Constantine.

Guy was killed in an uprising in Armenia on April 17, 1344 and was succeeded by a distant cousin, Constantine III.

==Marriages and issue==
Guy married twice, firstly to a Kantakouzene (died c. 1330), without issue, and secondly in 1330–1332, Theodora Syrgiannaina (died 1347/1349), with whom he fathered:
* Isabella of Lusignan (c. or after 1333 – in Cyprus, 1382–1387), Lady of Aradippou, married after February 26, 1349 Manuel Kantakouzenos (c. 1326 – April 10, 1380), Despot of Morea.

<doc id="403243" wikidata="Q4791765" url="?curid=403243" title="Arkansas Department of Corrections">
<text>The Arkansas Department of Corrections (DOC), formerly the Arkansas Department of Correction, is the state law enforcement agency that oversees inmates and operates state prisons within the U.S. state of Arkansas. DOC consists of two divisions, the Arkansas Division of Corrections (ADC) and the Arkansas Division of Community Corrections (DCC), as well as the Arkansas Correctional School District. ADC is responsible for housing and rehabilitating people convicted of crimes by the courts of Arkansas. ADC maintains 20 prison facilities for inmates in 12 counties. DCC is responsible for adult parole and probation and offender reentry.

The Department of Corrections was officially organized as a cabinet-level state agency in 2019, but traces history back to the first state penitentiary in 1838. Early efforts focused on convict leasing, though the program largely ended toward the end of the 19th century after abuses were exposed, and prisoners were housed in &quot;The Walls&quot; prison in Little Rock until 1933. Arkansas next transitioned to the prison farm system, establishing the Cummins State Farm and Tucker Farm in South Arkansas. Underfunded and mostly operated by so-called &#x27;trusties&#x27; (inmates); corrupt and dangerous conditions plagued Arkansas prisons for decades, culminating in several reform efforts throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of the first modern incarnation of the ADC in 1967.

As the War on drugs and law and order politics became prominent, the Arkansas inmate population surged, and ADC built new prisons across the state. Prison conditions slowly improved and scandals became more infrequent. In 1993, Arkansas created the Department of Community Punishment (DCP), which would evolve into the DCC. Arkansas briefly contracted with a private prison between 1998 and 2001, but inmate conditions were unsafe and unsanitary and United States Department of Justice ruled Arkansas&#x27; private prison unconstitutional in 2003.

==History==
Arkansas became a state in 1836. The first Governor of Arkansas, James S. Conway, pushed the Arkansas General Assembly to allocate funds for a state penitentiary in their first meeting, but he met strong resistance with many of his proposals, and a penitentiary was not funded. The Second General Assembly in 1838 allocated $20,000 ($ today) to a state penitentiary in Little Rock. The state purchased a tract outside of Little Rock in 1839, and the Third General Assembly allocated another $40,500 ($ today) in 1840 to finish construction of the Arkansas State Penitentiary. It held 300 prisoners. It was destroyed in 1846 in a prisoner revolt.

From 1849 to 1893 the State of Arkansas leased its convicted felons to private individuals. After abuses became publicized, the state assumed direct control of felons. The state continued to have prison labor be hired to contractors, manufacturers, and planters until 1913.

In 1899, the penitentiary site was selected for the new Arkansas State Capitol, which supplanted the Old State House. In the interim, Arkansas leased many convicts to companies, including the Arkansas Brick Manufacturing Company, for as long as ten years in an effort to house them while a new prison was built. Though officials agreed on the need to purchase a prison farm, widespread disagreement about the new prison&#x27;s location stalled progress further. Governor Jeff Davis vetoed a plan to purchase the Sunnyside Plantation in February 1901. Further trying to make his case for more sweeping penal reform, Governor Davis toured the convict-leasing camp in England, Arkansas and revealed shocking allegations of inhumane treatment. The political battle consumed state politics for the next year. The General Assembly decided to purchase the Cummins Farm over the objection of Governor Davis, who preferred a location in Altheimer. However, ending the convict-lease system would remain an issue in state politics for the next 10 years.

A new prison was simultaneously constructed on a new site southwest of Little Rock. Nicknamed &quot;The Walls&quot;, the new prison opened in 1910. In 1913 act 55, signed into law, lead to the establishment of a permanent execution chamber in the state prison system. In 1916 the state purchased the land which became the Tucker Unit. In 1933 Junius Marion Futrell, then the governor, closed the penitentiary in Little Rock and transferred the prisoners to Cummins and Tucker, and the execution chamber was moved to Tucker.

In 1943 the state established the State Penitentiary Board through Act 1. In 1951 the state established the State Reformatory for Women through Act 351. The state moved the functions of the Arkansas State Training School for Girls to the state prison system.

===Legal challenges begin===
By the 1960s, Arkansas was infamous for operating one of the most corrupt and dangerous prison systems in the nation. Both Cummins and Tucker relied on the trusty system, which created a hierarchy of prisoners, with some designated as &#x27;trusties&#x27; who the guards trusted with many of the day-to-day duties. The Tucker Telephone was a torture device designed using parts from an old-fashioned crank telephone used to apply an electric shock to an uncooperative prisoner&#x27;s genitals at Tucker. Atrocious conditions in the prison system had long been known about in Arkansas, but rose in prominence during the 1960s.

In 1965, Federal Judge J. Smith Henley ruled in favor of Cummins inmates in &quot;Talley v. Stephens&quot;, who sued claiming they were unconstitutionally subjected to cruel and unusual punishments and denied access to the courts and medical care. Henley ordered the prison stop forcing prisoners to work beyond their physical ability, cease arbitrary use of corporal punishment by &quot;blows with a leather strap&quot;, and to allow access to medical care and legal resources without fear or reprisals. The case initiated a long legal saga that would eventually lead to major reforms in Arkansas prisons.

Governor Orval Faubus ordered a study of conditions at Tucker, but suppressed the report when it found torture, violence, rape, corruption and graft widespread by both trusties and prison officials. The report also found &quot;To make profits, the prisoners were driven remorselessly from dawn to dusk in the fields, especially at harvest time&quot;. Both farms were operated to generate revenues to the state. A 1968 &quot;Time&quot; article entitled &quot;Hell in Arkansas&quot; found the two farms &quot;averaged&quot; profits of &quot;about $1,400,000 over the years...&quot; ($ million today) using prisoners as forced labor.

===Department founding 1967 and early history===
Winthrop Rockefeller, running on a good government platform, released the previously suppressed report publicly upon election to the Governor&#x27;s office in 1967. Rockefeller succeeded in reorganizing the penitentiary system into the Arkansas Department of Correction through Act 50 in the 66th Arkansas General Assembly. The ADC assumed control over the Tucker State Prison Farm for younger white prisoners, and the 1,300-inmate Cummins Farm for &quot;white and black adult inmates&quot;. Rockefeller hired the first professional penologist, Tom Murton, as prison superintendent in 1967. On January 29, 1968, Murton invited the media to witness the unearthing of three decayed skeletal remains in a remote part of the 16,000-acre grounds of the Cummins prison farm. They believed the skeletons were those of prisoners murdered at Cummins, although this was never proven. Fired after less than a year, Murton&#x27;s aggressive approach to uncovering Arkansas&#x27; prison scandal with its decades-long systemic corruption, embarrassed Rockefeller and &quot;infuriated conservative politicians&quot;. Murton had attracted nationwide media attention and contempt for Arkansas, as news of &quot;Bodiesburg&quot;, as it was called, spread. Murton&#x27;s co-authored 1969 book, &quot;Accomplices to the Crime: The Arkansas Prison Scandal&quot; was the basis for the fictionalized 1980 film &quot;Brubaker&quot; starring Robert Redford.

In &quot;Holt v. Sarver&quot;, Judge Henley ruled several aspects of Arkansas&#x27;s prison system unconstitutional and provided guidelines to get the system into compliance. The following year, Henley found the entire prison system operated by the ADC unconstitutional, as issues restricting inmates&#x27; access to court and cruel and unusual punishment remained in violation of his previous ruling. A 1969 case challenging many aspects of the ADC prison system lasted almost a decade, resulting in the Supreme Court landmark case &quot;Hutto v. Finney&quot; 437 U.S. 678 (). The case also clarified prison system&#x27;s unacceptable punitive measures. T. Don Hutto had been hired by Governor Dale Bumpers in 1971 as the head of the Arkansas Department of Correction, with a mandate of &quot;humanizing&quot; the &quot;convict farms&quot;.

In 1974, Hutto resigned and moved to Virginia to become deputy director of the Virginia Department of Corrections.

===Recent history===
In 2014 the state made a call for cities to submit bids to host a new maximum security prison.

===2019 State government reorganization===

Following state government reorganization in 2019, the State of Arkansas created the cabinet level Department of Corrections (DOC) as the umbrella department for several corrections-related state agencies. DOC oversees administrative functions for these several units, including the Division of Community Corrections (DCC), Arkansas Parole Board (APB), Arkansas Sentencing Commission (ASC), Arkansas Criminal Detention Facility Review Committee, and the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.

The primary duties of the old ADC is now under the auspices of the Division of Corrections, with DCC becoming the Division of Community Corrections, with both reporting to the Secretary of Corrections, a cabinet-level position.

==Division of Correction==
===Headquarters===
The headquarters are in Pine Bluff. The ADC headquarters moved to the Pine Bluff Complex in 1979. Previously they were located in the State Office Building in Little Rock.

===Operations===

For the diagnostic process, male inmates go to the Ouchita River Correctional Unit in Malvern, and women go to the McPherson Unit in Newport. Male death row inmates are housed at the Varner Super Max Unit while women with death sentences are received at McPherson. The death chamber is located at the Cummins Unit. Previously the Diagnostic Unit in Pine Bluff was the intake unit for male prisoners.

After the intake process, most inmates go to a &quot;parent unit&quot; for their initial assignment. The male parent units are Cummins, East Arkansas, Grimes, Tucker, and Varner. The McPherson Unit is the female parent unit. The initial assignments last for at least 60 days. Inmates may be moved to other units based on behavior, institutional needs, job availability, and available space.

The ADC operates the Willis H. Sargent Training Academy in England, Arkansas.

==Boards and Commissions==
In Arkansas&#x27;s shared services model of state government, the cabinet-level agencies assist boards and commissions who have an overlapping scope. DOC supports:

;Boards
*Arkansas Board of Corrections
*Arkansas Parole Board
;Commissions
*Arkansas Sentencing Commission
;Committee
*Criminal Detention Facility Review Committee
;Councils
*Arkansas State Council for the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision

===Death row===
Male death row inmates are located at the Varner Unit&#x27;s Supermax, while the executions are performed at the Cummins Unit, adjacent to Varner. The female death row is located at the McPherson Unit. In 1999 the female death row was newly inaugurated.

In 1974 male death row inmates, previously at the Tucker Unit, were moved to the Cummins Unit. In 1986 male death row inmates were moved to the Maximum Security Unit. On Friday August 22, 2003, all 39 Arkansas death row inmates, all of them male, were moved to the Supermax at the Varner Unit.

===Demographics===
As of June 3, 2015 the ADC has 18,681 prisoners. This is an increase from 1977, when it had 2,519 prisoners. After a parole violator was accused of committing a 2013 murder, the Arkansas Board of Corrections changed the conditions of parole, stating that any parolee accused of committing a felony must have his/her parole revoked, even if he/she has not yet been convicted of that felony. This caused the prison population to increase.

==Operations==
All male prisoners entering the Colorado DOC system first go to the Denver Reception &amp; Diagnostic Center (DRDC) before going to their assigned facilities, while female prisoners are sent to the Denver Women&#x27;s Correctional Facility for processing. Assignments are primarily determined by security level, and each facility can accommodate inmates of different security levels.

In 2012, the state of Colorado had no designated death row. All prisoners with death sentences were given classifications of &quot;Close&quot;, the highest custody designation possible. As of 2017, all prisoners with death sentences are located at the Sterling Correctional Facility. The execution chamber is located at the Colorado State Penitentiary. By state statute, executions took place there. The death penalty was abolished in 2020.

From the 1890s to the 1990s, the Colorado death row was located at the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility. The execution chamber was also located in this prison. In the 1990s, the Colorado State Penitentiary opened. Previously state statute dictated that prisoners with death sentences were to be held at the administrative segregation facility at the Colorado State Penitentiary. In 2011 the State of Colorado moved its death row prisoners in order to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Nathan Dunlap, a death row prisoner. Dunlap had complained about the state&#x27;s lack of outdoor exercise facilities at Colorado State Penitentiary. The Crowley County facility experienced two major riots involving Colorado and Washington state prisoners, the first in 1999 when operated by Correctional Services Corporation and the second on July 20, 2004, when owned and operated by the Corrections Corporation of America, and involving Wyoming inmates as well.

From the end of 2024, the Colorado Department of Corrections will implement policies for transgender inmates - regarding gender-affirming healthcare and other related issues. This was bought about with a court &quot;settlement&quot; from a lawsuit.

==Fallen officers and officials==
Since the establishment of the Colorado Department of Corrections, 17 officers have died while on duty, including Executive Director Tom Clements.

<text>Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (c. 5 January 1928 – 22 October 2011) (, &quot;Sulṭān ibn ʿAbdulʿazīz Āl Suʿūd&quot;), called &quot;The generous Sultan&quot; (, &quot;Sulṭan al Khair&quot;) in Saudi Arabia, was the Saudi defense minister from 1963 to 2011 and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia from 2005 until his death in October 2011.

==Early life and education==
Sultan was born in Riyadh sometime between the mid to late 1920s to early 1930s, with the year being given as 1925, 1928, 1930, and 1931. He was the 15th son of Ibn Saud and his mother was Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. He was the second of the Sudairi Seven, who also included Fahd, Nayef and Salman. Prince Sultan, along with many of his brothers, received his early education in religion, modern culture, and diplomacy at the royal court.

==Early experience==
His career in public service began in 1940 when he was made a deputy to Riyadh governor or emir, Prince Nasser. In 1947, Prince Sultan replaced Prince Nasser as governor of Riyadh. Prince Sultan also assisted King Abdulaziz&#x27;s attempts to establish a national administrative system based on the Islamic Sharia law during this period. In 1947, Prince Sultan oversaw ARAMCO&#x27;s construction of the Kingdom&#x27;s rail link between Dammam and Riyadh. It was upon his advice King Abdulaziz ibn Saud ordered the dismantling of Riyadh&#x27;s city walls in the early 1950s that eventually resulted in the expansion and urbanization of the town into a modern metropolis. He was appointed as the kingdom&#x27;s first minister of agriculture in 1953 and minister of transport in 1955.

Following the assassination of Lebanese prime minister, Riad Al Solh, in 1951 King Abdulaziz sent Prince Sultan to Beirut to offer condolences to late prime minister&#x27;s family.

Although the direct military experience of Prince Sultan was brief, heading the Royal Guard in Riyadh in the early 1950s, he felt a lifelong connection to the military and the cause of Saudi independence from an early age. Major General Carl von Horn, Swedish commander of the UN observer mission during the Yemeni civil war, described the Prince Sultan as &quot;a volatile and emotional young man&quot; in the early days.

==Minister of defense and aviation==
In 1963, Crown Prince Faisal appointed Prince Sultan as minister of defense and aviation. He presided over the development of the Saudi armed forces. During the reign of King Faisal, Prince Sultan was particularly interested in Yemen.

At the beginning of King Faisal&#x27;s reign in 1964 Prince Sultan became a member of the council which had been established by the king to guide the succession issues. In the late 1966 Prince Sultan survived an assassination attempt by the revolutionary Yemenites who were assisted by Egyptian intelligence. His influence declined under the reign of King Khalid due to the fact that in 1977 Prince Sultan unsuccessfully tried to prevent Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz from becoming heir apparent when the king died.

Sultan purchased U.S. tanks, fighter planes, missiles, and AWACS (airborne warning and control systems). However, as a result of problems assimilating technology within its armed forces, a relatively high proportion of the military equipment is stored or under maintenance, despite a large portion of Saudi&#x27;s $34 billion defense budget being spent on maintaining military equipment. Sultan allegedly became extraordinarily wealthy from kickbacks by Western businesses that handled multibillion-dollar defense contracts. He was involved in many scandals, including the Al Yamamah deal. However, his influence remained unhindered until his health began to deteriorate. During his tenure, Saudi Arabia became the largest importer of U.S. arms, and he was a strong proponent of the U.S.-Saudi partnership.

As well, Sultan authorized a deal with the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1965. His program, called Operation Magic Carpet, traded £16 million for six second-hand Lightnings, six Hawker Hunters, and a set of missile launchers going to Royal Saudi Air Force. Geoffrey Edwards served as the official intermediary. British pilots also came over, privately contracted. Prince Sultan was an expert on the Yemen civil war and Soviet involvement in the Horn of Africa in 1985.

In 1996, Prince Sultan opposed Pentagon plans to relocate U.S. troops to safer locations after the Dhahran complex bombings. He visited Iran in May 1999 - his visit was the first official visit of a Saudi minister since 1979.

==Second deputy prime minister==
On 13 June 1982, after the death of King Khalid and Crown Prince Fahd became the King, Prince Sultan was appointed second deputy prime minister. Opposition to his appointment as second deputy prime minister came in particular from his elder half-brothers Musaid and Bandar. The objection of Prince Musaid was easily ignored since his son, Faisal bin Musaid, had assassinated King Faisal. However, the interests of Bandar bin Abdulaziz were much harder to ignore. Thus, he was compensated and the dispute was resolved.

Prince Sultan, in December 1995, attempted to seize power through the support of the Ulema when Crown Prince Abdullah was in Oman for a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council. However, his attempted coup failed.

Prince Sultan was one of the members of the Al Saud Family Council established by Crown Prince Abdullah in June 2000 to discuss private issues such as business activities of princes and marriages of princess to individuals who were not members of the House of Saud.

==Crown prince==

On 1 August 2005, Sultan bin Abdulaziz was designated heir apparent despite having a discord with King Abdullah. During the same period he led the group called Sudairi Seven, being the eldest of the group after King Fahd&#x27;s demise.

==Various positions==
During the 1970s Prince Sultan was one of the members of the inner family council which was led by King Khalid and included Sultan&#x27;s brothers Prince Mohammed, Crown Prince Fahd, Prince Abdullah, and Prince Abdul Muhsin and his uncles Prince Ahmed and Prince Musaid.

Prince Sultan was Saudi Arabia&#x27;s inspector general. He was chairman of the board of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s national airline, Saudi Arabian Airlines. As chairman, he approved a ban on smoking inside all Saudi airports. In 1986, he founded the Saudi National Commission for Wildlife Conservation. He was chairman of the Higher Council for Islamic Affairs, which financially supports Muslim communities around the world.

===Scientific prizes sponsored by Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz===
* Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz prize for water. He was the founder and patron of the Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water, a bi-annual international scientific award for water research created in 2002. 
* Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Chair for environmental engineering, department of civil engineering, King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals. It is the first chair in the university.
* The scientific agreement between Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz and Oxford University for academic and cultural co-operation, which enables Saudi students for bachelor&#x27;s, master and PhD degrees in the field of human sciences.

==Charity works==
Prince Sultan was known as &quot;Sultan the Good&quot; () in Saudi Arabia for his generosity. He played a role in many charitable works, including providing for the poor and people with special needs. He set up and funded the Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation on 21 January 1995, with the aim of providing humanitarian services and medical services to people unable to afford the expenses. With the exception of his private residence and important necessities, he donated his possessions to the foundation.

The foundation includes the following centers in different countries:

*Sultan bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City
**Sultan bin Abdulaziz Science and Technology Center
**Charity housing projects
**Sultan bin Abdulaziz Special Education Program at the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain
**Prince Sultan Center for Speech and Hearing in Bahrain
**King Abdulaziz Center for Islamic Studies at Bologna University
**Sultan bin Abdulaziz Arab and Islamic Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley
*Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Private: Committee for Relief.

This private committee organizes relief and medical convoys and sets up camps to combat diseases like Malaria and blindness. It has carried out several developmental, social and medical projects, like, digging wells, building schools, public libraries, mosques, hospitals, establishing dialysis centers. It also sponsors Muslim preachers in Ethiopia, Chad, Niger, Malawi, Mali, Comoro Islands, Djibouti and Indonesia.

He inaugurated and served as the patron of Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. It was named in his honor by the university&#x27;s parent institution, Al-Riyadh Philanthropic Society, which was founded by the prince&#x27;s brother, Salman of Saudi Arabia, who would later become king. This is the first private/non-profit university established in the kingdom. In 2007, Prince Sultan was awarded the Medal of Human Honor for his charitable works.

In April 2005, Sultan donated £2 million to the Ashmolean Museum. A year after his donations to establish an art museum, Oxford University agreed to &#x27;expedite&#x27; the scholarship application process for Saudi students, and identify colleges for ten Saudi students from Prince Sultan University. When this arrangement became public, it led to criticism due to the donations bypassing Oxford&#x27;s governing council, and breaching the admissions process for prospective students.

A press release issued by Oxford University on 20 April 2005 said that:
 HRH Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has given the Ashmolean Museum a substantial donation to provide a fitting home for the Museum&#x27;s internationally renowned collection of Islamic art. The total value of the gift is £2 million, which will also provide for ten scholarships at the University of Oxford for Saudi Arabian students.

The press release added further that ‘the new gallery, part of the ambitious redevelopment of one of the world’s oldest museums, will be named the “Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al Saud Gallery”’. &quot;Arab News&quot; on 21 April 2005 reported that Sultan’s donation was a ‘move to promote understanding between Islam and the West’, adding that ‘Saudi and British officials’ had said that the new gallery ‘will help to portray Islamic culture and civilization in right perspectives.’

==Controversy==
In 2002, families of the victims of the September 11 attacks in the United States sued Prince Sultan and other senior Saudi officials for their alleged contributions to al-Qaeda linked charities. The lawsuits were thrown out by a US federal judge due to insufficient evidence submitted.

==Personal life==

His son Khalid bin Sultan, after Prince Sultan&#x27;s death, was appointed deputy minister of defense and served in the post until 20 April 2013.

==Characteristics==
Prince Sultan was regarded by the House of Saud as a workaholic. He doled out money at banquets in keeping with tribal customs. A conservative, it was expected that he would have put a brake on King Abdullah&#x27;s timid reforms. Sultan was considered to be pro-American.

==Views==
Sultan took a lifetime anti-communist and anti-Soviet view, based on his dislike of Soviet state atheism as well as Soviet interest in Gulf oil and access to ports that he felt risked Saudi independence. He rebuked U.S. President Jimmy Carter for what he saw as &quot;pusillanimity&quot; in the face of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

In a 23 October 2001 interview in Kuwaiti newspaper &quot;As Seyassa&quot;, concerning 9/11 attacks, Sultan stated “Who stands behind this terrorism and who carried out this complicated and carefully planned terrorist operation? Osama bin Laden and those with him have said what indicates that they stand behind this carefully planned act. We, in turn, ask: Are bin Laden and his supporters the only ones behind what happened or is there another power with advanced technical expertise that acted with them?”.

==Wealth and property==
Prince Sultan&#x27;s wealth in 1990 was reported to be $1.2 billion. In 1993 &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine cited him as the 34th rich person in the world with $4.0 billion wealth. Later, his fortune was estimated at $270 billion, which he distributed between his sons prior to his death in October 2011 in order to support their political position in the competitive princely arena. Prince Sultan owned 2–8a Rutland Gate, the former London residence of the Lebanese politician and businessman Rafic Hariri. Prince Sultan had been given the property after Hariri&#x27;s assassination in 2005.

Documents in the Paradise Papers release show Prince Sultan used the law firm Appleby at the center of the use of offshore businesses and trusts by world leaders.

==Health issues==
Prince Sultan was rumored to have had colon cancer in 2003. A foreign correspondent was forced to leave the country after reporting his health problems.

In 2004, Prince Sultan was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent several corrective surgeries. He underwent an operation to remove an intestinal polyp in Jeddah in 2005. Prince Sultan visited a Swiss clinic in late April 2008. In April 2009, he began to suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

He was reported to be suffering dementia, specifically Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Morocco vacation===
In February 2009, Sultan spent several months in New York City at New York–Presbyterian Hospital and underwent surgery in New York. He then convalesced at Agadir, Morocco. He went back to Saudi Arabia, but soon returned to Morocco in August 2009. During his vacation, the Saudi cabinet increased officer salaries, a traditional domain of Sultan.

In 2009, King Abdullah took charge of all defense purchases and reduced the power of the Defense Ministry. In October 2010, Abdullah personally conducted much of the negotiations for the U.S. arms package worth over $60 billion.

In November 2010, Sultan received in Agadir Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri to discuss the future of Lebanon&#x27;s government. He had been receiving treatment since 2009 for what analysts and diplomats believed to be cancer. At the end of November 2010, he returned to Saudi Arabia because King Abdullah had left for the United States for surgery. His return was seen as a legal formality necessary under Saudi law, which stipulates that only one of the kingdom&#x27;s top two officials can be abroad at a given time.

==Death and funeral==
The Saudi Royal court announced on 22 October 2011 that Prince Sultan died at dawn of an unspecified illness. According to media reports, Prince Sultan had been battling cancer and had been seeking medical treatment in the United States since mid-June 2011. He had a surgical operation in New York in July 2011. Unnamed U.S. officials cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that he died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, New York City.

His body was taken from New York City to Riyadh on 24 October 2011. His funeral was held at the Imam Turki bin Abdullah mosque in Riyadh on 25 October 2011 in the presence of King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz. He was buried in Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh.

Various leaders, including the president of Afghanistan, Farouk Al Sharaa, the vice-president of Syria, the Iranian foreign minister and the head of Egypt&#x27;s ruling military council, participated in the funeral. Additionally, other statesmen went to Riyadh to offer their condolences, such as the US Vice President Joe Biden, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

==Honours==
Among others, Prince Sultan was the recipient of the following honours and medals:
* Order of St Michael and St George (May 1967)
* National Order of Chad, First Class (1972)
* Order of the Lion of Senegal (1972)
* Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, First Class (19 July 1997)
* Order of King Abdulaziz (1973; First Class).
* National Order of Merit (1973; Grand Class)
* Order of the Liberator, First Class (Venezuela, 1975)
* Honorary Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (P.M.N.) (Malaysia; 1982)
* Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (Malaysia; 2000)

He was also posthumously given the King Khalid award in 2011.

<text>Sir William Hamilton, KB, PC, FRS, FRSE (13 December 1730 – 6 April 1803) was a British diplomat, politician, antiquarian and vulcanologist who served as the Envoy Extraordinary to the Kingdom of Naples from 1764 to 1800. After sitting in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1761 to 1764, he began working as a diplomat, succeeding Sir James Gray as the British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples. While in Italy, Hamilton became involved in studying local volcanoes and collecting antiquities, becoming a fellow of the Royal Society and being given the Copley Medal. His second wife was Emma Hamilton, who was famed as the mistress of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson.

==Early life and career==

Hamilton was born on 13 December 1730 (or 12 January 1731) in either London or at Park Place, Berkshire, the fourth son of Lord Archibald Hamilton (1673–1754), Governor of Jamaica, and Lady Jane Hamilton (before 1704–1753), daughter of the 6th Earl of Abercorn (near 1661–1734). His father was the seventh son of William, Duke of Hamilton and 1st Earl of Selkirk (1634–1694), and Anne, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton (1632–1716). His mother was a favourite, and possibly a mistress, of the Prince of Wales and William grew up with his son George III, who would call him his &quot;foster brother&quot;. At age nine, he went to Westminster School, where he made lifelong friends of Frederick, 4th Earl of Bristol, and David, 2nd Earl of Mansfield. Hamilton used to say that he was born with an ancient name and a thousand pounds; as a younger son he would have to make his own way in life. So, six weeks after his sixteenth birthday, he was commissioned into the 3rd Foot Guards as an ensign. He spent some time with the regiment in the Netherlands, and advanced to lieutenant in 1753. In September 1757, he was present as aide-de-camp to General Henry Seymour Conway at the abortive attack on Rochefort. The following year he left the Army, after having married Catherine Barlow, the daughter of Hugh Barlow, Member of Parliament for Pembroke Boroughs. The couple shared a love of music, and the marriage, which lasted until Catherine&#x27;s death on 25 August 1782, was a happy one. There were no children. When Catherine&#x27;s father died in 1763, she inherited his estates in Wales and these provided the Hamiltons with a steady income.

In 1761, Hamilton entered Parliament as Member for Midhurst. When he heard that the ambassador to the court of Naples, Sir James Gray, was likely to be promoted to Madrid, Hamilton expressed an interest in the position, and was duly appointed in 1764.

==Naples==

Hamilton arrived in Naples on 17 November 1764 with the official title of Envoy Extraordinary to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and would remain as ambassador to the court of Ferdinand and Maria Carolina until 1800, although from November 1798 he was based in Palermo, the court having moved there when Naples was threatened by the French Army. As ambassador, Hamilton was expected to send reports back to the Secretary of State every ten days or so, to promote Britain&#x27;s commercial interests in Naples, and to keep open house for English travellers to Naples. These official duties left him plenty of time to pursue his interests in art, antiquities, and music, as well as developing new interests in volcanoes and earthquakes. Catherine, who had never enjoyed good health, began to recover in the mild climate of Naples. Their main residence was the Palazzo Sessa, where they hosted official functions and where Hamilton housed his growing collection of paintings and antiquities; they also had a small villa on the seashore at Posillipo (later it would be called Villa Emma), a house at Portici, Villa Angelica, from where he could study Mount Vesuvius, and a house at Caserta near the Royal Palace.
===Vases===

Hamilton began collecting Greek vases and other antiquities as soon as he arrived in Naples, obtaining them from dealers or other collectors, or even opening tombs himself. In 1766–67 he published a volume of engravings of his collection entitled &quot;Collection of Etruscan, Greek, and Roman antiquities from the cabinet of the Honble. Wm. Hamilton, His Britannick Maiesty&#x27;s envoy extraordinary at the Court of Naples&quot;. The text was written by d&#x27;Hancarville with contributions by Johann Winckelmann. A further three volumes were produced in 1769–76. During his first leave in 1771 Hamilton arranged the sale of his collection to the British Museum for £8,410. Josiah Wedgwood the potter drew inspiration from the reproductions in Hamilton&#x27;s volumes. During this first leave, in January 1772, Hamilton became a Knight of the Order of the Bath and the following month was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1777, during his second leave to England, he became a member of the Society of Dilettanti.

When Hamilton returned to England for a third period of leave, in 1783–84, he brought with him a Roman glass vase, which had once belonged to the Barberini family and which later became known as the Portland Vase. Hamilton had bought it from a dealer and sold it to the Duchess of Portland with the help of his niece Mary Hamilton, who was the duchess&#x27;s literary friend. The cameo work on the vase again served as inspiration to Josiah Wedgwood, this time for his jasperware. The vase was eventually bought by the British Museum. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1792.

In 1798, as Hamilton was about to leave Naples, he packed up his art collection and a second vase collection and sent them back to England. A small part of the second vase collection went down with off the Scilly Isles. The surviving part of the second collection was catalogued for sale at auction at Christie&#x27;s when at the eleventh hour Thomas Hope stepped in and purchased the collection of mostly South Italian vases.

===Volcanoes===

Soon after Hamilton arrived in Naples, Mount Vesuvius began to show signs of activity and in the summer of 1766 he sent an account of an eruption, together with drawings and samples of salts and sulphurs, to the Royal Society in London. On the strength of this paper he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the autumn of 1767 there was an even greater eruption and again Hamilton sent a report to the Royal Society. The two papers were published as an article in the Society&#x27;s journal &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;.

The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1770 for his paper, &quot;An Account of a Journey to Mount Etna&quot;. In 1772 he published his writings on both volcanoes in a volume called &quot;Observations on Mount Vesuvius, Mount Etna, and other volcanos&quot;. This was followed in 1776 by a collection of his letters on volcanoes, entitled &quot;Campi Phlegraei&quot; (Flaming fields, the name given by the Ancients to the area around Naples). The volume was illustrated by Pietro Fabris. Hamilton subsequently hired a priest, Padre Antonio Piaggio, who lived near the western slopes of Vesuvius to keep a regular diary of notes and sketches of the volcano. Piaggio&#x27;s diaries span the period 1779-1795. Hamilton was also interested in earthquakes. He visited Calabria and Messina after the earthquake of 1783 and wrote a paper for the Royal Society.

===Music===

The Hamiltons gave musical entertainments in which they played (William the violin, and Catherine the harpsichord or pianoforte) with some of their servants or professional musicians. During their tour of Italy in 1770, the young Mozart and his father were introduced to the Hamiltons. Catherine played the harpsichord for Mozart, and he said he found her performance &quot;uncommonly moving&quot;. Another musical visitor was the music historian Charles Burney, who stayed at Villa Angelica at Portici and was helped by Hamilton with his research. Burney thought that Catherine Hamilton was the best harpsichord player in Naples. When the young Irish singer Michael Kelly arrived in Naples, he was introduced to the Court by Hamilton. The young Irish composer Thomas Carter also stayed with him around 1788.

Catherine Hamilton died in August 1782; her body was returned to Britain for burial in the Barlow vault at the old Slebech parish church. Hamilton wrote to his niece Mary: &quot;I must for ever feel the loss of the most amiable the most gentle and virtuous companion that ever man was blessed with&quot;.

===Pagan Fertility Studies===
Hamilton discovered evidence of a fertility cult involving phallus worship in the province of Abruzzi. He reported his findings to the Society of Dilettanti, of which he was a member. In 1783 he published some of those findings in a slim volume, &quot;The Worship of Priapus: An account of the fete of St. Cosmo and Damiano celebrated at Isernia in 1780...&quot; These writings were condemned for their mixture of sexual and religious ideas. 

===Second marriage===
A year after his wife&#x27;s death Hamilton had a third period of leave in Britain. This time he visited his estates in Wales and went on a trip to Scotland with his nephew Charles Greville, who was a younger son of the Earl of Warwick and Hamilton&#x27;s sister Elizabeth. When Hamilton made a will during that visit to Britain he made Greville his heir. In London, Hamilton met Emma Hart who at that time was Greville&#x27;s mistress.

On his return to Naples, Hamilton was lonely. &quot;After having lived 22 years en famille it is most terrible to live chiefly alone&quot;, he wrote to his niece. Meanwhile, Greville, who wanted to search for a wealthy wife, was hatching a plan to persuade his uncle to take Emma off his hands. Somewhat reluctantly Hamilton agreed to the plan and Emma arrived in Naples on her 21st birthday, 26 April 1786. With her was her mother, who went by the name of Mrs Cadogan, and who would live with Emma and Hamilton until she died in 1810. The women were installed in an apartment in the Palazzo Sessa, and provided with a carriage and wardrobes. Tutors were hired to give Emma lessons in Italian and singing. It was some months though before Emma accepted the fact that Greville was not going to join her in Naples or send for her to go back to England. At that point she decided to become Hamilton&#x27;s mistress.

Hamilton and Emma married five years later, when Hamilton obtained leave of three months in Britain. As he held a public position he had to ask the King&#x27;s permission. The ceremony was a quiet one in St Marylebone Parish Church, taking place on 6 September 1791, two days before the couple&#x27;s return to Naples. Emma signed the register as Amy Lyons; the witnesses were Hamilton&#x27;s cousin the Marquess of Abercorn and Louis Dutens, who had been chaplain at Turin. The following day Hamilton was sworn of the Privy Council in 1791.

For most of Hamilton&#x27;s time as ambassador, Naples had been a political backwater. But when France declared war on Britain in 1793 events in Naples became more turbulent, and Hamilton&#x27;s role became more important, just as his health was declining. Nelson&#x27;s fleet arrived in the Bay of Naples after defeating the French Fleet at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 and Nelson was a guest of the Hamiltons. At the end of the year the King and Queen abandoned Naples as the French Army advanced and fled to Palermo in Sicily. The Hamiltons went with them.

==Later life==

In the summer of 1799 Naples was recaptured from the French and savage reprisals were enacted against those who had supported the Parthenopean Republic. Hamilton, together with the king and queen, and Nelson, remained in Palermo, except for a visit to the Bay of Naples in when he briefly went ashore. Hamilton was anxious to return to Britain. At the beginning of 1800 Sir Arthur Paget was sent out to replace him and the Hamiltons and Nelson returned overland to England. By this time Emma and Nelson were lovers. They landed at Great Yarmouth on 31 October 1800. The relationship between Hamilton, Emma and Nelson was already causing a scandal and Hamilton was caricatured in cartoons by James Gillray.

Hamilton would live in retirement for another two and a half years, at Merton with Emma, Nelson, and Mrs Cadogan, and in a house he leased in Piccadilly. He spent his time fishing on the River Thames, visiting his estates in Wales, selling paintings and vases, trying to get money owed to him by the government for his expenses in Naples, and attending his clubs, especially the Royal Society and the Dilettanti. He died on 6 April 1803 at his house in Piccadilly. He left Emma £800 a year, which included £100 a year for her mother, and small annuities for four servants in Naples. His estates in Wales, which were heavily mortgaged, were left to Greville. Nelson was left an enamel copy of a portrait of Emma by Élisabeth Vigée le Brun.

Hamilton was buried beside his first wife at Slebech.

==Homage==

Hamilton&#x27;s life was fictionalised by Susan Sontag in her novel &quot;The Volcano Lover: A Romance&quot;.

In the 1941 movie &quot;That Hamilton Woman&quot;, the role of Sir William Hamilton was portrayed by Alan Mowbray.

In the Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm in Germany there is an island in a lake atop which is a model of Mount Vesuvius. Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau would stage fireworks that seemed to issue from an erupting volcano to entertain his guests. At the foot of the mountain on the island is a building intended to suggest Hamilton&#x27;s villa at Posillipo.

Walton Ford&#x27;s watercolour &quot;Jack on his Deathbed&quot; portrays the death of Hamilton&#x27;s pet monkey in 1780.

<text>Northern Praying Mantis () is a style of Chinese martial arts, sometimes called Shandong Praying Mantis after its province of origin. It is one of the best known styles of &quot;Northern&quot; kung fu and it encompasses of many styles, with the three main ones being the &quot;six-harmony style&quot;, &quot;eight-steps style&quot; and &quot;seven-star style&quot;.

According to common folk stories, it was created by Wang Lang (王朗) and was named after the praying mantis, an insect, the aggressiveness of which inspired the style. One version of the myth places the creation of the style during the Song dynasty when Wang Lang was supposedly one of 18 masters gathered by the Abbot Fu Ju (福居), a legendary persona of the historical Abbot Fu Yu (福裕; 1203–1275), to improve Shaolin martial arts. However, most legends place Wang Lang in the late Ming dynasty, or early Qing dynasty circa 1650.

== Features ==
The mantis is a long and narrow predatory insect. While heavily armoured, it is not built to withstand forces from perpendicular directions. Consequently, its fighting style involves the use of whip-like/circular motions to deflect direct attacks, which it follows up with precise attacks to the opponent&#x27;s vital spots. These traits have been subsumed into the Northern Praying Mantis style, under the rubric of &quot;removing something&quot; (blocking to create a gap) and &quot;adding something&quot; (rapid attack).

One of the most distinctive features of Northern Praying Mantis is the &quot;praying mantis hook&quot; (): a hook made of one to three fingers directing force in a whip-like manner. The hook may be used to divert force (blocking), hook onto and adhere to an opponent&#x27;s limb, such as in clinching, or to strike with the back of the wrist.

Northern Praying Mantis is especially known for its speed and continuous attacks. Wrist/arm techniques in particular are emphasized, as well as knee and elbow strikes. Another prominent feature of the style is its complex footwork, borrowed from Monkey Kung Fu.

The core of the Mantis system is made up of the following forms: &quot;Beng Bu&quot;, &quot;Luan Jie&quot;, &quot;Fen Shen Ba Zhou&quot;, Quan Zhong &quot;Zhai Yao&quot; and &quot;Fan Che&quot;.

According to the writings of Liang Xuexiang, the original forms of the system, as passed down by Wang Lang, were Luan Jie, Fen Shen Ba Zhou, and the Mi Shou (secret hands, not a form but solo movements). Others have stated that Beng Bu, Luan Jie and Fen Shou Ba Zhou are the original. 

Quan Zhong Zhai Yao was created later, and is a compilation of the most important techniques and combinations of the system. A set of seven forms, Zhai Yao is typically regarded as being the result of exchanges between Jiang Hua Long, Li Dan Bai and Song Zi De. Some sources say that Seven Star Mantis founder, Wang Yun Sheng, was also involved in the creation.

== Origins ==
There are many legends surrounding the creation of Northern Praying Mantis boxing. One legend attributes the creation of Mantis fist to the Song dynasty when Abbot Fu Ju (福居), a legendary persona of the historical Abbot Fu Yu (福裕) (1203–1275), supposedly invited Wang Lang (王朗) and seventeen other masters to come and improve the martial arts of Shaolin. The Abbot recorded all of the techniques in a manual called the &quot;Mishou&quot; (祕手 – &quot;Secret Hands&quot;) and later passed it onto the Taoist priest Shen Xiao. This manual supposedly disappeared until the Qianlong reign era when it was published under the name &quot;Arhat exercising merit short strike illustrated manuscript&quot; (). Some sources place the folk manuscript&#x27;s publication on the &quot;sixteenth day of the third month of the spring of 1794&quot;. The manual records Wang Lang &quot;absorbed and equalized all previous techniques&quot; learned from the 17 other masters.

A third of the masters listed all come from fictional novels. Yan Qing (#7) and Lin Chong (#13) come from the &quot;Water Margin&quot; and Emperor Taizu of Song (#1), Han Tong (#2), Zheng En (#3) and Gao Huaide (#11) come from the &quot;Fei Long Quan Zhuan&quot; (飞龙全传 – &quot;The Complete Flying Dragon Biography&quot;), which was published prior to the aforementioned manual.

Another legend connected to the Song Dynasty states Wang Lang participated in a Lei tai contest in the capital city of Kaifeng and was defeated by General Han Tong (韩通), the founder of Tongbeiquan. After leaving the fighting arena, he saw a brave praying mantis attacking the wheels of oncoming carts with its &quot;broadsword-like&quot; arms, Mantis fist was born shortly thereafter. 

Many martial scholars doubt the existence of Wang Lang, and believe that Mantis was an amalgamation of local Shandong styles, such as Long Fist, Groundboxing, Luohan Quan and Shui Kou Men.

=== Connection with General Yue Fei ===
As previously stated, the Water Margin bandits Lin Chong and Yan Qing, the adopted of Lu Junyi, are said to be part of the 18 masters supposedly invited to Shaolin by the legendary Abbot Fuju. According to the folklore biography of Song dynasty General Yue Fei, Lin and Lu were former students of Zhou Tong, the general&#x27;s military arts teacher. One martial legend states Zhou learned Chuojiao boxing from its originator Deng Liang (邓良) and then passed it onto Yue Fei. Chuojiao is also known as the &quot;Water Margin Outlaw style&quot; and &quot;Mandarin Duck Leg&quot; (). In the Water Margin&#x27;s twenty-ninth chapter, entitled &quot;Wu Song, Drunk, Beats Jiang the Gate Guard Giant&quot;, it mentions Wu Song, another of Zhou&#x27;s fictional students, using the &quot;Jade Circle-Steps with Duck and Drake feet&quot;. Lin Chong is listed above as being a master of &quot;Mandarin ducks kicking technique&quot;.

Northern Mantis Lineage Master Yuen Man Kai openly claims Zhou taught Lin and Lu the &quot;same school&quot; of martial arts that was later combined with the seventeen other schools to create the Mantis style. However, he believes Mantis style was created during the Ming dynasty, and was therefore influenced by these eighteen schools from the Song. He also says Lu Junyi taught Yan Qing the same martial arts as he learned from Zhou. Master Yuen further comments Zhou later taught Yue the same school and that Yue was the originator of the mantis move &quot;Black Tiger Steeling Heart&quot;. Note that the various branches of Yue Jia Quan (Yue Family Boxing) do indeed have an analogous postural movement named &quot;Black Tiger Steals the Heart&quot;. Also various Yue Jia Quan sets feature a &quot;Preying Mantis Pounces on Prey&quot; claw hand posture as well.

== Styles ==
=== Widespread styles ===
There are several styles of Northern Praying Mantis, the best known of which are:

* Seven Star Praying Mantis Boxing () is arguably the most well known and practiced branch of Northern Praying Mantis. In China, it is widely practiced in Liaoning and Shandong Provinces. Today this system is represented by the lineages of Wang Rongsheng (王榮生) and Wang Yunpeng, based on the teachings of Li Sanjian (李三箭). Fan Xudong (范旭東) teaches In the modern era, Luo Guangyu (羅光玉) is known for having passed down this style to Hong Kong, Shanghai and other parts of Southern China via the Jingwu Athletic Association, and by his disciples Chiu Chi Man (趙志民) and Wong Hon Fun (黃漢勛1) the martial tradition has been disseminated internationally through the Chinese Diaspora. Seven Star Mantis combines elements of Hard and Soft methods, Long and Short attacks, internal and external principles. It is considered by many as the &#x27;hardest&#x27; of the Praying Mantis styles, but this association is misleading. A common saying, &quot;Hide the hard in the soft,&quot; means both Hard and Soft are interwoven together.
* Plum Blossom Praying Mantis Boxing (). it is widespread in Shandong Province, Jilin, Liaoning and South Korea. Though heavily influenced by the development of Taiji Mantis of Cui Shoushan and Wang Yushan, Taiji Plum Blossom of Hao Family, Taiji Mantis of Zhao Zhuxi and Babu Mantis of Wei Xiaotang in the early 1900s, the art traces its lineage directly from Li Bingxiao (b.1700s) to Zhao Zhu to Liang Xuexiang (1810–1895). Liang Xuexiang (alternately listed as living from 1790-1860) was mentioned prominently by the Korean Branch of the Mei Hua Tang Lang as the &quot;creator of the Plum Flower Branch of Praying Mantis Boxing and was the first master to use the name &quot;Plum Blossom&quot;. Liang Xuexiang&#x27;s disciples, mainly Jiang Hualong, Liang Jingchuan, Sun Yuanchang, Hao Hong and Xiu Kunshan are responsible for popularization of this style in the 20th century while Lin Ping Jiang, an emigre of the 1940s is known to have come from Shantong province to teach Praying Mantis in the area of Seoul, Korea.
* Taiji Praying Mantis Boxing (). Today this style is represented by two distinct lineages. The first one is that of Cui Shoushan and Wang Yushan and is based on Song Zide and Jiang Hualong&#x27;s Plum Blossom teachings in Laiyang, Shandong Province. It is popular in Laiyang, Yantai, Qingdao, Dalian, North America, Russia, France and Spain. The second lineage can be traced to Sun Yuanchang&#x27;s Plum Blossom, who was yet another disciple of Liang Xuexiang. Its best known progenitor is Zhao Zhuxi, who is said to have taught (both directly and indirectly) thousands of students during his lifetime in Vietnam and Hong Kong, who have since spread to all corners of the globe. He was given the Cantonese nickname &quot;Chuk Kai&quot;, meaning &quot;Bamboo Creek&quot;, for a famous battle he fought with bandits at that location. This style has since become prevalent in places such as Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and North America.
* Taiji Plum Blossom Praying Mantis Boxing (). This style is, historically, a combination of two different lineages of Mantis: Taiji Mantis and Plum Blossom Mantis. This style is widespread in Yantai, Qingdao, Beijing, Dalian, Harbin, etc. What is now called Taiji Plum Blossom traces its lineage to Hao Lianru (郝蓮茹)—a disciple of Liang Xuexiang, his sons Hao Henglu, Hao Hengxin and his grandson Hao Bin. The later three combined both Taiji Mantis and Plum Blossom in the early 20th century, creating the current style. Hao Lianru&#x27;s five sons have since spread the style elsewhere. This style is well known for its large, two-handed sword, and for being somewhat &#x27;softer&#x27; than Seven Star Praying Mantis.
* Six Harmony Praying Mantis Boxing (). Known as the &#x27;softest&#x27; or most &#x27;internal&#x27; of the Praying Mantis styles, Six Harmony was passed down by Ding Zicheng (丁子成), whose students taught in Shandong Province as well as Taiwan. Six Harmony Praying Mantis has a very different curriculum, with unique routines not found in other Praying Mantis styles.
* Eight Step Praying Mantis Boxing (). This style claims to have been originally conceived by Jiang Hualong (姜化龍), and was further refined by his principle disciple of the style, Feng Huanyi (馮環義), which was passed down by his disciple Wei Xiaotang (衛笑堂) in Taiwan. However, Wei Xiaotang is the first verifiable teacher of the style, and it seems most likely that he developed the style himself, either while still in China, or later after he relocated to Taiwan. It is claimed that the style was passed down to his disciple Shyun Guang Long (荀廣龍) (James Shyun), although this claim has been contested. The style is taught in Taiwan by Master Tso Hsien Fu, and was taught abroad by Su Yuchang, both disciples of Wei Xiaotang, amongst others.

== Media ==
Mantis fist is usually the main antagonist&#x27;s style of choice in various forms of media.

=== Film ===
Northern Praying Mantis is one of the most common martial arts appearing in the movies.

David Chiang learns this style from the Mantis in The Deadly Mantis (1978 film) a.k.a. Shaolin mantis (1978)

The Style is performed in Yuen Siu-tien&#x27;s starring Dance of the Drunk Mantis (1979)

In &quot;The Tricky Master&quot; (1999), Stephen Chow&#x27;s apprentice beats an overweight card sharp in a &quot;fixed&quot; high-stakes poker game. When taunted, the card sharp jumps onto the playing table and defeats Chow&#x27;s deaf, cross-dressing bodyguard with a &quot;long lost kung fu&quot; called &quot;Fat Mantis&quot;, which is the &quot;most powerful...and kills without blood.&quot; In the end, Stephen Chow sprays the card sharp with a can of insecticide. He falls to the ground dead with his hands and legs held into the air like a bug.

In &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot; (2008), the &quot;Silent Monk&quot; (Jet Li) employs mantis fist in his battle over the Monkey King&#x27;s magical staff with Lu Yan, the &quot;Drunken Immortal&quot; (Jackie Chan). But his Mantis boxing is shortly thereafter overpowered by Lu&#x27;s Tiger boxing. The movie&#x27;s screenwriter, John Fusco, is a long-time student of Northern Praying Mantis and worked closely with Jet Li during production.

In the animated movie &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, one of the six kung fu students is an actual praying mantis who uses Northern Praying Mantis kung fu.

=== Television ===
In &quot;Hung Hei-Gun: Decisive Battle With Praying Mantis Fists&quot; (洪熙官: 决战螳螂拳) (a.k.a. The Kung Fu Master, 1994), Donnie Yen plays the titular role of legendary martial arts hero Hung Hei-Gun. After being beaten up as a Child, Hung&#x27;s parents send him away to study Kung Fu. He returns eight years later to find his father (who is secretly an anti-Manchu rebel leader) working as the military arms instructor for the Qing government, much to the chagrin of the local villagers. Despite his years of training, a rakish manchu Prince easily overpowers Hung with the mantis style. After the supposed death of his father, Hung faces the prince once more. When the prince shoots poisonous arrows from his sleeves, Hung twirls his staff to collect the projectiles and then flings them back. The Prince dies from his own poison arrows.

In the 2014 Netflix TV series &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, Jia Sidao, the main antagonist, portrayed by Chin Han, uses praying mantis kung fu.

=== Books ===
&quot;Mantis&quot; is about a half-Vietnamese serial killer who murders erotic dancers because he believes his pet praying mantis tells him to do so (which is quite similar the real life case involving the &quot;Son of Sam&quot;). He uses this style of fighting utilizing his fingers to attack the neck veins and the eyes.

=== Video games ===
Lion Rafale, a character from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series, uses Praying Mantis style. He was introduced in &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. It is also used by Kung Lao and Shujinko in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. Wulong Goth, the leader of the evil &quot;Black Mantis&quot; sect, employs Praying Mantis in the game &quot;Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus&quot;. Gen, from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series of video games, uses this technique, which he can change at will with the Crane style. In the Eternal Champions series, Praying Mantis is used by Larcen Tyler.

<text>Joanna Pacuła (; born 30 December 1957) is a Polish actress and model. Born in Tomaszów Lubelski and immigrating to the United States in the early 1980s, she first gained prominence through her modeling work for &quot;Vogue&quot;. Her breakthrough performance in the 1983 film &quot;Gorky Park&quot; earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture. In the years since, she established herself as a character actress, appearing in numerous high-profile films and television series.

== Life and career ==
Pacuła was born in Tomaszów Lubelski, Poland, to a pharmacist mother and an engineer father. She has a sister, Ewa Pacuła, a model and TV personality who has also worked in the United States.

In 1979, Pacuła graduated from the Aleksander Zelwerowicz State Theatre Academy. After graduation, she joined the Warsaw Dramatic Theatre, where she acted until 1981. She began her career playing in productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

In 1981, Pacuła was in Paris when the communist authorities in Poland declared martial law. She did not return to her homeland, and in 1982 emigrated to the United States, where she specialized in playing European temptresses. Her feature debut came in appearing opposite William Hurt in &quot;Gorky Park&quot; (1983). She was praised by Roman Polanski for that role. She played in numerous American TV series and movies, including the Holocaust drama &quot;Escape From Sobibor&quot; (CBS, 1987), &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1988), &quot;E.A.R.T.H. Force&quot; (CBS, 1990), and the TV series, &quot;The Colony&quot; (ABC, 1996). She also starred in Lewis Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Not Quite Paradise&quot; released in 1985.

She was featured in &quot;Marked for Death&quot; (1990) as an expert on Jamaican voodoo and gangs; in the Italian erotic thriller &quot;Husband and Lovers&quot; (1992) as a free-spirited adultress; &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993) as Doc Holliday&#x27;s lover, Kate; in &quot;The Haunted Sea&quot; (1997); and in the film &quot;Virus&quot; (1999), playing a Russian scientist.

<text>The Englischer Garten (, &quot;English Garden&quot;) is a large public park in the centre of Munich, Bavaria, stretching from the city centre to the northeastern city limits. It was created in 1789 by Sir Benjamin Thompson (1753–1814), later Count Rumford (&quot;Reichsgraf von Rumford&quot;), for Prince Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. Thompson&#x27;s successors, Reinhard von Werneck (1757–1842) and Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell (1750–1823), advisers on the project from its beginning, both extended and improved the park.

With an area of (370 ha or 910 acres), the &quot;Englischer Garten&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s largest urban public parks. The name refers to its English garden form of informal landscape, a style popular in England from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century and particularly associated with Capability Brown.

==History==

===Creation===

When the Elector of Bavaria Maximilian III Joseph, the last ruler from the Bavarian branch of the Wittelsbach dynasty, died childless in 1777, his throne passed to Charles Theodore, count and elector of the Palatinate. The new ruler preferred his existing home in Mannheim on the Rhine to living in Bavaria and tried unsuccessfully to trade his unloved inheritance for the Austrian Netherlands. Understandably, the people of Munich returned his disdain. To offset this unhappy atmosphere, Charles Theodore devoted much attention to improvements in the city. Among others, he created an art gallery in the northern arcades of the Residence&#x27;s &quot;Hofgarten&quot; (&quot;Court Garden&quot;) and made both the garden and the new gallery open to the public (the former in 1780, the latter in 1781).
While the &quot;Hofgarten&quot; was then the only public park in Munich, that was not the primary motivation for the creation of the English Garden. Rather, it was part of a series of military reforms being pursued under the guidance of Sir Benjamin Thompson, the new Elector&#x27;s chief military aide, later created Count Rumford and appointed as Bavarian war minister. Born in Massachusetts, Thompson had served on the Loyalist side in the American Revolutionary War, and after the British defeat had returned to England before moving to continental Europe and entering Charles Theodore&#x27;s service in 1784. In 1788 Thompson proposed that in peacetime the majority of the soldiers of the Elector&#x27;s army should be given leave to do civilian work, such as farming and gardening. In February 1789, Charles Theodore decreed that military gardens should be laid out in each garrison city, to provide soldiers with good agricultural knowledge and also to serve as recreation areas, accessible also to the public.

The planned location of the Munich gardens was the area north of the Schwabinger city gate, a hunting ground of the Wittelsbach rulers since the Middle Ages. Known as the &quot;Hirschanger&quot; (or &quot;deer park&quot;), the higher part of the hunting ground closer to the city was included in the scheme, while the &quot;Hirschau&quot; (also meaning &quot;deer park&quot;), lower and further north, and a more densely wooded part to the south known as the &quot;Hirschangerwald&quot; (&quot;Deer Park Wood&quot;) were originally not included. The whole area had been subject to flooding from the Isar, the river on which Munich stands, a little to the east. This problem was soon removed by the construction of a river wall in 1790, which became known as the &quot;Riedl-Damm&quot; after the engineer Anton von Riedl, who had supervised its construction.

The laying out of the military garden was begun in July 1789, and an area of 800 by slightly less than 200 metres was quickly made ready for cultivation, but soon the idea was extended to the creation of a public park, of which the military garden should be only a small part. On August 13, 1789, Charles Theodore published a decree, devoting the &quot;Hirschanger&quot; to the amusement of the people of Munich. To advise on the project, the Royal Gardener Friedrich Ludwig Sckell (ennobled in 1808) who had studied landscape gardening in England and had previously worked for Charles Theodore at Schwetzingen, had been summoned to Munich earlier in August. Various associated projects were made part of the park development, among them the &quot;Elevengarten&quot; (&quot;Pupils&#x27; Garden&quot;, a garden for the students at the recently formed military academy), a &quot;Schweizerey&quot; (cattle farm), &quot;Schäfery&quot; (sheep farm) and &quot;Ackerbauschule&quot; (arable farming school) to improve farming techniques, and a &quot;Vihearzneyschule&quot; (veterinary school) for the treatment of cattle diseases. Most of these projects did not long survive the creation of the park, but the veterinary school went on to become what is now the &quot;Tierärztliche Fakultät&quot; (Veterinary Faculty) of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The gateway from 1790 can be seen at the &quot;Veterinärstraße&quot; entrance to the garden. The park was initially named &quot;Theodors Park&quot;, but it very quickly became known by the descriptive name of &quot;the English Garden&quot;. By May 1790 sufficient progress had been made to allow Charles Theodore to make an inspection tour; but it was first in the spring of 1792 that the park was officially opened to the approximately 40,000 citizens of Munich.

===Further development===

Thompson left Munich in 1798. His successor, Baron von Werneck, attempted to make the garden itself through its agricultural use. To that end he expanded the park in December 1799 to encompass the Hirschau, which was improved to provide pasture. The fields of the military gardens were added to the &quot;Englischer Garten&quot; in January 1800. Werneck&#x27;s improvements had been costly, and in 1804 he was replaced by Sckell, who was given the post of &quot;Bayerischer Hofgärtenintendant&quot; (&quot;Bavarian Court Garden Supervisor&quot;). Although Sckell had had a guiding role from the beginning, many aspects of the execution differed from his ideas, which he set out in a memorandum of 1807. His long supervision of the garden (1804–1823) was marked by a movement away from agricultural uses and by concentration on the landscape garden. For instance, two mills at the point where the &quot;Schwabingerbach&quot; (Schwabing stream) leaves the &quot;Eisbach&quot; (Ice stream) were removed and an artificial waterfall was created in 1814–1815.

Under Sckell, the park took on its present form. The only significant addition since his time is the creation of the hill for the Monopteros by his nephew Carl August Sckell, who succeeded him as director of the park. In the 20th century, there were some minor additions to the park, most notably the addition in 1952 of some thirty hectares of land where the locomotive factory of Joseph Anton von Maffei had stood, and in 1958–1962 of a further 67 hectares from the &quot;Hirschauer Forst&quot; (Hirschau Wood). The century almost brought less welcome changes to the park. In the Second World War, Allied bombing damaged the Monopteros and destroyed the Chinese Tower, and 93,000 cubic metres of rubble were dumped in the &quot;Hirschanger&quot;. The area was only cleared in 1953, when a sports ground for schools was created there. (The park briefly had another sports ground, with the archery range that hosted the archery competitions for the 1972 Summer Olympics on the Werneckwiese by the Kleinhesseloher See.) Transport too has harmed the character of the garden, most notably with the construction in 1963 of the &quot;Isarring&quot;, part of Munich&#x27;s central ring road, which divides the park just north of the Kleinhesseloher See. Towards the end of the 20th century the city of Munich wished to construct a tram route through the garden north of the Chinese Tower, currently a road used only by buses; but it was opposed by the Bavarian government, which owns the land, and the &quot;Bayerische Verwaltungsgerichtshof&quot; rejected the plan. There were also natural disasters: many trees were destroyed by severe storms in 1964, 1988, and 1990 (the &quot;Wiebke&quot; storm); and Dutch elm disease has almost destroyed the elm trees of the park. Both kinds of loss were compensated by a &quot;tree donation&quot; campaign organised by Munich&#x27;s &quot;Abendzeitung&quot; (&quot;Evening Paper&quot;) in 1989 to 1990 on the occasion of the park&#x27;s 200th anniversary; among the 1500 new trees that were planted were a thousand elms, using only varieties resistant to Dutch elm disease.

In April 1972, to celebrate the Summer Olympics of that year, held in Munich, a Japanese teahouse and a Japanese garden were created on a small island at the south end of the &quot;Englischer Garten&quot;, behind the Haus der Kunst. The island lies in a lake which had been created only a few years earlier, in 1969. The teahouse was a gift to Bavaria from Soshitsu Sen, head of the Urasenke tea school in Kyoto, and it was designed by Soshitsu Sen and Mitsuo Nomura. A traditional Japanese tea ceremony takes place here regularly.

===Schönfeldwiese and surroundings===

Between the Monopteros and the &quot;Japanisches Teehaus&quot; lies the &quot;Schönfeldwiese&quot; (&quot;Beautiful field meadow&quot;). In this part of the Gardens nude sunbathing has been permitted since the 1960s, something which many Germans practise. It caused quite a sensation at the time and also made the English Gardens well-known, even outside Munich. The &quot;Schönfeldwiese&quot; proper lies to the south of the &quot;Schwabingerbach&quot;, which crosses the English Garden at this point before flowing northwards along its west side; but the name is sometimes used of the whole larger open space. The expanse to the north of the &quot;Schwabingerbach&quot;, the &quot;Carl Theodorswiese&quot; (&quot;Carl Theodors meadow&quot;) has the oldest construction in the park: the &quot;Burgfriedsäule&quot;, a boundary marker from 1724, topped with the Münchner Kindl stands in a grove of trees below the Monopteros.

===Surfing===
In one of the artificial streams flowing through the Englischer Garten, there is a standing wave (a stationary hydraulic jump) in which there is a transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Surfers line up along the bank taking turns entering the water with their boards. After a minute or so, successful surfers will voluntarily drop out returning to the end of the line allowing the next person in line an opportunity. The signage states that surfing should only be done by expert or skilled surfers.

===Monopteros===

When the nearby wooden Apollo temple had fallen into disrepair, an early idea of Sckell&#x27;s for a hilltop temple was taken up and a new stone building of similar design was commissioned (an early plan even calls the Monopteros &quot;Apollo Tempel&quot;, a name it never actually bore). This small (16 m high), round, Greek-style temple was designed by Leo von Klenze. It was built on a 15 m high foundation, around which a small hill was created in 1832, using leftover building material from recent work on the Munich &quot;Residenz&quot; (Royal Residence). Hill and temple were completed in 1836. Ten Ionic columns support a shallow copper-covered dome; palmettes adorn the sima. A particular feature of the Monopteros is the use of polychrome stone painting, an interest of Klenze at the time, who intended the building to serve as a model for its use.

===Steinerne Bank===

Before the Monopteros was built, a small circular temple had stood by the Eisbach a little to the south of the &quot;Chinesischer Turm&quot;. Designed by Johann Baptist Lechner (1758–1809) and erected in 1789, it became known as the Apollo temple after an Apollo statue by Josef Nepomuk Muxel was added to it in 1791. While the basis of the temple was tuff, the temple itself was wooden; and by the early nineteenth century, this had fallen into disrepair. In 1838, Leo von Klenze built an exedra or stone bench (&quot;Steinerne Bank&quot;) in place of the temple, with the inscription &quot;Hier wo Ihr wallet, da war sonst Wald nur und Sumpf&quot; (&quot;Here where you meander was once only wood and marsh&quot;). The temple&#x27;s circular basis served as the basis for the curved bench.

===Chinese Tower===
====Tower====

The &quot;Chinesischer Turm&quot; (&quot;Chinese Tower&quot;) is a 25-metre-high wooden structure, first constructed in 1789 to 1790, from a design by the Mannheimer military architect Joseph Frey (1758–1819). It was modelled on the &quot;Great Pagoda&quot; in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew. The Pagoda, twice as high as the tower, was supposed to resemble a porcelain pagoda in the gardens of a Chinese emperor. The Munich tower has five storeys: the ground storey roof has a diameter of 19 m, the topmost storey of 6 m.

On July 13, 1944, the original tower burned down after heavy bombing; but a society aiming to rebuild it was formed in 1951 and the new tower, copied accurately from the original by consulting photographs and old drawings, was completed in September 1952.

====Surroundings====
A wooden &quot;Chinesische Wirtschaft&quot; (restaurant in Chinese style), designed by Lechner, was added in 1790. In 1912, this was replaced by the present-day stone building, which reflected the original design. With 7,000 seats, the beer garden at the &quot;Chinesischer Turm&quot; is the second largest in Munich.
In the late 19th century up to 5000 servants, manual workers, soldiers, and students would come to the tower early on a Sunday morning to dance to the music of a brass band. The dance began around five in the morning and ended around eight o&#x27;clock, so that servants could return to serve their employers&#x27; breakfast or go to church. As a dance for servants it was known as the &quot;Kocherlball&quot; (cooks&#x27; ball). In 1904 the custom was forbidden by the police on moral grounds. But in 1989, to celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the park, a revival was made, with around 4000 attending, and the dance has since been celebrated each year in July.

A children&#x27;s carousel was put up near the tower in 1823, similar in design to the current one. By 1912 a replacement was needed, which is still in use. It was designed by the Schwabinger sculptor Joseph Erlacher and the decoration painter August Julier. Alongside the usual horses, the carousel has less expected creatures to ride, such as an ibex, stork and flamingo. Its wooden roof and pillars were restored from 1979 to 1980.

South of the tower are the &quot;Ökonomiegebäude&quot; (&quot;Economy buildings&quot;), which were designed by Lechner towards the end of the 18th century as a model farm. Today, the &quot;Ökonomiegebäude&quot; are occupied by the management of the Englischer Garten.

===Rumford-Saal===

A little to the north of the &quot;Chinesischer Turm&quot;, the &quot;Rumford-Saal&quot; (Rumford Hall) or &quot;Rumfordhaus&quot; (Rumford House) is a small building in Palladian style. During its construction it was known as the &quot;großer Saal&quot; (great hall) or &quot;Militairsaal&quot; (military hall); but it was later renamed to honour the garden&#x27;s founder, Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford. It was built in 1791 by Lechner as an officers&#x27; mess (&quot;Offiziers-kasino&quot;) and was used first by the army, later by the court. The building, 30 m long and 10 m wide, has one and a half storeys; front and back have a portico with six wooden Ionic pillars. Its dining hall, adorned with many mirrors which give it its name, the &quot;Spiegelsaal&quot; (mirror room), has room for 150 people. The building is currently used by the city of Munich as a children&#x27;s centre (&quot;Kinderfreizeitstätte&quot;).

===Kleinhesseloher See===
The &quot;Kleinhesseloher See&quot; (&quot;Kleinhesseloher Lake&quot;) was created under Werneck&#x27;s direction around 1800 between the districts of Schwabing, at that time a village north of Munich, and Kleinhesselohe. Kleinhesselohe had been the original northern limit of the park, with a watchhouse and a gate to the northern Hirschau. The park warden there had set up an improvised beer shop for workers in the park. This soon expanded to offer milk and cold meals and came to be a favoured stop for walkers in the park, especially after a wooden dance place had been added. Werneck&#x27;s successor Sckell increased the size of the lake by one and a half times in 1807 to 1812, giving it its present form. It is constantly fed by water from the Eisbach. Three islands can be found within the lake&#x27;s 86,410 square meters: &quot;Königsinsel&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Island&quot;, 2,720 m2), &quot;Kurfürsteninsel&quot; (&quot;Elector&#x27;s Island&quot;, 1,260 m2) and &quot;Regenteninsel&quot; (&quot;Regent&#x27;s Island&quot;, 640 m2).
Sckell&#x27;s enlargement of the lake brought it close to Kleinhesselohe; and the little beer garden there was to be a forerunner of the modern &quot;Seehaus&quot; (&quot;lake house&quot;), with 2,500 seats. In 1882 to 1883 Gabriel von Seidel built a boathouse with food service. This was replaced with a new building by Rudolf Esterer in 1935; with a terrace overlooking the lake, this was very popular until 1970, when it was demolished. A competition for a new design was won by Alexander von Branca, with a design modelled on a Japanese village; but the work was found too costly and never executed. For fifteen years service was from temporary buildings, until in 1985 the current &quot;Seehaus&quot; was built to a design by Ernst Hürlimann and Ludwig Wiedemann. Today, the lake and the Seehaus are well-loved leisure destinations; pedal boats are also leased here to those who want to splash around.

Two monuments near the lake honour its creators. The &quot;Werneck-Denkmal&quot;, a monument to Werneck, stands on a rise near the east side. It was erected in 1838 on Ludwig I&#x27;s suggestion to a design by von Klenze. A little south of it, on the bank of the lake, the &quot;Sckell-Säule&quot; (&quot;Sckell pillar&quot;) honours Ludwig von Sckell. This, also designed by von Klenze, was erected in 1824, a year after Sckell&#x27;s death; the design was executed by Ernst von Bandel, who would later be known as the creator of the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot;.

===Hirschau===

The English Garden is divided into two portions by the busy Isarring road. The southern part is around 2 km long, while the northern part, called the Hirschau, is around 3 km long. In contrast to the southern part, which on sunny days contains as many people as one would find in a medium-sized town, the Hirschau has a peaceful character. In the southern part the grass in the open expanses (heavily used for sport and sunbathing) must be kept short; but in the Hirschau some meadows are allowed to grow and are mown for hay in June and August, while others are used as pasture for sheep. Two beer gardens, the &quot;Aumeister&quot;, built in 1810–11 by the court mason (&quot;Hofmaurermeister&quot;) Joseph Deiglmayr (1760–1814) and the &quot;Hirschau&quot;, built in 1840, are located at the north and south end of the Hirschau respectively. 
The northern part of the garden also contains a small amphitheatre, built in 1985 and called the new amphitheatre. (An amphitheatre built in 1793 to a similar plan, but in a different position, a little north of the Rumford-Saal, has not survived; this had been used primarily for fireworks exhibitions). The new amphitheatre is used for open-air performances in summer. To the east the Hirschau&#x27;s border is formed by the Isar, which can be crossed at the Oberföhring dam (&quot;Stauwehr Oberföhring&quot;), built between 1920 and 1924, and at the Emmeram Bridge, a wooden pedestrian bridge first built in 1978. The bridge was destroyed by arson in 2002, and replaced by a new design in 2004.

<text>Fawley is a village and civil parish in Wycombe district in the south-western corner of Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the boundary between Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, about seven miles west of Great Marlow and north of Henley-on-Thames.

The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;fallow-coloured woodland clearing&quot;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Falelie&quot;. There are two other places in England called Fawley.

Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke, a prominent Member of Parliament in Cromwell&#x27;s day, was from Fawley. In 1642 he allowed soldiers fighting in the English Civil War to stay at the manor house in Fawley, known as Fawley Court but they were quite raucous in their behaviour and destroyed the contents of the house. In 1684 the house was redesigned, following a design by Sir Christopher Wren.

The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin was rebuilt in 1748. It has a &quot;Tree of Life&quot; stained glass window designed by the artist John Piper (who lived nearby in Fawley Bottom) and Patrick Reyntiens.

<text>Constantine III (also Constantine V; ; , Western Armenian transliteration: &quot;Gosdantin&quot; or &quot;Kostantine&quot;; 17 April 1313 – 21 December 1362) was the King of Armenian Cilicia from 1344 to 1362. He was the son of Baldwin, Lord of Neghir (a nephew of Hethum I of Armenia), and second cousin of Constantine II.

When Constantine II was killed in an uprising in 1344, Constantine III succeeded him. He attempted to wipe out all rival claimants to the throne, giving orders to kill Constantine II&#x27;s nephews, Bemon and Leo, but before the murders could be carried out they escaped to Cyprus. During his rule, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was reduced by Mamluk raids and conquests. They conquered Ajazzo in 1347 and Tarsus and Adana in 1359.

Constantine was the first husband of Maria, daughter of Oshin of Corycos and Joan of Taranto. He was predeceased by his two sons. Upon his death from natural causes he was succeeded by his cousin Constantine IV.

<doc id="403264" wikidata="Q19077" url="?curid=403264" title="Justice and Development Party (Turkey)">
<text>The Justice and Development Party ( , AK PARTİ), abbreviated officially as AK Party in English, is a political party in Turkey self-describing as conservative-democratic. It has been the ruling party of Turkey since 2002. Third-party sources often refer to the party as national conservative, social conservative, right-wing populist and as espousing neo-Ottomanism. The party is generally regarded as being right-wing on the political spectrum, although some sources have described it as far-right since 2011. It is one of the two major parties of contemporary Turkey along with the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP).

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been chairman of the AK Party since the 2017 Party Congress. The AK Party is the largest party in the Grand National Assembly, the Turkish national legislature, with 268 out of 600 seats, having won 35.6% of votes in the 2023 Turkish parliamentary election. It forms the People&#x27;s Alliance with the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). The current parliamentary leader of the AK Party is Abdullah Güler.

Founded in 2001 by members of a number of parties such as FP, ANAP and DYP, the party has a strong base of support among people from the conservative tradition of Turkey, though the party strongly denies it is Islamist. The party positioned itself as pro-liberal market economy, supporting Turkish membership in the European Union. Orange is the party&#x27;s main colour. Other colours include white for the logo, blue for the flag, and orange-white-blue-red for the corporate design.

The AK Party is the only party in Turkey with a significant presence in all provinces of Turkey. Since the beginning of Turkey&#x27;s multiparty democracy in 1946, AK Party is the only party to win seven consecutive parliamentary elections. The AK Party has headed the national government since 2002 under Abdullah Gül (2002–2003), Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (2003–2014), Ahmet Davutoğlu (2014–2016), Binali Yıldırım (2016–2018) and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (2018–present). The AK Party&#x27;s rule has been marked with increasing authoritarianism, expansionism, censorship and banning of other political parties and dissent.

The party was an observer in the European People&#x27;s Party between 2005 and 2013. After not being granted full membership in the EPP, the party became a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE) from 2013 to 2018.

AK Party has dominated Turkish politics since 2002. It is the sixth largest political party in the world by membership and the biggest in the world outside India, China and the U.S.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The AK Party was established by a wide range of politicians of various political parties and a number of new politicians in 2001. The core of the party was formed from the reformist faction of the Islamist Virtue Party, including people such as Abdullah Gül and Bülent Arınç, while a second founding group consisted of members of the social conservative Motherland Party who had been close to Turgut Özal, such as Cemil Çiçek and Abdülkadir Aksu. Historically the party was described as liberal conservative, conservative liberal, economically liberal, pro-European, and center-right.

Some members of the True Path Party, such as Hüseyin Çelik and Köksal Toptan, joined the AK Party. Some members, such as Kürşad Tüzmen or Ertuğrul Günay, had nationalist or center-left backgrounds respectively, while representatives of the nascent, more clearly anti-capitalist &#x27;Muslim left&#x27; current were largely excluded. In addition, a large number of people joined a political party for the first time, such as Ali Babacan, Nimet Baş, Egemen Bağış and Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.

=== Closure cases ===

Controversies over whether the party remains committed to secular principles enshrined in the Turkish constitution have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. Turkey&#x27;s constitution established the country as a secular state and prohibits any political parties that promote Islamism or shariah law.

Since coming to power, the party has brought about tighter regulations on abortion and higher taxes on alcohol consumption, leading to allegations that it is covertly undermining Turkish secularism. Some activists, commentators, opponents and government officials have accused the party of Islamism. The Justice and Development Party has faced two &quot;closure cases&quot; (attempts to officially ban the party, usually for Islamist practices) in 2002 and 2008.

Just 10 days before the national elections of 2002, Turkey&#x27;s chief prosecutor, Sabih Kanadoğlu, asked the Turkish constitutional court to close the Justice and Development Party, which was leading in the polls at that time. The chief prosecutor charged the Justice and Development Party with abusing the law and justice. He based his case on the fact that the party&#x27;s leader had been banned from political life for reading an Islamist poem, and thus the party had no standing in elections. The European Commission had previously criticized Turkey for banning the party&#x27;s leader from participating in elections.
The party again faced a closure trial in 2008 brought about by the lifting of a long-standing university ban on headscarves. At an international press conference in Spain, Erdoğan answered a question of a journalist by saying, &quot;What if the headscarf is a symbol? Even if it were a political symbol, does that give [one the] right to ban it? Could you bring prohibitions to symbols?&quot; These statements led to a joint proposal of the Justice and Development Party and the far-right Nationalist Movement Party for changing the constitution and the law to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves at state universities.

Soon afterwards, Turkey&#x27;s chief prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçınkaya, asked the Constitutional Court of Turkey to close down the party on charges of violating the separation of religion and state in Turkey. The closure request failed by only one vote, as only six of the 11 judges ruled in favor, with seven required; however, 10 out of 11 judges agreed that the Justice and Development Party had become &quot;a center for anti-secular activities&quot;, leading to a loss of 50% of the state funding for the party.

=== Elections ===

The party has won pluralities in the seven most recent legislative elections, those of 2002, 2007, 2011, June 2015, November 2015, 2018 and 2023. The party held a majority of seats for 13 years, but lost it in June 2015, only to regain it in the snap election of November 2015 but then lose it again in 2018. Its past electoral success has been mirrored in the three local elections held since the party&#x27;s establishment, coming first in 2004, 2009 and 2014 respectively. However, the party lost most of Turkey&#x27;s biggest cities including Istanbul and Ankara in 2019 local elections, which has been attributed to the Turkish economic crisis, accusations of authoritarianism, as well as alleged government inaction on the Syrian refugee crisis.

==== 2002 general elections ====
The AK Party won a sweeping victory in the 2002 elections, which saw every party previously represented in the Grand National Assembly ejected from the chamber. In the process, it won a two-thirds majority of seats, becoming the first Turkish party in 11 years to win an outright majority. Erdoğan, as the leader of the biggest party in parliament, would have been normally given the task to form a cabinet. 

However, according to the Turkish Constitution Article 109 the prime ministers had to be also a representative of the Turkish Parliament. Erdoğan, who was banned from holding any political office after a 1994 incident in which he read a poem deemed pro-Islamist by judges, was therefore not. As a result, Gül became prime minister. 

It survived the crisis over the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite a massive back bench rebellion where over a hundred AK Party MPs joined those of the opposition Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) in parliament to prevent the government from allowing the United States to launch a Northern offensive in Iraq from Turkish territory. Later, Erdoğan&#x27;s ban was lifted with the help of the CHP and Erdoğan became prime minister by being elected to the parliament after a by-election in Siirt.

The AK Party has undertaken structural reforms, and during its rule Turkey has seen rapid growth and an end to its three decade long period of high inflation rates. Inflation had fallen to 8.8% by 2004.

Influential business publications such as &quot;The Economist&quot; consider the AK Party&#x27;s government the most successful in Turkey in decades.

==== 2004 local elections ====
In the local elections of 2004, the AK Party won 42% of the votes, making inroads against the secular Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) on the South and West Coasts, and against the Social Democratic People&#x27;s Party, which is supported by some Kurds in the South-East of Turkey.

In January 2005, the AK Party was admitted as an observer member in the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). However, it left the EPP to join the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR) in 2013.

==== 2007 elections ====
On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest the possible candidacy of Erdoğan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as president, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had decided to nominate Abdullah Gül as the AK Party candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million reported at an 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands reported at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Çanakkale, and one million in İzmir on 13 May.

Early parliamentary elections were called after the failure of the parties in parliament to agree on the next Turkish president. The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote and deadlocked the election process. At the same time, Erdoğan claimed the failure to elect a president was a failure of the Turkish political system and proposed to modify the constitution.

The AK Party achieved a significant victory in the rescheduled 22 July 2007 elections with 46.6% of the vote, translating into control of 341 of the 550 available parliamentary seats. Although the AK Party received significantly more votes in 2007 than in 2002, the number of parliamentary seats they controlled decreased due to the rules of the Turkish electoral system. However, they retained a comfortable ruling majority.

Nationally, the elections of 2007 saw a major advance for the AK Party, with the party outpolling the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party in traditional Kurdish strongholds such as Van and Mardin, as well as outpolling the secular-left CHP in traditionally secular areas such as Antalya and Artvin. Overall, the AK Party secured a plurality of votes in 68 of Turkey&#x27;s 81 provinces, with its strongest vote of 71% coming from Bingöl. Its weakest vote, a mere 12%, came from Tunceli, the only Turkish province where the Alevi form a majority. Abdullah Gül was elected as the President in late August with 339 votes in the third round – the first at which a simple majority is required – after deadlock in the first two rounds, in which a two-thirds majority was needed.

==== 2007 constitutional referendum ====
After the opposition parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AK Party proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by President Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court did not find any problems in the package and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.

The reforms consisted of:
* electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament;
* reducing the presidential term from seven years to five;
* allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term;
* holding general elections every four years instead of five;
* reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.

==== 2009 local elections ====
The 2009 Turkish local elections took place in March 2009, during the Great Recession. After the success of the AK Party in the 2007 general elections, the party saw a decline in the 2009 Turkish local elections. In these elections the AK Party received 39% of the vote, 3% less than in the local elections of 2004. Still, the AK Party remained the dominating party in Turkey. The second party CHP received 23% of the vote and the third party MHP received 16% of the vote. The AK Party won in Turkey&#x27;s largest cities: Ankara and Istanbul.

==== 2010 constitutional referendum ====

Reforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AK Party during the 2007 election campaign. The main opposition party CHP was not interested in altering the Constitution on a big scale, making it impossible to form a Constitutional Commission (&quot;Anayasa Uzlaşma Komisyonu&quot;). The amendments lacked the two-thirds majority needed to instantly become law, but secured 336 votes in the 550 seat parliament – enough to put the proposals to a referendum. 

The reform package included a number of issues: such as the right of individuals to appeal to the highest court, the creation of the ombudsman&#x27;s office, the possibility to negotiate a nationwide labour contract, positive exceptions for female citizens, the ability of civilian courts to convict members of the military, the right of civil servants to go on strike, a privacy law, and the structure of the Constitutional Court. The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.

==== 2011 Turkish general election ====
==== 2014 elections ====
In the presidential election of 2014, the AK Party&#x27;s long time leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected president. In the party&#x27;s first extraordinary congress, former foreign minister Ahmet Davutoğlu was unanimously elected unopposed as party leader and took over as prime minister on 28 August 2014. Davutoğlu stepped down as prime minister on 4 May 2016 following policy disagreements with President Erdoğan. Presidential aide Cemil Ertem said to Turkish TV that the country and its economy would stabilize further &quot;when a prime minister more closely aligned with President Erdoğan takes office&quot;.

==== June 2015 general election ====
In the general election held on 7 June, the AK Party gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AK Party lost its status as the majority party and the power to form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. In this election, the AK Party was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. 

This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has drawn fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centered Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party, HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in the election, which caused the AK Party to lose its parliamentary majority.

==== November 2015 general election ====
==== 2018 general election ====
==== 2019 local elections ====
In the 2019 local elections, the ruling party AK Party lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 15 years, as well as five of Turkey&#x27;s six largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to AK Party&#x27;s mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as alleged government inaction on the Syrian refugee crisis. Soon after the elections, the Turkish government ordered a re-election in Istanbul. The decision led to a downfall on AK Party&#x27;s popularity and it lost the elections again in June with an even greater margin. 

The result was seen as a huge blow to Erdoğan, who had once said that if his party &#x27;lost Istanbul, we would lose Turkey.&#x27; The opposition&#x27;s landslide was characterized as the &#x27;beginning of the end&#x27; for Erdoğan, with international commentators calling the re-run a huge government miscalculation that can lead to a potential İmamoğlu candidacy in the next scheduled presidential election. It is suspected that the scale of the government&#x27;s defeat could provoke a cabinet reshuffle and early general elections, currently scheduled for June 2023.

==== 2023 general election ====
==== 2024 local elections ====
== Ideology and policies ==
Although the party is described as an Islamist party in some media, party officials reject those claims. According to former minister Hüseyin Çelik, &quot;In the Western press, when the AK Party administration – the ruling party of the Turkish Republic – is being named, most of the time &#x27;Islamic,&#x27; &#x27;Islamist,&#x27; &#x27;mildly Islamist,&#x27; &#x27;Islamic-oriented,&#x27; &#x27;Islamic-based&#x27; or &#x27;with an Islamic agenda,&#x27; and similar language is being used. These characterizations do not reflect the truth, and they sadden us.&quot; Çelik added, &quot;The AK Party is a conservative democratic party. The AK Party&#x27;s conservatism is limited to moral and social issues.&quot; Also in a separate speech made in 2005, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated, &quot;We are not an Islamic party, and we also refuse labels such as Muslim-democrat.&quot; Erdogan went on to say that the AK Party&#x27;s agenda is limited to &quot;conservative democracy&quot;.

On the other hand, according to at least one observer (Mustafa Akyol), under the AK Party government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, starting in 2007, &quot;hundreds of secularist officers and their civilian allies&quot; were jailed, and by 2012 the &quot;old secularist guard&quot; in positions of authority was replaced by members/supporters of the AK Party and the Islamic Gülen movement. On 25 April 2016, the Turkish Parliament Speaker İsmail Kahraman told a conference of Islamic scholars and writers in Istanbul that &quot;secularism would not have a place in a new constitution”, as Turkey is “a Muslim country and so we should have a religious constitution&quot;. (One of the duties of Parliament Speaker is to pen a new draft constitution for Turkey). As of 2023, some sources define the party as being &quot;rooted in political Islam&quot; and an &quot;Islamist-rooted party&quot;.

In recent years, the ideology of the party has shifted more towards Turkish nationalism, causing liberals such as Ali Babacan and some conservatives such as Ahmet Davutoğlu and Abdullah Gül to leave the party. Several writers have also labelled the party as being right-wing populist since 2007.

The party&#x27;s foreign policy has also been widely described as Neo-Ottomanist, an ideology that promotes renewed Turkish political engagement in the former territories of its predecessor state, the Ottoman Empire. However, the party&#x27;s leadership has also rejected this label. The party&#x27;s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood has drawn allegations of Islamism.

The AK Party favors a strong centralized leadership, having long advocated for a presidential system of government and significantly reduced the number of elected local government positions in 2013.

The party was an observer in the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party between 2005 and 2013 and a member of the Eurosceptic Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE) from 2013 to 2018.

=== European affiliation ===

In 2005, the party was granted observer membership in the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).

In November 2013, the party left the EPP to join the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (now European Conservatives and Reformists Party) instead. This move was attributed to the AK Party&#x27;s disappointment to not to be granted full membership in the EPP, while it was admitted as a full member of the AECR. It drew criticism in both national and European discourses, as the driving force of Turkey&#x27;s aspirations to become a member of the European Union decided to join a largely eurosceptic alliance, abandoning the more influential pro-European EPP, feeding suspicions that AK Party wants to join a watered down, not a closely integrated EU. The AK Party withdrew from AECR in 2018.

===Legislation and positions===
From 2002 to 2011 the party passed series of reforms to increase accessibility to healthcare and housing, distribute food subsidies, increased funding for students, improved infrastructure in poorer districts, and improved rights for religious and ethnic minorities. AK Party is also widely accredited for overcoming the 2001 Turkish economic crisis by following International Monetary Fund guidelines, as well as successfully weathering the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2002 to 2011, the Turkish economy grew on average by 7.5 percent annually, thanks to lower inflation and interest rates. The government under AK Party also backed extensive privatization programs. In fact, 88% of the privatizations in Turkey were carried out under AK Party rule. The average income in Turkey rose from $2,800 U.S. in 2001 to around $10,000 U.S. in 2011, higher than income in some of the new EU member states. Other reforms included increasing civilian representation over military in areas of national security, education and media, and grant broadcasting and increased cultural rights to Kurds. On Cyprus, AK Party supported unification of Cyprus, something deeply opposed by the Turkish military. Other AK Party reforms included lifting bans on religious and conservative dress, such as headscarves, in universities and public institutions. AK Party also ended discrimination against students from religious high schools, who previously had to meet additional criteria in areas of education and upon entry to universities. AK Party is also accredited for bringing the Turkish military under civilian rule, a paradigm shift for a country that had experienced constant military meddling for almost a century.

More recently, nationwide protests broke out against the alleged authoritarianism of the AK Party in 2013, with the party&#x27;s perceived heavy-handed response receiving western condemnation and stalling the party&#x27;s once championed EU accession negotiations. In addition to its alleged attempts to promote Islamism, the party is accused by some of restricting some civil liberties and internet use in Turkey, having temporarily blocked access to Twitter and YouTube in March 2014. Especially after the government corruption scandal involving several AKP ministers in 2013, the party has been increasingly accused of crony capitalism. The AK Party favors a strong centralized leadership, having long advocated for a presidential system of government and significantly reduced the number of elected local government positions in 2013.

== Criticism ==
Critics have accused the AK Party of having a &#x27;hidden agenda&#x27; despite their public endorsement of secularism and the party maintains informal relations and support for the Muslim Brotherhood. Both the party&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy has been perceived to be Pan-Islamist or Neo-Ottoman, advocating a revival of Ottoman culture often at the expense of secular republican principles, while increasing regional presence in former Ottoman territories.

The AK Party has been criticized for supporting a wide-scale purge of thousands of academics after the failed coup attempt in 2016. Primary, lower secondary and secondary school students were forced to spend the first day of school after the failed coup d&#x27;état watching videos about the ‘triumph of democracy’ over the plotters, and listening to speeches equating the civilian counter-coup that aborted the takeover with historic Ottoman victories going back 1000 years. Campaigns have been organised to release higher education personnel and to drop charges against them for peaceful exercise of academic freedom.

Imprisonment of political activists continues, while the chair of Amnesty Turkey has been jailed for standing up to the AK Party on trumped up &quot;terrorism charges&quot;. These charges have drawn condemnation from many western countries, including from the US State Department, the EU, as well as from international and domestic human rights organisations.

The party has also been criticized by Turkish and international LGBT rights groups including KAOS GL for homophobic statements made by some AK Party politicians and for what they argue has become a repressive climate for LGBT rights in Turkey under the AK Party. In 2002 before his election, Erdoğan said that &quot;homosexuals must be legally protected within the framework of their rights and freedoms.&quot; In 2011, AK Party Minister for Families and Social Policy Fatma Şahin said the AK Party government would be willing to work with LGBT rights groups to advance laws protecting Turkey&#x27;s gay community. However, commentators have argued the AK Party has taken an increasingly hardline stance on LGBT issues since coming to power, which has been characterized variously as part of a general trend towards authoritarianism under the AK Party or as motivated by Islamic and militant nationalist sentiments within the party. In 2012, the AK Party voted against a proposal by the BDP to include legalization of same-sex marriage in the redrafted Turkish constitution and in 2013 blocked a research motion in the parliament of Turkey on having a parliamentary debate regarding LGBT rights. During the latter debate, AK Party MP Türkan Dağoğlu stated &quot;Homosexuality is an abnormality. Same-sex marriages may not be allowed. It would cause social deterioration&quot;; this prompted criticism from some opposition politicians. In 2017, Erdogan stated that the principle of LGBT rights was &quot;against the values of our nation&quot; and in 2020 endorsed controversial anti-gay statements made by Muslim scholar Ali Erbaş which had received condemnation from some Turkish lawyers and human rights groups. In 2021, AK Party vice chairman and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu declared LGBT people to be &quot;perverts.&quot; Turkish constitutional law experts Sule Ozsoy Boyunsuz and Serkan Koybasi have described public statements on gay people made by AK Party politicians as both constituting as hate speech and contradicting the principle of Turkey&#x27;s policy of secularism. Political scientist Mine Eder has argued that Turkey has experienced a backslide on acceptance and government anti-discrimination support for homosexuals under Erdogan.

===2013 corruption scandal===
The 2013 corruption scandal was a criminal investigation that involved several key people in the Turkish government. All of the 52 people detained on 17 December were connected in various ways with the ruling Justice and Development Party. Prosecutors accused 14 people including Suleyman Aslan, the director of state-owned Halkbank, Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab, and several family members of cabinet ministers of bribery, corruption, fraud, money laundering and gold smuggling.

At the heart of the scandal was an alleged &quot;gas for gold&quot; scheme with Iran involving Aslan, who had US$4.5 million in cash stored in shoeboxes in his home, and Zarrab, who was involved in about US$9.6 billion of gold trading in 2012. Both men were arrested. The scheme started after Turkish government officials found a loophole in the U.S. sanctions against Iran that allowed them to access Iranian oil and gas. The Turks exported some US$13 billion of gold to Iran directly, or through the UAE, between March 2012 and July 2013. In return, the Turks received Iranian natural gas and oil. The transactions were carried out through the Turkish state-owned bank, Halkbank. In January 2013, the Obama administration decided to close this loophole but instead of immediately charging Halkbank, the U.S. government allowed its gold trading activities to continue until July 2013, because Turkey was an important ally regarding the American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the U.S. had been working on a nuclear deal with Iran.

Then-Prime Minister Erdogan (now President of Turkey) was on a tour of Pakistan when the scandal broke, which analysts believe changed the response of the AK Party, or influenced those with the tapes to leak them at a time when Erdoğan was visiting an ally (Pakistan).

<text>Fenny Stratford is a constituent town of Milton Keynes, a city in Buckinghamshire, England. It is administered by Bletchley and Fenny Stratford, a civil parish under the Milton Keynes City Council. It is located around Watling Street, at the southern edge of the city, just east of Bletchley and west of the modern A5. It was included in Milton Keynes when the latter was designated in 1967.

== Today ==

A mixture of old buildings and new developments, Fenny Stratford is a small town on the edge of Milton Keynes. Its market may be long gone but it hosts various shops, restaurants, pubs, newsagents, and hotels centered mainly around Aylesbury Street. There is an LGBT friendly night club on Watling Street. Fenny Stratford railway station, one of the seven railway stations that serve the Milton Keynes urban area, is served by the (Bletchley - Bedford) Marston Vale Line.

==History==

The town name is an Old English language word that means &#x27;marshy ford on a Roman road&#x27;. The Roman road in this case is the Watling Street. There are traces of the Romano-British settlement (or ) at Dropshot Farm, on the edge of the present day occupation. (Possibly the oldest known gold coin in Britain was found here in 1849, a gold stater of the mid-second century BCE. Although known as the &quot;Bletchley&quot; hoards, two coin hoards were also found at or near the site of , consisting of silver &quot;denarii&quot;, in 1967 and 1987.) The town was recorded in manorial rolls in 1252 as &quot;Fenni Stratford&quot;. King JamesI awarded a market charter in 1608, making it formally a town.

Being an ancient market town, Fenny Stratford was the location of a weekly market for many years until 1665 when the town was badly hit by the bubonic plague. As a result, the main London-Chester route that ran through the town on Watling Street was diverted away from it, and the market ceased to exist. The market was never reinstated: the town was very much in ruins by the early eighteenth century, and had by this time been joined with both Bletchley and Simpson, being commonly considered a hamlet of the former.

Fenny Stratford was formerly a chapelry, in 1866 Fenny Stratford became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Bletchley. In 1931 the parish had a population of 4,602.

==Local government==
From 1882 to 1891, it was a civil parish in its own right. In 1895, it formed an urban district with Simpson, expanded in 1898 to include Bletchley. In 1974, it became part of the (then) District of Milton Keynes under Buckinghamshire County Council.

==Parish church==

On St Martin&#x27;s Day 1724, the first stone was laid of the new parish church of Fenny Stratford, marking a fresh start in the town&#x27;s history. Browne Willis, a historian of the day, had raised the funds for its construction. The Church was built on the site of the old chantry chapel of St. Margaret and St. Catherine at Fenny Stratford. He erected the church as a memorial to his grandfather Thomas Willis, a famous physician, who lived in St. Martin&#x27;s Lane in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London, and who died on St. Martin&#x27;s day, 11 November 1675. To perpetuate his own memory, Browne Willis arranged for a sermon to be preached at St. Martin&#x27;s Church on each St. Martin&#x27;s Day, for which a fee was payable. During his lifetime, he also celebrated the occasion with a dinner attended by local clergy and gentry, an event which has continued to the present day.

=== The Fenny Poppers ===
The Fenny Poppers are six small ceremonial cannon which date from this time and are still fired ceremonially (with blank charges) today.

There is no record of their first use. In 1740, Browne Willis bought a house in Aylesbury Street, Fenny Stratford and the rent from this was used to pay for the sermon and gunpowder. Following his death in 1760, the traditions were carried on and later documented.

All six Poppers were re-cast by the Eagle Foundry, Northampton in 1859, after one of them burst. They are still in use today, and were recently examined and x-rayed to ensure there are no cracks. During their long history, many sites have been used for this battery. These include the Canal Wharf, land behind the Church, St, Martin&#x27;s Hall, the Churchyard and now the Leon Recreation Ground, which was once part of the lands belonging to the Chantry.

The Poppers each weigh about 19 pounds (8.5 kg). The , 6&quot; by 1¾&quot; (152 mm x 44 mm) will take one ounce (28g) of gunpowder, which is plugged with well-rammed newspaper. They are fired three times on St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November): noon, 2pm and 4pm. There is of course no connection with Remembrance Day (also 11 November). In 1901 they were fired to mark the death of Queen Victoria; the 81 salvoes were heard as far away as Olney.

On 1 January 2000, at 11am the Poppers were fired to mark the beginning of the second millennium.

At 2pm on 4 August 2000, a salute of six Poppers was fired to celebrate the 100th birthday of the Queen Mother.

At 2pm on 5 June 2012 a salute was fired to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

== Invention of the Diesel Engine in Fenny Stratford ==
The world&#x27;s first successful heavy oil engines were invented and built by Herbert Akroyd Stuart in Fenny Stratford. There is a plaque commemorating this at the westerly end of Denmark Street in Fenny Stratford opposite The Foundry public house – though the location of Akroyd Stuart&#x27;s workshop is usually given as &quot;Bletchley&quot;, which is a larger town adjoining Fenny Stratford. These engines were precursors to what is now known as the Diesel engine: Rudolf Diesel based his designs (1892) on Akroyd Stuart&#x27;s proven inventions (1890) of direct (airless) fuel injection and compression ignition. An experimental model was tried out at the offices of the Fenny Stratford Times Newspaper, and the first production models were installed at the nearby Great Brickhill Waterworks where they were in operation from 1892 to 1923. (It has been argued that engines of this type might have become known as &quot;Akroyds&quot;, had Diesel not been a rather paranoid person not prone to giving other inventors credit.)

==Waterways==

The Grand Union Canal runs through the southern outskirts of the town and Fenny Lock is located in Simpson Road area to the east of Watling Street. It is notable both for the manually operated swing bridge which crosses the lock and for the very small rise in the lock (around , the shallowest on the Grand Union Canal network). This was deemed necessary by the canal engineers because the next section northwards of the canal could not be made adequately watertight at reasonable cost without it. The level persists from this lock for eleven miles, through what is now Milton Keynes, through to the next lock at Cosgrove. A little further south of the canal bridge, Watling Street crosses the river Ouzel (a tributary of the river Great Ouse: it was the marshy ford across this river that gave the town its name.
Fenny Stratford is bordered by North Street, Bletchley Leisure Centre, Knowles School/Leon Recreational Ground and the Fenny Allotments from the west, the Rail line, Watling street and Denbigh East from the north, Water Eaton Brook by the south and the River Ouzel and Grand Union Canal from the east.

==Manor Fields==
Manor Fields sports ground to the south of the town (and just across the Grand Union Canal from Bletchley&#x27;s &#x27;Trees&#x27; estate) is home to Milton Keynes Irish FC, Bletchley RUFC, the Irish Centre and other activities. The Roman town lay either side of Watling Street and thus Manor Fields lies on part of it.

<doc id="403286" wikidata="Q333106" url="?curid=403286" title="Hilaire Belloc">
<text>Joseph Hilaire Pierre René Belloc ( , ; 27 July 187016 July 1953) was a French-English writer, politician, and historian. Belloc was also an orator, poet, sailor, satirist, writer of letters, soldier, and political activist. His Catholic faith had a strong effect on his works.

Belloc became a naturalised British subject in 1902 while retaining his French citizenship. While attending Oxford University, he served as President of the Oxford Union. From 1906 to 1910, he served as one of the few openly Catholic members of the British Parliament.

Belloc was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds. He was also a close friend and collaborator of G. K. Chesterton. George Bernard Shaw, a friend and frequent debate opponent of both Belloc and Chesterton, dubbed the pair the &quot;Chesterbelloc&quot;.

Belloc&#x27;s writings encompassed religious poetry and comic verse for children. His widely sold &quot;Cautionary Tales for Children&quot; included &quot;Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion&quot; and &quot;Matilda, who told lies and was burned to death&quot;. He wrote historical biographies and numerous travel works, including &quot;The Path to Rome&quot; (1902).

==Family and career==
===Family===
Belloc was born in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France to a French father, Louis Belloc (1830–1872) and an English mother. His sister Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes also became a writer.

Belloc&#x27;s mother Bessie Rayner Parkes (1829–1925) was a writer, activist and an advocate for women&#x27;s equality, a co-founder of the &quot;English Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; and the Langham Place Group. As an adult, Belloc campaigned against women&#x27;s suffrage as a member of the Women&#x27;s National Anti-Suffrage League.

Belloc&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Joseph Parkes (1796–1865). Belloc&#x27;s grandmother, Elizabeth Rayner Priestley (1797–1877), was born in the United States, a granddaughter of Joseph Priestley.

In 1867, Bessie Rayner Parkes married attorney Louis Belloc, son of Jean-Hilaire Belloc. In 1872, five years after they wed, Louis died but not before being wiped out financially in a stock market crash. The young widow then brought her children from France back to England.

===Early life===
Belloc grew up in England; his boyhood was spent in Slindon, West Sussex. He wrote about his home in poems such as &quot;West Sussex Drinking Song&quot;, &quot;The South Country&quot;, and &quot;Ha&#x27;nacker Mill&quot;; after graduating from John Henry Newman&#x27;s Oratory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

===Courtship, marriage, and premature death of his wife===
In September 1889, Belloc&#x27;s sister Marie made the accidental acquaintance of a Catholic widow, Mrs. Ellen Hogan, who was travelling from California on a European tour with two of her children, her daughters Elizabeth and Elodie. The travellers were both devoutly Catholic and keenly interested in literature, and Marie arranged a visit with her mother, Bessie, who in turn arranged an audience with Henry Cardinal Manning. These acts of generosity cemented a strong friendship, further deepened when Marie and Bessie accompanied the Hogans on their tour of France, visiting Paris with them. Hilaire was absent touring the French provinces as a correspondent for &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, but when the Hogans stopped back in London on their return from another European trip the following year, Belloc met Elodie for the first time, and was smitten.

Shortly after this meeting, Ellen Hogan was called back to California prematurely to take care of another of her children who was stricken with illness. She left her two daughters, who wished to remain in London, under the care of the Belloc family, and, Bessie asked her own son to squire the Hogan daughters around London. Belloc&#x27;s interest in Elodie grew more fervid by the day. This was the beginning of a long, intercontinental, and star-crossed courtship, made all the more difficult by the opposition of Elodie&#x27;s mother, who wished Elodie to enter the convent, and Hilaire&#x27;s mother, who thought her son was too young to marry. Belloc pursued Elodie with letters, and, after her return to the United States, in 1891, he pursued her in person.

The impoverished Belloc, still only twenty years old, sold nearly everything he had to purchase a steamship ticket to New York, ostensibly to visit relatives in Philadelphia. Belloc&#x27;s true reason for the trek to America became apparent when, after spending a few days in Philadelphia, he began to make his way across the American continent. Part of his journey was by train, but when the money ran out, Belloc just walked. An athletic man who hiked extensively in Britain and Europe, Belloc made his way on foot for a significant part of the 2870 miles from Philadelphia to San Francisco. While walking, he paid for lodging at remote farm houses and ranches by sketching the owners and reciting poetry.

Hilaire&#x27;s first letter on his arrival in San Francisco is effervescent, happy to see Elodie and full of hopes for their future, but his manifestly zealous courtship was to go unrewarded. The joy he felt at seeing Elodie soon gave way to disappointment when the apparently insurmountable opposition of her mother to the marriage manifested itself. After a stay of only a few weeks, far shorter than the time he had spent in his journey to California, the crestfallen Belloc made his way back across the United States, after a fruitless journey of thousands of miles. His biographer Joseph Pearce compares the return to Napoleon&#x27;s long winter retreat from Moscow. When Belloc finally reached the East Coast at Montclair, New Jersey, he received a letter from Elodie on 30 April 1891, definitively rejecting him in favour of a religious vocation; the steamship trip home was tainted with despair.

The gloomy Belloc threw himself into restless activity. Determined to fulfill the obligation of military service necessary to retain his French citizenship, Belloc served his term with an artillery regiment near Toul in 1891. While he was serving in France, Elodie&#x27;s mother Ellen died, removing a significant obstacle to Belloc&#x27;s hopes, but Elodie, although torn between her affection for Hilaire and her desire to serve God in the religious life, was unwilling to cross her mother&#x27;s wishes so soon after her mother&#x27;s untimely death and persisted in refusing Belloc&#x27;s advances.

After his year of service was concluded, still pining for and writing to Elodie, he took the entrance exam to Oxford University, and matriculated to Balliol College in January 1893. Belloc later wrote in a poem:

While at Oxford he was bestowed by his fellow students with a great honour: he was elected and served as President of the Oxford Union, the University debating society. He and another undergraduate, Anthony Henley, also achieved the record-breaking and amazing athletic feat of walking from Carfax Tower in Oxford, to Marble Arch in London, a distance of some 55 miles, more than double that of a marathon, in only 11½ hours. He was awarded a first-class honours degree in history in June 1895.

That autumn, Elodie entered religious life and joined the Sisters of Charity at Emmitsburg, Maryland, as a postulant. She left a month later, writing to Belloc that she had failed in her religious vocation. In March 1896, having secured financing as an Oxford Extension lecturer in Philadelphia, Germantown, Baltimore and New Orleans, Belloc took a steamship to New York, and started making his way to Elodie in California. He expected to receive letters from her on his journey, but received none. To his shock and dismay, when he finally arrived in California in May, he discovered Elodie was deathly ill, worn out by the stress of the previous year. Belloc, thinking that after all their suffering, he and his beloved would be denied one another by her death, also collapsed. Over the next few weeks, however, Elodie recovered and after a tumultuous six-year courtship, Belloc and Elodie were married at St. John the Baptist Catholic church in Napa, California, on 15 June 1896. They settled initially in Oxford.

In 1906, Belloc purchased land and a house called King&#x27;s Land at Shipley, West Sussex in the United Kingdom. The couple had five children before Elodie&#x27;s untimely death on the Feast of the Purification, 2 February 1914, likely from cancer. She was age 45, and Belloc, at age 43, had more than 40 years of life ahead of him. He wore mourning garb for the rest of his life and kept her room as she had left it.

Nearly five years later, his son Louis was killed in 1918 while serving in the Royal Flying Corps in northern France. Belloc placed a memorial tablet at the nearby Cambrai Cathedral. It is in the same side chapel as the icon of Our Lady of Cambrai.

===Political career===
At Oxford University, Belloc served as president of the Oxford Union. He went into politics after he became a naturalised British subject. A great disappointment in his life was his failure to gain a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford in 1895. This failure may have been caused in part by his producing a small statue of the Virgin Mary and placing it before him on the table during the interview for the fellowship.

From 1906 to 1910, Belloc was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Salford South. During one campaign speech, he was asked by a heckler if he was a &quot;papist&quot;. He responded:
Gentlemen, I am a Catholic. As far as possible, I go to Mass every day. This [taking a rosary out of his pocket] is a rosary. As far as possible, I kneel down and tell these beads every day. If you reject me on account of my religion, I shall thank God that He has spared me the indignity of being your representative. The crowd cheered and Belloc won the election, despite his Catholic faith. He retained his seat in the first 1910 election but did not stand in December 1910.

Belloc&#x27;s only period of steady employment after that was from 1914 to 1920 as editor of &quot;Land and Water&quot;. Otherwise, he lived by his writing and was often financially insecure.

===In controversy and debate===
Belloc first came to public attention shortly after arriving at Balliol College, Oxford as a recent French army veteran. Attending his first debate of the Oxford Union Debating Society, he saw that the affirmative position was wretchedly and half-heartedly defended. As the debate drew to its conclusion and the division of the house was called, he rose from his seat in the audience, and delivered a vigorous, impromptu defence of the proposition. Belloc won that debate from the audience, as the division of the house then showed, and his reputation as a debater was established. He was later elected president of the Union. He held his own in debates there with F. E. Smith and John Buchan, the latter a friend.

In the 1920s, Belloc attacked H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Outline of History&quot;. Belloc criticised what he termed Wells&#x27;s secular bias and his belief in evolution by means of natural selection, a theory that Belloc asserted had been completely discredited. Wells remarked that &quot;Debating Mr. Belloc is like arguing with a hailstorm&quot;. Belloc&#x27;s review of &quot;Outline of History&quot; observed that Wells&#x27;s book was a powerful and well-written volume &quot;up until the appearance of Man, that is, somewhere around page seven&quot;. Wells responded with the small book &quot;Mr. Belloc Objects&quot;. Not to be outdone, Belloc followed with &quot;Mr. Belloc Still Objects&quot;.

G. G. Coulton wrote &quot;Mr. Belloc on Medieval History&quot; in a 1920 article. After a long-simmering feud, Belloc replied with a booklet, &quot;The Case of Dr. Coulton&quot;, in 1938.

Belloc&#x27;s style during later life fulfilled the nickname he received in childhood, &quot;Old Thunder&quot;. Belloc&#x27;s friend Lord Sheffield described his provocative personality in a preface to &quot;The Cruise of the Nona&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1937, Belloc was invited to be a visiting professor at Fordham University in New York City by university president Robert Gannon. Belloc delivered a series of lectures at Fordham which he completed in May of that year. The experience ended up leaving him physically exhausted, and he considered stopping the lectures early.

On 2 April 1941, Belloc&#x27;s son Peter Gilbert Marie Sebastian Belloc died at the age of 36 of pneumonia. He fell ill while on active service with the 5th Battalion, Royal Marines in Scotland. He is buried in West Grinstead at Our Lady of Consolation and St. Francis churchyard.

===Death and legacy===
In 1942, Belloc suffered a stroke and never recovered from its effects. On the 12 July 1953, he also suffered burns and shock after falling on his fireplace. He died on 16 July 1953 at Mount Alvernia Nursing Home in Guildford, Surrey.

Belloc was buried at the Shrine Church of Our Lady of Consolation and St Francis at West Grinstead, where he had regularly attended Mass as a parishioner. His estate was probated at £7,451. At his funeral Mass, homilist Monsignor Ronald Knox said &quot;No man of his time fought so hard for the good things&quot;. Boys from the Choir and Sacristy of Worth Preparatory School sang and served at the Mass.

Recent biographies of Belloc have been written by A. N. Wilson and Joseph Pearce. Jesuit political philosopher James Schall&#x27;s &quot;Remembering Belloc&quot; was published by St. Augustine Press in September 2013. A memoir of Belloc was written by Henry Edward George Rope.

===Hobbies===
During his later years, Belloc sailed when he could afford to do so and became a well-known yachtsman. He won many races and was on the French sailing team.

In the early 1930s, he was given an old pilot cutter named &quot;Jersey&quot;. He sailed this for some years around the coasts of England, with the help of younger men. One sailor, Dermod MacCarthy, wrote a book about it, called &quot;Sailing with Mr Belloc&quot;.

==Writing==
Belloc wrote more than 150 books, the subjects ranging from warfare to poetry to the many current topics of his day. He has been called one of the Big Four of Edwardian Letters, along with H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and G. K. Chesterton, all of whom debated with each other into the 1930s. Belloc was closely associated with Chesterton, and Shaw coined the term &quot;Chesterbelloc&quot; for their partnership. Belloc was co-editor with Cecil Chesterton of the literary periodical the &quot;Eye-Witness&quot;.

Asked once why he wrote so much, Belloc responded: &quot;Because my children are howling for pearls and caviar.&quot; Belloc observed that &quot;The first job of letters is to get a canon&quot;, that is, to identify those works a writer sees as exemplary of the best of prose and verse. For his own prose style, he said he aspired to be as clear and concise as &quot;Mary had a little lamb.&quot;

===Essays and travel writing===

In 1902, Belloc published &quot;The Path to Rome&quot;, an account of a walking pilgrimage from Central France across the Alps to Rome. &quot;The Path to Rome&quot; contains descriptions of the people and places he encountered, his drawings in pencil and in ink of the route, humour, poesy. In 1909, Belloc published &quot;The Pyrenees&quot;, providing many details of that region. As an essayist he was one of a small group (with Chesterton, E. V. Lucas and Robert Lynd) of popular writers.

During World War I, Belloc was perceived by soldiers as a &quot;kept correspondent&quot; for the Entente leadership. &quot;The Wipers Times&quot; mocked him as &quot;Belary Helloc,&quot; a satirical persona who advanced foolish suggestions for winning the war.

===Poetry===
His 1907 &quot;Cautionary Tales for Children&quot;, humorous poems with implausible morals, illustrated by Basil Temple Blackwood (signing as &quot;B.T.B.&quot;) and later by Edward Gorey, are the most widely known of his writings. Supposedly for children, they, like Lewis Carroll&#x27;s works, are more to adult and satirical tastes: &quot;Henry King, Who chewed bits of string and was early cut off in dreadful agonies&quot;. A similar poem tells the story of &quot;Rebecca, who slammed doors for fun and perished miserably&quot;.

The tale of &quot;Matilda who told lies and was burned to death&quot; was adapted into the play &quot;Matilda Liar!&quot; by Debbie Isitt. Quentin Blake, the illustrator, described Belloc as at one and the same time the overbearing adult and mischievous child. Roald Dahl was a follower. But Belloc has broader if sourer scope. For example, with Lord Lundy (who was &quot;far too freely moved to Tears&quot;):
leading up to
instead, Lundy is condemned to the ultimate political wilderness:
Of more weight is Belloc&#x27;s &quot;Sonnets and Verse&quot;, a volume that deploys the same singing and rhyming techniques of his children&#x27;s verses. Belloc&#x27;s poetry is often religious, often romantic; throughout &quot;The Path to Rome&quot; he writes in spontaneous song.

===History, politics, and economics===

Three of his best-known non-fiction works are &quot;The Servile State&quot; (1912), &quot;Europe and the Faith&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Jews&quot; (1922).

He authored the 1924 book &quot;Economics for Helen&quot;, which has lessons about economics for a 16-year old Helen. Economists criticized the book, with one writing, &quot;for example, he defines wealth as a sum of values rather than valuable things; he fails to distinguish betwen interest and profit; he says that there is no such thing as interest on money, that the intention of using wealth for further production is the essential feature of capital, and that taxes should fall proportionately to the wealth of the taxed, in order that the sacrifice should be equally felt by all.&quot; Another economist wrote, &quot;On the whole this very readable book is interesting as affording some insight into an original mind rather than useful as an introduction to Economics.&quot;

From an early age Belloc knew Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, who was responsible for the conversion of his mother to Catholicism. In &quot;The Cruise of the &quot;Nona&quot;&quot; (1925), he mentions a &quot;profound thing&quot; that Manning said to him when he was just twenty years old: &quot;All human conflict is ultimately theological.&quot; What Manning meant, Belloc said, is &quot;that all wars and revolutions, and all decisive struggles between parties of men arise from a difference in moral and transcendental doctrine.&quot; Belloc adds that he never met any man, &quot;arguing for what should be among men, but took for granted as he argued that the doctrine he consciously or unconsciously accepted was or should be a similar foundation for all mankind. Hence battle.&quot; Manning&#x27;s involvement in the London Dock Strike of 1889 made a major impression on Belloc and his view of politics, according to biographer Robert Speaight. He became a trenchant critic both of capitalism and of many aspects of socialism.

With others (G. K. Chesterton, Cecil Chesterton, Arthur Penty) Belloc envisioned the socioeconomic system of distributism, which advocates for a market economy with state regulation favoring cooperatives and small to medium enterprises against the concentrated economic power of large firms, finance-owned trusts, and monopolies. In &quot;The Servile State&quot;, written after his party-political career, and in other works, he criticised the modern economic order and parliamentary system, advocating distributism in opposition to both capitalism and socialism. Belloc made the historical argument that distributism was not a fresh perspective or program of economics but rather a return to the economics of widely distributed property that prevailed in Europe for the thousand years when it was Catholic. He called for the dissolution of Parliament and its replacement with committees of representatives for the various sectors of society, similar to medieval guilds, an idea that was popular under the name of corporatism at the time.

He contributed an article on &quot;Land-Tenure in the Christian Era&quot; to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

Belloc held republican views, but became increasingly sympathetic to monarchism as he grew older. In his youth, he had initially been loyal to the French idea of republicanism, seeing it as a patriotic duty. Michael Hennessy, Chairman of the Hilaire Belloc Society, wrote that &quot;In some respects, Belloc remained a republican until his death, but increasingly realized that there were not enough republicans to make a republic function effectively. Belloc thus felt that monarchy was the most practicable, superior form of government.&quot; Belloc explores some of these ideas in his work &quot;Monarchy: A Study of Louis XIV&quot;. Within it, Belloc also wrote that democracy &quot;is possible only in small states, and even these must enjoy exceptional defences, moral or material, if they are to survive.&quot;

With these linked themes in the background, he wrote a long series of contentious biographies of historical figures, including Oliver Cromwell, James II, and Napoleon. They show him as an ardent proponent of orthodox Catholicism and a critic of many elements of the modern world.

Outside academe, Belloc was impatient with what he considered axe-grinding histories, especially what he called &quot;official history.&quot; Joseph Pearce notes also Belloc&#x27;s attack on the secularism of H. G. Wells&#x27;s popular &quot;Outline of History&quot;:

Belloc objected to his adversary&#x27;s tacitly anti-Christian stance, epitomized by the fact that Wells had devoted more space in his &quot;history&quot; to the Persian campaign against the Greeks than he had given to the figure of Christ.

He wrote also substantial amounts of military history. He also contributed to the 1931 alternative history collection &quot;If It Had Happened Otherwise&quot; edited by Sir John Squire.

==Religion==
One of Belloc&#x27;s more famous statements was &quot;the faith is Europe and Europe is the faith&quot;; those views were expressed in many of his works from the period 1920 to 1940. These are still cited as exemplary of Catholic apologetics. They have also been criticised, for instance by comparison with the work of Christopher Dawson during the same period.

As a young man, Belloc moved away from Catholicism. However, he later stated that a spiritual event, which he never discussed publicly, prompted his return to it. Belloc alludes to this return to Catholicism in a passage in &quot;The Cruise of the Nona&quot;.

According to his biographer A. N. Wilson (&quot;Hilaire Belloc&quot;, Hamish Hamilton), Belloc never wholly apostatised from the faith (ibid p. 105). The momentous event is fully described by Belloc in &quot;The Path to Rome&quot; (pp. 158–61). It took place in the French village of Undervelier at the time of Vespers. Belloc said of it, &quot;not without tears&quot;, &quot;I considered the nature of Belief&quot; and &quot;it is a good thing not to have to return to the Faith&quot;. (See &quot;Hilaire Belloc&quot; by Wilson at pp. 105–06.) Belloc believed that the Catholic Church provided hearth and home for the human spirit. More humorously, his tribute to Catholic culture can be understood from his well-known saying, &quot;Wherever the Catholic sun does shine, there&#x27;s always laughter and good red wine.&quot;

Belloc had a disparaging view of the Church of England, and used sharp words to describe heretics, such as, &quot;Heretics all, whoever you may be/ In Tarbes or Nîmes or over the sea/ You never shall have good words from me/ Caritas non-conturbat me&quot;. Indeed, in his &quot;Song of the Pelagian Heresy&quot; he described how the Bishop of Auxerre, &quot;with his stout Episcopal staff/ So thoroughly thwacked and banged/ The heretics all, both short and tall/ They rather had been hanged&quot;.

Belloc sent his son Louis to Downside School (1911–1915). Louis&#x27;s biography and death in August 1918 is recorded in &quot;Downside and the War&quot;.

===On Islam===
Belloc&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;The Crusades: the World&#x27;s Debate&quot;, he wrote 

In &quot;The Great Heresies&quot; (1938), Belloc argued that although &quot;Muslim culture happens to have fallen back in material applications; there is no reason whatever why it should not learn its new lesson and become our equal in all those temporal things which now &quot;alone&quot; give us our superiority over it—whereas in &quot;Faith&quot; we have fallen inferior to it.&quot;

Belloc continued:

Belloc considered that Islam was permanently intent on destroying the Christian faith, as well as the West, which Christendom had built. In &quot;The Great Heresies&quot;, Belloc grouped the Protestant Reformation together with Islam as one of the major heresies threatening the &quot;Universal Church&quot;.

===Accusations of antisemitism===
Belloc&#x27;s writings were at times supportive of anti-Semitism and other times condemnatory of it.

Belloc took a leading role in denouncing the Marconi scandal of 1912. Belloc emphasized that key players in both the government and the Marconi corporation had been Jewish. American historian Todd Endelman identifies Catholic writers as central critics. In his opinion:The most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by Hilaire Belloc and the brothers Cecil and G. K. Chesterton, whose hostility to Jews was linked to their opposition to liberalism, their backward-looking Catholicism, and the nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous. The Jew baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and their challenges to what were seen as traditional English values.A. N. Wilson&#x27;s biography expresses the belief that Belloc tended to allude to Jews negatively in conversation, sometimes obsessively. Anthony Powell mentions in his review of that biography that in his view Belloc was thoroughly anti-Semitic, at all but a personal level.

In &quot;The Cruise of the Nona&quot;, Belloc reflected equivocally on the Dreyfus Affair after thirty years. Norman Rose&#x27;s book &quot;The Cliveden Set&quot; (2000) asserts that Belloc &#x27;was moved by a deep vein of hysterical anti-semitism&#x27;.In his 1922 book, &quot;The Jews&quot;, Belloc argued that &quot;the continued presence of the Jewish nation intermixed with other nations alien to it presents a permanent problem of the gravest character&quot;, and that the &quot;Catholic Church is the conservator of an age-long European tradition, and that tradition will never compromise with the fiction that a Jew can be other than a Jew. Wherever the Catholic Church has power, and in proportion to its power, the Jewish problem will be recognized to the full.&quot;Robert Speaight cited a letter by Belloc in which he condemned Nesta Webster because of her accusations against &quot;the Jews&quot;. In February 1924, Belloc wrote to an American Jewish friend regarding an anti-Semitic book by Webster. Webster had rejected Christianity, studied Eastern religions, accepted the supposed Hindu concept of the equality of all religions and was fascinated by theories of reincarnation and ancestral memory. Speaight also points out that when faced with anti-Semitism in practice—as at elitist country clubs in the United States before World War II—he voiced his disapproval. Belloc also condemned Nazi anti-Semitism in &quot;The Catholic and the War&quot; (1940).

==Sussex==
Belloc grew up in Slindon and spent most of his life in the part of Sussex that is now West Sussex. He always wrote of Sussex as if it were the crown of England and the western Sussex Downs the jewel in that crown. He loved Sussex as the place where he was brought up, considering it his earthly &quot;spiritual home&quot;.

Belloc wrote several works about Sussex including &quot;Ha&#x27;nacker Mill&quot;, &quot;The South Country&quot;, the travel guide &quot;Sussex&quot; (1906) and &quot;The County of Sussex&quot; (1936). One of his best-known works relating to Sussex is &quot;The Four Men: A Farrago&quot; (1911), in which the four characters, each aspects of Belloc&#x27;s personality, travel on a pilgrimage across the county from Robertsbridge to Harting. The work has influenced others including musician Bob Copper, who retraced Belloc&#x27;s steps in the 1980s.

Belloc was also a lover of Sussex songs and wrote lyrics for some songs which have since been put to music. Belloc is remembered in an annual celebration in Sussex, known as Belloc Night, that takes place on the writer&#x27;s birthday, 27 July, in the manner of Burns Night in Scotland. The celebration includes reading from Belloc&#x27;s work and partaking of a bread and cheese supper with pickles.

<text>The Seattle Center is an entertainment, education, tourism and performing arts center located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. Constructed for the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair, the Seattle Center&#x27;s landmark feature is the Space Needle, an official city landmark and globally recognized symbol of Seattle&#x27;s skyline. Other notable attractions include Pacific Science Center, Climate Pledge Arena, and the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP), as well as McCaw Hall, which hosts both Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet. The Seattle Center Monorail provides regular public transit service between the Seattle Center and Westlake Center in downtown Seattle, and is itself considered a tourist attraction.

== History ==

=== Background ===

In 1886, Seattle founder David Denny donated the tract of land that would eventually host the Seattle Center, stipulating that it be of &quot;public use forever&quot;.

Plans for the land took shape in 1928, when mayor Bertha Knight Landes dedicated the newly-constructed arena and auditorium on the site as the Civic Center complex.

The Seattle Field Artillery Armory was constructed in 1939.

=== World&#x27;s Fair ===
In 1958, the Civic Auditorium was chosen as the future location of the World&#x27;s Fair, and demolition work began following a countdown ceremony initiated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In 1961, Japanese architects Hideki Shimizu and Kazuyuki Matsushita were chosen to design the International Fountain, and a contract with Alweg Rapid Transit Systems was signed for the construction of the monorail line. On April 21, 1962, President John F. Kennedy officially opened the World&#x27;s Fair; the six-month event was attended by, among others, astronaut John Glenn, politician Robert F. Kennedy, and singer Elvis Presley, who arrived in September 1962 to shoot the film &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;.

=== Later history ===
On June 1, 1963, ownership of the complex was returned to the City of Seattle, which has since maintained it as a hub for the city&#x27;s performing arts and sporting events. Some of the facilities were leased to the Century 21 Center, a nonprofit corporation formed in 1962 to promote the Seattle Center complex. In December 1964, City of Seattle announced its intent to take over management of the Century 21 Center from the corporation after it had incurred $300,000 in debts. The corporation was dissolved in 1965 and promotion of the Seattle Center was transferred to Greater Seattle, Inc., the region&#x27;s tourism organization.

As of 1965, the Seattle Center Armory remained under the ownership of the Washington State Military Department but was leased to the city government for use as an events and museum space. 

The Seattle Center campus underwent a decline in attendance and importance after the World&#x27;s Fair, which led to proposal to redevelop it for other uses. The Seattle city government contracted Walt Disney Imagineering in 1987 to design a long-term campus plan; the Disney proposal included replacement of the International Fountain with a pond and Memorial Stadium with a parking garage topped by an artificial meadow. The proposals were rejected by the city government after public outcry at hearings.

==Attractions==

Several buildings and pieces of artwork at the Seattle Center have Japanese influences. These include the Pacific Science Center, designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, the &quot;Seattle Mural&quot; by artist Paul Horiuchi, and the Kobe Bell, a gift to Seattle from its sister city of Kobe, Japan.

=== Landmarks ===

*The Space Needle, an official city landmark, featuring an observation deck and formerly a revolving restaurant. At the time of its completion in 1961, the Space Needle was the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.
*International Fountain, located in the center of the complex. Designed by Japanese architects Kazuyuki Matsushita and Hideki Shimizu, the fountain was built as a modernist water sculpture and renovated extensively in 1995. With over 20 spouts, the fountain rotates through programmed cycles of water patterns, accompanied by recorded music from around the world. The music is changed twice a month; it is chosen to complement the water patterns and events programming at the center.

<text>Christopher Michael Benoit ( ; May 21, 1967 – June 24, 2007) was a Canadian professional wrestler. He worked for various pro-wrestling promotions during his 22-year career, but is notorious for murdering his wife and youngest son.

Bearing the nicknames The (Canadian) Crippler alongside The Rabid Wolverine throughout his career, Benoit held 30 championships between
World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW – all United States), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW – Japan), and Stampede Wrestling (Canada). He was a two-time world champion, Benoit having reigned as a one-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion and a one-time World Heavyweight Champion in WWE; he was booked to win a third world championship at a WWE event on the . Benoit was the twelfth WWE Triple Crown Champion and the seventh WCW Triple Crown Champion, and the second of four men in history to achieve both the WWE and the WCW Triple Crown Championships. He was also the 2004 Royal Rumble winner, joining Shawn Michaels and preceding Edge as one of the three men to win a Royal Rumble as the number one entrant. Benoit headlined multiple pay-per-views for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) including a victory in the World Heavyweight Championship main event triple threat match of WrestleMania XX in March 2004.

In a three-day double-murder and suicide, Benoit murdered his wife in their residence on June 22, 2007, and his 7-year-old son the next day, before killing himself on June 24. The incident profoundly shocked and changed the professional wrestling industry and drew intense mainstream media criticism regarding brain injuries, substance abuse, and the long-term health of athletes in contact sports. Subsequent research undertaken by the Sports Legacy Institute (now the Concussion Legacy Foundation) suggested that depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition of brain damage, from multiple concussions that Benoit had sustained throughout his pro-wrestling career were likely contributing factors of the crimes.

Due to his murders, Benoit&#x27;s legacy in the professional wrestling industry is heavily debated. Benoit has been renowned by many for his exceptional technical wrestling ability. Prominent combat sports journalist Dave Meltzer considers Benoit &quot;one of the top 10, maybe even [in] the top five, all-time greats&quot; in professional wrestling history. Benoit was inducted into the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2003. His WON induction was put to a re-vote in 2008 to determine if Benoit should remain a member of their Hall of Fame. The threshold percentage of votes required to remove Benoit was not met.

== Early life ==
Benoit was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Michael and Margaret Benoit. He grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, from where he was billed throughout the bulk of his career. He had a sister who lived near Edmonton.

During his childhood and early adolescence in Edmonton, Benoit idolized Tom &quot;Dynamite Kid&quot; Billington and Bret Hart; at twelve years old, he attended a local wrestling event at which the two performers &quot;stood out above everyone else&quot;. Benoit trained to become a professional wrestler in the Hart family &quot;Dungeon&quot;, receiving education from family patriarch Stu Hart. In-ring, Benoit emulated both Billington and Bret Hart, cultivating a high-risk style and physical appearance more reminiscent of the former (years later, he adopted Hart&#x27;s own &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; hold as a finishing move).

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Stampede Wrestling (1985–1989) ===
Benoit began his career in 1985, in Stu Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling promotion. From the beginning, similarities between Benoit and Billington were apparent, as Benoit adopted many of his moves such as the diving headbutt and the snap suplex; the homage was complete with his initial billing as &quot;Dynamite&quot; Chris Benoit. According to Benoit, in his first match, he attempted the diving headbutt before learning how to land correctly, and had the wind knocked out of him; he said he would never do the move again at that point. His debut match was a tag team match on November 22, 1985, in Calgary, Alberta, where he teamed with &quot;The Remarkable&quot; Rick Patterson against Butch Moffat and Mike Hammer, which Benoit&#x27;s team won the match after Benoit pinned Moffat with a sunset flip. The first title Benoit ever won was the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship on March 18, 1988, against Gama Singh. During his tenure in Stampede, he won four International Tag Team and three more British Commonwealth titles, and had a lengthy feud with Johnny Smith that lasted for over a year, which both men traded back-and-forth the British Commonwealth title. In 1989, Stampede closed its doors, and with a recommendation from Bad News Allen, Benoit departed for New Japan Pro-Wrestling.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1986–1999) ===
Upon arriving to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Benoit spent about a year training in their &quot;New Japan Dojo&quot; with the younger wrestlers to improve his abilities. While in the dojo, he spent months doing strenuous activities like push-ups and floor sweeping before stepping into the ring. He made his Japanese debut in 1986 under his real name. In 1989, he started wearing a mask and assuming the name The Pegasus Kid. Benoit said numerous times that he originally hated the mask, but it eventually became a part of him. While with NJPW, he came into his own as a performer in critically acclaimed matches with luminaries like Jushin Thunder Liger, Shinjiro Otani, Black Tiger, and El Samurai in their junior heavyweight division.

In August 1990, he won his first major championship, the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, from Jushin Thunder Liger. He eventually lost the title in November 1990 (and in July 1991 in Japan and in November 1991 in Mexico, his mask) back to Liger, forcing him to reinvent himself as Wild Pegasus. Benoit spent the next couple years in Japan, winning the Best of the Super Juniors tournament twice in 1993 and 1995. He went on to win the inaugural Super J-Cup tournament in 1994, defeating Black Tiger, Gedo, and The Great Sasuke in the finals. He wrestled outside New Japan occasionally to compete in Mexico and Europe, where he won a few regional championships, including the UWA Light Heavyweight Championship. He held that title for over a year, having many forty-plus minute matches with Villano III.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992–1993) ===
Benoit first came to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in June 1992, teaming up with fellow Canadian wrestler Biff Wellington for the NWA World Tag Team Championship tournament; they were defeated by Brian Pillman and Jushin Thunder Liger in the first round at Clash of the Champions XIX.

He did not return to WCW until January 1993 at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXII&quot;, defeating Brad Armstrong. A month later, at SuperBrawl III, he lost to 2 Cold Scorpio, getting pinned with only three seconds left in the 20-minute time limit. At the same time, he formed a tag team with Bobby Eaton. After he and Eaton lost to Scorpio and Marcus Bagwell at Slamboree, Benoit headed back to Japan.

=== Various promotions (1993–1994) ===
After WCW, Benoit worked in Australia, and CMLL in Mexico. In early 1994, he worked for NWA New Jersey where he defeated Jerry Lawler. A month later he fought Terry Funk to a double count out.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994–1995) ===
In August 1994, Benoit began working with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in between tours of Japan. He was booked as a dominant wrestler there, gaining notoriety as the &quot;Crippler&quot; after he put Rocco Rock out. In his first appearance, Benoit competed in a one-night eight-man tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, losing to 2 Cold Scorpio in the quarter-finals match.

At November to Remember, Benoit accidentally broke Sabu&#x27;s neck within the opening seconds of the match. The injury came when Benoit threw Sabu with the intention that he take a face-first &quot;pancake&quot; bump, but Sabu attempted to turn mid-air and take a backdrop bump instead. He did not achieve full rotation and landed almost directly on his neck.

After this match Benoit returned to the locker room and broke down over the possibility that he might have paralysed someone. Paul Heyman, the head booker of ECW at the time, came up with the idea of continuing the &quot;Crippler&quot; moniker for Benoit. From that point until his departure from ECW, he was known as &quot;Crippler Benoit&quot;. When he returned to WCW in October 1995, WCW modified his ring name to &quot;Canadian Crippler Chris Benoit&quot;. In &quot;The Rise and Fall of ECW&quot; book, Heyman commented that he planned on using Benoit as a dominant heel for quite some time, before putting the company&#x27;s main title, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, on him to be the long-term champion of the company.

Benoit and Dean Malenko won the ECW World Tag Team ChampionshipBenoit&#x27;s first American titlefrom Sabu and The Tazmaniac in February 1995 at Return of the Funker. After winning, they were initiated into the Triple Threat stable, led by ECW World Heavyweight Champion, Shane Douglas, as Douglas&#x27;s attempt to recreate the Four Horsemen, as the three-man contingency held all three of the ECW championships at the time (Malenko also held the ECW World Television Championship at the time). The team lost the championship to The Public Enemy that April at Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with The Steiner Brothers and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed to make it on time, so Benoit left ECW in August 1995 as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States. He toured Japan until WCW called.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1995) ===
In June 1995, while under contract with ECW, Benoit worked in three dark matches losing to Bob Holly, Adam Bomb and Owen Hart.

=== Return to WCW (1995–2000) ===
==== The Four Horsemen (1995–1999) ====
New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) had a working relationship, and because of their &quot;talent exchange&quot; program, Benoit signed with WCW in late 1995 along with a number of talent working in New Japan to be a part of the angle. Like the majority of those who came to WCW in the exchange, he started out in as a member of the cruiserweight division, having lengthy matches against many of his former rivals in Japan on almost every single broadcast. At the end of 1995, Benoit went back to Japan as a part of the &quot;talent exchange&quot; to wrestle as a representative for New Japan in the Super J-Cup: 2nd Stage, defeating Lionheart in the quarterfinals (he received a bye to the quarterfinals for his work in 1995, similar to the way he advanced in the 1994 edition) and losing to Gedo in the semifinals.
After impressing higher-ups with his work, he was approached by Ric Flair and the WCW booking staff to become a member of the reformed Four Horsemen in 1995, alongside Flair, Arn Anderson, and Brian Pillman; he was introduced by Pillman as a gruff, no-nonsense heel similar to his ECW persona, &quot;The Crippler&quot;. He was brought in to add a new dynamic for Anderson and Flair&#x27;s tormenting of Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage in their &quot;Alliance to End Hulkamania&quot;, which saw the Horsemen team up with The Dungeon of Doom, but that alliance ended with Dungeon leader and WCW booker, Kevin Sullivan feuding with Pillman. When Pillman abruptly left the company for the WWF, Benoit was placed into his ongoing feud with Sullivan. This came to fruition through a dissension between the two in a tag team match with the two reluctantly teaming with each other against The Public Enemy, and Benoit being attacked by Sullivan at Slamboree. This led to the two having violent confrontations at pay-per-views, which led to Sullivan booking a feud in which Benoit was having an affair with Sullivan&#x27;s real-life wife and onscreen valet, Nancy (also known as Woman). Benoit and Nancy were forced to spend time together to make the affair look real, (hold hands in public, share hotel rooms, etc.).

This onscreen relationship developed into a real-life affair offscreen. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best, and an undying hatred for each other at worst. Benoit did, however, admit having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD &quot;Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story&quot; that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. This continued for over the course of a year with Sullivan having his enforcers apprehend Benoit in a multitude of matches. This culminated in a retirement match at the Bash at the Beach, where Benoit defeated Sullivan; this was used to explain Sullivan going to a behind-the-scenes role, where he could focus on his initial job of booking.
In 1998, Benoit had a long feud with Booker T. They fought over the WCW World Television Championship until Booker lost the title to Fit Finlay. Booker won a &quot;Best-of-Seven&quot; series which was held between the two to determine a number one contender. Benoit went up 3 to 1 before Booker caught up, forcing the 7th and final match on &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;. During the match, Bret Hart interjected himself, interfering on behalf of Benoit in an attempt to get him to join the New World Order. Benoit refused to win that way and told the referee what happened, getting himself disqualified. Booker refused that victory, instead opting for an eighth match at the Great American Bash to see who would fight Finlay later that night. Booker won the final match and went on to beat Finlay for the title. This feud significantly elevated both men&#x27;s careers as singles competitors, and both remained at the top of the midcard afterward.

In 1999, Benoit teamed with Dean Malenko once again and defeated Curt Hennig and Barry Windham to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. This led to a reformation of the Four Horsemen with the tag team champions, Anderson, and Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael. The two hunted after the tag team championship for several months, feuding with teams like Raven and Perry Saturn or Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio Jr.

==== The Revolution and World Heavyweight Champion (1999–2000) ====
After a falling out with Anderson and McMichael, Benoit and Malenko left the Horsemen; he won the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship before bringing together Malenko, Perry Saturn, and Shane Douglas to form &quot;the Revolution&quot;.

The Revolution was a heel stable of younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never gave them the chance to be stars, pushing older, more established wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable worthiness of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit&#x27;s heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match. In October 1999 on &quot;Nitro&quot; in Kansas City, Missouri, Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to Bret&#x27;s brother Owen Hart, who had recently died due to an equipment malfunction. Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, Harley Race.

Benoit was unhappy working for WCW. One last attempt in January 2000 was made to try to keep him with WCW, by putting the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship on him by defeating Sid Vicious at Souled Out. However, due to disagreements with management and to protest the promotion of Kevin Sullivan to head booker, Benoit left WCW the next day alongside his friends Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn, forfeiting his title in the process. WCW then refused to acknowledge Benoit&#x27;s victory as an official title reign, and Benoit&#x27;s title reign was not listed in the title lineage at WCW.com. However, the WWF recognized Benoit&#x27;s title win, and Benoit&#x27;s title reign is still listed in the title lineage at WWE.com. Benoit spent the next few weeks in Japan before heading to the WWF, who acknowledged his WCW World Heavyweight Championship win and presented him as a former world champion.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2000–2007) ===
==== The Radicalz (2000–2001) ====
Benoit joined the World Wrestling Federation near the end of its Attitude Era. Along with Guerrero, Saturn and Malenko, he debuted in the WWF as a stable that became known as the Radicalz. After losing their &quot;tryout matches&quot; upon entry, The Radicalz aligned themselves with WWF Champion Triple H and became a heel faction. Benoit quickly won his first title in the WWF just over a month later at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, pinning Chris Jericho in a triple threat match to win Kurt Angle&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship. It was also in this time period that Benoit wrestled in his first WWF pay-per-view main events, challenging The Rock for the WWF Championship at Fully Loaded on July 23 and as part of a fatal four-way title match at Unforgiven on September 24. On both occasions Benoit appeared to have won the title, only to have the decision reversed by then-WWF commissioner Mick Foley due to cheating on Benoit&#x27;s part. Benoit simultaneously entered into a long-running feud with Jericho for the Intercontinental title, with the two meeting at Backlash on April 30, Judgment Day on May 21 and SummerSlam on August 27; Benoit winning all three matches. The feud finally culminated in Jericho defeating Benoit in a ladder match at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001. Benoit won the Intercontinental title three times between April 2000 and January 2001.

In early 2001, Benoit broke away from The Radicalz (who had recently reformed three months earlier) and turned face, feuding first with his former stablemates and then with Kurt Angle, whom he wrestled and lost to at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1. He gained some amount of revenge after beating Angle in an &quot;Ultimate Submission&quot; match at Backlash on April 29. The feud continued after Benoit stole Angle&#x27;s cherished Olympic Gold Medal. This culminated in a match at Judgment Day on May 20 where Angle won a two out of three falls match with the help of Edge and Christian. In response, Benoit teamed up with his former rival Jericho to defeat Edge and Christian in that night&#x27;s Tag Team Turmoil match to become the number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship.

The next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Benoit and Jericho defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the May 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Benoit suffered a legitimate neck injury in a four-way TLC match. Benoit challenged Austin for the WWF Championship on two occasions, first losing in a manner similar to the Montreal Screwjob in Calgary on the May 28 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; and then losing in a close match in Benoit&#x27;s hometown of Edmonton on the May 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Despite the neck injury, he continued to wrestle until the King of the Ring on June 24, where he was pinned by Austin in a triple threat match for the WWF Championship also involving Jericho. Benoit missed the next year due to his neck injury, missing the entire Invasion storyline.

==== Championship pursuits and reigns (2002–2003) ====

During the first WWF draft, he was the third wrestler picked by Vince McMahon to be part of the new SmackDown! roster, although still on the injured list. However, when he returned, he did so as a member of the Raw roster. On his first night back, he turned heel by aligning himself with Eddie Guerrero, and he feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin briefly. Benoit defeated Rob Van Dam on the July 29, 2002, edition of &quot;Raw&quot; to become Intercontinental Champion for the fourth and final time. He and Guerrero were then moved to SmackDown! during a storyline &quot;open season&quot; on wrestler contracts, with Benoit taking the Intercontinental Championship to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Van Dam defeated Benoit at SummerSlam on August 25 and returned the title to &quot;Raw&quot;.

After returning to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he embarked on a feud with Kurt Angle in which he defeated him at Unforgiven on September 22. On October 20, 2002, at No Mercy, he teamed with Angle to win a tournament to crown the first-ever WWE Tag Team Champions. They became tweeners after betraying Los Guerreros. At Rebellion, Benoit and Angle made their successful title defence, defeating Los Guerreros. They lost the championships to Edge and Rey Mysterio on the November 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a two-out-of-three falls match. They received a rematch at Survivor Series on November 17 in a triple threat elimination match against Edge and Mysterio and Los Guerreros, but failed to win the titles after being the first team eliminated. The team split up shortly afterward and Benoit became a face.

Angle won his third WWE Championship from Big Show at Armageddon on December 15, and Benoit faced him for the title at the Royal Rumble on January 19, 2003. The match was highly praised from fans and critics. Although Benoit lost the match, he received a standing ovation for his efforts. Benoit returned to the tag team ranks, teaming with the returning Rhyno.

At WrestleMania XIX on March 30, the WWE Tag Team Champions, Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin), put their titles on the line against Benoit and his partner Rhyno and Los Guerreros in a triple threat tag team match. Team Angle retained when Benjamin pinned Chavo.

In April 2003, following WrestleMania, Benoit then feuded with John Cena (wearing a shirt saying &quot;Toothless Aggression&quot;) and The Full Blooded Italians, teaming with Rhyno occasionally.

In June 2003, the WCW United States Championship was reactivated and renamed the WWE United States Championship, and Benoit participated in the tournament for the title. He lost in the final match to Eddie Guerrero at Vengeance on July 27. The two feuded over the title for the next month, and Benoit went on to defeat the likes of A-Train at No Mercy on October 19, Big Show, and eliminating Brock Lesnar by submission at Survivor Series on November 16 as part of a Survivor Series elimination tag team match between Team Angle against Team Lesnar. As a result, Benoit challenged Lesnar for the WWE Championship on the December 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but lost after passing out to Lesnar&#x27;s debuting &quot;Brock Lock&quot; submission hold. SmackDown! General Manager Paul Heyman had a vendetta against Benoit along with Lesnar, preventing him from gaining a shot at Lesnar&#x27;s WWE Championship.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2004–2005) ====
When Benoit won a qualifying match for the 2004 Royal Rumble against the Full Blooded Italians in a handicap match with John Cena, Heyman named him as the number one entry. On January 25, 2004, he won the Royal Rumble by last eliminating Big Show, and thus earned a world title shot at WrestleMania XX on March 14. He became only the second WWE performer to win the Royal Rumble as the number one entrant along with Shawn Michaels. With Benoit being on the SmackDown! brand at the time, it was assumed that he was going to compete for his brand&#x27;s championship, the WWE Championship. However, Benoit exploited a &quot;loophole&quot; in the rules and moved to the Raw brand the following night to announce he would instead challenge World Heavyweight Champion Triple H at WrestleMania. Though the match was originally intended to be a one-on-one match, Shawn Michaels, whose Last Man Standing match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight Championship ended in a draw, thought that he deserved to be in the main event. When it was time for Benoit to sign the contract putting himself in the main event, Michaels superkicked him and signed his name on the contract, which eventually resulted in a Triple Threat match between Michaels, Benoit, and the champion, Triple H.
At WrestleMania, Benoit won the World Heavyweight Championship by forcing Triple H to tap out to his signature submission move, the Crippler Crossface, in a highly acclaimed match. The match marked the first time the main event of a WrestleMania ended in submission. After the match, Benoit celebrated his win with then-reigning WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero. The rematch was held at Backlash on April 18 in Benoit&#x27;s hometown of Edmonton. It was Michaels who ended up submitting to Benoit&#x27;s Sharpshooter, allowing Benoit to retain his title. The next night in Calgary on the April 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he and Edge won the World Tag Team Championship from Batista and Ric Flair, making Benoit a double champion.

Following his victories, Benoit and Edge engaged in a rivalry with La Résistance for the World Tag Team Championship, which saw a series of matches (including losing the titles to La Résistance on the May 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;), while simultaneously having confrontations with Kane over the World Heavyweight Championship. Benoit wrestled in two matches at Bad Blood on June 13 in his respective rivalries; he and Edge failed to regain the World Tag Team Championship (winning by disqualification when Kane interfered) while he successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Kane. A month later at Vengeance on July 11, Benoit retained the title against Triple H.

At SummerSlam on August 15, Benoit lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Randy Orton. Benoit then teamed with William Regal at Unforgiven on September 12 against Ric Flair and Batista in a winning effort. Benoit then feuded with Edge (who had turned into an arrogant and conceited heel), leading to Taboo Tuesday on October 19 where Benoit, Edge, and Shawn Michaels were all put into a poll to see who would face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship that night. Michaels received the most votes and as a result, Edge and Benoit were forced to team up to face the World Tag Team Champions, La Résistance, in the same night. However, Edge deserted Benoit during the match and Benoit was forced to take on both members of La Résistance by himself. He and Edge still managed to regain the World Tag Team Championship. They lost the titles back to La Résistance on the November 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Survivor Series on November 14, Benoit sided with Randy Orton&#x27;s team while Edge teamed with Triple H&#x27;s team, and while Edge was able to pin Benoit after a Pedigree from Triple H, Orton&#x27;s team won.

The Benoit-Edge feud ended at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, 2005 in an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which both men lost. The feud stopped abruptly, as Edge feuded with Shawn Michaels, and Benoit entered the Royal Rumble as the second entrant on January 30, lasting longer than any competitor before being eliminated by Ric Flair. The two then continued to have matches in the following weeks until the two of them, Chris Jericho, Shelton Benjamin, Kane, and Christian were placed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 21 on April 3. Edge won the match by knocking Benoit off of the ladder by smashing his arm with a chair. The feud finally culminated in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash on May 1, which Edge won with a brick shot to the back of Benoit&#x27;s head.

==== United States Champion (2005–2007) ====
On June 9, Benoit was drafted to the SmackDown! brand after being the first man selected by &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in the 2005 Draft Lottery and participated in an ECW-style revolution against the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; heels. Benoit appeared at ECW One Night Stand on June 12, defeating Eddie Guerrero.
On July 24 at The Great American Bash, Benoit failed to win the WWE United States Championship from Orlando Jordan, but won a rematch at SummerSlam on August 21 in 25 seconds. Benoit then won three consecutive matches against Jordan in less than a minute. Benoit later wrestled Booker T in friendly competitions, until Booker T and his wife, Sharmell, cheated Benoit out of the United States title on the October 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

On November 13, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room. The following night, &quot;Raw&quot; held a Guerrero tribute show hosted by both Raw and SmackDown! wrestlers. Benoit was devastated at Guerrero&#x27;s death and was very emotional during a series of video testimonials, eventually breaking down on camera. The same week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; (taped on the same night as &quot;Raw&quot;), Benoit defeated Triple H in a tribute match to Guerrero. Following the contest, Benoit, Triple H, and Dean Malenko all assembled in the ring and pointed to the sky in salute of Guerrero.

After controversy surrounding a United States Championship match against Booker T on the November 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Theodore Long set up a &quot;Best of Seven&quot; series between the two. Booker T won three times in a row (at Survivor Series on November 27, the November 29 &quot;SmackDown! Special&quot;, and the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;), due largely to Sharmell&#x27;s interference, and Benoit faced elimination in the series. Benoit won the fourth match to stay alive at Armageddon on December 18, but after the match, Booker T suffered a legitimate groin injury, and Randy Orton was chosen as a stand-in. Benoit defeated Orton twice by disqualification on the December 30 and January 6, 2006, episodes of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. However, in the seventh and final match, Orton defeated Benoit with the help of Booker T, Sharmell, and Orlando Jordan, and Booker T captured the United States Championship. Benoit feuded with Orton for a short time, before defeating Orton in a No Holds Barred match on the January 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; via the Crippler Crossface. Benoit was given one last chance at the United States Championship at No Way Out on February 19 and won it by making Booker T submit to the Crippler Crossface, ending the feud.

The next week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Benoit (kayfabe) broke John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL)&#x27;s hand (JBL actually needed surgery to remove a cyst). A match was set up for the two at WrestleMania 22 on April 2 for Benoit&#x27;s title, and for the next several weeks, they attacked each other. At WrestleMania, JBL won the match with an illegal cradle to win the title. Benoit used his rematch clause two weeks later in a steel cage match on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but JBL again won with illegal tactics. Benoit entered the King of the Ring tournament, only to be defeated by Finlay in the opening round on the May 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after Finlay struck Benoit&#x27;s neck with a chair and delivered a Celtic Cross. At Judgment Day on May 21, Benoit gained some revenge by defeating Finlay with the Crippler Crossface in a grudge match. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mark Henry brutalized Benoit during their match, giving him (kayfabe) back and rib injuries and causing him to bleed from his mouth. Benoit then took a sabbatical to heal nagging shoulder injuries.

On October 8, Benoit made his return at No Mercy, defeating William Regal in a surprise match. Later that week, he won his fifth and final United States Championship from Mr. Kennedy. Benoit then engaged in a feud with Chavo and Vickie Guerrero. He wanted answers from the Guerreros for their rash behaviour towards Rey Mysterio, but was avoided by the two and was eventually assaulted. This led to the two embarking on a feud with title matches at Survivor Series on November 26 and Armageddon on December 17; Benoit won both matches. The feud culminated with one last title match as a No disqualification match on the January 19, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which was also won by Benoit. Later, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), who claimed that he was the best man to hold the United States title, challenged Benoit for the title at WrestleMania 23 on April 1, where Benoit retained. Their rivalry continued with Benoit defeating MVP again at Backlash on April 29. At Judgment Day on May 20, however, MVP gained the upper hand and defeated Benoit to win the title in a two out of three falls match, thus ending the feud. Benoit would wrestle MVP one last time on the June 2 episode &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, in a winning effort in a tag-team match where Benoit partnered with Batista and MVP partnered with then-World Heavyweight Champion Edge.

==== ECW (2007) ====
On the June 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benoit was drafted from SmackDown! to ECW as part of the 2007 WWE draft after losing to ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley. In his debut on the ECW brand, Benoit teamed up with CM Punk in a tag team match against Elijah Burke and Marcus Cor Von, in which Benoit and Punk won. On the June 19 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Benoit wrestled his final match, defeating Elijah Burke in a match to determine who would compete for the vacated ECW World Championship at on June 24. Since Lashley was drafted to Raw, he had vacated the title.

Benoit missed the weekend house shows, telling WWE officials that his wife and son were vomiting blood due to food poisoning. When he failed to show up for Vengeance, viewers were informed that he was unable to compete due to a &quot;family emergency&quot; and he was replaced in the title match by Johnny Nitro, who defeated Punk to become ECW World Champion. The crowd spent the majority of the match chanting for Benoit. It would be revealed in the following days that Benoit had murdered his wife Nancy and son Daniel before committing suicide.

WWE executive Stephanie McMahon later indicated that Benoit would have defeated CM Punk for the ECW World Championship had he been present for Vengeance. Professional wrestler and MMA fighter Bob Sapp, whom WWE had tried to sign up before a contract dispute with K-1 rendered it impossible, reported he would have been put into an oncoming angle with Benoit in case he would have been able to debut.

== Professional wrestling style ==
Benoit included a wide array of submission holds in his move-set and used a crossface, dubbed the &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot;, and a sharpshooter as finishers. He also used a diving headbutt to finish off opponents. The diving headbutt, which saw the deliverer leap off the top rope and land head first on the opponent, was partially blamed for the head trauma that caused Benoit to commit his crimes. Another of Benoit&#x27;s trademark moves was three rolling German suplexes. This move would later be mimicked by multiple other wrestlers, including Brock Lesnar who uses it as &quot;Suplex City&quot;.

Benoit was renowned for his high-impact technical style. Former WWE rival Kurt Angle said in a 2017 interview that &quot;he has to got to be in the top three of all time.&quot;

== Personal life==
Benoit spoke both English and French fluently. He married twice, and had two children (David and Megan) with his first wife, Martina. By 1997, that marriage had broken down, and Benoit was living with Nancy Sullivan, the wife of the WCW booker and frequent opponent Kevin Sullivan. On February 25, 2000, Chris and Nancy&#x27;s son Daniel was born; on November 23, 2000, Chris and Nancy married. It was Nancy&#x27;s third marriage. In 2003, Nancy filed for divorce from Benoit, citing the marriage as &quot;irrevocably broken&quot; and alleging &quot;cruel treatment&quot;. She claimed that he would break and throw furniture around. She later dropped the suit as well as the restraining order she had filed.

Benoit became good friends with fellow wrestler Eddie Guerrero following a match in Japan, when Benoit kicked Guerrero in the head and knocked him out cold.

Benoit was also close friends with Dean Malenko, as the trio travelled from promotion to promotion together putting on matches, eventually being dubbed the &quot;Three Amigos&quot; by commentators. According to Chris Benoit, the Crippler Crossface was borrowed from Malenko and eventually caught on as Chris Benoit&#x27;s finishing hold.

Benoit&#x27;s lost tooth, his top-right lateral incisor, was commonly misattributed to training or an accident early on in his wrestling career. It actually resulted from an accident involving his pet rottweiler: one day while playing with the dog, the animal&#x27;s skull struck Benoit&#x27;s chin, and his tooth &quot;popped out&quot;.

== Death ==

On June 25, 2007, police entered Benoit&#x27;s home in Fayetteville, Georgia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday/Benoit&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; when WWE, Benoit&#x27;s employers, requested a &quot;welfare check&quot; after Benoit missed weekend events without notice, leading to concerns. The officers discovered the bodies of Benoit, his wife Nancy, and their 7-year-old son Daniel at around 2:30 p.m. EDT. Upon investigating, no additional suspects were sought by authorities. It was determined that Benoit had committed the murders. Over a three-day period, Benoit had killed his wife and son before committing suicide. His wife was bound before the killing. Benoit&#x27;s son was drugged with Xanax and likely unconscious before Benoit strangled him. Benoit then committed suicide by hanging himself on his lat pulldown machine.

WWE cancelled the scheduled three-hour-long live &quot;Raw&quot; show on June 25 and replaced the broadcast version with a three-hour tribute to Benoit&#x27;s life and career, featuring his past matches, segments from the &quot;Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story&quot; DVD, and comments from wrestlers and announcers.

Toxicology reports released on July 17, 2007, revealed that at their time of death, Nancy had three different drugs in her system: Xanax, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, all of which were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels. Daniel was found to have Xanax in his system, which led the chief medical examiner to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered. Benoit was found to have Xanax, hydrocodone, and an elevated level of testosterone, caused by a synthetic form of the hormone, in his system. The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse or testicular insufficiency. There was no indication that anything in Benoit&#x27;s body contributed to his violent behaviour that led to the murder-suicide, concluding that there was no &quot;roid-rage&quot; involved. Prior to the murder-suicide, Benoit had illegally been given medications not in compliance with WWE&#x27;s Talent Wellness Program in February 2006, including nandrolone, an anabolic steroid, and anastrozole, a breast cancer medication which is used by bodybuilders for its powerful antiestrogenic effects. During the investigation into steroid abuse, it was revealed that other wrestlers had also been given steroids.

After the double-murder suicide, neuroscientist and retired professional wrestler Christopher Nowinski contacted Michael Benoit, Chris&#x27;s father, suggesting that years of trauma to his son&#x27;s brain may have led to his actions. Tests were conducted on Benoit&#x27;s brain by Julian Bailes, the head of neurosurgery at West Virginia University, and results showed that &quot;Benoit&#x27;s brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer&#x27;s patient.&quot; He was reported to have had an advanced form of dementia, similar to the brains of four retired NFL players who had multiple concussions, sank into depression, and harmed themselves or others. Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to dementia, which can contribute to severe behavioural problems. Benoit&#x27;s father suggests that brain damage may have been the leading cause.

Once the details of Benoit&#x27;s actions became apparent, WWE made the decision to remove nearly all mentions of Chris Benoit from their website, future broadcasts, and all publications.

<text>Constantine IV (also Constantine VI; , Western Armenian transliteration: &quot;Gosdantin&quot; or &quot;Kostantine&quot;; died 1373) was the King of Armenian Cilicia from 1362 until his death. He was the son of Hethum of Neghir, a nephew of Hethum I of Armenia. Constantine came to the throne on the death of his cousin Constantine III, whose widow, Maria, daughter of Oshin of Corycos, he married. 

Constantine formed an alliance with Peter I of Cyprus, offering him the port and castle of Corycus. On Peter&#x27;s death in 1369, Constantine looked for a treaty with the Sultan of Egypt. The barons were unhappy with this policy, fearing annexation by the sultan, and in 1373 Constantine was murdered. Upon his death he was succeeded by his distant cousin Leo V, one of the Poitiers-Lusignan dynasty, who would become the last king of Cilician Armenia.

<text>Yellow Matter Custard was a Beatles tribute supergroup consisting of Mike Portnoy, Neal Morse, Paul Gilbert and Matt Bissonette. Kasim Sulton played bass with the band in 2011, replacing Bissonette.

They take their name from a line in &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, by the Beatles: &quot;Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog&#x27;s eye&quot;.

Ty Tabor (King&#x27;s X) was originally approached to play guitar for the group, but was unable due to the King&#x27;s X touring schedule.

Conceived as more of a project than a band, they have only performed a total of five times: twice in 2003 (May 17 at Upper Montclair, New Jersey and May 18 at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club, New York), and three times in 2011. Due to scheduling conflicts, Matt Bissonette was unable to play with the band in 2011, and thus was replaced by Kasim Sulton.

<doc id="403299" wikidata="Q1048469" url="?curid=403299" title="Music of Scotland">
<text>Scotland is internationally known for its traditional music, often known as Scottish folk music, which remained vibrant throughout the 20th century and into the 21st when many traditional forms worldwide lost popularity to pop music. Traditional Scottish music comprises a variety of different styles such as ballads, reels, jigs, and airs. Traditional Scottish music is closely associated with the bagpipes which is credited as having a prominent role in traditional music originating from the country. The bagpipes are considered an &quot;iconic Scottish instrument&quot; with a history dating back to the 15th century. Other notable Scottish instruments include the tin whistle, the accordion and the fiddle.

The origins of Scottish music are said to have originated over 2,300 years ago following the discovery of Western Europe&#x27;s first known stringed instrument which was a &quot;lyre-like artifact&quot;, which was discovered on the Isle of Skye. The earliest known traces of published Scottish music dates from 1662. John Forbes of Aberdeen published the earliest printed collection of music in Scotland which ultimately became recognised as the first known published collection featuring traditional Scottish songs. Modern contemporary Scottish musicians within popular genres of rock, pop, and dance include Calvin Harris, Paolo Nutini, Amy Macdonald, Lewis Capaldi, Shirley Manson, Lulu, Sheena Easton, Susan Boyle, KT Tunstall, Emeli Sande, and Nina Nesbitt. Successful bands originating from Scotland include Travis, Texas, Simple Minds, the Bay City Rollers, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Fratellis, Glasvegas, and the Cocteau Twins. 

Music in Scotland is celebrated and recognised in a variety of different methods such as music festivals and award ceremonies. The countries major music festival, TRNSMT replaced the former T in the Park, and is held annually in July in Glasgow Green. Other music festivals include Celtic Connections, Eden Festival, Glasgow Summer Sessions, the Skye Live Festival, and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. Scottish music is celebrated through awards such as the Scottish Album of the Year Award, the Scots Trad Music Awards, the Scottish Alternative Music Awards, and the Scottish Music Awards.

==Early music==
Stringed instruments have been known in Scotland since at least the Iron Age. The first evidence of lyres was found in the Greco-Roman period on the Isle of Skye (dating from 2300 BCE), making it Europe&#x27;s oldest surviving stringed instrument. Bards acted as musicians but also as poets, storytellers, historians, genealogists, and lawyers, relying on an oral tradition that stretched back generations in Scotland as well as Wales and Ireland. Often accompanying themselves on the harp, they can be seen in records of Scottish courts throughout the medieval period. Scottish church music from the later Middle Ages was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like 13th-century musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris before returning to Scotland, where he introduced several reforms of church music. Scottish collections of music like the 13th-century &#x27;Wolfenbüttel 677&#x27;, which is associated with St Andrews, contain mostly French compositions but with some distinctive local styles. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to bring English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. In the late 15th century, a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety. The latter became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique.

In 1501, James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle with a new and enlarged choir and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII&#x27;s daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503. James V (1512–42) was a major patron of music. A talented lute player, he introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court and was patron to composers such as David Peebles (c. 1510–1579?).

The Scottish Reformation, directly influenced by Calvinism, was generally opposed to church music, leading to the removal of organs and a growing emphasis on metrical psalms, including a setting by David Peebles commissioned by James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. The most important work in Scottish reformed music was probably &quot;A Form of Prayers,&quot; published in Edinburgh in 1564. The return in 1561 from France of James V&#x27;s daughter Mary, Queen of Scots renewed the Scottish court as a centre of musical patronage and performance. The Queen played the lute and virginals and, unlike her father, was a fine singer. She brought many influences from the French court where she had been educated, employing lutenists and viola players in her household. Mary&#x27;s position as a Catholic gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal in her reign, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors.

The outstanding Scottish composer of the era was Robert Carver (c. 1485–c. 1570) whose works included the nineteen-part motet &#x27;O Bone Jesu&#x27;. James VI, king of Scotland from 1567, was a major patron of the arts in general. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594, and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he came south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. The Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, as when Charles I returned in 1633 to be crowned, bringing many musicians from the English Chapel Royal for the service, it began to fall into disrepair. From now on the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage.

==Folk music==

There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland during the late Middle Ages, but the only song with a melody to survive from this period is the &quot;Pleugh Song&quot;. After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins with battle tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes, and laments. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families, including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of the adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands, with Martin Martin noting in his &quot;A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot; (1703) that he knew of 18 players in Lewis alone. Well-known musicians included the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson. This tradition continued into the nineteenth century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Niel and Nathaniel Gow. There is evidence of ballads from this period. Some may date back to the late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century. They remained an oral tradition until they were collected as folk songs in the eighteenth century.

The earliest printed collection of secular music comes from the seventeenth century. Song collecting began to gain momentum in the early eighteenth century, and as the Kirk&#x27;s opposition to music waned, there was a flood of publications, including Allan Ramsay&#x27;s verse compendium &quot;The Tea Table Miscellany&quot; (1723) and &quot;The Scots Musical Museum&quot; (1787–1803) by James Johnson and Robert Burns. In the late nineteenth century, there was renewed interest in traditional music, which was more academic and political in intent. In Scotland collectors included the Reverend James Duncan and Gavin Greig. Major performers included James Scott Skinner. This revival began to have a major impact on classical music, with the development of what was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland, with composers that included Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace, Learmont Drysdale, Hamish MacCunn and John McEwen.
 

After World War II, traditional music in Scotland was marginalized but remained a living tradition. This marginal status was changed by individuals including Alan Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy through collecting, publications, recordings, and radio programmes. Acts that were popularised included John Strachan, Jimmy MacBeath, Jeannie Robertson and Flora MacNeil. In the 1960s, there was a flourishing folk club culture and Ewan MacColl emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain. They hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, alongside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall, Jimmie Macgregor, The Corries and the Ian Campbell Folk Group. There was also a strand of popular Scottish music that benefited from the arrival of radio and television, which relied on images of Scottishness derived from tartanry and stereotypes employed in music hall and variety. This was exemplified by the TV programme &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; which ran from 1958 to 1967, hosted by Andy Stewart and starring Moira Anderson and Kenneth McKellar.

The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davey Graham and Bert Jansch. Others such as Donovan and The Incredible String Band abandoned the traditional element and have been seen as developing psychedelic folk. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included The Tannahill Weavers, Ossian, Silly Wizard, The Boys of the Lough, Battlefield Band, The Clutha and the Whistlebinkies.

Celtic rock developed as a variant of British folk rock by Scottish groups including the JSD Band and Spencer&#x27;s Feat. Five Hand Reel, who combined Irish and Scottish personnel, emerged as the most successful exponents of the style. From the late 1970s on, the attendance at and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease as new musical and social trends began to dominate. However, in Scotland, the circuit of ceilidhs and festivals helped sustain traditional music. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s that emerged from this dance band circuit were Runrig and Capercaillie. &quot;An Ubhal as Àirde (The Highest Apple)&quot; by Runrig made history by becoming the first song to be sung in Scottish Gaelic to chart on the UK Singles Charts, peaking at number eighteen on the UK Singles Charts. It also became a top five single for the band in Scotland, debuting at number three on the Scottish Singles Charts. At the height of their success during the 1980s and 1990s, Runrig were described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as one of the &quot;most celebrated&quot; Gaelic language bands in Scotland.

A by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. From the US, this includes Scottish bands Seven Nations, Prydein and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands such as Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real McKenzies and Spirit of the West.

==Classical music==
The development of a distinct tradition of art music in Scotland was limited by the impact of the Scottish Reformation on ecclesiastical music from the sixteenth century. Concerts, largely composed of &quot;Scottish airs&quot;, developed in the seventeenth century and classical instruments were introduced to the country. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s. The Musical Society of Edinburgh was incorporated in 1728. Several Italian musicians were active in the capital in this period and there are several known Scottish composers in the classical style, including Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie, the first Scot known to have produced a symphony.

In the mid-eighteenth century, a group of Scottish composers including James Oswald and William McGibbon created the &quot;Scots drawing room style&quot;, taking primarily Lowland Scottish tunes and making them acceptable to a middle-class audience. In the 1790s Robert Burns embarked on an attempt to produce a corpus of Scottish national songs, contributing about a third of the songs of &quot;The Scots Musical Museum&quot;. Burns also collaborated with George Thomson in &quot;A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs&quot;, which adapted Scottish folk songs with &quot;classical&quot; arrangements. However, Burns&#x27; championing of Scottish music may have prevented the establishment of a tradition of European concert music in Scotland, which faltered towards the end of the eighteenth century.

From the mid-nineteenth century, classical music began a revival in Scotland, aided by the visits of Chopin and Mendelssohn in the 1840s. By the late nineteenth century, there was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland, with major composers including Alexander Mackenzie, William Wallace, Learmont Drysdale and Hamish MacCunn. Major performers included the pianist Frederic Lamond, and singers Mary Garden and Joseph Hislop.

After World War I, Robin Orr and Cedric Thorpe Davie were influenced by modernism and Scottish musical cadences. Erik Chisholm founded the Scottish Ballet Society and helped create several ballets. The Edinburgh Festival was founded in 1947 and led to an expansion of classical music in Scotland, leading to the foundation of Scottish Opera in 1960. Important post-war composers included Ronald Stevenson, Francis George Scott, Edward McGuire, William Sweeney, Iain Hamilton, Thomas Wilson, Thea Musgrave, Judith Weir, James MacMillan and Helen Grime. Craig Armstrong has produced music for numerous films. Major performers include the percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Major Scottish orchestras include the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO), the Scottish Chamber Orchestra (SCO) and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBC SSO). Major venues include Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Usher Hall, Edinburgh and Queen&#x27;s Hall, Edinburgh.

==Contemporary modern music==
===1950s–1960s===
Scotland produced few rock or pop bands of note in the 1950s. During the 1960s, two innovative rock musicians from Scotland became central to the international rock scene – Donovan and Jack Bruce. Traces of Scottish literary and musical influences can be found in both Donovan&#x27;s and Bruce&#x27;s work. Donovan&#x27;s music on 1965&#x27;s &quot;Fairytale&quot; anticipated the British folk rock revival, and his musicianship is said to have pioneered psychedelic rock with Sunshine Superman in 1966. Donovan is said to be an early influence on Marc Bolan, founder of T. Rex. Jack Bruce co-founded Cream along with Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker in 1966, debuting with the album &quot;Fresh Cream&quot;. &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; and the launch of Cream are considered a pivotal moment in blues-rock history, introducing virtuosity and improvisation to the form. Bruce, as a member of The Tony Williams Lifetime (along with John McLaughlin and Larry Young) on &quot;Emergency!&quot;, similarly contributed to a seminal jazz-rock work that predated Bitches Brew by Miles Davis.

Thanks to accolades from David Bowie and others, the Edinburgh-based band 1-2-3 (later known as Clouds), active between 1966–1971, were acknowledged as a definitive precursor of the progressive rock movement. 

===1970s–1980s===
By the 1970s, Rod Stewart and groups such as the Average White Band, Nazareth and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band began to gain international success. The most commercially successful Scottish pop act of the 1970s by sales was the Bay City Rollers, who sold over 120 million albums worldwide. Their 1975 single &quot;Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby Goodbye)&quot; finished the year as the UK&#x27;s best selling single.

Pilot, a band formed by former Bay City Rollers member Billy Lyall, also enjoyed some success. Their 1974 single &quot;Magic&quot; from their debut album &quot;From the Album of the Same Name&quot; (1974) reached number eleven on the UK Singles Charts and number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. Selling over one million copies, it was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in August 1975. The song &quot;January&quot; gave Pilot their greatest success in the UK, securing the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart on 1 February 1975.

Several members of the internationally successful rock band AC/DC were born in Scotland, including original lead singer Bon Scott and guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young, though by the time they began playing, all three had moved to Australia. Angus and Malcolm&#x27;s older brother, George Young, found success as a member of the Australian band The Easybeats and later produced some of AC/DC&#x27;s records and formed a songwriting partnership with Dutch ex-pat Harry Vanda. Musicians Mark Knopfler and John Martyn were also partly raised in Scotland.

Scotland produced a number of punk bands which achieved mainstream success, namely The Exploited, The Rezillos, The Skids, The Fire Engines, and the Scars. In the post-punk era of the early 1980s, Scotland produced bands like Cocteau Twins, Orange Juice, The Associates, Simple Minds, Maggie Reilly, Annie Lennox (Eurythmics), Hue and Cry, Goodbye Mr Mackenzie, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Wet Wet Wet, Big Country, The Proclaimers, and Josef K. Since the 1980s Scotland has produced several popular rock and alternative rock acts. The growth of indie bands in Scotland during the 1980s was prominent with the arrival of the likes of Primal Scream, The Soup Dragons, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Aztec Camera, The Blue Nile, Teenage Fanclub, 18 Wheeler, The Pastels and BMX Bandits. The following decade also saw a burgeoning scene in Glasgow, with the likes of The Almighty, Arab Strap, Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, The Delgados, Bis and Mogwai.

===1990s–present===

In 1990, Scottish band Aztec Camera released a protest song against Margaret Thatcher and her government entitled &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, with lyrics referencing the social unrest evident in the country during the 1980s. 

The late 1990s and 2000s saw Scottish guitar bands continue to achieve critical or commercial success. Examples include Franz Ferdinand, Frightened Rabbit, Biffy Clyro, Texas, Travis, KT Tunstall, Amy Macdonald, Paolo Nutini, The View, Idlewild, Shirley Manson of Garbage, Glasvegas, We Were Promised Jetpacks, The Fratellis, and Twin Atlantic. Scottish extreme metal bands include Man Must Die and Cerebral Bore. Successful electronic music producer Calvin Harris is also Scottish. The Edinburgh-based group Young Fathers won the 2014 Mercury Prize for their album &quot;Dead&quot;. 

With the arrival and increasing popularity of musical talent television shows throughout the 2000s, notable Scottish acts include Michelle McManus (winner of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, 2003), Darius Campbell Danesh (3rd, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, 2001–2002), Leon Jackson (winner, &quot;The X Factor&quot;, 2007), Nicholas McDonald (runner-up, &quot;The X Factor&quot;, 2014) and Susan Boyle (runner-up, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, 2009).

Artists to achieve international and commercial success through the 2010s and 2020s include Calvin Harris, Susan Boyle, Lewis Capaldi, Nina Nesbitt, The Snuts, Nathan Evans, Gerry Cinnamon and Chvrches. 

Susan Boyle achieved international success, particularly with her first two studio albums, topping both the UK Album Charts and the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart in the United States, becoming the first female artist in history to have a number one album simultaneously in both the United Kingdom and the United States within the space of a year. In 2011, Boyle made UK music history by becoming the first female artist to achieve three successive album debuts at No.1 in less than two years. Her debut album, &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; (2009), is one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, having sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and it was the best-selling album internationally in 2009. 

===Scotland in Eurovision===

As part of the United Kingdom, Scotland does not compete separately in the annual Eurovision Song Contest. Edinburgh hosted the contest in 1972.

Scotland entered the Eurovision Choir 2019, a European Broadcasting Union competition for choral singers. This marked the first time that Scotland had entered a Eurovision or European Broadcasting Union competition separately from the United Kingdom. The choir, Alba, performed three songs in Scottish Gaelic; &quot;Cumha na Cloinne&quot;, &quot;Ach a&#x27; Mhairead&quot; and &quot;Alba&quot;. The choir competed in the first round and did not advance to the second and final round.

Scotland competed in the second Free European Song Contest in 2021, a competition broadcast by German broadcaster ProSieben as an alternative to the main Eurovision Song Contest which had been cancelled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Singer Amy Macdonald represented Scotland and finished in 4th place with the song &quot;Statues&quot;.

==Instruments==

===Accordion===

Though often derided as Scottish kitsch, the accordion has long been a part of Scottish music. Country dance bands, such as that led by Jimmy Shand, have helped to dispel this image. In the early 20th century, the melodeon, a variety of diatonic button accordion was popular among rural folk and was part of the bothy band tradition. More recently, Phil Cunningham (of Silly Wizard) has helped popularise the accordion in Scottish music.

===Bagpipes===
 
Many associate Scottish folk music with the Great Highland Bagpipe, which has long played an important part in Scottish music. Although this particular form of bagpipe was developed exclusively in Scotland, it is not the only Scottish bagpipe. The earliest mention of bagpipes in Scotland dates to the 15th century although they are believed to have been introduced to Britain by the Roman armies. The &quot;pìob mhór&quot;, or Great Highland Bagpipe, was initially associated with both hereditary piping families and professional pipers to various clan chiefs; later, pipes were adopted for use in other venues, including military marching. Piping clans included the Clan Henderson, MacArthurs, MacDonalds, MacKays and, especially, the MacCrimmon, who were hereditary pipers to the Clan MacLeod.

Though bagpipes are closely associated with Scotland, the instrument (or, more precisely, &quot;family&quot; of instruments) is found throughout large swathes of Europe, North Africa and South Asia. The most common bagpipe heard in modern Scottish music is the Great Highland Bagpipe, which was spread by the Highland regiments of the British Army. Historically, numerous other bagpipes existed, and many of them have been recreated in the last half-century. Also during the 19th century bagpipes were played on ships sailing off to war to keep the men&#x27;s hopes up and to bring good luck in the coming war.

The classical music of the Great Highland Bagpipe is called Pìobaireachd, which consists of a first movement called the &quot;urlar&quot; (in English, the &#x27;ground&#x27; movement,) which establishes a theme. The theme is then developed in a series of movements, growing increasingly complex each time. After the &quot;urlar&quot; there is usually a number of variations and doublings of the variations. Then comes the &quot;taorluath&quot; movement and variation and the &quot;crunluath&quot; movement, continuing with the underlying theme. This is usually followed by a variation of the crunluath, usually the &quot;crunluath a mach&quot; (other variations: &quot;crunluath breabach&quot; and &quot;crunluath fosgailte&quot;) ; the piece closes with a return to the &quot;urlar&quot;.

Bagpipe competitions are common in Scotland, for both solo pipers and pipe bands. Competitive solo piping is currently popular among many aspiring pipers, some of whom travel from as far as Australia to attend Scottish competitions. Other pipers have chosen to explore more creative usages of the instrument. Different types of bagpipes have also seen a resurgence since the 70s, as the historical border pipes and Scottish smallpipes have been resuscitated and now attract a thriving alternative piping community. Two of Scotland&#x27;s most highly regarded pipers are Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison.

The pipe band is another common format for highland piping, with top competitive bands including the Victoria Police Pipe Band from Australia (formerly), Northern Ireland&#x27;s Field Marshal Montgomery, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Laurence O&#x27;Toole pipe band, Canada&#x27;s 78th Fraser Highlanders Pipe Band and Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, and Scottish bands like Shotts and Dykehead Pipe Band and Strathclyde Police Pipe Band. These bands, as well as many others, compete in numerous pipe band competitions, often the World Pipe Band Championships, and sometimes perform in public concerts.

===Fiddle===

Scottish traditional fiddling encompasses a number of regional styles, including the bagpipe-inflected west Highlands, the upbeat and lively style of Norse-influenced Shetland Islands and the Strathspey and slow airs of the northeast. The instrument arrived late in the 17th century, and is first mentioned in 1680 in a document from Newbattle Abbey in Midlothian, &quot;Lessones For Ye Violin&quot;.

In the 18th century, Scottish fiddling is said to have reached new heights. Fiddlers like William Marshall and Niel Gow were legends across Scotland, and the first collections of fiddle tunes were published in the mid-century. The most famous and useful of these collections was a series published by Nathaniel Gow, one of Niel&#x27;s sons, and a fine fiddler and composer in his own right. Classical composers such as Charles McLean, James Oswald and William McGibbon used Scottish fiddling traditions in their Baroque compositions.

Scottish fiddling is most directly represented in North America in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, an island on the east coast of Canada, which received some 25,000 emigrants from the Scottish Highlands during the Highland Clearances of 1780–1850. Cape Breton musicians such as Natalie MacMaster, Ashley MacIsaac, and Jerry Holland have brought their music to a worldwide audience, building on the traditions of master fiddlers such as Buddy MacMaster and Winston Scotty Fitzgerald.

Among native Scots, Aly Bain and Alasdair Fraser are two of the most accomplished, following in the footsteps of influential 20th-century players such as James Scott Skinner, Hector MacAndrew, Angus Grant and Tom Anderson. The growing number of young professional Scottish fiddlers makes a complete list impossible.

The Annual Scots Fiddle Festival which runs each November showcases the great fiddling tradition and talent in Scotland.

===Guitar===
The history of the guitar in traditional music is recent, as is that of the cittern and bouzouki introduced into Celtic folk music by folksinger Johnny Moynihan in the late 1960s. The guitar featured prominently in the folk revival of the early 1960s with the likes of Archie Fisher, The Corries, Hamish Imlach, Robin Hall and Jimmie Macgregor. The virtuoso playing of Bert Jansch was widely influential, and the range of instruments was widened by The Incredible String Band. Notable artists include Tony McManus, Dave MacIsaac, Peerie Willie Johnson and Dick Gaughan. Other notable guitarists in Scottish music scene include Kris Drever of Fine Friday and Lau, and Ross Martin of Cliar, Dàimh and Harem Scarem. Scotland has also produced several notable electric guitarists, including Stuart Adamson of Big Country (once referred to as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Jimi Hendrix&quot;), Angus Young of AC/DC, Jimmy McCulloch of Wings, Manny Charlton of Nazareth, Zal Cleminson of The Sensational Alex Harvey band, and Brian Robertson of Thin Lizzy.

===Gittern===
Stringed instruments similar to that of modern guitars have appeared in Scottish folk music for centuries. 
The Gittern, an ancestor to the modern guitar, featured in medieval Scottish appearing from at least the 13th century and was still around in Scotland 300 years later.

===Harp===
Material evidence suggests that lyres and / or harp, or clarsach, has a long and ancient history in Britain, with Iron Age lyres dating from 2300 BC. The harp was regarded as the national instrument until it was replaced with the Highland bagpipes in the 15th century. Stone carvings in the East of Scotland support the theory that the harp was present in Pictish Scotland well before the 9th century and may have been the original ancestor of the modern European harp and even formed the basis for Scottish pibroch, the folk bagpipe tradition.

Barring illustrations of harps in the 9th century Utrecht Psalter, only thirteen depictions exist in Europe of any triangular chordophone harp pre-11th century, and all thirteen of them come from Scotland. Pictish harps were strung with horsehair. The instruments apparently spread south to the Anglo-Saxons, who commonly used gut strings, and then west to the Gaels of the Highlands and Ireland. The earliest Irish word for a harp is in fact Cruit, a word which strongly suggests a Pictish provenance for the instrument. The surname MacWhirter, &quot;Mac a&#x27; Chruiteir&quot;, means son of the harpist, and is common throughout Scotland, but particularly in Carrick and Galloway.

The Clàrsach (Gd.) or Cláirseach (Ga.) is the name given to the wire-strung harp of either Scotland or Ireland. The word begins to appear by the end of the 14th century. Until the end of the Middle Ages it was the most popular musical instrument in Scotland, and harpers were among the most prestigious cultural figures in the courts of Irish/Scottish chieftains and Scottish kings and earls. In both countries, harpers enjoyed special rights and played a crucial part in ceremonial occasions such as coronations and poetic bardic recitals. The Kings of Scotland employed harpers until the end of the Middle Ages, and they featured prominently in royal iconography. Several Clarsach players were noted at the Battle of the Standard (1138), and when Alexander III of Scotland (died 1286) visited London in 1278, his court minstrels with him, records show payments were made to one Elyas, &quot;King of Scotland&#x27;s harper.&quot; One of the nicknames for the Scottish harp is &quot;taigh nan teud&quot;, the house of strings.

Three medieval Gaelic harps survived into the modern period, two from Scotland (the Queen Mary Harp and the Lamont Harp) and one in Ireland (the Brian Boru harp), although artistic evidence suggests that all three were probably made in the western Highlands.

The playing of this Gaelic harp with wire strings died out in Scotland in the 18th century and in Ireland in the early 19th century. In the late 19th century Gaelic revival the instruments used differed greatly from the old wire-strung harps. The new instruments had gut strings, and their construction and playing style was based on the larger orchestral pedal harp. Nonetheless, the name &quot;clàrsach&quot; was and is still used in Scotland today to describe these new instruments. The modern gut-strung clàrsach has thousands of players, both in Scotland and Ireland, as well as North America and elsewhere. The 1931 formation of the Clarsach Society kickstarted the modern harp renaissance. Recent harp players include Savourna Stevenson, Maggie MacInnes, and the band Sileas. Notable events include the annual Edinburgh International Harp Festival, which in 2006 staged the world record for the largest number of harpists to play at the same time.

===Tin whistle===
One of the oldest tin whistles still in existence is the Tusculum whistle, found with pottery dating to the 14th and 15th centuries; it is currently in the collection of the Museum of Scotland. Today the whistle is a very common instrument in recorded Scottish music. Although few well-known performers choose the tin whistle as their principal instrument, it is quite common for pipers, flute players, and other musicians to play the whistle as well.

===Bodhrán===

The Irish word bodhrán (plural bodhráin), indicating a drum, is first mentioned in a document translated to English from Irish in the 17th century. The bodhrán originated in southwest Ireland, probably in the 18th century, and was known as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s tambourine&quot;. Made from farm implements and without the cymbals, it was popular among mummers or wren boys. A large oil painting by Irish artist Daniel Maclise (1806–1870) depicts a large Halloween house party in which a bodhrán features clearly. The bodhrán in Scotland and also Cape Breton, the northern mainland of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island is an import from Ireland due to its popularity in the 1960s because of the music of Seán Ó Riada

==Music awards==
The Scottish Music Awards, Scottish Album of the Year Award, the Scots Trad Music Awards and the BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician Award each recognise musical talent in Scotland annually from both Scottish and international artists.

==Music festivals==



Scotland has long had a number of festivals that celebrate music of Scottish and international origin on an annual basis. T in the Park (1994–2016) was one of Scotland&#x27;s largest music festivals, drawing crowds annually during the second weekend of July since its inception in 1994. Featuring a lineup of some of the globe&#x27;s biggest and most successful artists and bands, it held a special place in the hearts of music enthusiasts. T in the Park was replaced by TRNSMT (2017–present) which similarly takes place in the second weekend of July and is held in Glasgow Green.

Other festivals include the Aberdeen and NE Scotland Music Festival, Big Burns Supper Festival, Callander Jazz and Blues Festival, Connect Music Festival, the Darvel Music Festival, Eden Festival, the Glasgow International Jazz Festival, Glasgow Summer Sessions, Let&#x27;s Rock, the Leith Festival and the Skye Live Festival.

The Glasgow Bandstand at Kelvingrove Park hosts the annual Summer Nights festival with artists such as KT Tunstall, Anastacia, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Belinda Carlisle, Rick Astley and The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain being past performers.

Former major festivals include Wickerman Festival, Big in Falkirk, RockNess and Be in Belhaven.

Celtic Connections started in 1994 and celebrates Celtic music. It is held annually in Glasgow, for 18 days in January and February.

The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo is performed by international armed forces bands. It is held in August at Edinburgh Castle as part of the Edinburgh Festivals.

<text>Canis is a genus of the Caninae which includes multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs, coyotes, and golden jackals. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well-developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Canis&quot; (Carl Linnaeus, 1758) was published in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae and included the dog-like carnivores: the domestic dog, wolves, coyotes and jackals. All species within &quot;Canis&quot; are phylogenetically closely related with 78 chromosomes and can potentially interbreed. In 1926, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) in Opinion 91 included Genus &quot;Canis&quot; on its &quot;Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology&quot;. In 1955, the ICZN&#x27;s Direction 22 added &quot;Canis familiaris&quot; as the type species for genus &quot;Canis&quot; to the official list.

The cladogram below is based on the DNA phylogeny of Lindblad-Toh &quot;et al&quot;. (2005), modified to incorporate recent findings on &quot;Canis&quot; species,

In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group recommends that because DNA evidence shows the side-striped jackal (&quot;Canis adustus&quot;) and black-backed jackal (&quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;) to form a monophyletic lineage that sits outside of the &quot;Canis&quot;/&quot;Cuon&quot;/&quot;Lycaon&quot; clade, that they should be placed in a distinct genus, &quot;Lupulella&quot; Hilzheimer, 1906 with the names &quot;Lupulella adusta&quot; and &quot;Lupulella mesomelas&quot;.

===Evolution===
:&quot;See further: Evolution of the canids&quot;
The fossil record shows that feliforms and caniforms emerged within the clade Carnivoramorpha 43 million YBP. The caniforms included the fox-like genus &quot;Leptocyon&quot;, whose various species existed from 24 million YBP before branching 11.9 million YBP into &quot;Vulpes&quot; (foxes) and Canini (canines). The jackal-sized &quot;Eucyon&quot; existed in North America from 10 million YBP and by the Early Pliocene about 6-5 million YBP the coyote-like &quot;Eucyon davisi&quot; invaded Eurasia. The canids that had emigrated from North America to Eurasia – &quot;Eucyon&quot;, &quot;Vulpes&quot;, and &quot;Nyctereutes&quot; – were small to medium-sized predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but they were not the top predators.

For &quot;Canis&quot; populations in the New World, &quot;Eucyon&quot; in North America gave rise to early North American &quot;Canis&quot; which first appeared in the Miocene (6 million YBP) in south-western United States and Mexico. By 5 million YBP the larger &quot;Canis lepophagus&quot;, ancestor of wolves and coyotes, appeared in the same region.

Around 5 million years ago, some of the Old World &quot;Eucyon&quot; evolved into the first members of &quot;Canis&quot;, and the position of the canids would change to become a dominant predator across the Palearctic. The wolf-sized &quot;C. chihliensis&quot; appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4-3 million YBP. This was followed by an explosion of &quot;Canis&quot; evolution across Eurasia in the Early Pleistocene around 1.8 million YBP in what is commonly referred to as the &quot;wolf event&quot;. It is associated with the formation of the mammoth steppe and continental glaciation. &quot;Canis&quot; spread to Europe in the forms of &quot;C. arnensis&quot;, &quot;C. etruscus&quot;, and &quot;C. falconeri&quot;.

However, a 2021 genetic study of the dire wolf (&quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot;), previously considered a member of &quot;Canis&quot;, found that it represented the last member of an ancient lineage of canines originally indigenous to the New World that had diverged prior to the appearance of &quot;Canis&quot;, and that its lineage had been distinct since the Miocene with no evidence of introgression with &quot;Canis&quot;. The study hypothesized that the Neogene canids in the New World, &quot;Canis armbrusteri&quot; and &quot;Canis edwardii&quot;, were possibly members of the distinct dire wolf lineage that had convergently evolved a very similar appearance to members of &quot;Canis&quot;. True members of &quot;Canis&quot;, namely the gray wolf and coyote, likely only arrived in the New World during the Late Pleistocene, where their dietary flexibility and/or ability to hybridize with other canids allowed them to survive the Quaternary extinction event, unlike the dire wolf.

&quot;Xenocyon&quot; (strange wolf) is an extinct subgenus of &quot;Canis&quot;. The diversity of the &quot;Canis&quot; group decreased by the end of the Early Pleistocene to the Middle Pleistocene and was limited in Eurasia to the small wolves of the &quot;Canis mosbachensis–Canis variabilis&quot; group and the large hypercarnivorous &quot;Canis (Xenocyon) lycaonoides&quot;. The hypercarnivore &quot;Xenocyon&quot; gave rise to the modern dhole and the African wild dog.

==Dentition and biteforce==


Dentition relates to the arrangement of teeth in the mouth, with the dental notation for the upper-jaw teeth using the upper-case letters I to denote incisors, C for canines, P for premolars, and M for molars, and the lower-case letters i, c, p and m to denote the mandible teeth. Teeth are numbered using one side of the mouth and from the front of the mouth to the back. In carnivores, the upper premolar P4 and the lower molar m1 form the carnassials that are used together in a scissor-like action to shear the muscle and tendon of prey.

Canids use their premolars for cutting and crushing except for the upper fourth premolar P4 (the upper carnassial) that is only used for cutting. They use their molars for grinding except for the lower first molar m1 (the lower carnassial) that has evolved for both cutting and grinding depending on the candid&#x27;s dietary adaptation. On the lower carnassial the trigonid is used for slicing and the talonid is used for grinding. The ratio between the trigonid and the talonid indicates a carnivore&#x27;s dietary habits, with a larger trigonid indicating a hypercarnivore and a larger talonid indicating a more omnivorous diet. Because of its low variability, the length of the lower carnassial is used to provide an estimate of a carnivore&#x27;s body size.

A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for their body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in Newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the extinct dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator&#x27;s largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits.

==Behavior==

===Description and sexual dimorphism===
There is little variance among male and female canids. Canids tend to live as monogamous pairs. Wolves, dholes, coyotes, and jackals live in groups that include breeding pairs and their offspring. Wolves may live in extended family groups. To take prey larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey. They work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. Social mammal predators prey on herbivores with a body mass similar to that of the combined mass of the predator pack. The gray wolf specializes in preying on the vulnerable individuals of large prey, and a pack of timber wolves can bring down a moose.

==== Mating behaviour ====
The genus &quot;Canis&quot; contains many different species and has a wide range of different mating systems that varies depending on the type of canine and the species. In a study done in 2017, it was found that in some species of canids females use their sexual status to gain food resources. The study looked at wolves and dogs. Wolves are typically monogamous and form pair-bonds; whereas dogs are promiscuous when free-range and mate with multiple individuals. The study found that in both species females tried to gain access to food more and were more successful in monopolizing a food resource when in heat. Outside of the breeding season their efforts were not as persistent or successful. This shows that the food-for-sex hypothesis likely plays a role in the food sharing among canids and acts as a direct benefit for the females.

Another study on free-ranging dogs found that social factors played a significant role in the determination of mating pairs. The study, done in 2014, looked at social regulation of reproduction in the dogs. They found that females in heat searched out dominant males and were more likely to mate with a dominant male who appeared to be a quality leader. The females were more likely to reject submissive males. Furthermore, cases of male-male competition were more aggressive in the presence of high ranking females. This suggests that females prefer dominant males and males prefer high ranking females meaning social cues and status play a large role in the determination of mating pairs in dogs.

Canids also show a wide range of parental care and in 2018 a study showed that sexual conflict plays a role in the determination of intersexual parental investment. The studied looked at coyote mating pairs and found that paternal investment was increased to match or near match the maternal investment. The amount of parental care provided by the fathers also was shown to fluctuated depending on the level of care provided by the mother.

Another study on parental investment showed that in free-ranging dogs, mothers modify their energy and time investment into their pups as they age. Due to the high mortality of free-range dogs at a young age a mother&#x27;s fitness can be drastically reduced. This study found that as the pups aged the mother shifted from high-energy care to lower-energy care so that they can care for their offspring for a longer duration for a reduced energy requirement. By doing this the mothers increasing the likelihood of their pups surviving infancy and reaching adulthood and thereby increase their own fitness.

A study done in 2017 found that aggression between male and female gray wolves varied and changed with age. Males were more likely to chase away rival packs and lone individuals than females and became increasingly aggressive with age. Alternatively, females were found to be less aggressive and constant in their level of aggression throughout their life. This requires further research but suggests that intersexual aggression levels in gray wolves relates to their mating system.

====Tooth breakage====

Tooth breakage is a frequent result of carnivores&#x27; feeding behaviour. Carnivores include both pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter depends on a powerful bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use the strength of the mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the modern gray wolf and the red wolf (&quot;C.rufus&quot;) possess greater buttressing than all other extant canids and the extinct dire wolf. This indicates that these are both better adapted for cracking bone than other canids.

A study of nine modern carnivores indicate that one in four adults had suffered tooth breakage and that half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The highest frequency of breakage occurred in the spotted hyena, which is known to consume all of its prey including the bone. The least breakage occurred in the African wild dog. The gray wolf ranked between these two. The eating of bone increases the risk of accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to bending stresses that are unpredictable in direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when taking and consuming large prey.
In comparison to extant gray wolves, the extinct Beringian wolves included many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth and with a significantly greater number of broken teeth. The frequencies of fracture ranged from a minimum of 2% found in the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf &quot;(Canis lupus irremotus)&quot; up to a maximum of 11% found in Beringian wolves. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row also differs, with Beringian wolves having much higher frequencies of fracture for incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption because bones are gnawed with the incisors and then cracked with the carnassials and molars.

== Coyotes, jackals, and wolves ==
The gray wolf (&quot;C. lupus&quot;), the Ethiopian wolf (&quot;C. simensis&quot;), eastern wolf (&quot;C. lycaon&quot;), and the African golden wolf (&quot;C. lupaster&quot;) are four of the many &quot;Canis&quot; species referred to as &quot;wolves&quot;. Species that are too small to attract the word &quot;wolf&quot; are called coyotes in the Americas and jackals elsewhere. Although these may not be more closely related to each other than they are to &quot;C. lupus&quot;, they are, as fellow &quot;Canis&quot; species, more closely related to wolves and domestic dogs than they are to foxes, maned wolves, or other canids which do not belong to the genus &quot;Canis&quot;. The word &quot;jackal&quot; is applied to the golden jackal (&quot;C. aureus&quot;), found across southwestern and south-central Asia, and the Balkans in Europe.

==African migration==
The first record of &quot;Canis&quot; on the African continent is &quot;Canis sp. A&quot; from South Turkwel, Kenya, dated 3.58–3.2 million years ago. In 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole genome nuclear sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids have colonised Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of the African canid fauna diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions. In 2017, the fossil remains of a new &quot;Canis&quot; species, named &quot;Canis othmanii&quot;, was discovered among remains found at Wadi Sarrat, Tunisia, from deposits that date 700,000 years ago. This canine shows a morphology more closely associated with canids from Eurasia instead of Africa.

<text>Ruth Pitter (alternatively Emma Thomas Pitter), CBE, FRSL (7 November 1897 – 29 February 1992) was a British poet.

She was the first woman to receive the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1955, and was appointed CBE in 1979 to honour her many contributions to English literature. In 1974, she was named a &quot;Companion of Literature&quot;, the highest honour given by the Royal Society of Literature.

==Early life and education==
Pitter was born in Ilford, eldest of three children of George Pitter (1862–1926) and his wife Louisa Rosetta Rosamund (; 1869–1941), both assistant teachers in the East End of London. She grew up in &quot;poor surroundings&quot;, but &quot;her childhood was transfigured&quot; by discovering Hainault Forest, which she considered &quot;magical&quot;. Her birth certificate reports her given name simply as &quot;Ruth.&quot; She was educated at the Coborn School, Bow.

==Career==
Pitter was employed at the War Office from 1915 to 1917, later working as a painter at a furniture company in Suffolk, Walberswick Peasant Pottery Co., where she remained until 1930. In Suffolk, she befriended Richard and Ida Blair at Southwold, the parents of George Orwell, and later helped Orwell find lodgings in London in 1927, taking a vague interest in his writing, of which she was generally critical.

Later, Pitter and her lifelong good friend, Kathleen O&#x27;Hara, operated Deane and Forester, a small firm that specialised in decorative, painted furniture. The business closed when World War II began. Pitter took work in a factory. After the war, she and O&#x27;Hara opened a small business painting trays. Pitter was skilful at the flower-painting used in both furniture and tray decorating.

From 1946 to 1972, she was often a guest on BBC radio programmes, and from 1956 to 1960 she appeared regularly on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;, one of the first television talk programmes.

==Poet==
Pitter began writing poetry early in life under the influence of her schoolteacher parents. In 1920, she published her first book of poetry with the help of Hilaire Belloc. Despite her business and factory work, Pitter managed to spend a few hours a day writing poetry.

She went on to publish 18 volumes of new and collected verse over a 70-year career as a published poet. Many of her volumes met with some critical and financial success.

She received the Hawthornden Prize in 1937 for &quot;A Trophy of Arms&quot;, published the previous year. In 1954 she won the William E. Heinemann Award for her book &quot;The Ermine&quot; (Cresset Press, 1953).

==Style and influences==
Pitter was a traditionalist poet; she avoided most of the experimentations of modern verse and preferred the meter and rhyme schemes of the 19th century. One critic has described her and her poetry thus:

Because of this, Pitter was frequently overlooked by critics of her day, and has only in recent years been seen as important: her reputation was helped by Larkin&#x27;s respect for her poetry (he included four of her poems in &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot;).

She was a good friend of C. S. Lewis, who admired her poetry and once said, according to his friend and biographer George Sayer, that if he was the kind of man who got married, he would have wanted to marry Ruth Pitter. In correspondence between the two, Lewis often critiqued her work and made suggestions. More often he invited her critique of his poems. Pitter is considered by many Lewis scholars to have had an effect on his writing in the 1940s and 1950s.

W. B. Yeats, Robin Skelton and Thom Gunn also appreciated Pitter&#x27;s work and praised her poetry. Lord David Cecil once remarked that Pitter was one of the most original and moving poets then living.

Pitter&#x27;s work continues to be published in anthologies, including:

* &quot;The Faber Book of 20th Century Women&#x27;s Poetry&quot;, ed. Fleur Adcock (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1987), where her &quot;The Sparrow&#x27;s Skull&quot; and &quot;Morning Glory&quot; appear (pp. 77–78).
