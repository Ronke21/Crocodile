<text>Graham Paul Thorpe (1 August 1969 – 4 August 2024) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Surrey, and represented England in 100 Test matches. He also played 82 One Day Internationals (ODIs) including appearances at the 1996 and 1999 World Cups and deputised as captain on three occasions.

A left-handed middle-order batsman, Thorpe made his first-class debut for Surrey in 1988, becoming a regular in their side the following season. Following four winters of England A tours he made his full international debut in 1993, scoring a century on his Test debut against Australia. He was briefly dropped in 1994 but became an England regular through consistent scoring, although he struggled for a time to convert half-centuries into three-figure scores. After beginning 1997 with back-to-back centuries he was England&#x27;s leading scorer and player of the Ashes series, which led to his selection as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. After 10 seasons of touring he opted out of the South Africa series at the turn of the millennium, before returning refreshed to play some of his best cricket as England won a subcontinent series against Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2000–01.

In early 2002, Thorpe scored the then third fastest double century in Test history as he made his highest Test score of 200 not out against New Zealand. The innings came at a time when his marriage was breaking down, and this led him to first retire from ODIs before taking a break from cricket entirely. He returned for England after over a year out, scoring a century at his home ground, The Oval. He was a member of the England side that won a national record eight successive Tests in 2004, and the following year made his 100th Test appearance. Thorpe retired from playing in 2005 after non-selection for the Ashes and took up coaching positions with New South Wales, Surrey and England. He died in August 2024, aged 55.

==Early life==
Graham Thorpe was born in Farnham on 1 August 1969, the third of three boys to Geoff and Toni Thorpe. Graham&#x27;s brothers are Ian, four years older, and Alan, two years older. Geoff Thorpe worked as a draughtsman and then as an engineering surveyor.

Thorpe first played men&#x27;s cricket for village team Wrecclesham aged 13, moving on to play alongside his brothers at Farnham in the Surrey Championship. The whole family had a long association with the club, Ian and Alan would go on to be captain while Geoff served as chairman and Toni acted as scorer.

Thorpe was also a promising footballer: he represented England Schools at under-18 level as a midfielder and had a trial at Brentford. He was educated as Weydon School and Farnham College, but did not complete his A-Levels and was unsure what he would do for a career until offered a two-year contract by Surrey.

==Cricket career==
===Early career===
Thorpe made his first-class debut aged 18 for Surrey against Leicestershire in June 1988. Batting at number eight he made scores of 15 and 16 and also claimed two wickets, his first wicket being that of David Gower lbw. Just a few days later Thorpe scored his maiden first-class century against Cambridge University, his unbeaten century taking 122 minutes. He made two further first-team appearances that season, scoring 19 against Derbyshire in the County Championship and 15 on his List A debut against Glamorgan. He established himself in the Surrey team in 1989, scoring his maiden Championship century at Basingstoke against a Hampshire attack featuring Malcolm Marshall. He surpassed 1,000 runs for the season at an average of 45, which led to selection for England A on their tour of Zimbabwe in 1989–90. He would go on three further tours with England A.

The 1990 season broke records for high scoring, however Thorpe struggled with an average of 27 and made just three half-centuries from 18 matches, he ended the campaign playing for the second XI. The following season was more successful, he scored his maiden List A century against Lancashire when opening the batting. Towards the end of the season he had a spell of three centuries in five County Championship innings. He also top scored with 93 in the Natwest Trophy final although Surrey lost by four wickets to Hampshire. He was awarded his county cap on 12 September 1991.

Thorpe had his most productive season of his career in 1992, amassing 1,895 runs at an average of 51.21. He was a consistent scorer recording fifties in the County Championship 13 times before finally passing three figures on 31 August. He converted the innings against Somerset into a maiden double century and shared in a stand of 211 from 34 overs with Ali Brown.

===1993===
In May 1993, Thorpe received his first senior international call-up as part of a 13-man squad for the Texaco Trophy, a three-match ODI series against the touring Australians. On 19 May, he made his ODI debut at Old Trafford in the first match of the series. During Australia&#x27;s innings he took a catch off the bowling of fellow ODI debutant Andy Caddick and in England&#x27;s run chase Thorpe, batting at number 6, made 31 in a four-run defeat, &quot;Wisden&quot; considered it &quot;an intelligent innings in difficult circumstances&quot;. He added scores of 36 and 22 in the rest of the series. In Australia&#x27;s tour match with Surrey which followed, Thorpe took his career best bowling figures of 4/40.

Thorpe was not selected for the first two Ashes Tests but the selectors made wholesale changes after an innings defeat in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s including calling up Thorpe despite him being viewed as &#x27;out of form&#x27; with a season average of 25. On 1 July, Thorpe made his Test debut against Australia at Trent Bridge alongside three other debutants (Mark Ilott, Martin McCague and Mark Lathwell). Thorpe scored 6 in the first innings before being caught at gully off a short ball from Merv Hughes. In England&#x27;s second innings, Thorpe came to the wicket at 159/5 and shared in a 150-run sixth wicket partnership with captain Graham Gooch, Thorpe ended the fourth day on 88 not out and completed his century on the final morning, finishing unbeaten on 114 as Gooch declared. The Test match was drawn with Thorpe named as man of the match. By scoring a century on Test debut he became the 14th England player to achieve the feat and the first since Frank Hayes in 1973. Thorpe made a half-century in the fifth Test at Edgbaston but missed the final Test at The Oval after breaking his left thumb in a net session on the first morning of the match. He ended the series with an average of 46 and was one of only two England players to reach a hundred in the series, his partnership with Gooch at Trent Bridge was England&#x27;s longest of the series.

===1994===
Thorpe was selected for England&#x27;s tour of the West Indies in early 1994 and played all five Tests. He top-scored in the third Test at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval with 86 before England collapsed to 46 all out in their second innings. In the fourth Test at Kensington Oval he scored 84, adding 150 in partnership with Surrey team-mate Alec Stewart, as England won their only Test of the tour. Thorpe averaged 26.55 across the series, with &quot;Wisden&quot; assessing: &quot;Among the fringe batsmen Graham Thorpe made much the most progress, though he, too, had to cure technical problems before batting with authority late in the tour.&quot;

Thorpe was dropped for the home series with New Zealand in 1994, new chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth made wholesale changes with only six of the West Indies touring squad retained and opted for just five specialist batsmen with a five-man bowling attack including all-rounder Craig White. While back playing for Surrey, Thorpe made the highest List A score of his career against Lancashire in the NatWest Trophy, the innings of 145 not out coming from 135 deliveries. He shared a 180-run partnership with David Ward which set a county record for the competition and Surrey&#x27;s total of 343 was also their highest in one-day cricket at the time.

Later that summer Thorpe was recalled by England for the second Test of the series against South Africa at Headingley, taking the place of an injured White. Thorpe, batting at number four, scored 72 from 112 balls including 13 boundaries during England&#x27;s first innings, &quot;Wisden&quot; picked out &quot;his urgency, instinctive placement and crisp driving&quot;. He added 73 in the second innings and 79 in the final Test at The Oval to end the series with an average of 79.66. In his series summary, Scyld Berry praised Thorpe&#x27;s attacking play for enlivening England who prior to his introduction had taken a defensive approach to their batting. In the ODI series with South Africa that followed the Tests, Thorpe scored his maiden ODI half-century.

Thorpe was selected for the 1994–95 Ashes tour and played in all five Tests as Australia won the series 3–1. He contributed three fifties in the first four Tests including 83 in England&#x27;s solitary victory at Adelaide. In the fifth Test at Perth he scored his second Test century with an innings of 123 from 218 balls including 19 fours. His partnership of 158 with Mark Ramprakash recovered England&#x27;s first innings from 77/4 but after Thorpe was dismissed, stumped off a Shane Warne top-spinner, they collapsed going on to lose the match by 329 runs. Thorpe was England&#x27;s leading run-scorer across the series with 444 runs at an average of 49.33. &quot;Wisden&quot; assessed that: &quot;Thorpe appeared to have the temperament, as well as the technique, to be a fixture in the team for several years.&quot; In the 1994–95 Australian Tri-Series scheduled during the Ashes series, he made his highest ODI score of 89 against Zimbabwe at The Gabba however after batting for 155 minutes in 90°F heat he was taken to hospital with dehydration and heat exhaustion.

===1995===
Thorpe continued his consistent scoring into the 1995 home series with West Indies, two fifties in the first two Tests extended his sequence of half-centuries to nine in nine Tests since being recalled the previous summer. During the second innings of the second Test, he was struck first ball by an unintentional beamer from Courtney Walsh and spent the night at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital but returned the following day to make 42. Thorpe&#x27;s highest score of the series, 94, came in the fourth Test at Old Trafford where England won by six wickets to level the series at 2–2. Two further fifties saw him end the six-match series as England&#x27;s leading run-scorer with 506 at 42.16. He became the first England player to surpass 500 runs against the West Indies in a home series.

During the tour to South Africa in 1995–96, Thorpe struggled across the Test series making a total of 184 runs at 26.28. His highest score, and only half-century, came in the deciding Test at Newlands where he was dismissed run out for 59 in controversial fashion. The umpire Dave Orchard had originally adjudged him to be not out before South African captain Hansie Cronje persuaded Orchard to get the third umpire to check the TV replays which did show Thorpe to be out. Cronje was fined half his match fee for dissent but England went on lose the match and with it the series. Thorpe had a better ODI series, scoring three half-centuries from six matches and was England&#x27;s highest scorer.

Thorpe was selected for the 1996 World Cup and played in all six of England&#x27;s matches. During the group game with Netherlands, he scored 89 from 82 balls, equalling his highest ODI score. He also contributed an unbeaten half-century against Pakistan. In what was a disappointing tournament for England, beaten by all four Test-playing nations they played, he was their leading scorer with 254 at an average of 63.50.

===1996===
England began the 1996 season with an ODI series against India, Thorpe was named man of the match in the second ODI at Headingley as he led England to a six-wicket victory with an unbeaten 79. In the following match at Old Trafford, Thorpe took the wickets of Vikram Rathour and Sourav Ganguly, these would be his only wickets at international level. Across the subsequent Test series with India, Thorpe scored 193 runs at 48.25 with a highest score of 89.

Pakistan were the second touring side of the summer with the Test series starting at Lord&#x27;s. In England&#x27;s first innings Thorpe top scored with 77, however there was criticism of his increasing failure to convert his innings into centuries this being his 19th score of more than 50 in Test cricket of which only twice he had reached a hundred. England lost the Lord&#x27;s Test and again at the Oval where Thorpe had added another fifty to end the Test series with 159 runs at 31.80.

In county cricket, Thorpe had a strong season with six centuries, including five in his nine County Championship matches. He was the first English player to pass 1,000 runs for the season, and ended the campaign with an average of 62.76 in all first-class cricket. He also made seven appearances for Surrey as they won the Sunday League, the county&#x27;s first trophy in 14 years.

England toured Zimbabwe at the end of 1996 to play their first Test series against the nation. Thorpe was in poor form on the tour with &quot;Wisden&quot; describing him in the first Test as &quot;horribly out-of-touch&quot;. He was able to score 50 not out in the second Test before final day rain cut the match short.

===1997===
At the end of the Zimbabwe tour in 1996–97, England travelled on to New Zealand. In the first Test at Auckland, Thorpe was struck by a bouncer from Chris Cairns and been at fault for a run out of John Crawley before going on to make 119, ending his wait for a third Test century. He made it consecutive hundreds at Wellington as he scored 108, sharing century partnerships with Nasser Hussain and Crawley in the process.

Australia toured England in 1997 and ahead of the Ashes played three ODIs. England won all three matches with six wickets being the margin of victory on each occasion, Thorpe was unbeaten in the first and third match run chases with scores of 75 and 45.

The first Test of the Ashes took place at Edgbaston, England dismissed Australia for 118 and were 50/3 in reply when Thorpe joined Hussain at the crease. The pair batted through to the close adding 150 in 169 minutes with &quot;Wisden&quot; stating that Thorpe&#x27;s &quot;cutting and sweeping of Warne were crucial in seizing the initiative&quot;. On the second morning Thorpe reached his third Test century in four Tests as the stand contributed a further 135 in the pre-lunch session. He was dismissed to Glenn McGrath&#x27;s first ball after lunch for 138, a Test best score at the time. The partnership of 288 with Hussain was the highest for England against Australia for the fourth wicket. England won the match by nine wickets but Australia fought back by dismissing England for 77 in the drawn second Test and winning the third comfortably.

In the fourth Test at Headingley, Australia were 50/3 in their first innings when Thorpe dropped a routine first slip catch from Matthew Elliott off the bowling of debutant Mike Smith. Smith would never take a Test wicket while Elliott, who was on 29 at the time, would go on to score 199 as Australia won the match by an innings. Having failed to pass 30 in six innings since the first Test there were calls for Thorpe to lose his place in the team, but he was retained by the selectors. In the fifth Test he scored 53 and 82 not out, the latter innings played as wickets were falling at the other end with six of his partners contributing just 14 whilst he added 68. Australia won the series by winning the match but England were victorious the sixth Test at The Oval. In a low-scoring match, Thorpe made the only half-century of the game with &quot;Wisden&quot; describing it as &quot;an innings of exceptional quality and tenacity&quot;. He ended the series as England&#x27;s top run-scorer with 453 at 50.33, and was chosen as their player of the series.

Thorpe ended the season with a double-century for Surrey against County Championship leaders Glamorgan, batting for 438 minutes in making a then career best score of 222. Earlier in the campaign he featured in Surrey&#x27;s Benson &amp; Hedges Cup victory over Kent. For his performances during the 1997 English cricket season he was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in its 1998 edition of the &quot;Almanack&quot;.

In December 1997, England won a four-team ODI tournament in Sharjah, Thorpe was named man of the match in the final after he scored an unbeaten 66 to guide England to a three-wicket victory over the West Indies.

===1998===
England&#x27;s tour of West Indies in early 1998 began dramatically as the first Test was abandoned after an hour due to a dangerous pitch. The uneven bounce led to several batsmen being struck including Thorpe who was hit twice during his 10-ball innings, play was ended after the second such blow. The West Indies won two of the next three Tests with Thorpe only managing 111 runs across those matches.

On the first day of the fifth Test, he retired hurt at lunch due to back spasms with England at 55/4. After a painkilling injection he was able to return to the crease at the fall of the next wicket and batting alongside Mark Ramprakash ended the day unbeaten on 50. The following day Thorpe reached his sixth Test century, dismissed for 103 having batted for 395 minutes and shared in a 205-run sixth wicket partnership with Ramprakash. In setting up a second innings declaration Thorpe added 36 off 35 balls which included three pulled fours in a single Curtly Ambrose over, however final day rain denied England a chance of squaring the series. He was reprimanded for dissent by the match referee in the final Test following his first innings dismissal. Thorpe remained at the wicket for too long on being given out lbw, replays did show Thorpe had got an inside edge on the ball. In the second innings and facing a large deficit, Thorpe and Hussain put on a partnership of 168 in attempting to draw the match, however the run out of Hussain prompted a collapse of seven wickets for 26 runs as England succumbed to an innings defeat. Thorpe was left 84 not out having faced 322 balls. His series tally was 339 runs at 42.37. Thorpe played in the first game of the subsequent ODI series before returning home early from the tour due to the back injury sustained in the fifth Test.

Thorpe was named in England&#x27;s ODI squad for the home series with South Africa but suffered a reoccurrence of the back injury in a practise session and missed all three matches. To prove his fitness ahead of the Test series he played a County Championship match against Kent and took six catches in their first innings, one short of the first-class record for a fielder. Across the first two Tests he scored 63 runs, before his back injury flared up during the Old Trafford Test. He was moved down the order to number eight in the first innings but managed only a six-ball duck. He lasted just three balls in the second innings as he completed the only pair of his Test career. The injury meant he was not selected for the fourth Test bringing an end to his run of 44 consecutive Test appearances. After an operation to remove a cyst from his lower back, he returned to cricket for Surrey&#x27;s final match of the season against Leicestershire.

Thorpe was included in England&#x27;s 17-man squad for the 1998–99 Ashes series. He began the tour well by scoring a career-best 223 not out in a warm-up match against South Australia, putting together an unbroken partnership of 377 with Ramprakash which broke the record for highest stand by an overseas team in Australia. In the first Test he scored 77 but his back problem resurfaced and he missed the second Test. He suffered more back pain while batting in the tour game against Victoria which forced an end to his tour.

===1999===
Thorpe was selected in the squad for the 1999 World Cup staged in England and proved his fitness in the build-up by scoring two ODI fifties in two days during the Sharjah triangular tournament. Despite home advantage at the World Cup England failed to progress out of the group stage. Thorpe top scored in their win over Zimbabwe, however defeat to South Africa and other results meant they had to beat India to progress. In the decisive match Thorpe scored 36 before receiving a contentious lbw decision from Javed Akhtar, England going on to lose by 63 runs.

Thorpe returned to the Test team for the four-match series with New Zealand. At the end of the first Test he was jeered by the crowd and received criticism for denying nightwatchman Alex Tudor the chance to score a century. Tudor was on 84 as Thorpe arrived at the crease but by outscoring him Tudor was left 99 not out when England reached their target. During the second Test, captain Hussain broke a finger while fielding and left Thorpe to deputise in his place. England lost the match convincingly by nine wickets after which Mark Butcher was chosen as stand-in captain for the next Test. Thorpe finished the series with 147 runs at 24.50, his highest score of 44 came in the defeat at The Oval which saw England lose the series and drop to the bottom of the &quot;Wisden World Championship&quot;.

In a difficult international summer, Thorpe did enjoy success with Surrey, making nine appearances as they won the County Championship title for the first time since 1971.

Thorpe opted out of the winter tour of South Africa citing family reasons having been on England tours, including those with England A, for the previous 10 years.

===2000===
After missing the South Africa series Thorpe was omitted from the first set of central contracts awarded by the ECB for the 2000 English summer. Thorpe struggled for form at the start of the season while playing for Surrey, making 112 runs in nine innings before scoring a century against Somerset in mid-June. He was recalled by England firstly for the ODI squad to play in the Triangular Series and following that to the Test squad for the third match of the West Indies series. His return to Test cricket after 11 months began inauspiciously as he was dismissed lbw from the first delivery he faced, a slower ball from Courtney Walsh that Thorpe lost sight of and ducked into. He contributed scores of 46 and 40 as England won the next two Tests, the latter innings was again ended by a Walsh slower ball.

The tour of Pakistan in late 2000 began with England successfully chasing over 300 in an ODI for the first time as they won their opening match, Thorpe scored an unbeaten 64 in putting on 138 in 17 overs with Andrew Flintoff. In the first Test at Lahore, Thorpe batted for over seven hours to score 118, the innings contained just two boundaries and only one of which was struck before he reached a hundred making it the record for fewest boundaries in a Test century. He added 166 in partnership with Craig White, breaking a sixth-wicket record for England-Pakistan contests. The match was drawn as was the second Test where Thorpe&#x27;s stay at the crease lasted 323 minutes as he made 79. A collapse from the hosts in the third Test at Karachi left England a target of 176 in 44 overs, Thorpe scored an unbeaten 64 to see them to victory, completing the run chase in near darkness due to Pakistan&#x27;s slow over-rate. His series aggregate was 284 runs at 56.80, &quot;Wisden&quot; praised his performance picking out his &quot;judgment of line and length, limitless patience and mental strength&quot;.

===2001===
England&#x27;s second tour of the winter took them to Sri Lanka where the hosts dominated the first Test winning by an innings. Thorpe made contributions of 59 and 46 as England won the second Test in a match overshadowed by poor umpiring decisions. In the deciding Test at Colombo, Thorpe held England&#x27;s first innings together scoring 113 not out from a total of 249 with the next highest score being 26, although he was fortunate to survive a bat-pad catch that was given not out when on 73. On a dramatic third day, 22 wickets fell including Sri Lanka bowled out for 81. In pursuit of a small target of 74 the tourists lost six wickets but a calm 32 from Thorpe completed the victory. He ended the series as leading run-scorer with a tally of 269 runs at an average of 67.25. Captain Nasser Hussain left the tour with a thigh injury after the Tests and Thorpe was chosen as acting captain for the ODI series, Sri Lanka won all three matches convincingly including inflicting a first ever 10-wicket ODI defeat on England in the last game.

In the two-Test home series with Pakistan, Thorpe scored 80 during England&#x27;s innings victory at Lord&#x27;s in the first Test. In the second Test at Old Trafford, Thorpe made his ninth Test century going on to equal his Test best score of 138. He and Michael Vaughan came together at 15/2 in response to Pakistan&#x27;s 403 before sharing a partnership of 267 which was a record for England against Pakistan. Thorpe&#x27;s dismissal brought collapses in both innings with Pakistan taking eight wickets in the final session to win the match. His 228 runs in three innings saw him named as England&#x27;s player of the series.

Thorpe sustained a calf injury in the warm-up before the opening match of the Natwest Series, the issue caused him to miss the whole ODI tournament as well as the first Test of the Ashes series. He returned to the team for the second Test but suffered another injury setback after being struck by a bouncer from Brett Lee which broke a bone in his right hand. He failed to play in the remainder of the series which Australia won 4–1.

Thorpe was selected for England&#x27;s tour of India in 2001–02 and played in the first Test at Mohali, scoring 23 and 62. He flew home before the second Test for &#x27;personal reasons&#x27;, but did return to India for the ODI leg of the tour in January 2002.

===2002===
Following the India series England&#x27;s moved on to New Zealand, beginning their tour with a five-match ODI series. Thorpe scored half-centuries in the third and fourth ODIs with England winning both matches. The first Test match was played at Lancaster Park on a drop-in pitch which got better for batting as the match went on. In England&#x27;s second innings they were 106/5 when Thorpe, having already been dropped by Nathan Astle off his second ball, was joined by Andrew Flintoff. The pair put on a partnership of 281 in 312 balls, surpassing the English record for the sixth-wicket in the process. Thorpe reached his maiden Test double century from 231 balls, at the time the third fastest in Tests, his innings contained 28 fours and four sixes. Set an implausible target of 550, Astle scored the fastest double-century in Test history which briefly threatened a New Zealand win. Thorpe made 57 runs in the next two Tests which were overshadowed by news of Ben Hollioake&#x27;s death, a Surrey and England team-mate of Thorpe.

Sri Lanka toured England in the first part of the 2002 English season to play a three-Test series. In the second Test at Edgbaston, Thorpe reached his 11th Test century thanks to support from number 11 Matthew Hoggard. Thorpe was on 61 when the ninth wicket fell but was able to more than double his score with the stand of 91 being a tenth wicket record for England-Sri Lanka matches. He also passed 5,000 Test runs during the innings, the 14th Englishman to reach the landmark.

Thorpe played in England&#x27;s first three ODIs of the NatWest Series before being omitted from the rest of their matches. At the end of the tournament he announced his retirement from ODI cricket to focus on Test cricket citing the fitness demands of playing in both formats as well as wanting to spend more time with his children. In the first Test against India, Thorpe struggled scoring five runs in two innings with &quot;Wisden&quot; describing him as &#x27;visibly distressed&#x27;. At the conclusion of the match he announced that he was taking a break from cricket stating: &quot;I am feeling very worn down and burnt out by events off the field which have become a major distraction for me and prevented me from focusing fully on my cricket.&quot;

Thorpe returned to cricket seven weeks later for Surrey in a County Championship fixture with Hampshire, scoring a second innings century. He was originally named in England&#x27;s squad for the 2002–03 Ashes after making himself available for selection but reversed his decision two weeks later and withdrew from the tour.

===2003===
During the 2003 English season, Thorpe played for Surrey for most of the campaign and helped them to win the double of National League and Twenty20 Cup. He made 13 appearances in the National League and averaged 47.25, and featured in five matches during the inaugural season of the Twenty20 Cup including the opening night win over Middlesex as well as the victory over Warwickshire in the final.

Thorpe was recalled by England for the final Test of the summer with England trailing South Africa 2–1 in the series, he replaced an injured Nasser Hussain. In response to South Africa&#x27;s 484, Thorpe joined Marcus Trescothick at the wicket with England 78/2 and the pair batted together for five hours in adding 268. This was the fourth occasion of Thorpe being involved in a Test partnership of more than 250 and his innings of 126 was his first century for England at The Oval. England would go on to win the match and draw the series.

The Oval century ensured Thorpe&#x27;s place in the squad for the tours of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In Bangladesh he scored two half-centuries as England won both Tests. However on the Sri Lankan leg of the tour he struggled against Muttiah Muralitharan&#x27;s doosra and was dismissed by him five times, across the three Tests he scored 183 runs at 30.50.

===2004===
Thorpe was selected for his third tour of the West Indies in 2004 for a four-Test series. In the second Test, he top-scored with an innings of 90 with &quot;Wisden&quot; commenting that &quot;he pulled and hooked majestically&quot;. He followed that by scoring his 13th Test century in the next Test at the Kensington Oval under tough circumstances. England lost wickets regularly in their first innings but Thorpe remained, and with support from the tail was able to reach three figures and put his side into a narrow lead. His unbeaten score of 119 was more than half the team total of 226 with the next highest contribution being 17. He was named man of the match as England won the Test to secure a first series victory in the Caribbean since 1968. In the final Test, Brian Lara scored 400 not out to break the record for highest score in Test cricket for a second time in his career, Thorpe witnessed both innings having also been in the opposition during his score of 375 in 1994. Thorpe ended the series with 274 runs at an average of 91.33.

In the home series with New Zealand, Thorpe twice helped England to successful fourth innings run chases of more than 280. At Lord&#x27;s he made a half-century in an unbroken stand of 139 alongside Nasser Hussain who scored a century in his final Test innings. In the third Test at Trent Bridge, Thorpe arrived at the wicket with England 46/3 in pursuit of 284 before making his 14th Test century which with support down the order lead his team to a four wicket victory. The innings, which won him the man of the match award, was noted for its cover drives with &quot;Wisden&quot; stating that he &quot;scored heavily between point and extra cover&quot;. The 3–0 series score made it England&#x27;s first whitewash of a three-match series since 1978.

England continued their success during the second half of the English season as they beat the touring West Indies 4–0. Thorpe contributed a pair of half-centuries in the second Test at Edgbaston. In the following match at Old Trafford, he began his innings in partnership with Andrew Strauss for the first time and the two left-handers added 177 for the third wicket recovering the score from 40/3. Thorpe broke his little finger when struck by a Fidel Edwards bouncer on 91 but batted on to reach his 15th Test century with a score of 114. Due to the injury Thorpe was unable to field and not called upon to bat in the second innings as England won the match by seven wickets. He also missed the final Test with Ian Bell taking his place. Across the series Thorpe made 286 runs at 57.20 however he did drop several catches with &quot;Wisden&quot; picking out &quot;his increasingly unreliable and slow performances in the field&quot;.

England began a tour of South Africa in December playing five Tests. In winning the opening match England achieved their eighth consecutive Test victory, a national record. In the second Test at Durban, Thorpe scored his 16th Test century helping England to recover a first innings deficit of 193. Despite centuries from Strauss and Marcus Trescothick, the match was in the balance when Thorpe began his innings but century stands with Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones helped secure a position from which they were able to declare, Thorpe remaining unbeaten on 118. In South Africa&#x27;s second innings he became the fifth Englishman to register 100 Test catches as a fielder. Thorpe&#x27;s other significant contribution of the series came in the final Test at Centurion Park where he batted over five and a half hours for a patient 86, taking time from a match South Africa needed to win to level the series. Overall he had an indifferent series, averaging 35.87, with &quot;Wisden&quot; assessing that he was &quot;generally less convincing than in the past&quot;.

===2005===
At the start of the English season, Thorpe was in poor form making 78 runs in five County Championship innings while also missing a match due to a back injury. However he was included in England&#x27;s squad for the two Tests against Bangladesh. He made 42 not out in the first Test and an unbeaten 66 in the second, during the latter innings he combined with Ian Bell to add 187 runs from 193 balls. Against weak opposition, England won both matches comfortably by an innings. The second Test brought Thorpe his 100th Test appearance, becoming the eighth English player to reach the landmark.

The form shown by Kevin Pietersen in the ODIs against Australia led to media speculation over which of Thorpe or Pietersen would be selected for the Ashes series. They opted for Pietersen with chairman of selectors David Graveney describing it as &quot;the most difficult decision that I have been party to in my time as a selector&quot;. On 22 July, Thorpe announced his retirement from international cricket citing the arrival of his third child as the main reason behind the decision. A month later he retired from all first-class cricket stating: &quot;In purely physical terms, I don&#x27;t want to go through another season of taking painkillers and having injections in my back.&quot; He had intended to finish at the end of the season but suffered a back spasm ahead of the match with Hampshire and was not included in Surrey&#x27;s squad for final game of the season, so his final first-class appearance came against Gloucestershire prior to the announcement.

==Style and personality==
Thorpe was a batsman capable of adapting to attack or defence depending on the match situation. He was considered a counter-attacking batsman in the early stages of his international career before evolving into a more &#x27;pragmatic player of percentages&#x27;. After being recalled in 1994, Thorpe returned with more intent to play his shots. His innings in that South Africa series were noted for their attacking nature and his strike rate of 65.30 was one of the highest of his career. Thorpe was not considered a powerful batsman but instead relied on crisp stroke-play and skillful placement of shots.

Thorpe was adept against fast or spin bowling but after the successful tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2000–01 he earned a reputation as the team&#x27;s best player of spin. According to Alec Stewart, Thorpe adapted his batting method during the Pakistan tour from being stroke-maker to being a &#x27;nudger and nurdler&#x27;. Mike Atherton rated Thorpe&#x27;s Colombo century in testing conditions as &quot;one of the finest I ever saw from an England player&quot; despite a lack of fluent strokeplay. He described his technique as akin to French cricket where he played the ball late, with a low backlift and was able to use his wrists to place his shots past the fielders.

Writing in 2011, David Gower ranked Thorpe as the second best English batsman from those he had either played with or commentated on. He picked out his versality and ability to play Muralitharan. Angus Fraser assessed that Thorpe would be remembered as a good rather than great batsman because of his 16 Test centuries he only went on to pass 130 three times.

Thorpe was viewed as a quiet man, but on occasion had difficulties with authority figures. He clashed with his first county captain Ian Greig and was opposed to Surrey having separate dressing rooms for players depending on if they were capped or not. For England, he often failed to stick to the dress code but his most severe indiscretion came days ahead of the 1999 World Cup when he failed to attend an official function and was fined £1,000 by the ECB. In 2004, he outspokenly criticised the ECB for allowing England to tour Zimbabwe for an ODI series when they had pulled out of playing a World Cup match in the country the previous year.

David Lloyd, England coach from 1996 to 1999, was critical of Thorpe&#x27;s attitude, accusing him of being surly and divisive. Ahead of Thorpe&#x27;s recall in 2003, Fraser and Mike Selvey questioned the decision as potentially disrupting the team spirit. Fraser stated Thorpe was &quot;his own man&quot; who did not conform to the &quot;little things that make a team a team&quot;.

==Records and statistics==

At the time of his retirement Thorpe&#x27;s 6,744 Test runs placed him tenth on the list of leading run-scorers for England, with his 16 hundreds placing him joint ninth on the list of century makers. Thorpe spent the majority of his career batting at either number 4 or 5. He averaged 56.21 when batting at number 5 and his 3,373 runs in that position is an England record. He was noted for his record in a winning cause and successful fourth innings run chases. He averaged 62.62 in the 38 Test victories he experienced and averaged 108.25 in successful fourth innings run chases.

Thorpe was involved in four Test partnerships worth 250 or more, the only England player to have done so. The largest of these was a stand of 288 with Nasser Hussain which was the England fourth wicket record against Australia until surpassed by Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood in 2006. His sixth wicket partnership of 281 with Andrew Flintoff was an England Test record for that wicket until bettered by Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in 2016.

At the time of his ODI retirement in 2002, Thorpe&#x27;s 2,380 runs placed him eighth on the list of leading run-scorers for England in the format. That run tally is the highest of any England player who never managed to score an ODI century.

In the ICC batting rankings Thorpe peaked at number 3 for Test cricket ahead of the West Indies tour in 1998. His peak in the ODI rankings was number 10.

===Test centuries===
During his career Thorpe made 16 centuries in international cricket, all of which were scored in Test matches. He scored multiple centuries against the six teams he played most often in Tests, but did not reach three figures against India (five Tests), Bangladesh (four Tests) or Zimbabwe (two Tests). The Kensington Oval was the only overseas ground at which he made two Test centuries, and despite playing more Tests at Lord&#x27;s than any other ground he never got on their honours board, with a best score of 89.

==Post-playing career==
===Coaching===
Ahead of playing in the 2005 Bangladesh series Thorpe announced he would coach for New South Wales the following winter as well as playing Sydney Grade Cricket. He played for UTS Balmain and was available to play for New South Wales, if required, but made only one second XI appearance for the state side. After two seasons as batting consultant for New South Wales, he was named assistant coach ahead of the 2007–08 campaign, replacing Matthew Mott who was promoted to the position of head coach. In January 2008, he resigned from the position for business and family reasons. Later that year he returned to Surrey as batting coach, holding the position for two years before joining the ECB in a national lead batting coach role working with the England Lions and younger development squads.

At the start of 2013, the ECB split the coaching of the Test and white ball sides, as part of this reshuffle Thorpe became batting coach for the senior England white ball teams. Following the appointment of Chris Silverwood as England head coach in 2019, Thorpe was named as one of his three assistants. During the COVID-19 affected summer of 2020, Thorpe was interim head coach for England&#x27;s Twenty20 series with Pakistan. He also stood in during the fourth Test of the 2021–22 Ashes series with Silverwood self-isolating. Following the end of the series, Thorpe was involved in an drinking session with England and Australia players which continued until 6a.m. and resulted in the police being called. He was among those to be dismissed by the ECB after the 4–0 Ashes defeat.

In March 2022, Thorpe was announced as the new head coach of Afghanistan, but fell seriously ill before beginning the role.

===Media===
Thorpe worked with BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s commentary team for the final Test of the 2005 Ashes. He made his debut as a summariser for BBC Radio&#x27;s Test Match Special programme during India&#x27;s 2007 tour of England. He also appeared as a match summariser on Sky Sports&#x27; highlights coverage for the same series.

In September 2005 Thorpe released an autobiography entitled &quot;Rising from the Ashes&quot;. He wrote a monthly column for the UK-based cricket magazine, &quot;SPIN World Cricket Monthly&quot;.

Thorpe appeared on an Ashes special edition of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in 2005. He also competed on the 2008 remake of &quot;Superstars&quot;.

===Honours===
Thorpe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2006 Birthday Honours.

As part of the extension of the Oval members&#x27; pavilion in 2021, a room was named after Thorpe.

There is a street in Maggona, Sri Lanka named &#x27;Graham Thorpe Road&#x27;. Following the 2004 tsunami, Surrey organised a charity match which raised funds of £1.5 million to help re-build the village and create the Surrey Village Cricket Ground.

In November 2024, a new trophy was launched named the Crowe-Thorpe Trophy in tribute to Thorpe and New Zealand batsman Martin Crowe. The trophy will be played for in Test series between England and New Zealand.

==Personal life and death==
Thorpe married his first wife Nicola in September 1995 having first met her on a Surrey pre-season tour to Dubai. The couple had two children, a boy born in November 1996 and a girl born in April 1999. The couple separated in late 2001, with Graham leaving India for England in a failed attempt to save the relationship. The resulting divorce proceedings and custody battle led to him taking a break from cricket in the summer of 2002.

Thorpe met his second wife Amanda at a benefit function for his Surrey team-mate Ali Brown. The couple had a child together in August 2005 before getting married in 2007; his wife also had a daughter from her first marriage. 

Thorpe suffered from severe depression and anxiety in the final years of his life, and was admitted to intensive care following a suicide attempt in May 2022. On 10 May 2022, the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association released a statement on behalf of Thorpe&#x27;s family stating that he was seriously ill, though the nature of his condition was not disclosed. 

On 4 August 2024 Thorpe took his own life by stepping in front of a train at Esher railway station; he was 55 years old. His family publicly revealed his cause of death and mental health struggles a week after his death, with the intention of raising awareness.

<text>A truss is an assembly of &quot;members&quot; such as beams, connected by &quot;nodes&quot;, that creates a rigid structure.

In engineering, a truss is a structure that &quot;consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object&quot;. A &quot;two-force member&quot; is a structural component where force is applied to only two points. Although this rigorous definition allows the members to have any shape connected in any stable configuration, architectural trusses typically comprise five or more triangular units constructed with straight members whose ends are connected at joints referred to as &quot;nodes&quot;.

In this typical context, external forces and reactions to those forces are considered to act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members that are either tensile or compressive. For straight members, moments (torques) are explicitly excluded because, and only because, all the joints in a truss are treated as revolutes, as is necessary for the links to be two-force members.

A planar truss is one where all members and nodes lie within a two-dimensional plane, while a space frame has members and nodes that extend into three dimensions. The top beams in a truss are called &#x27;top chords&#x27; and are typically in compression, the bottom beams are called &#x27;bottom chords&#x27;, and are typically in tension. The interior beams are called &quot;webs&quot;, and the areas inside the webs are called &quot;panels&quot;, or from graphic statics (see Cremona diagram) &#x27;polygons&#x27;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Truss&quot; derives from the Old French word &quot;trousse&quot;, from around 1200 AD, which means &quot;collection of things bound together&quot;. The term &quot;truss&quot; has often been used to describe any assembly of members such as a cruck frame or a couple of rafters.

== Characteristics ==
A truss consists of typically (but not necessarily) straight members connected at joints, traditionally termed &quot;panel points&quot;. Trusses are typically (but not necessarily) composed of triangles because of the structural stability of that shape and design. A triangle is the simplest geometric figure that will not change shape when the lengths of the sides are fixed. In comparison, both the angles and the lengths of a four-sided figure must be fixed for it to retain its shape.

===Simple truss===

The simplest form of a truss is one single triangle. This type of truss is seen in a framed roof consisting of rafters and a ceiling joist, and in other mechanical structures such as bicycles and aircraft. Because of the stability of this shape and the methods of analysis used to calculate the forces within it, a truss composed entirely of triangles is known as a simple truss. However, a simple truss is often defined more restrictively by demanding that it can be constructed through successive addition of pairs of members, each connected to two existing joints and to each other to form a new joint, and this definition does not require a simple truss to comprise only triangles. The traditional diamond-shape bicycle frame, which utilizes two conjoined triangles, is an example of a simple truss.

===Planar truss===

A planar truss lies in a single plane. Planar trusses are typically used in parallel to form roofs and bridges.

The depth of a truss, or the height between the upper and lower chords, is what makes it an efficient structural form. A solid girder or beam of equal strength would have substantial weight and material cost as compared to a truss. For a given span, a deeper truss will require less material in the chords and greater material in the verticals and diagonals. An optimum depth of the truss will maximize the efficiency.

===Space frame truss===
A space frame truss is a three-dimensional framework of members pinned at their ends. A tetrahedron shape is the simplest space truss, consisting of six members that meet at four joints. Large planar structures may be composed from tetrahedrons with common edges, and they are also employed in the base structures of large free-standing power line pylons.

==Types==
: &quot;For more truss types, see truss types used in bridges.&quot;
There are two basic types of truss:
* The pitched truss, or common truss, is characterized by its triangular shape. It is most often used for roof construction. Some common trusses are named according to their &quot;web configuration&quot;. The chord size and web configuration are determined by span, load and spacing.
* The parallel chord truss, or flat truss, gets its name from its parallel top and bottom chords. It is often used for floor construction.

A combination of the two is a truncated truss, used in hip roof construction. A metal plate-connected wood truss is a roof or floor truss whose wood members are connected with metal connector plates.

===Warren truss===

Truss members form a series of equilateral triangles, alternating up and down.

===Octet truss===
Truss members are made up of all equivalent equilateral triangles. The minimum composition is two regular tetrahedrons along with an octahedron. They fill up three dimensional space in a variety of configurations.

===Pratt truss===
The Pratt truss was patented in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers, Caleb Pratt and his son Thomas Willis Pratt. The design uses vertical members for compression and diagonal members to respond to tension. The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is probably due to the fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to buckling under compression loads (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient under static, vertical loading.

The Southern Pacific Railroad bridge in Tempe, Arizona is a 393 meter (1,291 foot) long truss bridge built in 1912. The structure, still in use today, consists of nine Pratt truss spans of varying lengths.

The Wright Flyer used a Pratt truss in its wing construction, as the minimization of compression member lengths allowed for lower aerodynamic drag.
===Town&#x27;s lattice truss===
American architect Ithiel Town designed Town&#x27;s Lattice Truss as an alternative to heavy-timber bridges. His design, patented in 1820 and 1835, uses easy-to-handle planks arranged diagonally with short spaces in between them, to form a lattice.

===Bowstring truss===

Named for their shape, bowstring trusses were first used for arched truss bridges, often confused with tied-arch bridges.

Thousands of bowstring trusses were used during World War II for holding up the curved roofs of aircraft hangars and other military buildings. Many variations exist in the arrangements of the members connecting the nodes of the upper arc with those of the lower, straight sequence of members, from nearly isosceles triangles to a variant of the Pratt truss.

===King and queen post trusses===
One of the simplest truss styles to implement, the king post consists of two angled supports leaning into a common vertical support.
The queen post truss, sometimes &quot;queenpost&quot; or &quot;queenspost&quot;, is similar to a king post truss in that the outer supports are angled towards the centre of the structure. The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the centre which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.


===Lenticular truss===

Lenticular trusses, patented in 1878 by William Douglas (although the Gaunless Bridge of 1823 was the first of the type), have the top and bottom chords of the truss arched, forming a lens shape. A lenticular pony truss bridge is a bridge design that involves a lenticular truss extending above and below the roadbed.

===Vierendeel structure===

The members of a Vierendeel structure are not triangulated but form rectangular openings. The structure has a frame with fixed joints that are capable of transferring and resisting bending moments. As such, it does not fit the definition of a truss, since it contains non-two-force members: regular trusses comprise members that are commonly assumed to have pinned joints, with the implication that no moments exist at the jointed ends. This style of structure was named after the Belgian engineer Arthur Vierendeel, who developed the design in 1896. It is rarely used for bridges because of higher costs compared to a triangulated truss, but in buildings it has the advantage that a large amount of the exterior envelope remains unobstructed and it can therefore be used for windows and door openings. In some applications this is preferable to a braced-frame system, which would leave some areas obstructed by the diagonal braces.

==Statics==

A truss that is assumed to comprise members that are connected by means of pin joints, and which is supported at both ends by means of hinged joints and rollers, is described as being statically determinate. Newton&#x27;s Laws apply to the structure as a whole, as well as to each node or joint. In order for any node that may be subject to an external load or force to remain static in space, the following conditions must hold: the sums of all (horizontal and vertical) forces, as well as all moments acting about the node equal zero. Analysis of these conditions at each node yields the magnitude of the compression or tension forces.

Trusses that are supported at more than two positions are said to be statically indeterminate, and the application of Newton&#x27;s Laws alone is not sufficient to determine the member forces.

In order for a truss with pin-connected members to be stable, it does not need to be entirely composed of triangles. In mathematical terms, the following necessary condition for stability of a simple truss exists:

:formula_1
where &quot;m&quot; is the total number of truss members, &quot;j&quot; is the total number of joints and &quot;r&quot; is the number of reactions (equal to 3 generally) in a 2-dimensional structure.

When formula_2, the truss is said to be &quot;statically determinate&quot;, because the (&quot;m&quot;+3) internal member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2&quot;j&quot; equilibrium equations, once we know the external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member is taken out (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the load carrying capacity of the members.

Some structures are built with more than this minimum number of truss members. Those structures may survive even when some of the members fail. Their member forces depend on the relative stiffness of the members, in addition to the equilibrium condition described.

==Analysis==

Because the forces in each of its two main girders are essentially planar, a truss is usually modeled as a two-dimensional plane frame. However if there are significant out-of-plane forces, the structure must be modeled as a three-dimensional space.

The analysis of trusses often assumes that loads are applied to joints only and not at intermediate points along the members. The weight of the members is often insignificant compared to the applied loads and so is often omitted; alternatively, half of the weight of each member may be applied to its two end joints. Provided that the members are long and slender, the moments transmitted through the joints are negligible, and the junctions can be treated as &quot;hinges&quot; or &quot;pin-joints&quot;.

Under these simplifying assumptions, every member of the truss is then subjected to pure compression or pure tension forces – shear, bending moment, and other more-complex stresses are all practically zero. Trusses are physically stronger than other ways of arranging structural elements, because nearly every material can resist a much larger load in tension or compression than in shear, bending, torsion, or other kinds of force.

These simplifications make trusses easier to analyze. Structural analysis of trusses of any type can readily be carried out using a matrix method such as the direct stiffness method, the flexibility method, or the finite element method.
===Forces in members===
Illustrated is a simple, statically determinate flat truss with 9 joints and (2 x 9) − 3 = 15 members. External loads are concentrated in the outer joints. Since this is a symmetrical truss with symmetrical vertical loads, the reactive forces at A and B are vertical, equal, and half the total load.

The internal forces in the members of the truss can be calculated in a variety of ways, including graphical methods:
* Cremona diagram
* Culmann diagram
* Ritter analytical method (method of sections)

===Design of members===
A truss can be thought of as a beam where the web consists of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the &quot;bottom chord&quot;) and the upper horizontal member (the &quot;top chord&quot;) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the bottom chord is in tension, and the top chord in compression.

The diagonal and vertical members form the &quot;truss web&quot;, and carry the shear stress. Individually, they are also in tension and compression, the exact arrangement of forces is depending on the type of truss and again on the direction of bending. In the truss shown above right, the vertical members are in tension, and the diagonals are in compression.

In addition to carrying the static forces, the members serve additional functions of stabilizing each other, preventing buckling. In the adjacent picture, the top chord is prevented from buckling by the presence of bracing and by the stiffness of the web members.

The inclusion of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being a balance between the costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery and the cost of labor. In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as prestressed concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges.

Once the force on each member is known, the next step is to determine the cross section of the individual truss members. For members under tension the cross-sectional area &quot;A&quot; can be found using &quot;A&quot; = &quot;F&quot; × γ / σ&quot;y&quot;, where &quot;F&quot; is the force in the member, γ is a safety factor (typically 1.5 but depending on building codes) and σy is the yield tensile strength of the steel used.

The members under compression also have to be designed to be safe against buckling.

The weight of a truss member depends directly on its cross section—that weight partially determines how strong the other members of the truss need to be. Giving one member a larger cross section than on a previous iteration requires giving other members a larger cross section as well, to hold the greater weight of the first member—one needs to go through another iteration to find exactly how much greater the other members need to be. Sometimes the designer goes through several iterations of the design process to converge on the &quot;right&quot; cross section for each member. On the other hand, reducing the size of one member from the previous iteration merely makes the other members have a larger (and more expensive) safety factor than is technically necessary, but doesn&#x27;t &quot;require&quot; another iteration to find a buildable truss.

The effect of the weight of the individual truss members in a large truss, such as a bridge, is usually insignificant compared to the force of the external loads.

===Design of joints===
After determining the minimum cross section of the members, the last step in the design of a truss would be detailing of the bolted joints, e.g., involving shear stress of the bolt connections used in the joints. Based on the needs of the project, truss internal connections (joints) can be designed as rigid, semi rigid, or hinged. Rigid connections can allow transfer of bending moments leading to development of secondary bending moments in the members.

==Applications==
===Post frame structures===

Component connections are critical to the structural integrity of a framing system. In buildings with large, clearspan wood trusses, the most critical connections are those between the truss and its supports. In addition to gravity-induced forces (a.k.a. bearing loads), these connections must resist shear forces acting perpendicular to the plane of the truss and uplift forces due to wind. Depending upon overall building design, the connections may also be required to transfer bending moment.

Wood posts enable the fabrication of strong, direct, yet inexpensive connections between large trusses and walls. Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, and may be influenced by post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.

== Theorem ==
Let be a (Artinian) semisimple ring. Then the Wedderburn–Artin theorem states that is isomorphic to a product of finitely many -by- matrix rings formula_1 over division rings , for some integers , both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index . 

There is also a version of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem for algebras over a field . If is a finite-dimensional semisimple -algebra, then each in the above statement is a finite-dimensional division algebra over . The center of each need not be ; it could be a finite extension of .

Note that if is a finite-dimensional simple algebra over a division ring &quot;E&quot;, &quot;D&quot; need not be contained in &quot;E&quot;. For example, matrix rings over the complex numbers are finite-dimensional simple algebras over the real numbers.

== Proof ==
There are various proofs of the Wedderburn–Artin theorem. A common modern one takes the following approach. 

Suppose the ring formula_2 is semisimple. Then the right formula_2-module formula_4 is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of simple modules (which are the same as minimal right ideals of formula_2). Write this direct sum as
: formula_6
where the formula_7 are mutually nonisomorphic simple right formula_2-modules, the th one appearing with multiplicity formula_9. This gives an isomorphism of endomorphism rings
: formula_10
and we can identify formula_11 with a ring of matrices
: formula_12
where the endomorphism ring formula_13 of formula_7 is a division ring by Schur&#x27;s lemma, because formula_7 is simple. Since formula_16 we conclude
: formula_17

Here we used right modules because formula_16; if we used left modules formula_2 would be isomorphic to the opposite algebra of formula_20, but the proof would still go through. To see this proof in a larger context, see Decomposition of a module. For the proof of an important special case, see Simple Artinian ring.

== Consequences ==
Since a finite-dimensional algebra over a field is Artinian, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem implies that every finite-dimensional simple algebra over a field is isomorphic to an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix ring over some finite-dimensional division algebra &quot;D&quot; over formula_21, where both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are uniquely determined. This was shown by Joseph Wedderburn. Emil Artin later generalized this result to the case of simple left or right Artinian rings. 

Since the only finite-dimensional division algebra over an algebraically closed field is the field itself, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem has strong consequences in this case. Let be a semisimple ring that is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field formula_21. Then is a finite product formula_23 where the formula_24 are positive integers and formula_25 is the algebra of formula_26 matrices over formula_21. 

Furthermore, the Wedderburn–Artin theorem reduces the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central simple algebras over a field formula_21 to the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central division algebras over formula_21: that is, division algebras over formula_21 whose center is formula_21. It implies that any finite-dimensional central simple algebra over formula_21 is isomorphic to a matrix algebra formula_33
where formula_34 is a finite-dimensional central division algebra over formula_21.

<text>Deshabandu Sanath Teran Jayasuriya (, ; born 30 June 1969), is a former Sri Lankan cricketer, captain, cricket administrator and coach. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest all rounders ever to play in ODI cricket. A left arm orthodox spinner, left handed batter and a dynamic fielder, Jayasuriya together with his opening partner Romesh Kaluwitharana is credited for having revolutionized one-day international cricket with his explosive batting in the mid-1990s, which initiated the hard-hitting modern-day batting strategy of all nations. He was a key member of the Sri Lankan team that won 1996 Cricket World Cup. Under his captaincy Sri Lanka became joint champions along with India in the 2002 Champions Trophy. Currently, he is the head coach of the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team.

Considered one of the greatest attacking batsmen of all time, Jayasuriya is well known for his powerful striking and match-winning all-round performances in all formats of the game. Jayasuriya was an all-rounder, who had an international cricket career that spread over two decades. He is the only player to achieve the all rounder double of scoring over 10,000 runs and capturing more than 300 wickets in a single format of cricket and is regarded as one of the best all-rounders in the history of limited-overs cricket. Jayasuriya created many world records during his career.

Jayasuriya was named the Most Valuable Player of 1996 Cricket World Cup and Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack broke an age-old tradition by naming him one of Five Cricketers&#x27; of the Year 1997 despite not playing the previous season in England. Jayasuriya was also the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team from 1999 to 2003. He was also a key member of the team that won the 1996 Cricket World Cup and was part of the team that made the finals of 2007 Cricket World Cup and 2009 ICC World Twenty20. He retired from Test cricket in December 2007 and from limited-overs cricket in June 2011. On 28 January 2013, Sri Lanka Cricket appointed him as the chairman of the cricket selection committee. Sri Lanka won the ICC World Twenty20 for the first time in 2014, during his tenure as the chief selector.

Jayasuriya ran for public office at the 2010 Sri Lankan general elections and was elected to the parliament from his native Matara District. He topped the UPFA parliamentary election list for Matara district by obtaining 74,352 preferential votes.
He served as the deputy minister of Postal services in the former UPFA government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, and later as the Deputy Minister of Local Government &amp; Rural Development under president Maithripala Sirisena. Jayasuriya did not contest for the 2015 Sri Lankan general election, though he won most votes from Matara district under UPFA in the 2010 Sri Lankan general election. He is currently not active in politics.

== Early life and career ==
Sanath Jayasuriya was born in the Southern Sri Lankan city of Matara, to the family of Dunstan and Breeda Jayasuriya. He has an elder brother, Chandana Jayasuriya. He was educated at St. Servatius&#x27; College, Matara, where his cricketing talents were nourished by his school principal, G.L. Galappathy, and cricket coach, Lionel Wagasinghe. He excelled in cricket while at St. Servatius College, Matara and captained the college cricket team at the annual St. Thomas&#x27;–St. Servatius Cricket Encounter in 1988. Jayasuriya was picked as the &#x27;Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year&#x27; in the Outstation Segment in 1988. He also received the awards for the &#x27;Best Batsman&#x27; and &#x27;Best All-rounder&#x27; in the Outstation Segment at the Observer School Cricket Awards ceremony in the same year. Jayasuriya represented Sri Lanka in the inaugural ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup which was held in Australia in 1988 and was subsequently selected for a tour in Pakistan a few months later with the Sri Lanka &#x27;B&#x27; team, where he made two unbeaten double centuries. Shortly afterward he was drafted into the national side for the tour to Australia in 1989–90.
He made his One Day International debut against Australia at Melbourne on Boxing Day of 1989 and his Test debut against New Zealand at Hamilton in February 1991.

== Style and international career ==
===Batting style===
Along with his opening partner Romesh Kaluwitharana, Jayasuriya revolutionized One Day International batting with his aggressive tactics during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, a strategy they first tried on the preceding tour of Australia. The tactic used was to take advantage of the early fielding restrictions by smashing the opening bowlers to all parts of the cricket ground, particularly by lofting their deliveries over the mandatory infielders, rather than the established tactic of building up momentum gradually. This was a novel but potentially match-winning tactic at that time, and Sri Lanka, who had previously never made it out of the preliminary rounds, went on to win the World Cup without a single defeat. Their new gameplan is now the standard opening batting strategy in limited-overs cricket for the modern era. Glenn McGrath cited Jayasuriya in his XI of toughest batsmen, noting &quot;it is always a massive compliment to someone to say they changed the game, and his storming innings in the 1996 World Cup changed everyone&#x27;s thinking about how to start innings.&quot;

Jayasuriya is known for both cuts and pulls along with his trademark shot, a lofted cut over point. He was one of the key players in Sri Lanka&#x27;s victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he was adjudged Man of the Tournament in recognition of his all-around contributions.
His philosophy towards batting is summarized by an all-aggression approach and over the years he has dominated almost every one-day bowling combination that he has faced at one stage or another. This is because of his ability to make huge match-winning contributions at a rapid pace once he gets in, he holds the record for the second-highest number of one day centuries and has scored the 4th most 150+ scores (4 scores) jointly with Chris Gayle and Hashim Amla. Only Rohit Sharma, David Warner and Sachin Tendulkar have more 150+ scores than him, (Rohit Sharma has the most 150+ scores at 7). His devastating performances have ensured that Sri Lanka has won almost over 75% of the matches that he scored over 50 runs in limited-overs cricket. When asked in an interview who are the most challenging bowlers he had faced in the game, he named in the order Wasim Akram, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose.
===Bowling style===
Jayasuriya was a left-arm orthodox spin bowler known for quickly getting through his overs. Although a spinner, he was used to bowling faster balls and yorkers with quick arm action which gained him success as a bowler. He took 440 wickets altogether in international cricket with six 5 wicket hauls. His best bowling performance in an innings in international cricket is 6 for 29, which he took against England in an ODI in 1993. It was the best bowling performance by a Sri Lankan in ODIs until Muttiah Muralitharan broke the record in 2000. Jayasuriya&#x27;s best match figures in test cricket came in 2001/2002 season when he took 9 for 74 against Zimbabwe.

One of Jayasuriya&#x27;s memorable bowling performances came in the semi-final of 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he took three wickets for just 12 runs in seven overs. It was Jayasuriya who took the vital wicket of Sachin Tendulkar and broke his crucial partnership with Sanjay Manjrekar, which was taking the game away from Sri Lankans at one stage. Jayasuriya was the most successful bowler for Sri Lanka during the knockout stage of 1996 cricket World Cup where he took 6 wickets in three games. As an all-rounder, he took 27 wickets in Cricket world cups altogether including 10 wickets he took in 2003 edition.

===Test career===
Sanath Jayasuriya held the record for the highest Test score made by a Sri Lankan, 340 against India in 1997. This effort was part of a second-wicket partnership with Roshan Mahanama that set the then all-time record for any partnership in Test history, with 576 runs. Both records were surpassed in July 2006 when fellow Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene scored 374 as part of a 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara against South Africa. On 20 September 2005, during the Second Test of the home series against Bangladesh, Jayasuriya became the first Sri Lankan to play 100 Tests, and the 33rd Test cricketer to achieve this feat.

Jayasuriya announced his intention to retire from Test cricket following the Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka in April 2006. He reversed his decision soon after, however, joining the Sri Lankan cricket team in England in May 2006. Missing the first two Tests, Jayasuriya returned in the Third Test at Trent Bridge.

After scoring 78 runs on day three of the first Test against England in Kandy in 2007, he announced he was to retire from Test cricket at the end of the match. In that innings he hit six fours in one over against James Anderson.

===One Day International career===
===2009–2010===
Jayasuriya held the records for the fastest fifty (against Pakistan 17 balls), fastest 100 for Sri Lanka (against Pakistan 48 balls) and fastest 150 (against England in 95 balls) in ODI cricket. His fastest 50 stayed 19 years, where his half-century is regarded as the best because he achieved this feat in an era where no fielding restrictions and power plays are available. It took 19 years to surpass the fastest 50 with all limited over new restrictions and other fielding restrictions. However, he subsequently lost the fastest fifty to AB de Villiers. Jayasuriya is the only player of the ODI history to have scored two consecutive 150+ scores.

Jayasuriya&#x27;s highest ODI score is 189 runs, scored against India in Sharjah in 2000. It remained as the highest ODI score by a Sri Lankan and the third-highest in ODI history at that time. Currently the score is 11th highest ODI score of all time and highest by a Sri Lankan. In 2024, Pathum Nissanka made unbeaten 210* runs against Afghanistan, breaking Jayasuriya&#x27;s 24-year-old record.

Jayasuriya was the previous record-holder for the fastest century (off 48 balls), before losing that to Shahid Afridi&#x27;s 37 ball century. This is cited as the first ever fastest century scored in less than 50 balls in world cricket. The record was then broken by Corey Anderson of New Zealand (36 balls), which is currently held by AB de Villiers of South Africa with 31 ball century. He has also held the world record for most ODI sixes (270 in 445 ODIs), which was surpassed by Shahid Afridi during the 2010 Asia Cup match against Bangladesh. He became the fourth batsman to score more than 10,000 runs and the second batsman to score more than 12,000, and 13,000 runs in the history of ODIs. He also has 28 centuries, the fourth-highest in ODIs. He held the record of scoring most runs in an ODI over (30; he has achieved this twice), and the first batsman to score over 30 in an over. This record is now held by South Africa&#x27;s Herschelle Gibbs (36 runs in an over).

During the one-day Natwest series in May 2006 in England, he scored two centuries, including scoring 152 off 99 balls in the final match. In that innings, he and Upul Tharanga (109) put on 286 runs for the first wicket, a new record. Jayasuriya&#x27;s batting display earned him the Man of the Series award as Sri Lanka whitewashed England for the first time in their home soil by winning the series 5–0.

Following the Natwest Trophy, Sri Lanka travelled to the Netherlands for a two-match one-day series. In the first game, Jayasuriya scored 157 off 104 balls as Sri Lanka posted 443/9, beating the 438/9 South Africa scored against Australia in March 2006. Sri Lanka won the match by 195 runs. On a personal note, the innings was his 4th score of over 150 and was also his second successive score of 150 plus, only player to achieve the feat in ODI history.

He also scored 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries in the 2007 Cricket World Cup held in the West Indies. In 2008, his one-day career was all but over when he was omitted for the ODIs in the West Indies. However, a stirring performance in the IPL—finishing the third-highest run-getter with 514 runs—prompted his country&#x27;s sports minister to intervene in his selection for the Asia Cup. He ultimately shaped Sri Lanka&#x27;s title victory with a blistering hundred under pressure. His international career has been revived at the age of 41, after being recalled to the One-day and Twenty-20 squads for Sri Lanka&#x27;s 2011 tour of England and Scotland.

During 2008 Asia Cup, Jayasuriya scored a century against Bangladesh on his 39th birthday. With this century, he became the third cricketer out of four overall, to score an ODI century on a birthday. The two others before Jayasuriya to score the century were two Indians Vinod Kambli and Sachin Tendulkar. The last one to score a century on his birthday is blackcap Ross Taylor. His knock of 125 in the finals was voted as the Best ODI Batting Performance of 2008 by ESPNcricinfo.

===Twenty20 career===
During the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Jayasuriya appeared to break his tradition of using Kookaburra bats by wielding a normal Reebok sponsored bat. He achieved two half-centuries in the group stages against New Zealand and Kenya in this tournament. He also shares a dubious record with James Anderson for having the most expensive figures in a Twenty20 international, having been hit for 64 runs in the maximum of 4 overs.
After the Twenty20 World Cup, Jayasuriya played in Sri Lanka&#x27;s 3–2 One Day International series defeat against England, achieving limited success and then in the 2–0 Test series defeat in Australia. In December 2007, Jayasuriya confirmed that he has signed for Warwickshire for the Twenty20 Cup.

In April 2008, he joined the Mumbai Indians to play in the Indian Premier League T20.
After scoring a devastating 114 not out off just 48 balls for the Mumbai Indians against Chennai, Jayasuriya regained his position in the one-day side after he had been dropped for the West Indies tour. For his performances in 2008, he was named in the ESPNcricinfo IPL XI. He then followed up his century with a 17-ball 48 not out to surpass the Kolkata Knight Riders&#x27; score of 67 in just the 6th over, resulting in the biggest victory in Twenty20 history in terms of balls remaining. In 2010 has signed with Worcestershire for their Twenty20 campaign. At the age of 42, Jayasuriya played for the Ruhuna Rhinos in the qualifying round of the 2011 Champions League. In February 2012 Jayasuriya played for the Khulna Royal Bengals in the inaugural Bangladesh Premier League, later that year he played for Kandurata Warriors in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League.

=== Captaincy and all-round performances ===
Jayasuriya was chosen as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 1996 and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1997. He served as the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team in 38 test matches and 117 one day internationals from 1999 to 2003. Jayasuriya led Sri Lanka to the knock-out stage of the 2003 cricket world cup but stepped down from the captaincy after the loss to Australia in the semi-final. He was also a very useful all-rounder with a good batting average in both Test cricket and One Day Internationals, and had an excellent batting strike rate in One Day Internationals.

As a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he had a reasonable bowling average and an economy rate. He regularly helped to decrease the workloads of contemporary Sri Lankan strike bowlers Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas. At the end of his career, Jayasuriya took more than 400 wickets in international cricket with over 300 wickets in One Day Internationals. Jayasuriya was also a skillful infielder, with a report prepared by ESPNcricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the seventh highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the eleventh highest success rate.

==Selection committee==
Jayasuriya was appointed as the chairman of selectors of national cricket team on 28 January 2013 by sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage. The selection panel included Jayasuriya, Pramodya Wickramasinghe, Eric Upashantha, Chaminda Mendis and Hemantha Wickramaratne. But on 30 January 2013, Wickramaratne has been replaced by Hashan Tillakaratne. In 2013, he came under immense pressure and scrutiny for selecting state minister Keheliya Rambukwella&#x27;s son Ramith Rambukwella to the national team for a series against Bangladesh.

Under his selection, Sri Lanka won 2014 ICC World Twenty20, 2014 Asia Cup and Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever full series win in England in all three formats of the game Tests, ODIs and T20s. His tenure was ended in 2015, after many failures apart from those wins, such as whitewash against India and 2015 World Cup failure.

After Jayasuriya&#x27;s quit, Aravinda de Silva has appointed as the Chairman of selectors. On 11 April 2016, Jayasuriya was appointed back again to the post of chairman of selectors. This time, under his selection, many players got test, ODI and T20I caps and the team shuffled so many times due to many injuries to major players. During this period, Sri Lanka lost world No. 1 rankings in T20Is, lost many bilateral tours to New Zealand, England, India, Pakistan, South Africa. Despite them, Sri Lanka lost their first bilateral ODI series to Zimbabwe at home, Bangladesh drawn all formats in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka quit very early from both 2016 World Twenty20, and 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.

Through all those defeats and failures, Sri Lanka had a silver line, where they first marked a whitewash against Australia in Warne-Murali Trophy and Zimbabwe Tri-series. Many questions about the rapid changes occurred in the squads and the continuous failures of the team. With that, on 29 August 2017, Jayasuriya with his panel Ranjith Madurasinghe, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Asanka Gurusinha and Eric Upashantha resigned from the selection committee after heavy loss to India in both tests and ODIs.

== Coaching career ==
After serving international ban from cricket, Sanath took up his first coaching stint with Mulgrave Cricket Club, a third tier Australian cricket club in Melbourne which plays in Victoria&#x27;s Eastern Cricket Association. It was revealed that his former opening partner Tillekaratne Dilshan had convinced him to join the Mulgrave cricket team during when both featured together for Sri Lanka Legends team in the second half of the 2020–21 Road Safety World Series.
Having been interim head coach of Sri Lanka since July 2024, Jayasuriya was given the job on a full-time basis in October that year.

== Controversies ==
In an autobiography published by former Sri Lankan cricketer and match referee Roshan Mahanama in 2001, he claimed that former Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath racially abused Sanath Jayasuriya by calling him a &quot;black monkey&quot; during an ODI match between Sri Lanka and Australia in 1996.

In 2010, he signed contracts with two different clubs simultaneously to participate at the Cricket Association of Bengal league and ultimately both the teams had to withdraw his name and he was unable to take part in the competition for signing with two teams at the same time. Following this incident, Cricket Association of Bengal barred foreign players to participate in the competition.

In 2017, Jayasuriya was involved in a leaked sex tape of his ex-girlfriend Maleeka Sirisena . The clips went viral in social media and Maleeka slammed Sanath for his indecent behaviour. It was revealed that he dated Maleeka in 2012 despite being married to another woman Sandra De Silva. The extramarital affair triggered divorce with Sandra.

In November 2018, he was accused of trafficking rotten betel nuts from Indonesia to India. In March 2018, he criticised the behaviour of Bangladeshi cricketers during the crucial virtual semi final between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the 2018 Nidahas Trophy and degraded the Bangladesh team as a third class team in a tweet. He later deleted the tweet.

In October 2018, Jayasuriya was charged by the International Cricket Council with two counts of breaching its anti-corruption code. The accusations related to &quot;failure or refusal to co-operate&quot; with an ongoing ICC investigation into alleged match-fixing and &quot;concealing, tampering with or destroying any documentation or other information that may be relevant&quot;. The investigation was reported to relate to Jayasuriya&#x27;s time as Sri Lanka&#x27;s chairman of selectors, between April 2016 to August 2017, and the fourth ODI between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in July 2017. In February 2019, Jayasuriya was banned for two years in taking part in any cricket-related activity by the International Cricket Council&#x27;s (ICC) anti-corruption unit, after he failed to co-operate in a corruption investigation. However, he reportedly attended a group stage match between Sri Lanka and India during the 2019 Cricket World Cup and watched the match in the pavilion despite serving a ban. ICC later pointed out that he could still watch matches in the pavilion as a casual fan and barred him from entering teams dressing rooms. His international ban was lifted by the ICC in November 2020 and was once again eligible to involve with cricket.

===Career performance===
===Centuries===
Jayasuriya has scored 14 Test and 28 ODI centuries.
Although Jayasuriya made his Test debut in 1991, it was not until 1996 that he scored his first century, when he had become a regular player in the Sri Lankan side. His career high of 340 against India in August 1997 was the highest score by a Sri Lankan cricketer until 2006, and is also part of the highest team total (952/6) made in Test cricket. He has also scored two double centuries; 213 against England and 253 against Pakistan. His 157 against Zimbabwe in 2004 is the second fastest century by a Sri Lankan player. Jayasuriya, having scored centuries against every Test playing nation except New Zealand and West Indies, retired from Test cricket in 2007 with 14 to his name.

Jayasuriya made his ODI debut in 1989 and started playing as an opening batsman in 1993. He went on to score his first century in 1994 against New Zealand. From then on, Jayasuriya has scored the highest number of ODI centuries for Sri Lanka with 28 to his name. He currently holds the fourth place for most centuries in a career, behind Virat Kohli (50 ODI centuries),Sachin Tendulkar (with 49 ODI centuries), Ricky Ponting (30 centuries) and Rohit Sharma (29 centuries). His second century, 134 against Pakistan in 1996, was scored at a strike rate of 206.15 and was the fastest century in ODI cricket at the time. This record was later broken by Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi. The 189 he made against India in 2000 is the sixth-highest ODI score in a single innings. Making his second-highest ODI score of 157 against the Netherlands in 2006, Jayasuriya paved the way for Sri Lanka to set the world record for the highest ODI team total of 443/9. With his 107 against India on 28 January 2009, Jayasuriya—39 years and 212 days old at the time—became the oldest player to score a century, which was surpassed by UAE batsman Khurram Khan and also became the second player to score more than 13,000 runs in a career. Sanath Jayasuriya also holds the record of fourth fastest 150 in one day internationals. he made 152 vs England at Leeds on 1 July 2006, off just 99 balls which were the fastest at that time, and now after AB de Villiers 63 balls 150, Shane Watson 93 balls 150, and Luke Ronchi 95 balls 150.

<text>The Independent Order of Foresters, operating as Foresters Financial, is a fraternal benefit society headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that provides life insurance and other financial solutions in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of 2024, Matt Berman has served as the company&#x27;s president and CEO.

==History==
Foresters traces its origins to a British Friendly Society, a mutual organization caring for the sick. Membership was originally gained by combat, first with quarterstaffs, then with swords and finally with cudgels, until initiation by combat was abandoned in 1843.

In 1834, the Royal Foresters formed a Friendly Society, the Ancient Order of Foresters (AOF). The Independent Order of Foresters (IOF) in the United States became independent of the AOF in 1874.

The expansion of the IOF into Canada in 1875 is attributed to a doctor and community leader, Oronhyatekha. Of Mohawk descent, he was born in 1841 at Six Nations near present-day Brantford, Ontario, Oronhyatekha (&quot;Burning Sky&quot;) was baptized Peter Martin and later attended Oxford, where he became a medical doctor.

Dr. Oronhyatekha held the office of Supreme Chief Ranger (now called &quot;International Fraternal President&quot;) from 1879 until 1906; he died in 1907. Foresters membership reached 257,000 in 1906. Through the 20th century it amalgamated with various other fraternal organizations, including the Ontario part of one of the oldest, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, acquired in 1926, the Modern Brotherhood of America, acquired in 1931, and the Order of Scottish Clans, acquired in 1971.

Like other friendly societies and fraternal organizations of the time, Foresters helped transform the insurance industry by extending insurance benefits to the average working family. In addition to admitting women as full members, Foresters provided orphan benefits to the children of deceased Foresters members.

Foresters acquired Unity Life of Canada in 2008, which subsequently rebranded as Foresters Life Insurance Company in January 2012.

As of 2014, Foresters Financial operated a separate UK division based in South London.

In April 2019, Macquarie Group&#x27;s investing division agreed to buy $12.3 billion in assets from Foresters Financial, including Foresters&#x27; First Investors mutual funds business. In the same year, the company sold its U.S. broker-dealer to Cetera Financial Group, in efforts to focus on life insurance.

In May 2019, Foresters sold its Canadian money management unit, Foresters Asset Management, to Fiera Capital. In October 2019, the company sold Foresters Financial Holding and Foresters Life Insurance and Annuity Company to Nassau Financial Group.

In October 2020, Foresters Financial acquired life insurance distributor Canada Protection Plan. Canada Protection Plan was rebranded as &quot;Canada Protection Plan, a Foresters Financial company&quot;.

In July 2021, Foresters invested in a capital project to transform the UK London office. As part of Foresters sustainability roadmap, Renewable Energy Generation Assets and Energy Saving Products were utilized. The investment will reduce the CO₂ emissions by up to 10,000 kg per year.

In 2024, Foresters reached 150 years in business, serving 2.6 million clients and families in Canada, the US and the UK. The company continues to invest and support the community, including partnership with nonprofit KaBOOM!, which has helped Foresters build more than 170 playgrounds across the U.S. and Canada since 2006.

== Products ==
Foresters Financial offers term and permanent policies, including: 

* Term life insurance policies lasting 10, 20, or 30 years.
* Three types of Whole Life insurance covering children, all ages and 50-85.
* Various policy riders to cover spouses, children, disability and death benefits. 

The company&#x27;s structure as a fraternal organization also includes benefits such as discounted legal services, scholarships, and community grants.

<text>A cohort study is a particular form of longitudinal study that samples a cohort (a group of people who share a defining characteristic, typically those who experienced a common event in a selected period, such as birth or graduation), performing a cross-section at intervals through time. It is a type of panel study where the individuals in the panel share a common characteristic.

Cohort studies represent one of the fundamental designs of epidemiology which are used in research in the fields of medicine, pharmacy, nursing, psychology, social science, and in any field reliant on &#x27;difficult to reach&#x27; answers that are based on evidence (statistics). In medicine for instance, while clinical trials are used primarily for assessing the safety of newly developed pharmaceuticals before they are approved for sale, epidemiological analysis on how risk factors affect the incidence of diseases is often used to identify the causes of diseases in the first place, and to help provide pre-clinical justification for the plausibility of protective factors (treatments).

==Comparison with controlled trials==
Cohort studies differ from clinical trials in that no intervention, treatment, or exposure is administered to participants in a cohort design; and no control group is defined. Rather, cohort studies are largely about the life histories of segments of populations and the individual people who constitute these segments. Exposures or protective factors are identified as preexisting characteristics of participants. The study is controlled by including other common characteristics of the cohort in the statistical analysis. Both exposure/treatment and control variables are measured at baseline. Participants are then followed over time to observe the incidence rate of the disease or outcome in question. Regression analysis can then be used to evaluate the extent to which the exposure or treatment variable contributes to the incidence of the disease, while accounting for other variables that may be at play.

Double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally considered superior methodology in the hierarchy of evidence in treatment, because they allow for the most control over other variables that could affect the outcome, and the randomization and blinding processes reduce bias in the study design. This minimizes the chance that results will be influenced by confounding variables, particularly ones that are unknown. However, educated hypotheses based on prior research and background knowledge are used to select variables to be included in the regression model for cohort studies, and statistical methods can be used to identify and account for potential confounders from these variables. Bias can also be mitigated in a cohort study when selecting participants for the cohort.

RCTs may not be suitable in all cases; such as when the outcome is a negative health effect and the exposure is hypothesized to be a risk factor for the outcome. Ethical standards, and morality, would prevent the use of risk factors in RCTs. The natural or incidental exposure to these risk factors (e.g. time spent in the sun), or self-administered exposure (e.g. smoking), can be measured without subjecting participants to risk factors outside of their individual lifestyles, habits, and choices.

== Types ==
Cohort studies can be retrospective (looking back in time, thus using existing data such as medical records or claims database) or prospective (requiring the collection of new data). Retrospective cohort studies restrict the investigators&#x27; ability to reduce confounding and bias because collected information is restricted to data that already exists. There are advantages to this design, however, as retrospective studies are much cheaper and faster because the data has already been collected and stored.

A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period (e.g., are currently living, are exposed to a drug or vaccine or pollutant, or undergo a certain medical procedure). Thus a group of people who were born on a day or in a particular period, say 1948, form a birth cohort. The comparison group may be the general population from which the cohort is drawn, or it may be another cohort of persons thought to have had little or no exposure to the substance under investigation, but otherwise similar. Alternatively, subgroups within the cohort may be compared with each other.

==Application==

In medicine, a cohort study is often undertaken to obtain evidence to try to refute the existence of a suspected association between cause and effect; failure to refute a hypothesis often strengthens confidence in it. Crucially, the cohort is identified before the appearance of the disease under investigation. The study groups follow a group of people who do not have the disease for a period of time and see who develops the disease (new incidence). The cohort cannot therefore be defined as a group of people who already have the disease. Prospective (longitudinal) cohort studies between exposure and disease strongly aid in studying causal associations, though distinguishing true causality usually requires further corroboration from further experimental trials.

The advantage of prospective cohort study data is that it can help determine risk factors for contracting a new disease because it is a longitudinal observation of the individual through time, and the collection of data at regular intervals, so recall error is reduced. However, cohort studies are expensive to conduct, are sensitive to attrition and take a long follow-up time to generate useful data. Nevertheless, the results that are obtained from long-term cohort studies are of substantially superior quality to those obtained from retrospective/cross-sectional studies. Prospective cohort studies are considered to yield the most reliable results in observational epidemiology. They enable a wide range of exposure-disease associations to be studied.

Some cohort studies track groups of children from their birth, and record a wide range of information (exposures) about them. The value of a cohort study depends on the researchers&#x27; capacity to stay in touch with all members of the cohort. Some studies have continued for decades.

In a cohort study, the population under investigation consists of individuals who are at risk of developing a specific disease or health outcome.

==Examples==
An example of an epidemiological question that can be answered using a cohort study is whether exposure to X (say, smoking) associates with outcome Y (say, lung cancer). For example, in 1951, the British Doctors Study was started. Using a cohort which included both smokers (the exposed group) and non-smokers (the unexposed group). The study continued through 2001. By 1956, the study provided convincing proof of the association between smoking and the incidence of lung cancer. In a cohort study, the groups are &quot;matched&quot; in terms of many other variables such as economic status and other health status so that the variable being assessed, the independent variable (in this case, smoking) can be isolated as the cause of the dependent variable (in this case, lung cancer). In this example, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer in the smoking group as compared to the non-smoking group is evidence in favor of the hypothesis. However, rare outcomes, such as lung cancer, are generally not studied with the use of a cohort study, but are rather studied with the use of a case-control study.

Cohort Succession can explain most change in literature, art, intellectualism, political opinions, and phonology.

Shorter term studies are commonly used in medical research as a form of clinical trial, or means to test a particular hypothesis of clinical importance. Such studies typically follow two groups of patients for a period of time and compare an endpoint or outcome measure between the two groups.

Randomized controlled trials, or RCTs, are a superior methodology in the hierarchy of evidence, because they limit the potential for bias by randomly assigning one patient pool to an intervention and another patient pool to non-intervention (or placebo). This minimizes the chance that the incidence of confounding variables will differ between the two groups. Nevertheless, it is sometimes not practical or ethical to perform RCTs to answer a clinical question. To take our example, if we already had reasonable evidence that smoking causes lung cancer then persuading a pool of non-smokers to take up smoking in order to test this hypothesis would generally be considered unethical.

Two examples of cohort studies that have been going on for more than 50 years are the Framingham Heart Study and the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the most widely researched of the British birth cohort studies. Key findings of NCDS and a detailed profile of the study appear in the &quot;International Journal of Epidemiology&quot;.

The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study has been studying the thousand people born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972–1973. The subjects are interviewed regularly, with Phase (age) 52 starting in 2024.
The largest cohort study in women is the Nurses&#x27; Health Study. Starting in 1976, it is tracking over 120,000 nurses and has been analyzed for many different conditions and outcomes.

The largest cohort study in Africa is the Birth to Twenty Study, which began in 1990 and tracks a cohort of over 3,000 children born in the weeks following Nelson Mandela&#x27;s release from prison.

Other famous examples are the Grant Study tracking a number of Harvard graduates from ca. 1950.77, the Whitehall Study tracking 10,308 British civil servants, and the Caerphilly Heart Disease Study, which since 1979 has studied a representative sample of 2,512 men, drawn from the Welsh town of Caerphilly.

The ASPREE-XT study is designed to determine whether there are long-lasting effects of an average of four–five years of treatment with daily low-dose aspirin, with outcome measures including cancer mortality. As of September 2018, there were 16,703 ASPREE-XT participants in Australia. It has been proposed that the existing ASPREE-XT study could provide a platform for a future multigenerational research study.

==Variations==

The diagram indicates the starting point and direction of cohort and case-control studies.
In case-control studies the analysis proceeds from documented disease and investigations are made to arrive at the possible causes of the disease. In cohort studies the assessment starts with the putative cause of disease, and observations are made of the occurrence of disease relative to the hypothesized causal agent.

===Current and historical cohorts===
A current cohort study represents a true prospective study where the data concerning exposure are assembled prior to the occurrence of the fact to be studied, for instance a disease. An example of a current cohort study is the Oxford Family Planning Association Study in the United Kingdom, which aimed to provide a balanced view of the beneficial and harmful effects of different methods of contraception. This study has provided a large amount of information on the efficacy and safety of contraceptive methods, and in particular oral contraceptives (OCs), diaphragms and intrauterine device (IUDs).

In a historical cohort study the data concerning exposure and occurrence of a disease, births, a political attitude or any other categorical variable are collected after the events have taken place, and the subjects (those exposed and unexposed to the agent under study) are assembled from existing records or health care registers.

A &quot;prospective cohort&quot; defines the groups before the study is done, while historical studies, which are sometimes referred to as &quot;retrospective cohort&quot;, define the grouping after the data is collected. Examples of a retrospective cohort are &quot;Long-Term Mortality after Gastric Bypass Surgery&quot; and &quot;The Lothian Birth Cohort Studies&quot;.

Although historical studies are sometimes referred to as retrospective study, it a misnomer as the methodological principles of historical cohort studies and prospective studies are the same.

===Nested case-control study===

A nested case-control study is a case control nested inside of a cohort study. The procedure begins like a normal cohort study, however, as participants develop the outcome of interest they are selected as cases. Once the cases are identified, controls are selected and matched to each case. The process for selecting and matching cases is identical to a normal case control study. An example of a nested case-control study is &quot;Inflammatory markers and the risk of coronary heart disease in men and women&quot;, which was a case control analyses extracted from the Framingham Heart Study cohort.

Nested case-controls have the advantage of reducing the number of participants that require details follow up or diagnostic testing to assess outcome or exposure status. However, this will also reduce the power of the study, when compared to larger cohort the study population is drawn from.

===Household panel survey===
Panel surveys are another important sub-type of longitudinal study. They differ from cohort studies by starting with representative cross-sectional samples, rather than cohorts defined by an event. Household panels draw representative samples of households and survey them, following all individuals through time on a usual annual basis. Examples include the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (since 1968), the &quot;German&quot; Socio-Economic Panel (since 1984), the British Household Panel Survey (since 1991) and (since 2009) its successor Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (since 2001) and the European Community Household Panel (1994–2001).

===Cohort analysis in business===

For an example in business analysis, see cohort analysis.

===AI for cohort study===
Conventionally, cohort studies require manual definitions of the common characteristics, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, demanding extensive domain expertise. To address these limitations, researchers have increasingly explored the integration of AI technologies (e.g., CohortNet. COOL) to automate the identification of cohorts with their definitions. For example, in healthcare, we can identify patients with a certain combination of feature conditions as a specific cohort, typically resulting in a similar outcome or end-point. Once the cohort is identified, we further learn the commonalities among the associated patients and obtain meaningful cohort representations. These AI-derived cohorts not only enhance the ability to evaluate new patients but also hold significant potential to accelerate medical research and discovery.

<text>Szeged ( , ; ) is the third largest city of Hungary, the largest city and regional centre of the Southern Great Plain and the county seat of Csongrád-Csanád county. The University of Szeged is one of the most distinguished universities in Hungary.

The Szeged Open Air (Theatre) Festival (first held in 1931) is one of the main attractions, held every summer and celebrated as the Day of the City on 21 May.

== Etymology ==
It is possible that the name &quot;Szeged&quot; is a mutated and truncated form of the final syllables of &quot;Partiscum&quot;, the name of a Roman colony founded in the 2nd century, on or near the site of modern Szeged. In Latin language contexts, has long been assumed to be synonymous with &quot;Szeged&quot;. The Latin name is also the basis of the city&#x27;s Greek name &quot;Partiskon&quot;.

However, &quot;Szeged&quot; might instead have originated (or been influenced by) an old Hungarian word for &quot;corner&quot; (), pointing to the turn of the river Tisza that flows through the city. Others say it derives from the Hungarian word which means &quot;island&quot;. Others still contend that means &quot;dark blond&quot; () – a reference to the color of the water where the rivers Tisza and Maros merge. 

Szeged has a variety of names in languages other than Hungarian. These are usually formed by the addition of a suffix &quot;-in&quot; to the Hungarian name: ; or ; /; ; ; ; ; Slovak and ; .

== History ==
Szeged and its area have been inhabited since ancient times. Ptolemy mentions the oldest known name of the city: &quot;Partiscum&quot; (Ancient Greek: Πάρτισκον)&quot;.&quot; It is possible that Attila, king of the Huns had his seat somewhere in this area. The name Szeged was first mentioned in 1183, in a document of King Béla III.

In the second century AD there was a Roman trading post established on an island in the Tisza, and the foundations of the Szeged castle suggest that the structure may have been built over an even earlier fort. Today only one corner of the castle still remains standing.

During the Mongol invasion the town was destroyed and its inhabitants fled to the nearby swamps, but they soon returned and rebuilt their town. In the 14th century, during the reign of Louis the Great, Szeged became the most important town of Southern Hungary, and – as the Turkish armies got closer to Hungary – the strategic importance of Szeged grew. King Sigismund of Luxembourg had a wall built around the town. Szeged was raised to free royal town status in 1498.

Szeged was first pillaged by the Ottoman Army on 28 September 1526, but was occupied only in 1543, and became an administrative centre of the Ottomans (see Ottoman Hungary). The town was a sanjak centre first in Budin Eyaleti (1543–1596), after in Eğri Eyaleti. The town was freed from Turkish rule on 23 October 1686, and regained the free royal town status in 1715. In 1719, Szeged received its coat of arms (still used today) from Charles III. During the next several years, Szeged grew and prospered. Piarist monks arrived in Szeged in 1719 and opened a new grammar school in 1721. Szeged also held scientific lectures and theatrical plays. These years brought not only prosperity but also enlightenment. Between 1728 and 1744 witch trials were frequent in the town, with the Szeged witch trials of 1728–29 perhaps being the largest. The witch trials were instigated by the authorities, who decided on this measure to remove the problem of the public complaints about the drought and its consequences of famine and epidemics by laying the responsibility on people among them, which had fraternized with the Devil. In 1720, the ethnic Hungarian population of the town numbered about 13000 to 16000, while the number of the Serb inhabitants was 1300.

The first printing press was established in 1801, and the old town hall and the civil hospital were built at the same time.

Szeged is known as the home of paprika, a spice made from dried, powdered capsicum fruits. Paprika arrived in Hungary in the second half of the 16th century as an ornamental plant. About 100 years later the plant was cultivated as an herb, and paprika as we know it. Szeged is also famous for their szekelygulyas, a goulash made with pork, sauerkraut and sour cream. And also famous for their halászlé, fish soup made of carp and catfish.

The citizens of Szeged played an important part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Lajos Kossuth delivered his famous speech here. Szeged was the last seat of the revolutionary government in July 1849. The Habsburg rulers punished the leaders of the town, but later Szeged began to prosper again; the railway reached it in 1854, and the town got its free royal town status back in 1860. Mark Pick&#x27;s shop – the predecessor of today&#x27;s Pick Salami Factory – was opened in 1869.

Today the inner city of Szeged has wide avenues. This is mainly due to the great flood of 1879, which wiped away the whole town (only 265 of the 5723 houses remained and 165 people died). Emperor Franz Joseph visited the town and promised that &quot;Szeged will be more beautiful than it used to be&quot;. He kept his promise, and during the next years a new, modern city emerged from the ruins, with palaces and wide streets.

===20th century===
After the First World War Hungary lost its southern territories to Serbia, as a result Szeged became a city close to the border, and its importance lessened, but as it took over roles that formerly belonged to the now lost cities, it slowly recovered. Following the Loss of Transylvania to Romania, University of Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca), moved to Szeged in 1921 (see University of Szeged). In 1923 Szeged took over the role of episcopal seat from Temesvár (now Timișoara, Romania). It was briefly occupied by the Romanian army during Hungarian-Romanian War in 1919. It also became a center for right-wing forces which would install Miklós Horthy as the country&#x27;s new leader after the overthrow of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. During the 1920s the Jewish population of Szeged grew and reached its zenith.

Szeged suffered heavily during World War II. 6,000 inhabitants of the city were killed, In 1941, there were 4,161 Jews living in Szeged. After, March 19, 1944 German occupation, they were confined to a ghetto together with the Jews from surrounding villages. In June, 1944, the ghetto was liquidated. The Nazis murdered the larger part of the 8,500 and some were forced into forced labor in Strasshof Labor camp, Austria. Szeged was captured by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front on 11 October 1944 in the course of the Battle of Debrecen. During the communist era, Szeged became a centre of light industry and food industry. In 1965, oil was found near the city.

In 1962, Szeged became the county seat of Csongrád. Whole new districts were built, and many nearby villages (e.g. Tápé, Szőreg, Kiskundorozsma, Szentmihálytelek, Gyálarét) were annexed to the city in 1973 (as was a tendency during the Communist era).

Today&#x27;s Szeged is an important university town and a tourist attraction.

The Szeged Symphony Orchestra (Szegedi Szimfonikus Zenekar) gives regular concerts at the Szegedi Nemzeti Színház.

==Geography==
Szeged is situated near the southern border of Hungary, just to the south of the mouth of the Maros River, on both banks of the Tisza River, nearly in the centre of the Carpathian Basin. The Hungarian frontier with Serbia is just outside the town.

===Climate===
Szeged&#x27;s climate is transitional between humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) and humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), with cold winters, hot summers, and fairly low precipitation. Due to the high hours of sunlight reported annually, Szeged is often called &quot;City of Sunshine&quot; (). On 23 July 2022, a maximum temperature of was registered in Szeged.

== Education ==
The city of Szeged has 62 kindergartens, 32 elementary schools and 18 high schools. The two most prominent high schools (&quot;Ságvári Endre Gyakorló Gimnázium&quot; and &quot;Radnóti Miklós Kísérleti Gimnázium&quot;) are in the top fifteen in the country.

Szeged is the higher education centre of the Southern Great Plain and has built quite a reputation for itself. Thousands of students study here, many of whom are foreigners. The University of Szeged is according to the number of students the second largest and the 4th oldest university of Hungary being established in 1581. Ranked as the top university of the country on Academic Ranking of World Universities – 2005, and in the top 100 in Europe, it offers several programs on different fields of study.

The &quot;Biological Research Centre&quot; of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, which was built with the help of UNESCO funds, has also been a considerable source of advanced research. Scientists at this laboratory were first in the world to produce &quot;artificial heredity material&quot; in the year 2000. The building has served as a home to many well known conferences and continues to make contributions to the world of science.

The &quot;Szent-Györgyi Albert Agóra&quot; is a cultural scientific centre of Szeged which gives home to laboratories of the Biological Research Centre and to exhibitions of the John von Neumann Computer Society especially their IT historical exposition.

In 2018 the new scientific institution, the &quot;ELI Attosecond Light Pulse Source&quot; (ELI-ALPS) opened in Szeged establishing a unique facility which provides light sources within an extremely broad frequency range in the form of ultrashort pulses with high repetition rate which is needed for different kinds of physical experiments especially in the field of attosecond physics.

It is also one of the main options for medical students who come from all around Europe to study Medicine in their recognized international campus.

The venue hosted finals of the Hungarian Individual Speedway Championship.

From 1978, the Volán speedway club moved to a new track built on Napos út at Béke telepi. This venue held important events, including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship in 1983 and 1984 and a qualifying round of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1988 and 1990. The track closed, partly because of noise issues in a residential area, resulting in the speedway moving out of the city, 25 kilometres west, near to Mórahalom ().

<text>Canonicus (c. 1565 – June 4, 1647) was a chief of the Narragansett people. He was wary of the colonial settlers, but he ultimately befriended Roger Williams and other settlers.

==Biography==

Canonicus was born around 1565, but nothing is known of his early life. He was chief of the Narragansett tribe when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, and one of the first with whom they had dealings. In the words of historian Benjamin Lossing, he &quot;regarded the advent of the white men with a jealous fear&quot;, and he challenged the Plymouth colony in 1622 in front of a force of about 5,000 men. He sent a bundle of arrows in a leather wrap tied with a snake skin to Plymouth governor William Bradford, so Bradford filled the wrap with gunpowder and lead round shot and returned it to Canonicus. This first exposure to explosive powder and metal was met with &quot;superstitious awe,&quot; in the words of Lossing:
They were sent from village to village, and excited so much alarm, that the sachem sued for peace, and made a treaty of friendship; which he never violated, notwithstanding, he often received provocations that would have justified him in scattering all compacts to the winds.

The peace that resulted between the Narragansetts and the colonists extended beyond Canonicus&#x27;s death in 1647.

Roger Williams was driven from Massachusetts Bay Colony and sought refuge with the Narragansett tribe, and Canonicus made him welcome. In 1636, he gave Williams a large tract of land on which to establish Providence Plantations, the nucleus which became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In 1637, Canonicus was largely responsible for the Narragansetts&#x27; decision to side with the colonists during the Pequot War.

Canonicus was initially succeeded by his nephew Miantonomoh, but Miantonomoh was killed in 1643 and Canonicus resumed leadership. He made a formal treaty on April 19, 1644, acknowledging the sovereignty of King Charles. The influence of his counsels lasted for many years after his death, and the Narragansett tribe maintained peaceful relations with the colonists until King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675. Canonicus&#x27;s nephew Pessicus (1623-1676) changed his name to Canonicus to honor his uncle. Canonicus&#x27;s son Mixan (or Mexanno) died in 1657, but Mixan’s wife, Quaiapen, was the last Narragansett leader killed in King Philip&#x27;s War.

<doc id="397278" wikidata="Q270258" url="?curid=397278" title="Fleur Adcock">
<text>Fleur Adcock (10 February 1934 – 10 October 2024) was a New Zealand poet and editor. Of English and Northern Irish ancestry, Adcock lived much of her life in England. She is well-represented in New Zealand poetry anthologies, was awarded an honorary doctorate of literature from Victoria University of Wellington, and was awarded an OBE in 1996 for her contribution to New Zealand literature. In 2008 she was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to literature.

==Early life==
Adcock, the older of two sisters, was born in Papakura to Cyril John Adcock and Irene Robinson Adcock on 10 February 1934. Her birth name was Kareen Fleur Adcock, but she was known as Fleur and legally changed her name to Fleur Adcock in 1982. She spent eight years of her childhood (1939–1947) in England.

Adcock studied Classics at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1954 and a Masters of Arts in 1956.

== Career ==
Adcock worked as an assistant lecturer in classics and librarian at the University of Otago in Dunedin between 1958 and 1962, and as a librarian at the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington between 1962 and 1963.

In 1963, she returned to England and took up a post as a librarian at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. She had already had poems published in a few literary journals in New Zealand at this time. Her first collection of poetry, &quot;The Eye of the Hurricane&quot;, was published in New Zealand in 1964, and in 1967 &quot;Tigers&quot; was her first collection published in Britain.

In 1975, Adcock returned briefly to New Zealand for the first time since she had left for London, and on returning to London in 1976, she became a full time writer. She was the Arts Council Creative Writing Fellow at the Charlotte Mason College of Education in Ambleside from 1977 to 1978, followed by the Northern Arts Literary Fellowship at the universities of Newcastle and Durham from 1979 to 1981.

From 1980, Adcock worked as a freelance writer, living in East Finchley, north London, a translator and poetry commentator for the BBC.

Adcock&#x27;s poetry is typically concerned with themes of place, human relationships and everyday activities, but frequently with a dark twist given to the mundane events she writes about. Formerly, her early work was influenced by her training as a classicist but her later work is looser in structure and more concerned with the world of the unconscious mind. The &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; (2006) notes that her poems are often written from the perspective of an outsider or express a divided sense of identity inherited from her own emigrant experience and separation from New Zealand family.

In 2006, Adcock won one of Britain&#x27;s top poetry awards, the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry, for her collected works, &quot;Poems 1960–2000&quot;. She was only the seventh female poet to receive the award in its 73 years.

== Personal life and death ==
Adcock was married to two notable New Zealand literary personalities. In August 1952, she married Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, divorcing in 1958; and in February 1962, she married Barry Crump, divorcing in 1963. She had two sons, Gregory and Andrew, both with her first husband.

Adcock&#x27;s sister Marilyn Duckworth is a novelist, and their mother Irene (1908–2001) was also a writer.

Adcock died following a short illness on 10 October 2024, at the age of 90.

<text>Miantonomoh (1600? – August 1643), also spelled Miantonomo, Miantonomah or Miantonomi, was a chief of the Narragansett people of New England Indians.

==Biography==
He was a nephew of the Narragansett grand sachem, Canonicus (died 1647), with whom he associated in the government of the tribe, and whom he succeeded in 1636. Miantonomoh seems to have been friendly to the English colonists of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, though he was accused of being treacherous. In 1632 Miantonomoh and his wife Wawaloam traveled to Boston to visit with Governor John Winthrop.

In 1636, when under suspicion, Miantonomoh went to Boston to prove his loyalty to the colonists and deny allegations of infidelity. In the following year, during the Pequot War, he permitted John Mason to lead his Connecticut expedition against the Pequot Indians through Narragansett country. The Pequot were defeated in this war. In 1638, he signed for the Narragansett the tripartite treaty between that tribe, the Connecticut colonists and the Mohegan Indians, which provided for a perpetual peace between the parties, and Miantonomoh was given control over eighty of the two hundred Pequot. However, conflict continued with the Mohegans over control of the Pequot people and land. Miantonomoh tried to organize other tribes throughout the New England region in a union against the colonists.

The conflict with the Mohegans turned into a war in 1643. Miantonomoh invaded Mohegan territory with nearly 1,000 warriors, but was defeated. Miantonomoh was slowed by his coat of heavy armor and was taken prisoner. Miantonomoh suggested an alliance against the colonists to the sachem of the Mohegans, Uncas, but instead, Uncas brought him to Hartford to seek advice concerning further action from the Colonial Commissioners at their first meeting.

The commissioners of the United Colonies of New England, not knowing what to do, asked a committee of five clergymen from Boston, to whom his case was referred. Although Miantonomoh had made war with their consent, albeit from Gov. John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay colony who knew not much of the issues concerning the two Sachems, they suggested that he should be killed while admitting they had no authority to do so. Miantonomoh was taken back to Norwich, where he had been defeated, and killed with a tomahawk by Wawequa, the brother of Uncas.

==Family==
His younger brother Pessicus and Miantonomoh&#x27;s son Canonchet were Narragansett sachems. A granddaughter, Minnetinka, was raised and educated by a Quaker or Dutch family after her mother died and her father was killed by the Mohegans. She married John Corey with her Christian name being Elizabeth.

<text>Uncas () was a &quot;sachem&quot; of the Mohegans who made the Mohegans the leading regional Indian tribe in lower Connecticut, through his alliance with the New England colonists against other Indian tribes.

==Early life and family==

Uncas was born near the Thames River in present-day Connecticut, the son of the Mohegan sachem &quot;Owaneco&quot;. &quot;Uncas&quot; is a variant of the Mohegan term &quot;Wonkus&quot;, meaning &quot;Fox&quot;. He was a descendant of the principal sachems of the Mohegans, Pequots, and Narragansetts. Owaneco presided over the village known as &quot;Montonesuck&quot;. Uncas was bilingual, learning Mohegan and some English, and possibly some Dutch.

In 1626, Owaneco arranged for Uncas to marry the daughter of the principal Pequot sachem Tatobem to secure an alliance with them. Owaneco died shortly after this marriage, and Uncas had to submit to Tatobem&#x27;s authority. Tatobem was captured and killed by the Dutch in 1633; Sassacus became his successor, but Uncas felt that he deserved to be sachem.

Owaneco&#x27;s alliance with Tatobem was based upon a balance of power between the Mohegans and Pequots. After the death of Owaneco, the balance changed in favour of the Pequots. Uncas was unwilling to challenge the power of Tatobem; however, Uncas did begin contesting Pequot authority over the Mohegans. In 1634 with Narragansett support, Uncas rebelled against Sassacus and Pequot authority. Uncas was defeated and became an exile among the Narragansetts. He soon returned from exile after ritually humiliating himself before Sassacus. His failed challenges resulted in Uncas having little land and few followers, but Uncas saw that the newly arriving Puritan colonists, though few in number, had better weapons and much courage, so he started to develop a new strategy and alliance to work towards his ultimate goal of Grand Sachem.

==Pequot War==

About 1635, Uncas developed relationships with important figures in the Connecticut Colony. He was a trusted ally of Captain John Mason, a partnership which lasted three and a half decades and several family generations beyond. Uncas sent word to Jonathan Brewster that Sassacus was planning to attack the colonists on the Connecticut River. Brewster described Uncas as being &quot;faithful&quot; to the colonists.

In 1637, during the Pequot War, Uncas was allied with the New England colonists and against the Pequots. He led his Mohegans in a joint attack with the colonists against the Pequots near Saybrook and against the Pequot Fort at Mystic River. The Pequots were defeated and the Mohegans incorporated much of the remaining Pequot people and their land. In the 1638 Treaty of Hartford, Uncas made the Mohegans a tributary of the Connecticut River Colony. The treaty dictated that Uncas could pursue his interests in the Pequot country only with the explicit approval of the Connecticut Colony. The Mohegans had become a regional power.

In 1640, Uncas added Sebequanash of the Hammonassets to his several wives. This marriage gave Uncas some type of control over their land which he promptly sold to New England colonists. The Hammonassets moved and became Mohegans.

==War with the Narragansett==
The Mohegans were in continuous conflict with the Narragansetts over control of the former Pequot land. In the summer of 1643, this conflict turned into war.

The Mohegans defeated a Narragansett invasion force of around 1,000 men and captured their sachem Miantonomo. Uncas executed several of Miantonomo&#x27;s fellow warriors in front of him, trying to solicit a response from Miantonomo. Consistent with the 1638 treaty, he turned Miantonomo over to the New England colonists.

The colonists put him on trial where he was found guilty. Uncas requested and was given authority to put Miantonomo to death, provided that the killing was done by Indian hands in Indian territory to prevent difficulties between the Narragansetts and the colonists. Miantonomo subsequently escaped from the Mohegan village where he was being held and jumped Yantic Falls in escape of the pursuing Mohegans. This site is also known as Indian Leap. Uncas&#x27; brother Wawequa, leading the pursuit, caught up to Miantonomo and struck him a fatal blow to the back of his head with a tomahawk. A monument stands near the site of Miantonomo&#x27;s death. The exact location is unknown, since stones marking the original location of Miantonomo&#x27;s grave were allegedly used by early settlers to construct a barn. 

Author James Fenimore Cooper portrayed a fictional Uncas as having made the leap over the falls in his 1826 book &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. 

Narragansett sachem Pessachus proposed to go to war to avenge the death of Miantonomo, but the colonists promised to support the Mohegans. Colonists from the New England Confederation formed an alliance with the Mohegans for their defense. The Narragansett attacks started in June 1644. With each success, the number of Narragansett allies grew. In 1645, Uncas and the Mohegans were under siege in Fort Shantok at &quot;Shattuck&#x27;s Point&quot; and on the verge of a complete defeat when the colonists relieved them with supplies, led by Thomas Tracy and Thomas Leffingwell, and lifted the siege. The New England Confederation pledged any offensive action required to preserve Uncas in &quot;his liberty and estate&quot;. The New England administration sent troops to defend the Mohegan fort at Shantok. When the colonists threatened to invade Narragansett territory, the Narragansett signed a peace treaty.

In 1646, the tributary tribe at Nameag, consisting of former Pequots, allied with the colonists and tried to become more independent. In response, Uncas attacked and plundered their village. The Bay Colony governor responded by threatening to allow the Narragansetts to attack the Mohegans. For the next several years, the New England colonists both asserted the Nameag&#x27;s tributary status while supporting the Nameags in their independence. In 1655, the New England government removed the tribe from Uncas&#x27; authority.

==King Philip&#x27;s War==

King Philip&#x27;s War started in June 1675. In the summer, the Mohegans entered the war on the side of the New England colonists. Uncas led his forces in joint attacks with the colonists against the Wampanoags. In December, a combined New England-Mohegan force attacked a group of Narragansetts. The Mohegans continued to maintain their alliance until the war&#x27;s end in July 1676.

Uncas died sometime between June 1683 and June 1684 in Norwich, New London County, Connecticut.

<text>The Jagdtiger (&quot;Hunting Tiger&quot;; officially designated Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B) is a German casemate-type heavy tank destroyer (&quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;) of World War II. It was built upon the slightly lengthened chassis of a Tiger II. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 186.

The 72-tonne &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; was the heaviest armored fighting vehicle (AFV) used operationally by any nation in WWII and the heaviest combat vehicle of any type to be produced during the conflict. It was armed with a 12.8 cm Pak 44 L/55 main gun which could out-range and defeat any AFV fielded by the Allied forces.

It saw brief service in small numbers from late 1944 until the end of the war on both the Western and Eastern Front. Although 150 were ordered, only around 80 were produced. Due to an excessive weight and an underpowered drivetrain system, the &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; was plagued with mobility and mechanical problems. Three &quot;Jagdtigers&quot; survive in museums.

== Development ==
With the success of the StuG III, Marder I, Marder II, and Marder III , the military leadership of Nazi Germany decided to use the chassis of existing armored fighting vehicles as the basis for self-propelled guns (serving as assault guns and tank destroyers). German tank destroyers of World War II used fixed casemates instead of fully rotatable turrets to significantly reduce the cost, weight, and materials necessary for mounting large-caliber guns.
In early 1942, a request was made by the Army General Staff to mount a 128 mm gun on a self-propelled armored chassis. Firing tests of the 128 mm gun showed it to have a high percentage of hits; smaller caliber guns, such as the ubiquitous 88 mm and the slightly larger 105 mm, were also tested.

By early 1943, a decision was made to install a 128 mm gun on either a Panther or Tiger I chassis as a heavy assault gun. The Panther chassis was considered unsuitable after a wooden mockup of the design was constructed. On 20 October 1943, another wooden mockup was constructed on a Tiger II heavy tank chassis, and presented to Hitler in East Prussia. Two prototypes were produced: One was a version fitted with the eight-roadwheel Porsche suspension system (serial number 305001) and another version was equipped with the Henschel nine-overlapping roadwheel suspension system (serial number 305002), as used on the main-production Tiger IIs constructed by Henschel. They were completed in February 1944. It was originally designated as &quot; VI&quot; but was later renamed as the and received the Sd.Kfz. 186 designation as its inventory ordnance number.

== Design ==
The was a logical extension of the creation of designs from tank designs, such as the or the from the Panzer IV and Panther tanks respectively, with a fully armored and enclosed casemate-style fighting compartment. The used a boxy superstructure, with its sides integral with the hull sides, on top of a lengthened Tiger II chassis. Unlike the , the &#x27;s casemate design did not extend its glacis plate upwards in one piece to the full height of the casemate&#x27;s &quot;roof&quot; – it used a separate forward plate to form its casemate structure atop the hull roof, and mount its anti-tank gun. The resulting vehicle featured very heavy armor. It had armor on the front of the casemate and on the glacis plate. The main gun mount had a limited traverse of only 10 degrees; the entire vehicle had to be turned to aim outside that narrow field of fire.

The gun used two-part ammunition, which meant that the main projectile and the cased propellant-charge were loaded into the breech separately. Two loaders were tasked with this work, one for each type.

The suffered from a variety of mechanical and technical problems due to its immense weight and under-powered engine. The vehicle had frequent breakdowns; ultimately more were lost to mechanical problems or lack of fuel than to enemy action.

== Production ==
One hundred and fifty were initially ordered but only between 70 and 85 were produced at the Nibelungenwerk at St. Valentin, from July 1944 to May 1945. Eleven of them, serial numbers 305001 and 305003 to 305012, were produced with the Porsche suspension (with eight road wheels per side); all the rest used the Henschel suspension with nine road wheels per side. 

Important parts such as the tub, superstructure and drive wheels were supplied by the . Details and production locations were known to the Allies through the resistance group around the later executed priest Heinrich Maier. Prisoners from the St. Valentin concentration camp were used to build the tank. 

Production figures vary depending on source and other factors such as if prototypes are included and if those made after VE day are included: approximately 48 from July 1944 to the end of December 1944; 36 from January to April 1945, serial numbers from 305001 to 305088.

After serial number 305011 (September 1944), no Zimmerit anti-magnetic paste was factory applied.

== Combat history ==

Only two heavy anti-tank battalions (), numbered the 512th and 653rd, were equipped with , with the first vehicles reaching the units in September 1944. About 20% were lost in combat, with most destroyed by their crews when abandoned because of breakdowns or lack of fuel.

The first lost in combat was during the failed Operation Nordwind offensive in France in 1945. Despite its heavy armour, this was lost to American infantry using a bazooka, which at the time was considered ineffective against such a massive vehicle.

Tiger I tank ace Otto Carius commanded the second of three companies of in  512. His postwar memoir &quot;Tigers in the Mud&quot; provides a history of the 10 under his command. He said the were not utilized to their potential due to factors including Allied air supremacy making it difficult to maneuver and the heavy gun needing to be re-calibrated after travelling off-road even short distances. The vehicle was slow, having the same engine as the already-underpowered Tiger I and Tiger II. The vehicles&#x27; transmissions and differentials broke down easily because the whole 72-tonne vehicle needed to rotate for the gun&#x27;s traverse. The enormous 128 mm main-gun had to be locked down during the vehicle&#x27;s maneuvers, otherwise its mounting-brackets would wear out too much for accurate firing afterwards. This meant a crew-member had to exit the vehicle in combat and unlock the gun from its frontally mounted gun travel-lock before firing. Carius recorded that, in combat, a 128 mm projectile went through the walls of a house and destroyed an American tank behind it.

Insufficient training of vehicle crews and their poor morale during the last stage of the war were the biggest problems for crewmen under Carius&#x27;s command. At the Ruhr Pocket, two commanders failed to attack an American armored column about away in broad daylight for fear of attracting an Allied air attack, even though the were well-camouflaged. Both vehicles broke down while hurriedly withdrawing through fear of the supposed air attack that did not materialize and one was then subsequently destroyed by its crew. To prevent such a disaster, at Siegen, Carius himself dug in his command vehicle on high ground. An approaching American armored column avoided his ambush because nearby German civilians warned them of it. Later, one of his vehicles fell into a bomb crater at night and was disabled while another was lost to a attack by friendly militia troops who had never seen a before and mistook it for an Allied vehicle.

Near Unna, one climbed a hill to attack five American tanks 600 meters away, leading to two withdrawing and the other three opening fire. The took several hits but none of the American projectiles could penetrate the thick frontal armor of the vehicle&#x27;s casemate. However, the inexperienced German commander lost his nerve and turned around instead of backing down, thus exposing the thinner side armor, which was penetrated and all six crew members killed. Carius wrote that the crews were not trained or experienced enough to keep their thick frontal armour facing the enemy in combat.

When unable to escape the Ruhr Pocket, Carius ordered the guns of the remaining destroyed to prevent intact vehicles falling into Allied hands and then surrendered to American forces. The 10 of the 2nd Company of  512 destroyed one American tank for one lost to combat, one lost to friendly fire, and eight others lost to mechanical breakdown or destruction by their own crews to prevent capture by enemy forces.

On 17 January 1945, two used by the XIV Corps engaged a bunker-line in support of assaulting infantry near Auenheim. On 18 January, they attacked four secure bunkers at a range of 1,000 meters. The armored cupola of one bunker burned out after two shots. A Sherman attacking in a counter-thrust was set afire by explosive shells. The two Jagdtigers survived the fight, having fired 46 explosive shells and 10 anti-tank shells.

In April 1945,  512 saw a great deal of action, especially on 9 April, where the 1st Company engaged an Allied column of Sherman tanks and trucks from hull-down positions and destroyed 11 tanks and over 30 unarmored or lightly armored targets, with some of the enemy tanks knocked out from a distance of more than 4,000 m. The unit lost one in this incident, after Allied Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers appeared. During the next couple of days, the 1st Company destroyed a further five Sherman tanks before surrendering to US troops at Iserlohn. Meanwhile, the 2nd Company fought on with little gain. On 15 April 1945, the unit surrendered at Schillerplatz in Iserlohn.

== Survivors ==
Three survive, in US, UK and Russian museums:
* (serial number 305004): The Tank Museum in England. One of the 11 Porsche–designed suspension-equipped variants, it was captured by British troops in April 1945 near the armour proving ground at Sennelager, Germany, where it was undergoing testing and trials. The third wheel-station (paired-wheel bogie) on the left side is missing. Zimmerit was applied to approximately 2 meters high on the superstructure and the German Balkenkreuz was painted in the mid-section of the vehicle&#x27;s casemate&#x27;s side. The earlier 18-tooth drive-sprocket version is found on this vehicle (later vehicles had 9-tooth drive sprockets).
* (serial number 305020): U.S. Army Armor &amp; Cavalry Collection, Fort Moore, Georgia. It was produced in October 1944 and was attached to the 3rd Company of the  653, bearing the vehicle-number of 331. It was captured by American troops near , Germany in March 1945. Shell damage is still visible on the gun mantlet, glacis plate and lower-nose armor. This vehicle used the later-version nine-tooth drive sprockets for use with the &#x27;contact shoe&#x27; and &#x27;connector link&#x27;-style continuous track it shared with the Tiger II on which it was based.
* &quot;Jagdtiger&quot; (serial number 305083): Kubinka Tank Museum near Moscow. This vehicle, equipped with the standard Henschel-built running gear, was acquired by Soviet forces when a (battle-group) of the  653 equipped with four surrendered to the Red Army in Amstetten, Austria on 5 May 1945. This , not coated with Zimmerit, was acquired in mint condition with complete sideskirts and the later nine-tooth drive sprockets. Twelve hooks on both sides of the superstructure were designed to carry six pairs of track-links (the spare track-links are now missing on this vehicle). All of the Jagdtiger&#x27;s repair-tools are also missing, but it still retains the MG 42 anti-aircraft gun mount on the rear engine-deck (recent photographs show that this specific machine gun-mount has since been removed, leaving only its mounting-base).

== Variants ==
Aside from the 11 early vehicles with a Porsche suspension, the only variant developed was the Sd.Kfz.185.

*8.8 cm PaK 43 Jagdtiger – This variant used the 8.8 cm Pak 43 cannon instead of the 12.8 cm Pak 44 due to shortages of the latter weapon. The variant did not enter production.

<text>Spatial politics is an interdisciplinary field that analyses the ways in which space and geographic location influence political processes, power relations, and social dynamics. It examines how spatial arrangements, urban planning, and territorial boundaries impact societal structures and the distribution of resources, privileges, and disadvantages among different groups.

Spatial politics analyses how the use of space in society is political, positing that spatial configurations are a reflection of and reinforcement of political decisions. It studies how the control and organisation of space exercises power and influence over people and resources. This can manifest in the design of cities, zoning laws, and the strategic placement of infrastructure, all of which can serve to maintain or challenge existing power structures.

== Background and common debates ==

=== The origins of spatial politics ===
The origins of spatial politics are diverse and multidisciplinary, reflecting the interplay between power dynamics, social relations, political processes and physical spaces. The origins of spatial politics can be traced back to various historical, geographical, theoretical and philosophical developments from several disciplines, including:

&quot;Urban studies&quot; - Urban studies is based on the study of the urban development of cities and regions. It helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment. This includes understanding the spatial organisation of societies and the spatial aspects of cities and urban life, historically and in the present.

&quot;Marxist theory&quot; - Several marxist theorists have analysed the spatial dimensions of capitalism, emphasising how economic processes shape and are shaped by the spatial organisation of society. This includes exploring concepts like uneven development of capitalism, the concentration of capital in urban centres, and the spatial segregation of social classes. 

&quot;Critical space theory and feminist geography&quot; - Critical theorists such as Henri Lefebvre have looked to understand how power relations are inscribed in space, and how spatial arrangements can produce, reproduce and challenge social inequalities. Feminist geography has critiqued and extended traditional approaches to space and place, highlighting the gendered and intersectional dimensions of spatial organisation and inequalities. 

&quot;Environmental justice&quot; - Environmental justice movements have highlighted the intersection of spatial injustice and environmental degradation, by drawing attention to the spatial distribution of environmental hazards and unequal exposure of marginalised communities to environmental risk. 

=== Key debates within spatial politics ===
Within spatial politics, several debates shape academic inquiry and public discourse. These include:

&quot;Right to the city&quot; - The right to the city is a concept originating in urban studies, and is particularly associated with philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre. It is argued that urban space should be shaped and governed by the citizens that live in it, rather than solely be controlled by market forces such as capitalism and commodification. 

In the context of spatial politics, the concept brings into discussion debates about equitable access to essential resources, urban governance, participatory planning, gentrification and spatial justice. It draws attention to the debate of who has the right to produce space, and spatial production practices in private, public and common spaces. 

&quot;Spatial inequality and justice&quot; - Spatial inequality refers to social, economic and environmental inequalities that create disparities in access to resources, opportunities, and services across different spatial areas and scales. Spatial justice refers to addressing spatial inequalities and the fair and equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and environmental benefits across different spatial areas and scales. 

In the context of spatial politics, these debates centre on the unequal distribution of resources, infrastructure, opportunities and environmental risks, across spatial areas and scales. Spatial inequalities emphasise the importance of recognising the spatial dimensions of different inequalities, while spatial justice is a concept to guide efforts to address these inequalities. 

&quot;The city as a growth machine&quot; - The concept of the city as a growth machine originated from urban sociologist Harvey Molotch. The analogy explores the idea of powerful interest groups driving economic growth in urban areas and consequently shaping urban policies and governance. 

In the context of spatial politics, this concept draws attention to the need to study political influence including organisation, lobbying and structuring carried out by power interest groups when understanding spatial production. It also invites debate about the role of growth in urban processes. In response to the city as a growth machine, a degrowth spatial politics agenda has emerged.

&quot;Urbanisation -&quot; Cities or features of cities are increasingly positioned as the epicentre of prosperity and the solution for sustainability. For example, urban sprawl is seen as unsustainable, while denser and more compact cities are seen as sustainable. This creates a divide or a dichotomy with the role of rural areas. However, the concept of planetary urbanisation suggests that rural areas are also mobilised in the pursuit of economic growth, as they undergo changes that serve the city.

Urbanisation is a key debate within spatial politics due to its impact on social, economic, and environmental dynamics within urban spaces. Within this key debate are important discussions including gentrification and displacement, the role of technology, economic development, democracy and governance, and sustainability. 

== Spatial analysis ==

=== Space ===
Space refers to the physical dimensions, the state of ownership, the juridical understanding, the spatial, economic, and social relations of a place, and about the possibility and dynamics of the production of that place. Space is about spatial practices, such as the home and property.

In her famous work ‘For Space’: Doreen Massey defines space by three propositions:

* &quot;Space as the product of interrelations -&quot; Massey poses space as constituted through our interactions, ‘from the immensity of the global to the intimately tiny.’ 
* &quot;Space as the sphere of possibility -&quot; If space is the product of interrelations, then it must be predicated upon the existence of plurality, where different trajectories exist. She poses multiplicity and space as co-constitutive. 
* &quot;Space as a process -&quot; Space is always under construction because space is a product of relations-between, relations which have to be carried out,and therefore always are in the process of being made. It is never finished. Massey proposes we could imagine space as a &quot;simultaneity of stories-so-far.&quot; 

In &quot;The Production of Space.&quot;  Henri Lefebvre views space as a dynamic and socially constructed phenomenon. Space is produced by societies and is deeply influenced by social relations. He gives three dimensions of space:

* &quot;Spatial Practice (Perceived Space) -&quot; This refers to the physical and material dimensions of space that people experience in their daily lives. It encompasses the routines, activities, and interactions that occur in physical settings.
* &quot;Representations of Space (Conceived Space) -&quot; This dimension involves the mental and conceptual representations of space, often created by planners, architects, and scientists. It includes maps, plans, and designs that reflect the formal and organized ways societies envision and structure space.
* &quot;Spaces of Representation (Lived Space) -&quot; This is the space of symbolism, meaning, and lived experience. It includes the ways in which individuals and groups perceive and inhabit spaces, imbuing them with personal and cultural significance. Lived space is where imagination, memories, and emotions play a crucial role.

=== Place ===
Place refers to the actual locus, to the history and memory, and the spatial, cultural, historical relations of this locus. It involves locations that are imbued with personal, cultural, or communal significance, that highlight its identity and the social values we attribute to it. Place is a portion of space, seen as the outcome of the production of space through spatial politics. Places have meaning and are shaped by human experiences and interactions (Duarte, 2017).

=== Territory ===
Territory refers to the imposed qualities on a space. Territory is a concept associated with control, power, and political boundaries. It involves spaces that are claimed, governed, and regulated by individuals, groups, or institutions. An important characteristic of territory, therefore, is that it is constituted provided there is a system of values shared by those occupying that portion of space. The most institutionalised form of territory lies in the idea of the state. Territory, particularly in the modern world, is a conceptual device and an instrument designed for managing a portion of space, and the objects, people, and actions within it. Territory tends to have boundaries, which are governed internally and externally. (Duarte, 2017).

=== Maps ===
Space is reduced in various ways by creating maps. The representation of any object or phenomenon necessarily involves deciding which features to select and which features to leave out. Maps create new spatial understandings of the world, and also serve as social and political tools, such as the navigational maps used during the golden age of European navigation. (Duarte, 2017) Within spatial politics, a key understanding is that there is no right representation of space in maps. The decision of how you portray a certain space is always political. 

== Urban analysis ==

=== Touristification ===
Touristification refers to the process in which urban residential spaces are transformed to serve the needs of tourists and the mass-tourism sector. This transformation usually alters the social, spatial, cultural, and economic landscape of the area, which has led many to criticise the impacts of mass-tourism. Indeed, studies have shown that touristification can, among other things, cause prices on essentials such as housing and food to rise; erase the cultural heritage and traditions of the local area; harm the local environment due to high levels of wasted created.

This phenomenon has garnered increasing academic and political attention as it has become a major global industry, surpassing the automobile, oil export, and food products industries. Within this industry, urban tourism is by far the fastest growing sector. This reflects the reality that, according to UN findings, “54% of the world&#x27;s population lived in urban areas and, by 2030, this share is expected to reach 60%”. As such, many post-industrial cities, especially in Europe, have pivoted to focus on tourism as the main strategy for stimulating economic growth. 

Urban transformation has largely taken place in the historical centres of these cities, which were “(re)developed” in order to attract and manage more tourists. The effects of such redevelopment have been contradictory, as despite being extremely lucrative spaces for a city, touristified historical centres lose some of their history and cultural heritage, which lessens their appeal to tourists. 

There have been debates around whether touristification is a form of gentrification or a unique phenomenon. Some point to the fact that touristification, like gentrification results in the expulsion of locals to make space for an affluent population. On the other hand, others have stated that tourists do not settle down in the area they visit, making touristification a distinct process from gentrification. 

=== Rural-urban divide ===
Spatial politics calls for a new analysis of how space is produced, particularly in studying the urban and the rural. In the traditional view, informed by an analysis of 19th century metropolises, space is split in two between the urban centre and rural periphery. The two spaces are clearly delineated, with rural spaces supplying urban poles with resources. 

Spatial politics analysis, however, says that current space production has blurred the lines between the urban and the rural. The urban, according to spatial politics, should be analysed as a process, not a fixed thing in itself. Indeed, this analysis speaks of extended urbanisation, which refers to the transformation of rural and peri-urban spaces to integrate them into broad urban networks. For example, according to spatial politics, “rural” spaces used solely for agricultural products sent to a city are part of the urban network of the city. 

Furthermore, spatial politics analysis points to the fact that urbanisation is no longer limited to specific, recognisable urban centres. Instead, it extends across entire regions and even globally, influencing and transforming rural, suburban, and peri-urban areas. Cities are also increasingly interconnected through global networks of economic, social, and cultural flows. This interconnectedness means that urbanisation processes in one part of the world can have significant impacts on urban areas elsewhere.

=== Real subsumption of nature ===
The real subsumption of nature refers to the process by which capitalism extends its control over nature, transforming natural resources and processes into commodities for capitalist production and accumulation. The idea draws an analogy with the real subsumption of labour, originally outlined in Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital: A critique of political economy&quot;. This real subsumption of nature is a foundational concept for understanding common debates within spatial politics such as urbanisation processes, the rural-urban relationship and spatial inequalities.

<text>Nicolas Thomas Baudin (; 17 February 175416 September 1803) was a French explorer, cartographer, naturalist and hydrographer, most notable for his explorations in Australia and the southern Pacific. He carried a few corms of Gros Michel banana from Southeast Asia, depositing them at a botanical garden on the Caribbean island of Martinique.

== Biography ==
=== Early career ===
Born a commoner in Saint-Martin-de-Ré on the Île de Ré on 17 February 1754, Nicolas Baudin joined the merchant navy as an apprentice () at the age of 15; he was then &quot;of average height with brown hair&quot;. He then joined the French East India Company at the age of 20 on &quot;Flamand&quot;. He returned from India on &quot;L&#x27;Étoile&quot; and arrived at Lorient.

At the beginning of 1778, he was to set sail from Nantes on &quot;Lion&quot; as second lieutenant. It was a ship equipped by his uncle, Jean Peltier Dudoyer, at the request of the Americans, which would become a privateer and be renamed &quot;Deane&quot;. At first the Minister for the Navy was against it, but he finally changed his mind and authorised the departure, as France had signed a treaty with the United States on 6 February. Since the atmosphere between the French and American crews on &quot;Lion&quot; became unbearable, Baudin was assigned by Lamotte-Picquet to &quot;Duc de Choiseul&quot;, a ship equipped by Jean Peltier Dudoyer. Officially it was heading for Saint-Domingue, but in fact the destination was Nova Scotia. However the vessel was shipwrecked at Liverpool, Nova Scotia.

Baudin was wounded, taken prisoner by the British on 24 April 1778 and interned in Halifax, Canada. After one month, he escaped with 10 other prisoners and hid among the friendly communities of Acadia. Appointed captain of the transport vessel &quot;Amphitrite&quot;, he was sunk by the English out to sea, rescued in a rowing boat and made his way to Cape Cod and then Boston. As captain of &quot;Revanche&quot;, 400 tons, equipped by Jeange and sons of Bordeaux, with 30 men and 12 cannon, he was retaken by the English outside Cap-Français, heading for Boston. He was taken to Jamaica as a prisoner, then exchanged at the request of the Comte d&#x27;Argout, the Governor of Saint-Domingue. He returned to France on board the frigate &quot;Minerve&quot;, under the command of Captain de Grimouard, who was later guillotined at Rochefort under the Convention.

Back in France, he was appointed captain at the admiralty of La Rochelle on 2 March 1780 and was to sail in merchant ships. At the age of 27 he was named captain of &quot;Apollon&quot;, a civilian frigate of 1,100 tons and 42 cannon, fitted out by Jean Peltier Dudoyer. He was to form part of the convoy which took the Legion of Luxembourg to strengthen the defence of the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope. However, during a stopover in Brest, the Comte d&#x27;Hector decided he would appoint a man with more experience, Felix de Saint-Hilaire. Having returned to Nantes, and to the annoyance of Beaumarchais, the owner of the vessel, Baudin&#x27;s uncle entrusted him with the command of &quot;Aimable Eugenie&quot;, a ship of 600 tons, to go to Saint-Domingue and then to the US. He went back to Bordeaux and left the Gironde on 9 December 1782 as part of a convoy of five merchant vessels. Three days later, in the Action of 12 December 1782, the convoy was attacked by an English ship, . After a hard battle, Baudin escaped, but two other ships owned by Beaumarchais were captured.

Reaching Saint-Domingue, the ship sank on 23 March 1783 at Puerto Plata, but the freight was saved. He negotiated for it and set off once again for Nantes on 23 April on &quot;Prince Royal&quot;, which he had bought on the spot. On 30 August he resold the boat, which in the meantime had become &quot;Union des 6 Frères&quot;, to Robert Pitot, a shipbuilder from the Isle de France who had just been freed from an English prison, and established himself as a trader in Bordeaux. The insurance company reimbursed Beaumarchais through his shipbuilder Peltier Dudoyer.

On 16 April 1784, Baudin left once more for Saint-Domingue on &quot;Comte d&#x27;Angevillier&quot;, 1,000 tons with eight cannon, and built by Jean Peltier. He was still accompanied by his brother Alexandre Baudin as first mate. They were now 29 and 27 years old. Baudin had a 25% stake in the voyage and they returned to Nantes on 8 December 1784.

On 21 April 1785, he wrote to Benjamin Franklin requesting a recommendation to be accepted as a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He signed his letter &#x27;Commander of the private frigate &quot;Comte d&#x27;Angevilliers&quot;, Maison Peltier du Doyer quai de l&#x27;hôpital&#x27;.

On 22 July 1785, the Baudin brothers bought &quot;Caroline&quot;, a ship of 200 tons, built by the Thébaudière brothers. He was to take the last Acadians to Louisiana. He was a few months behind his brother Alexandre who was captain of &quot;Saint Remy&quot;, built by Jean Peltier Dudoyer. In La Nouvelle Orléans local merchants contracted him to take a cargo of wood, salted meat, cod and flour to Isle de France (now Mauritius), which he did in &quot;Josephine&quot; (also called &quot;Pepita&quot;), departing New Orleans on 14 July 1786 and arriving at Isle de France on 27 March 1787.

In the course of the voyage, &quot;Josephine&quot; had called at Cap‑Français in Haiti to make a contract to transport slaves there from Madagascar; while in Haiti he also encountered the Austrian botanist who apparently informed him that another Austrian botanist, Franz Boos, was at the Cape of Good Hope awaiting a ship to take him to Mauritius. &quot;Josephine&quot; called at the Cape and took Boos on board. At Mauritius, Boos chartered Baudin to transport him and the collection of plant specimens he had gathered there and at the Cape back to Europe, which Baudin did, with &quot;Josephine&quot; arriving at Trieste on 18 June 1788. The Imperial government in Vienna was contemplating organizing another natural-history expedition, to which Boos would be appointed, in which two ships would be sent to the Malabar and Coromandel coasts of India, the Persian Gulf, Bengal, Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Cochin China, Tongking, Japan, and China. Baudin had been given reason to hope that he would be given command of the ships of this expedition.

=== Austrian expeditions ===
Later in 1788, Baudin sailed on a commercial voyage from Trieste to Canton in &quot;Jardinière&quot;. He apparently arrived at Canton from Mauritius under the flag of the US, probably to avoid the possibility of having his ship seized by the Chinese for payment of the debts owed them by the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste. From there, he sent &quot;Jardinière&quot; under her second captain on a fur-trading venture to the north-west coast of America, but the ship foundered off Asuncion Island in the Northern Marianas Islands in late 1789.

Baudin made his way to Mauritius, where he purchased a replacement ship, &quot;Jardinière II&quot;, but this vessel was wrecked in a cyclone that struck Port Louis on 15 December 1789. Baudin embarked on the Spanish Royal Philippines Company ship, &quot;Placeres&quot;, which sailed from Port Louis for Cadiz in August 1790. &quot;Placeres&quot; called at the Cape of Good Hope where it took on board the large number of plant and animal specimens collected in South Africa for the Imperial palace at Schönbrunn by Georg Scholl, the assistant of Franz Boos. Because of the poor condition of the ship, &quot;Placeres&quot; had to put in at the island of Trinidad in the West Indies, where Scholl&#x27;s collection of specimens was deposited.

Baudin proceeded to Martinique, from where he addressed an offer to the Imperial government in Vienna to conduct to Canton commissioners who would be empowered to negotiate with the Chinese merchants there a settlement of the debts incurred by the Imperial Asiatic Company, which would enable the company to renew its trade with China. On its return voyage from Canton, the proposed expedition would call at the Cape of Good Hope to pick up Scholl and the remainder of his natural-history collection for conveyance to Schönbrunn.

After returning to Vienna in September 1791, Baudin continued to press his case for an expedition under the Imperial flag to the Indian Ocean and China, and in January 1792 he was granted a commission of captain in the Imperial navy for this purpose. A ship, called &quot;Jardinière&quot;, was acquired and the botanists Franz Bredemeyer and Joseph van der Schot appointed to the expedition. After delays caused by the outbreak of war between France and Austria (April 1792), &quot;Jardinière&quot; departed from the Spanish port of Málaga on 1 October 1792. From the Cape of Good Hope &quot;Jardinière&quot; sailed across the Indian Ocean to the coast of New Holland (Australia), but two consecutive cyclones prevented the expedition from doing any work there and forced Baudin to take the ship to Bombay for repairs.

From Bombay the expedition proceeded to the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa, where it gathered botanical and zoological collections. The expedition came to an abrupt end in June 1794 when &quot;Jardinière&quot; went aground in a storm while attempting to enter Table Bay at the Cape of Good Hope. Baudin survived the wreck and made his way to the US, from where he went to France. As the Cape had been occupied by the English in June 1795, Baudin went back to New England. On 23 November 1795, he set sail from New York as a passenger on board the American ship, &quot;Ocean&quot;, under the command of Captain Vredemburgh and also accompanied by General de Rochambeau, the Governor of Saint Lucia, the French Consul in Boston and a colonial trader from Saint-Domingue, Jean Baptiste Rivière de la Souchère (known as Souchère-Rivière). They arrived in Le Havre on 21 December 1795. Baudin believed that he was expected and offered his services and his talents. He wrote to the Minister to give notice of his imminent arrival in Paris. He would have been somewhat disappointed had he seen the little note at the top of the letter &#x27;Could Bonneville please tell me if he knows Captain Baudin and for which mission he was responsible?&#x27; He managed to send &quot;Jardinière&quot;″s cargo of natural history specimens to the island of Trinidad.

=== &quot;Belle Angélique&quot; Expedition ===
In Paris, Baudin visited Antoine de Jussieu at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris in March 1796 to suggest a botanical voyage to the Caribbean, during which he would recover the collection of specimens he had left in Trinidad. The museum and the French government accepted the proposal, and Baudin was appointed commander of an expedition in &quot;Belle Angélique,&quot; with four assigned botanists: René Maugé, André Pierre Ledru, Anselme Riedlé and Stanislas Levillain. &quot;Belle Angélique&quot; cleared Le Havre on 30 September 1796 for the Canary Islands, where the ship was condemned as unseaworthy. The expedition sailed from the Canaries in a replacement vessel, &quot;Fanny&quot;, and reached Trinidad in April 1797. The British, who had just captured the island from the Spanish in February 1797, refused to allow Baudin to recover the collection of natural-history specimens. Baudin took &quot;Fanny&quot; to St. Thomas and St. Croix, and then to Puerto Rico, specimens being collected in all three islands. At St Croix, &quot;Fanny&quot; was replaced by a newly purchased ship, renamed &quot;Belle Angelique&quot;. The expedition returned to France in June 1798 with a large collection of plants, birds and insects, which was incorporated into Bonaparte&#x27;s triumphal procession, on 27 July, celebrating his recent Italian victories. On the recommendation of the Naval Minister to the Directory, Baudin was reinstated into the navy with the rank of Chief of Staff to Admiral Bruix, who at his request, granted to Marie-Etienne Peltier the command of a corsair, the &quot;Virginie&quot;. Baudin joined Bruix on &quot;Océan&quot;, on which Bruix was in charge of the squadron which resupplied Genoa.

=== New Holland Expedition ===
On 24 July 1798, at the suggestion of the Ministry of Marine, Baudin presented to the Assembly of Professors and Administrators of the National Museum of Natural History a plan for a hydrographic-survey expedition to the South Seas, which would include a search for fauna and flora that could be brought back for cultivation in France. The expedition would also have the aim of promoting the economic and commercial interests of France in the regions to be visited. The expedition would require two well-equipped ships, which would carry a team of astronomers, naturalists and scientific draughtsmen over whom Baudin as commander would have absolute authority. The first part of the voyage would be devoted to a thorough exploration of the coast of Chile and the collection of animal, bird and plant specimens suitable for acclimatization in France, followed by a survey of the coasts from Peru to Mexico. The expedition would then continue into the Pacific Ocean, including a visit to Tahiti and the Society Islands, and would be completed with a survey of the yet unexplored south-west coast of New Holland (Australia). After considering this extensive proposal, the French government decided to proceed with an expedition confined to a survey of western and southern New Holland.

In October 1800, Baudin was selected by Bonaparte, whose wife Josephine had something of a fascination with Australia, to lead what has become known as the Baudin expedition to map the coast of New Holland. He had two ships, and captained by Hamelin, and a suite of nine zoologists and botanists, including Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour. Baudin left Le Havre on 19 October 1800, stopped off in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, then sailed straight to the Ile de France arriving on 15 March 1801, 145 days later. The over-long voyage, with early rationing, left sailors and scientists feeling discouraged, but the colony was happy to build up the crews in case of conflict and to make use of the new skills they brought with them. The expedition reached Australia in May 1801, and explored and mapped the western coast, and a part of the little-known southern coast of the continent. The scientific endeavour proved a great success, with more than 2,500 new species discovered. The French also met Aboriginal peoples and treated them with great respect.

In April 1802, Baudin met Matthew Flinders, also engaged in charting the coastline, in Encounter Bay in present-day South Australia. Baudin then stopped at the British colony at Sydney for supplies, and from there he sent home &quot;Naturaliste&quot;, carrying all of the specimens that had been collected by both ships up to that time. According to recent research by academics from the University of Adelaide, during Baudin&#x27;s expedition, François Péron, who had become the chief zoologist and intellectual leader of the mission, wrote a report for Bonaparte on ways to invade and capture the colony.

Realising that &quot;Géographe&quot; could not venture into some of the shallow waters along the Australian coast that he was intending to survey, he bought a new ship, , named after the wood it was made from, and placed it under the command of Louis de Freycinet, who would, 15 years later, make his own circumnavigation of the world in the corvette &quot;l&#x27;Uranie&quot;. He then headed back to Tasmania, before continuing along the southern and western coasts of Australia to Timor, mapping as he went. In very poor health, he then turned for home.

==Death==
Baudin died of tuberculosis at Mauritius on 16 September 1803, at the age of 49, apparently in the home of Madame Alexandrine Kerivel. Baudin&#x27;s exact resting place is not known, but the historian Auguste Toussaint believed that he was interred in the Kerivel family vault. However, the historian Edward Duyker likes to think that Baudin was buried in Le Cimetière de l’Ouest in the district of Port Louis, &quot;just a few hundred metres from the explorer’s certain love: the sea&quot;.

These were his last wishes:&quot;He gives and bequeaths to citizen Augustin Baudin, his brother, currently in India, his silver marine watch, his night telescope and an &#x27;Oriental Neptune&#x27;. He gives and bequeaths to Citizen Ronsin, wife of Citizen Louis Peltier, his porcelain from Saxony and Chantilly, consisting of three services, one of twelve cups, one of six and one of two pieces plus his gold watch. He names as the Executor of his will Citizen Louis Peltier (brother of Jean Peltier Dudoyer), Judge of the Court of Appeal of this colony, to whom he entrusts the execution of the present document wishing and expecting that his goods be distrained in accordance with usual custom.&quot;

A number of monuments have been established around Australia, including eight at various locations around Western Australia.

In Western Australia, there are many places that bear names from the French ships, sponsors and crew of Baudin&#x27;s 1801–04 voyage and Louis de Freycinet&#x27;s voyage in 1802–3, including:

<text>Co-operative Party Limited () is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom, supporting co-operative values and principles. The party currently has an electoral pact with the Labour Party. Established in 1917, the Co-operative Party was founded by co-operative societies to campaign politically for the fairer treatment of co-operative enterprise and to elect co-operators to Parliament. The party&#x27;s roots lie in the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Union established in 1881.

Since 1927, the Co-operative Party has had an electoral pact with the Labour Party, with the parties agreeing not to stand candidates against each other. Candidates selected by members of both parties contest elections using the description &quot;Labour and Co-operative Party&quot;. The Co-operative Party is a legally separate entity from the Labour Party, and is registered as a political party with the Electoral Commission. Co-operative Party members are not permitted to be members of any other political party in the UK apart from the Labour Party or Northern Ireland&#x27;s Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).

As of July 2024, the Co-operative Party was the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons, with 43 Members of Parliament. As all of its MPs sit with the Parliamentary Labour Party, this distinction is seldom made. The Co-operative Party also has representatives in the House of Lords, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd, the London Assembly and some local government authorities. In keeping with its co-operative values and principles, the Co-operative Party does not have a leader. Instead Joe Fortune is its General Secretary, Preet Kaur Gill chairs the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group, and Jim McMahon chairs the National Executive Committee. 

==History==
The Co-operative Party was formed in 1917 after being approved in May that year by the Congress of the British co-operative movement held in Swansea. Since an electoral pact was established in 1927, the party has stood joint candidates with the Labour Party. In 1938, the Co-operative Party adopted a written constitution that formalised its link with the Labour Party. Co-operative Party candidates first stood in elections under the &quot;Labour Co-operative&quot; banner in 1946.

In its formative years, the Co-operative Party was almost exclusively concerned with the trading and commercial problems of the co-operative movement. Since the 1930s, it has widened its emphasis, using influence gained through strong links with the political and commercial left to spread what it sees as the co-operative ethos and moral principles. The party now seeks recognition for co-operative enterprises and the &quot;social economy&quot;, and support for co-operatives and co-operation across Europe and the developing world. The party stands for a sustainable economy and society, and a culture of citizenship and socially responsible business represented by the practice of retail and industrial co-operatives. 

===Joint Parliamentary Committee===
The Joint Parliamentary Committee was set up in 1881 by The Co-operative Union. It was primarily a watchdog on parliamentary activities. Issues and legislation could be raised in the House of Commons only by lobbying sympathetic – usually Labour – MPs. As it was somewhat unsatisfactory to have to lobby MPs on each individual issue, motions were passed at the Co-operative Union Annual Congress urging direct parliamentary representation. However, for much of this early period societies would not commit funds.

===First World War and early years===
At the start of the First World War, the many retail societies in the co-operative movement grew in both membership and trade; this was due, in part, because of their very public anti-profiteering stance. When conscription was introduced and food and fuel supplies restricted, these societies began to suffer. The movement was under-represented on the various governmental distribution committees and tribunals. Co-operatives received minimal supplies and even management were often drafted, whereas business opponents were able to have even clerks declared vital for the war effort. Societies were also required to pay excess profits tax, although their co-operative nature meant they made no profits. A motion was tabled at the 1917 Congress held in Swansea by the Joint Parliamentary Committee and 104 retail societies, calling for direct representation at national and local government levels. The motion was passed by 1979 votes to 201.

At first, Co-operative Party candidates still stood separately from Labour in local elections. The Co-op Party&#x27;s Congress Reports listed the local authority candidates and their successes, listing them as (a) Co-operative, (b) Co-operative-Labour, or (c) Labour. Before 1946, there was no requirement that Co-operative Party candidates had also to be members of the Labour Party. The Co-operative Party presented itself as the representative of the members of its affiliated Co-operative Societies. Hence the Party claimed more than 11 million members in each of the six years 1962–67. At times, the Party presented itself as non-political. In his 1932 election address, High Wycombe&#x27;s first-elected Co-operative Party councillor Tom Collings wrote, &quot;The Chesham and Wycombe Co-operative Society, as one of the largest ratepayers in the town, claims the right of DIRECT REPRESENTATION ON THE COUNCIL. ... Our Co-operative Party is not affiliated to any Political Party, but like the [Co-operative] Society itself, is composed of members having divers political views.&quot;

===Central Co-operative Parliamentary Representation Committee===
An Emergency Political Conference was held on 18 October 1917. As a result, the Central Co-operative Parliamentary Representation Committee was formed in 1917, with the objective of putting co-operators into the House of Commons. This was soon renamed the Co-operative Party. The first national secretary was Samuel Perry, later a Member of Parliament and the father of Fred Perry. At first, the party put forward its own candidates. The first was H. J. May, later Secretary of the International Co-operative Alliance, who was unsuccessful at the January 1918 Prestwich by-election. Ten then stood in the 1918 general election. One candidate met with success, Alfred Waterson, who became a Member of Parliament for the Kettering seat. Waterson took the Labour whip in Parliament. In 1919, 151 Co-operative Party councillors were elected at local level. Waterson retired from Parliament in 1922, but four new Co-operative MPs were elected that same year, including A. V. Alexander, all of whom took the Labour whip. Six were elected in 1923 and five in 1924.

In the early years, Co-operative Party and Labour Party candidates stood against one another for election on at least one occasion, at Paisley in 1923, where a Labour candidate won enough votes to deny victory to J. M. Biggar of the Co-operative Party. Since the Cheltenham Agreement was made in 1927 the party has had an electoral agreement with the Labour Party, which allows for a limited number of Labour Co-operative candidates. This means that the parties involved do not oppose each other. The agreement has been amended several times, most recently in 2003, which was made in the name of the Co-operative Party rather than the Co-operative Union. After the formal agreement, nine Labour Co-operative MPs were elected at the 1929 general election, and Alexander was made a cabinet minister. However, only one was returned at the 1931 election against the backdrop of a massive defeat for Labour.

===Rise of sister party===
Labour&#x27;s recovery as a credible party of government during World War II and the formal links and local affiliations brought by the 1927 agreement saw benefits electorally for the Co-operative Party. In 1945, 23 Labour Co-operative MPs were elected and two held high office in the Labour government: Alexander and Alfred Barnes, who had been chair of the party.

With Labour&#x27;s fluctuating fortunes and the slow post-war decline of the co-operative movement, the party saw its influence and standing fall. By 1983, another nadir for Labour fortunes, only eight Labour Co-operative MPs were elected. In 1997, all 23 candidates won seats in Parliament and, after Labour assumed power, the party gained its first members of the Cabinet since A. V. Alexander: Alun Michael 1998–99 (later First Minister for Wales) and Ed Balls 2007–2010. In 2001, only one candidate was defeated: Faye Tinnion, who had stood against the Leader of the Conservative Party, William Hague.

==Organisation and structure==

The Co-operative Party is a membership organisation consisting of individual members as well as local, regional and national Co-operative Parties and affiliated co-operative societies and trade unions. Unlike other parties with representatives elected to Parliament, the Co-operative Party does not receive state funding and gets most of its income from membership subscriptions and affiliation fees. The party organisation is itself a co-operative society, registered with the Financial Conduct Authority.

The party&#x27;s highest decision-making body is the National Executive Committee (NEC), which is elected every three years by individual members, affiliated co-operatives and trade unions, the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group, and Co-operatives UK. An annual conference takes place each autumn to debate policy, discuss the party&#x27;s work and vote on motions, although its resolutions are only advisory on the NEC. The Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group co-ordinates the work of the party&#x27;s MPs and peers in Parliament.

===Affiliates===
Six of the UK&#x27;s largest consumer co-operatives are affiliated to the Co-operative Party: the Co-operative Group, Midcounties Co-operative, Central England Co-operative, East of England Co-operative, Scotmid Co-operative and Chelmsford Star Co-operative. The members of each co-operative society vote to approve affiliation to the party at their annual general meeting. The largest society and funder of the party is the Co-operative Group, which ballots its members each year on continued support for the Co-operative Party. At the May 2019 AGM, 79% of Co-operative Group members voted in favour of continued affiliation and that year donated £625,600 (2018: £625,600) to the Co-operative Party.

In 2016, Community became the first trade union to affiliate to the Co-operative Party, followed in 2018 by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw). Co-operatives UK, Co-operative Press and a number of worker co-operatives and housing co-operatives are also organisational members of the party.

===Local structure===
The local structure of the Co-operative Party&#x27;s is based on autonomous units known as Society Co-operative Parties, which operate in a similar way to Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs). Co-operative societies sponsor Society Co-operative Parties in their traditional areas of operation, which will often take the name of the supporting society (i.e. East of England Co-operative Party and East of England Co-operative).

Society Co-operative Parties usually have a number of branches covering one or more local authority area, which are the main way that individual members interact with the party to debate policy, select candidates for elections and liaise with Constituency Labour Parties. The Society Co-operative Party is overseen by a party council made up of delegates from branches and the supporting co-operative society. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a single national Society Co-operative Party. In England a local party will cover one or more county, or in some cases a full region.

===Labour and Co-operative Party===

The Co-operative Party and the Labour Party have had an electoral alliance known as the &#x27;National Agreement&#x27; since 1927, meaning they do not stand against each other in elections. Instead, the parties agree joint candidates to stand as Labour and Co-operative Party. Labour and Co-operative candidates can stand at elections at all levels in England, Scotland and Wales. Although both parties organise in Northern Ireland, they do not stand candidates for election. As a sister party, the Co-operative Party has a unique relationship with the Labour Party; this means that the parties do not affiliate at a UK level. Instead, local Society Co-operative Parties affiliate to Constituency Labour Parties, which facilitates local co-operation and the selection of joint candidates.

Most candidates use the Labour and Co-operative Party description on their ballot paper; however, some stand under another version, particularly for local government elections and elections in Scotland, Wales and London that use a list system. In this case, only one description will be used to avoid voters thinking Labour and Co-operative candidates are standing against Labour candidates; however, joint candidates are still recognised as part of the Labour and Co-operative Group if they are elected. Although only the Labour Party emblem is used on the ballot paper, candidates and representatives can use a joint logo on their printed materials and websites.

==Leadership==
The Co-operative Party does not have a single leader, with the responsibilities shared between Jim McMahon as Chair of the National Executive Committee, Preet Kaur Gill as Chair of the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group, and Joe Fortune as General Secretary, who oversees the day-to-day operations of the Party. For the purposes of the registration as a political party with the Electoral Commission, the General Secretary is registered as both the leader and the nominating officer.

<text>Knut (Norwegian and Swedish), Knud (Danish), or Knútur (Icelandic) is a Scandinavian and German first name, of which the anglicised form is Canute. In Germany both &quot;Knut&quot; and &quot;Knud&quot; are used. In Spanish and Portuguese Canuto is used which comes from the Latin version Canutus, and in Finland, the name Nuutti is based on the name Knut. The name is derived from the Old Norse Knútr meaning &quot;knot&quot;. In English the &quot;K&quot; is not mute, so the name is not properly pronounced &quot;nut&quot; or &quot;nute&quot;.

It is the name of several medieval kings of Denmark, two of whom also reigned over England during the first half of the 11th century.

<text>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is an umbrella term for a number of standards organizations which develop protocols for mobile telecommunications. Its best known work is the development and maintenance of:
* GSM and related 2G and 2.5G standards, including GPRS and EDGE
* UMTS and related 3G standards, including HSPA and HSPA+
* LTE and related 4G standards, including LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro
* 5G NR and related 5G standards, including 5G-Advanced
* An evolved IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) developed in an access independent manner

3GPP is a consortium with seven national or regional telecommunication standards organizations as primary members (&quot;organizational partners&quot;) and a variety of other organizations as associate members (&quot;market representation partners&quot;). The 3GPP organizes its work into three different streams: Radio Access Networks, Services and Systems Aspects, and Core Network and Terminals.

The project was established in December 1998 with the goal of developing a specification for a 3G mobile phone system based on the 2G GSM system, within the scope of the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s International Mobile Telecommunications-2000, hence the name 3GPP. It should not be confused with 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), which developed a competing 3G system, CDMA2000.

The 3GPP administrative support team (known as the &quot;Mobile Competence Centre&quot;) is located at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute headquarters in the Sophia Antipolis technology park in France.

== Organizational Partners ==
The seven 3GPP Organizational Partners are from Asia, Europe and North America. Their aim is to determine the general policy and strategy of 3GPP and perform the following tasks:
* The approval and maintenance of the 3GPP scope;
* The maintenance of the Partnership Project Description;
* Take the decision to create or cease a Technical Specification Groups, and approve their scope and terms of reference;
* The approval of Organizational Partner funding requirements;
* The allocation of human and financial resources provided by the Organizational Partners to the Project Co-ordination Group;
* Act as a body of appeal on procedural matters referred to them.

Together with the Market Representation Partners (MRPs) perform the following tasks:

* The maintenance of the Partnership Project Agreement;
* The approval of applications for 3GPP partnership;
* Take the decision against a possible dissolution of 3GPP.

The Organizational Partners are:
== Market Representation Partners ==

The 3GPP Organizational Partners can invite a Market Representation Partner to take part in 3GPP, which:

*Has the ability to offer market advice to 3GPP and to bring into 3GPP a consensus view of market requirements (e.g., services, features and functionality) falling within the 3GPP scope;
*Does not have the capability and authority to define, publish and set standards within the 3GPP scope, nationally or regionally;
*Has committed itself to all or part of the 3GPP scope;
*Has signed the Partnership Project Agreement.

, the Market Representation Partners are:
== Standards ==

3GPP standards are structured as &quot;Releases&quot;. Discussion of 3GPP thus frequently refers to the functionality in one release or another.
Each release incorporates hundreds of individual Technical Specification and Technical Report documents, each of which may have been through many revisions. Current 3GPP standards incorporate the latest revision of the GSM standards.

The documents are made available without charge on 3GPP&#x27;s web site. The Technical Specifications cover not only the radio part (&quot;Air Interface&quot;) and Core Network, but also billing information and speech coding down to source code level. Cryptographic aspects (such as authentication, confidentiality) are also specified.

== Specification groups ==

The 3GPP specification work is done in Technical Specification Groups (TSGs) and Working Groups (WGs).

There are three Technical Specifications Groups, each of which consists of multiple WGs:

* RAN (Radio Access Network): RAN specifies the UTRAN and the E-UTRAN. It is composed of six working groups.
* SA (Service and System Aspects): SA specifies the service requirements and the overall architecture of the 3GPP system. It is also responsible for the coordination of the project. SA is composed of six working groups.
* CT (Core Network and Terminals): CT specifies the core network and terminal parts of 3GPP. It includes the core network – terminal layer 3 protocols. It is composed of five working groups.
* GERAN (GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network): 
The closure of GERAN was announced in January 2016. The specification work on legacy GSM/EDGE system was transferred to RAN WG, RAN6. RAN6 was closed in July 2020 (https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/2128-r6_geran).

The 3GPP structure also includes a Project Coordination Group, which is the highest decision-making body. Its missions include the management of overall timeframe and work progress.

== Standardization process ==

3GPP standardization work is contribution-driven. Companies (&quot;individual members&quot;) participate through their membership to a 3GPP Organizational Partner. As of December 2020, 3GPP is composed of 719 individual members.

Specification work is done at WG and at TSG level:
* the 3GPP WGs hold several meetings a year. They prepare and discuss change requests against 3GPP specifications. A change request accepted at WG level is called &quot;agreed&quot;.
* the 3GPP TSGs hold plenary meetings quarterly. The TSGs can &quot;approve&quot; the change requests that were agreed at WG level. Some specifications are under the direct responsibility of TSGs and therefore, change requests can also be handled at TSG level. The approved change requests are subsequently incorporated in 3GPP specifications.

3GPP follows a three-stage methodology as defined in ITU-T Recommendation I.130:
* &quot;stage 1 specifications&quot; define the service requirements from the user point of view.
* &quot;stage 2 specifications&quot; define an architecture to support the service requirements.
* &quot;stage 3 specifications&quot; define an implementation of the architecture by specifying protocols in details.
Test specifications are sometimes defined as stage 4, as they follow stage 3.

Specifications are grouped into releases. A release consists of a set of internally consistent set of features and specifications.

Timeframes are defined for each release by specifying freezing dates. Once a release is frozen, only essential corrections are allowed (i.e. addition and modifications of functions are forbidden). Freezing dates are defined for each stage.

The 3GPP specifications are transposed into deliverables by the Organizational Partners.

<text>The Saab EV-1, or Saab 900 Turbo EV-1, was developed by Saab in 1985 as a fully functional and roadworthy future concept car, EV-1 stands for ´Experimental Vehicle One´.

It was a wedge shaped 2 + 2 sports coupé body style based on the Saab 900 Turbo 16v. The body was steel and the roof all glass. The design was made by Björn Envall, and the metal work was done by Leif Mellberg included features such as a solar powered interior cooling fan, with 66 solar cells mounted in the glass roof. 

This device cooled the car when parked in sunlight. The front and rear bumpers (fenders) were designed to absorb impacts and revert to their original shape. They were made of Aramid fibre (Twaron or Kevlar) reinforced composites. The side doors featured carbon-fibre side impact protection. 

Most of the parts were from the Saab 900 Turbo 16 and modified, but the seats came from a Chevrolet Corvette. The engine was tuned to give 285 hp (213 kW). The top speed was and 0 to acceleration took 6.9 seconds. 

The speedometer lights only illuminate the area around the current speed; a modified version of this feature has been incorporated as standard on later production Saab models. The windshield is wrap around and very deep and steeply inclined for the era, while the A-pillar has a much more vertical angle, providing excellent driver visibility.

The EV-1 can be seen in the background of &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;.

<doc id="397310" wikidata="Q327681" url="?curid=397310" title="Dogville">
<text>Dogville is a 2003 drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier. It features an ensemble cast led by Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Chloë Sevigny, Stellan Skarsgård, Udo Kier, Ben Gazzara, Patricia Clarkson, Harriet Andersson, and James Caan, with John Hurt as the narrator. The film employs an extremely minimal, stage-like set to tell the story of Grace Mulligan (Kidman), a woman on the run from mobsters who finds refuge in the small mountain town of Dogville, Colorado, in exchange for physical labor.

The film is the first installment in Trier&#x27;s incomplete &quot;USA: Land of Opportunities&quot; trilogy. It was followed by &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005), though the intended third part, &quot;Washington&quot;, was never produced. &quot;Dogville&quot; premiered in the main competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. After screenings at various film festivals, it received a limited release in the US on 26 March 2004.

&quot;Dogville&quot; received polarized reviews from critics upon its release. While some deemed it pretentious or exasperating, others hailed it as a masterpiece. Over time, the film has grown in stature and was included in the 2016 BBC poll of the greatest films since 2000. Renowned filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and Denis Villeneuve have praised the film.

==Plot==

Prologue: &quot;Which introduces us to the town and its residents&quot;: Set in the isolated Rocky Mountain town of Dogville, near an abandoned silver mine, the film opens with a narrator introducing its 15 residents. Through the perspective of Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany), an idealistic philosopher who organizes meetings on &quot;moral rearmament,&quot; the townsfolk are depicted as quaint but flawed. Tom aspires to replace his physician father as the community’s moral leader.

Chapter 1: &quot;In which Tom hears gunfire and meets Grace&quot;: Tom encounters Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman), a fugitive fleeing gangsters. After hiding her in the mine, he convinces her to stay, arguing the mountains are impassable. When gangsters arrive searching for Grace, Tom lies about her whereabouts but accepts a reward card. At a town meeting, Tom proposes sheltering Grace as a test of their morality. The skeptical residents agree to a two-week trial, during which Grace must earn their trust.

Chapter 2: &quot;In which Grace embarks upon physical labor&quot;: Grace begins chores for the townspeople: comforting blind recluse Jack McKay, babysitting for Chuck and Vera, and assisting shopkeeper Ma Ginger. Her willingness to help softens initial reluctance, and she gradually integrates into Dogville.

Chapter 3: &quot;In which Grace indulges in a shady provocation&quot;: Grace bonds with Jack, who pretends to see. She tricks him into admitting his blindness, earning his respect. After the trial period, the town votes unanimously to let her stay.

Chapter 4: &quot;Happy times in Dogville&quot;: Grace continues her work, saving wages to buy porcelain figurines from Ma Ginger. Tensions rise when police post a &quot;Missing&quot; notice with Grace’s name. Though divided on cooperating, the town opts to protect her—for now.

Chapter 5: &quot;Fourth of July after all&quot;: During Fourth of July celebrations, Tom confesses his love for Grace, reciprocated warmly. The mood sours when police replace the notice with a &quot;Wanted&quot; poster, accusing Grace of bank robbery. The town insists she’s innocent but demands more labor as a quid pro quo. Reluctantly, Grace agrees.

Chapter 6: &quot;In which Dogville bares its teeth&quot;: Grace’s expanded workload strains relations. Mistakes invite scorn: men sexually harass her, women grow abusive, and Vera’s son Jason manipulates Grace into spanking him. The abuse culminates in Chuck raping Grace in his orchard.

Chapter 7: &quot;In which Grace leaves Dogville and sees daylight&quot;: Grace confides in Tom, who plans her escape. Vera retaliates for the spanking, while Martha exposes Chuck’s assault. Vera smashes Grace’s figurines, mocking her Stoic teachings. Tom arranges for trucker Ben to smuggle Grace out, but Ben rapes her and returns her to Dogville. Blamed for Tom’s theft of his father’s money, Grace is enslaved—chained, raped, and tormented by the town, including children who mock her suffering with church bells.

Chapter 8: &quot;In which a meeting reveals the truth&quot;: At a town meeting, Grace details her abuse, prompting residents to vote to hand her to the gangsters. Tom, feigning loyalty, attempts to sleep with her but is rebuffed. Realizing his hypocrisy, he betrays Grace by calling her pursuers. Resigned, Grace mutters, &quot;Nobody’s gonna sleep here&quot;—echoing Pirate Jenny’s vengeance anthem.

Chapter 9: &quot;In which Dogville receives its awaited visit&quot;: The gangsters arrive, led by Grace’s father. Revealed as a mob boss’s daughter, Grace initially resists his harsh worldview but, after introspection, condemns Dogville. She orders the town’s annihilation: Vera must watch her children die unless she stifles tears, echoing her own torment. Dogville is razed, its residents massacred. Tom, applauding Grace’s &quot;illustration,&quot; is executed by her. Only the dog Moses—whose bone Grace once took—is spared. 

The credits roll over Jacob Holdt’s stark photos of American poverty, set to &quot;Young Americans&quot; by David Bowie.
==Cast==
==Pilot==
&quot;Dogville: The Pilot&quot; was shot during 2001 in the pre-production phase to test whether the concept of chalk lines and sparse scenery would work. The 15-minute pilot film starred Danish actors Sidse Babett Knudsen (as Grace) and Nikolaj Lie Kaas (as Tom). Eventually Lars von Trier was happy with the overall results. Thus, he and the producers decided to move forward with the production of the feature film. The test pilot was never shown in public, but is featured on the second disc of the &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003) DVD, released in November 2003.

==Staging==
The story of &quot;Dogville&quot; is narrated by John Hurt in nine chapters and takes place on a stage with minimalist scenery. Some walls and furniture are placed on the stage, but the rest of the scenery exists merely as white painted outlines which have big labels on them; for example, the outlines of gooseberry bushes have the text &quot;Gooseberry Bushes&quot; written next to them. While this form of staging is common in black box theaters, it has rarely been attempted on film before—the Western musical &quot;Red Garters&quot; (1954) and &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; (1994) being notable exceptions. The bare staging serves to focus the audience&#x27;s attention on the acting and storytelling, and also reminds them of the film&#x27;s artificiality. As such it is heavily influenced by the theatre of Bertolt Brecht. (There are also similarities between the song &quot;Seeräuberjenny&quot; (&quot;Pirate Jenny&quot;) in Brecht and Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot; (&quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;) and the story of Dogville. Chico Buarque&#x27;s version of this song, &quot;Geni e o Zepelim&quot; [Geni and the Zeppelin], deals with the more erotic aspects of abjection and bears striking similarity to Trier&#x27;s cinematic homage to the song.) The film used carefully designed lighting to suggest natural effects such as the moving shadows of clouds, and sound effects are used to create the presence of non-existent set pieces (e.g., there are no doors, but the doors can always be heard when an actor &quot;opens&quot; or &quot;closes&quot; one).

The film was shot on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 camera in a studio in Trollhättan, Sweden.

==Interpretations==
According to Trier, the point of the film is that &quot;evil can arise anywhere, as long as the situation is right&quot;.

Film review show &quot;At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; criticized &quot;Dogville&quot; as having a strongly anti-American message, citing, for example, the closing credits sequence with images of poverty-stricken Americans which were taken from Jacob Holdt&#x27;s documentary book &quot;American Pictures&quot; (1984), and accompanied by David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Young Americans&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Dogville&quot; polarised critics upon its United States theatrical release, with Metacritic giving it a score of 61 (&quot;Generally favourable reviews&quot;) and the Rotten Tomatoes critics&#x27; consensus for it stating simply, &quot;A challenging piece of experimental filmmaking.&quot; 70% of critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7/10, based on 168 reviews. Many hailed it as an innovative and powerful artistic statement, while others considered it to be an emotionally detached or even misanthropic work. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, J. Hoberman wrote, &quot;For passion, originality, and sustained chutzpah, this austere allegory of failed Christian charity and Old Testament payback is von Trier&#x27;s strongest movie—a masterpiece, in fact.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film 3.5/4 stars, praising Kidman&#x27;s performance and dubbing it &quot;a movie that never met a cliche it didn&#x27;t stomp on.&quot; Scott Foundas of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; described it as a work of &quot;boldness, cutting insight, [and] intermittent hilarity&quot;, and interpreted it as &quot;a potent parable of human suffering.&quot; In &quot;Empire&quot;, Alan Morrison wrote that &quot;&quot;Dogville&quot;, in a didactic and politicised stage tradition, is a great play that shows a deep understanding of human beings as they really are.&quot;

In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, on the other hand, Manohla Dargis dismissed it as &quot;three hours of tedious experimentation.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; argued that Trier lacked humanity and wrote that the director &quot;presumably wants us to attend to his characters&#x27; yearnings and prejudices without the distractions of period furnishings. It&#x27;s a brilliant idea, for about 10 minutes. Then the bare set is elbowed out of a viewer&#x27;s mind by the threadbare plot and characterizations.&quot; Roger Ebert, who gave it two out of four stars, felt that the film was so pedantic as to make Trier comparable to a crank, and viewed it as &quot;a demonstration of how a good idea can go wrong.&quot; In the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, Sean Axmaker said, &quot;There&#x27;s no denying von Trier is visually intriguing. ... But as an artist, his contempt for humanity is becoming harder to hide with stylistic flourish.&quot; Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; additionally responded to allegations of the film&#x27;s anti-Americanism with the charge that it was &quot;anti-human&quot;, and said that it was &quot;as total a misanthropic vision as anything control freak Stanley Kubrick ever turned out&quot;—while personally admitting that he felt Trier was as deliberate a filmmaker as Kubrick.

Later, &quot;Dogville&quot; was named one of the greatest films of its decade in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The List&quot;, and &quot;Paste&quot;. In 2016, it was ranked one of the 100 greatest motion pictures in a critics&#x27; poll conducted by BBC Culture. It was listed the 37th best film of the same time period by &quot;The Guardian&quot; critics.

American director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino has named the film as one of the 20 best to have been released during the time of his active career as a director; (which was between 1992 and 2009 when he was interviewed) he said that if it had been written for the stage, Trier would have won a Pulitzer Prize.

===Box office===
The film grossed $1,535,286 in the US market and $15,145,550 from the rest of the world for a total gross of $16,680,836 worldwide. In the opening US weekend it did poorly, grossing only $88,855. The movie was released in only nine theaters, with an average of $9,872 per theater. In Denmark, the film grossed $1,231,984. The highest-grossing country was Italy, with $3,272,119.

===&quot;Best-of&quot; lists===
&quot;Dogville&quot; made many 2004 top-ten lists:
* 1st – Mark Kermode, &quot;BBC Radio Five Live&quot;
* 2nd – J. Hoberman, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;
* 3rd – Overall, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;
* 4th – Dennis Lim, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;
* 5th – Jack Mathews, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;
* 8th – J. R. Jones, &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;
* n/a – David Sterritt, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;
* n/a – Ron Stringer, &quot;LA Weekly&quot;

The film received nine votes (with six from critics and three from directors) in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls.

===Accolades===
==Opera adaptation==
The opera adaptation &quot;Dogville&quot; was composed by Gordon Kampe and premiered in 2023 at the Aalto Theatre in Essen. The premiere was postponed two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The story is compressed to a runtime of 110 minutes.

<doc id="397321" wikidata="Q10898980" url="?curid=397321" title="The Frontier (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Frontier was a pro-democracy political group in Hong Kong. It was founded on 26 August 1996 by a group of Legislative Council members and democratic activists headed by Convenor Emily Lau. It was merged into the Democratic Party, the pro-democracy flagship party on 23 November 2008. A new party bearing the same name was established in 2010 by former members who opposed the previous Frontier joining the Democratic Party.

==Beliefs==
Among the pro-democratic parties, the Frontier took a relatively radical political agenda than the Democratic Party. Besides upholding human rights, rule of law and fighting for universal suffrage, it called for a new constitution drafted by the Hong Kong people to replace the Hong Kong Basic Law, which led to a direct confrontation to the PRC central government. For its continuing challenge to the central and SAR governments, it was described as a &quot;head-bander&quot; party.

The group had a left wing position on economic matters, with both membership and legislators except Emily Lau heavily involved in labour and worker activities.

==History==
The Frontier was officially launched on 26 August 1996 by one of Hong Kong&#x27;s most popular pro-democracy figures, Emily Lau. The founding members included her colleagues in the Legislative Council, Lee Cheuk-yan and Lau Chin-shek from the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU), Leung Yiu-chung from the Neighbourhood and Workers Service Centre (NWSC) and Independent Elizabeth Wong, as well as about 100 professionals, students and unionists. It had five seats in the last days in the colonial legislature, making it the second-largest pro-democracy group after the Democratic Party. The Frontier did not regard itself as a political party, but rather as an alliance for &quot;democracy, human rights and the rule of law&quot; in Hong Kong.

In the 1998 LegCo elections, the Frontier won total of three seats, excluding Lau Chin-shek who ran as Democratic Party candidate and Leung Yiu-chung ran as Independent, gaining about 10% of the popular votes just behind the pro-democracy flagship party Democratic Party and pro-Beijing flagship party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). Emily Lau and Cyd Ho were elected with the highest votes in the New Territories East.

Although Emily Lau, Cyd Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan were re-elected in the 2000 LegCo elections, Lee Cheuk-yan began to run under the banner of the CTU. which made the Frontier&#x27;s seat in the legislature reduce to two.

In April 2002, a number of radical &quot;Young Turks&quot; faction of the Democratic Party including Andrew To who had earlier formed a group called the Social Democratic Forum (SDF), split from the Democrats to join the Frontier.

In the 2004 LegCo elections, the Frontier won only one seat in the LegCo, occupied by Emily Lau, after Cyd Ho lost in the Hong Kong Island. This was believed to be caused by a tactical mistake by the Democratic Party to absorb too many votes from Cyd Ho which led to the defeat of Ho to DAB&#x27;s Choy So-yuk.

On 23 November 2008 after the LegCo elections, the Frontier declared to merge with the Democratic Party, but the motion to have it disbanded failed to meet the required support level of 80%. A new party bearing the same name was established on 9 September 2010 by former members who opposed the previous Frontier joining the Democratic Party. Yang Sun-kong, the former Secretary General of the Frontier became the Convenor of the new group which is now part of the radical pro-democracy People Power. Emily Lau became the Vice-Chairwoman of the Democratic Party and was subsequently elected as the party&#x27;s Chairwoman in 2012 leadership election.

<doc id="397323" wikidata="Q220361" url="?curid=397323" title="Zoot suit">
<text>A zoot suit (occasionally spelled zuit suit) is a men&#x27;s suit with high-waisted, wide-legged, tight-cuffed, ged trousers, and a long coat with wide lapels and wide padded shoulders. It is most notable for its use as a cultural symbol among the Hepcat and Pachuco subcultures. Originating among African Americans it would later become popular with Mexican, Filipino, Italian, and Japanese Americans in the 1940s.

The zoot suit originated in African American comedy shows within the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit in the 1920s. Comedians such as Pigmeat Markham, Stepin Fetchit, and many others would dress in rags or in baggy suits for their comedic routines. This style of oversized suits would later become more stylish and popular in the inner city ghettos. Many tap and Lindy hop dancers would wear loose-fitting suits to the clubs and ballrooms. These suits made it much easier to navigate through the dance floor while dancing. Jazz and Jump Blues singers helped popularize the style in the 1930s and 40s. Cab Calloway called them &quot;totally and truly American&quot;. The suits were worn mainly by African American men, including a young Malcolm X. During the rationing of World War II, they were criticized as a wasteful use of cloth, wool being rationed then. In 1942, the War Production Board issued restrictions aimed at stopping the sale of zoot suits.

In the so-called Zoot Suit Riots of 1943, groups of predominately Mexican zoot suiters became victims of repeated racial mob violence. Wearing of the zoot suit was never banned, despite a debate of its prohibition by the Los Angeles City Council in the aftermath of the riots. The zoot suit became an important symbol of cultural pride and defiance of oppression in the Chicano Movement. It experienced a brief resurgence in the swing revival scene in the 1990s. The suit is still worn by Chicano in Mexican subcultures for memorialization events, regular celebrations, and special occasions.

== History ==

=== Hepcats ===

The suits were first associated with African-Americans in communities such as Harlem, Chicago, and Detroit in the 1930s, but were made popular nationwide by Jazz and Jump Blues musicians in the 1940s. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;zoot&quot; probably comes from African American Vernacular English and reduplication of suit. The origin of the zoot suit has been disputed through out the years. Essentially Zoot suits were just oversized or baggy suits, frequently seen with loud colors. Over time, it became tailored to have its own distinctive look. There was no one designer in creating the zoot suits, however many tailors have taken credit for its definitive style. Harold C. Fox, a Chicago clothier and big-band trumpeter; Charles Klein and Vito Bagnato of New York City; Louis Lettes, a Memphis tailor; and Nathan (Toddy) Elkus, a Detroit retailer. Harold C. Fox has given inspirational credit to African American teenagers for the Zoot Suits. He was quoted in saying &quot;The zoot was not a costume or uniform from the world of entertainment. It came right off the street and out of the ghetto.&quot;
&quot;A Zoot Suit (For My Sunday Gal)&quot; was a 1942 song written by L. Wolfe Gilbert and Bob O&#x27;Brien. Jazz bandleader Cab Calloway frequently wore zoot suits on stage, including some with exaggerated details, such as extremely wide shoulders or overly draped jackets. He wore one in the 1943 film &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. In his dictionary, &quot;Cab Calloway&#x27;s Cat-ologue: A &quot;Hepster&#x27;s&quot; Dictionary&quot; (1938), he called the zoot suit &quot;the ultimate in clothes. The only totally and truly American civilian suit.&quot;

=== Pachucos and Pachucas ===
Pachucos and Pachucas were early Chicano youth who participated in a subculture that fashioned zoot suits. The subculture emerged in El Paso, Texas, in the late 1930s and quickly spread to Los Angeles. Pachucos and Pachucas embraced this style that challenged white American norms around race and gender norms The Mexican American zoot suit style was usually black, sharkskin, charcoal gray, dark blue, or brown in color with pinstripes. African American styles usually incorporated brighter colors, thick chalk stripes, floppy hats, and long chains more often than Mexican Americans. Both Pachucos and Hepcats functioned on the margins in American society. Some Pachucos and Hepcats shared solidarity or respect for one another because of this.

In the early 1940s, Pachucos were associated with violence and criminal behavior by the American media, which fueled anti-Mexican sentiment and especially negative views of the zoot suit style in Los Angeles. Pachucas, some of whom also wore the zoot suit, often with some modifications and additional accessories like dark lipstick, were seen as threatening to ideas of family stability and racial uplift, often shunned by their communities and the wider public. The zoot suits became framed as unpatriotic, referring to the excessiveness of cloth during wartime. In 1942, police from across Los Angeles arrested 600 Mexican Americans in the Sleepy Lagoon murder case, which involved the murder of José Gallardo Díaz at a party. Almost all of those arrested as allegedly potential suspects were wearing zoot suits.

Media coverage before and after the case sensationalized and further fanned the flames of hostile anti-Mexican sentiments in the city and abroad. This made some Mexican Americans hesitant to wear the zoot suit, since they did not want to be viewed as criminals simply for their style of dress. Some Pachucos became affiliated with early gangs in Los Angeles and embraced their presumed-to-be criminal status with the zoot suit. Others wore the zoot suit, but refused to refer to themselves as &#x27;zoot suiters.&#x27; Mexican Americans who rejected Pachucos and zoot suit attire became known as &#x27;squares&#x27; who were said to believe in assimilation and racial uplift theory. 

This tension exploded in 1943 in a series of anti-Mexican riots in Los Angeles that became termed the Zoot Suit Riots. For ten days, white U.S. servicemen cruised Mexican American neighborhoods searching for zoot suiters to attack. In some cases, youth as young as twelve were attacked and dragged out of establishments. Filipinos and Black zoot suiters were also targeted, such as a Black man who had his eye gouged out with a knife by &quot;a crowd of whites.&quot; After being attacked, Mexican and Black zoot suiters rioted against white U.S. servicemen. On the fifth day of the riots, the zoot suiters repelled attackers in a coordinated effort. Busloads of police were brought in to rescue &quot;the retreating servicemen,&quot; after which &quot;dozens of Mexicans&quot; were arrested. Military officials declared Los Angeles off limits to servicemen the next day.

After hearing of the event, an article for the &quot;Pittsburgh [PA] Courier&quot; warned that Black zoot suiters could be the next target for &quot;the patriotic lawlessness of men in uniform&quot; and stated that both &quot;Los Angeles Negro and Mexican zoot suiters are closer together than they are to members of their own racial group.&quot; Norris J. Nelson, Los Angeles City Council member, proposed outlawing zoot suits, although this did not occur due to questions about its constitutionality.

Cesar Chavez sported zoot suit attire in his younger years and the zoot suit became an important cultural symbol for the Chicano Movement. The earliest youth who reclaimed the word Chicano as an identity of empowerment were in fact Pachucos.

=== White Americans ===

Throughout the 1940s, white American views on the zoot suit varied. The jive talk of African American hepcats had spread among white middle class youth in the early 1940s. This began to reduce stress on the origins of the zoot suit as a Black cultural symbol, which made it more acceptable to white Americans. Prior to the Zoot Suit Riots, the zoot suit was sometimes positioned as a symbol of American individualism and even patriotism in comparison to the fascist uniform attire and regimentation of Nazi Germany. White and Black soldiers would sometimes be seen &quot;zooting&quot; their uniforms in war effort photos, with the press presenting the zoot suit as a symbol of youthful relatability rather than as an oppositional or unpatriotic symbol. Most of the visible tension surrounding the zoot suit prior to the riots was concentrated in the Los Angeles area regarding the spread of anti-Mexican sentiment among whites in the city.

=== Trinidad ===

Zoot suits not only played a historical role in the subculture in the United States in the 1940s, but also shaped a new generation of men in Trinidad. These Trinidadian men who adopted this American fashion became referred to as the &quot;saga boys&quot;; they wore these suits and embraced the glamorous lifestyle that they represented. &quot;Their fondness for the zoot suit, in particular signified a rejection of Anglo-centric precepts not only about fashion but, more profoundly, about manhood.&quot;

Therefore, although the &quot;saga boys&quot; had the appearance of adapting to the urban American way of life, they were in fact using this clothing and lifestyle as a way to improve their lives in Trinidad, rise above the restrictions that imperialism brought and create through this oppositional dress, a culture of their own.

=== Swing revival era ===

In the swing revival era, which started in 1989 and carried to about 1998, the zoot suit experienced a small resurgence mostly based in nostalgia of the 1940s era, yet notably missed many of the racial dynamics that surrounded the zoot suit. Bands included The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Royal Crown Revue, and Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies. One of the popular songs of the era was the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies&#x27; &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, which presented the historical moment of the Zoot Suit Riots through a lens of masculine power.
=== Contemporary ===
The zoot suit is regularly memorialized by the Chicano community today as a symbol of cultural pride. Some of this is owed to Luis Valdez&#x27;s 1979 play &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; and its subsequent 1981 film, which carried knowledge of the era and interest in the style forward. Outside of memorialization events, such as those held on the anniversary of the Zoot Suit Riots, the zoot suit is still sometimes worn by Chicanos for special occasions, including proms, usually as a dual display of formal wear and cultural pride. It is also worn in certain urban areas in Mexico for similar purposes.

==Characteristics==

Traditionally, zoot suits have been worn with a fedora or pork pie hat color-coordinated with the suit, occasionally with a long feather as decoration, and pointy, French-style shoes.
A young Malcolm X, who wore zoot suits in his youth, described the zoot suit as: &quot;a killer-diller coat with a drape shape, reet pleats, and shoulders padded like a lunatic&#x27;s cell&quot;. 

Zoot suits usually featured a watch chain dangling from the belt to the knee or below, then back to a side pocket. A woman accompanying a man wearing a zoot suit would commonly wear a flared skirt and a long coat.

The amount of material and tailoring required made them luxury items, so much so that the U.S. War Production Board said that they wasted materials that should be devoted to the World War II war effort. When &quot;Life&quot; published photographs of zoot suiters in 1942, the magazine joked that they were &quot;solid arguments for lowering the Army draft age to include 18-year-olds&quot;. This extravagance, which many considered unpatriotic in wartime, was a factor in the Zoot Suit Riots. 

To some, wearing the oversized suit was a declaration of freedom and self-determination, even rebelliousness.

Some observers claim that the &quot;Edwardian-look&quot; suits with velvet lapels worn by Teddy Boys in Britain are a derivative of the zoot suit.

<text>John McAllion (born 13 February 1948) is a campaigner for the Scottish Socialist Party, as well as a former Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), and convenor of Tayside Regional Council. He is also convener of the Scottish Fairtrade Forum.

== Early life ==
McAllion was born in Glasgow, where he was educated at St Augustine&#x27;s RC Comprehensive School in Milton. Following a brief period spent working as a clerical employee for the Post Office, he was admitted to the University of St Andrews to study modern and medieval history, graduating with a second-class honours degree in 1972. After a further year at Dundee College of Education, he was then employed by the city&#x27;s education department to teach history at St Saviour&#x27;s RC High School (1973–78) and social studies at Balgowan School (1978–82).

== Political history ==
McAllion was originally a member of the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) that was formed in 1976 by Jim Sillars; when the SLP collapsed, he chose to join the Labour Party (unlike Sillars, who joined the Scottish National Party). In 1982 he was recruited by the Glasgow Labour MP Bob McTaggart as a research assistant. Two years later, he was elected to Tayside Regional Council, becoming the council&#x27;s convenor in 1986. At the 1987 general election McAllion was elected as the Labour MP for Dundee East, defeating SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who had been the sitting MP since February 1974.

McAllion was a member of Scottish Labour Action, putting him on the Scottish nationalist wing of the Labour Party, and of the Campaign for Socialism, placing him firmly on the left of the party. As befitted a member of the Scottish Labour Action group he strongly favoured home rule for Scotland, and was often outspoken in his defence of civic-minded Scottish nationalism. In 1999 he was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent Dundee East.

As an MSP, he furthered his reputation as a left-winger, rebelling several times against the Labour-led Scottish Executive. He was also convenor of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Petitions Committee. In 2000 he helped establish the &quot;Scottish Left Review&quot; publication. At the 2003 parliament election he lost his seat to Shona Robison, the SNP candidate. The Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) pulled out of contesting the seat in favour of McAllion, but ironically this may have assisted his defeat.

After the election defeat, McAllion resigned his membership of the Labour Party, subsequently joining the Scottish Socialist Party. On 9 February 2006, McAllion stood for the SSP in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, coming fifth of nine candidates with 1.6% of the vote.

He was elected to the SSP executive at its conference in March 2006. He was elected co-chair (along with Morag Balfour) at its conference in October 2007, but he stood down during his term of office for personal reasons. However, he has remained active in campaigning with the party, particularly in the run-up to the independence referendum.

<text>Pollok (, ) is a large housing estate on the south-western side of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. The estate was built either side of World War II to house families from the overcrowded inner city. Housing 30,000 at its peak, its population has since declined due to the replacement of substandard housing with lower-density accommodation. As of 2021, the population was recorded at 81,951 people.

The main features of the area are the nearby Pollok Country Park, where the Burrell Collection is now housed, the ruins of Crookston Castle (within the north part of residential Pollok) which Mary, Queen of Scots once visited, and the Silverburn Centre, one of Glasgow&#x27;s major indoor retail complexes.

==Location==
The country park and the White Cart Water which flows through it form the northern and eastern boundary of the district, with Corkerhill and Cardonald the closest northern suburbs. Recent developments in the late 20th and early 21st century have created an adjoining neighbourhood to the west of Pollok at Crookston, Glasgow, stretching from Rosshall to Roughmussel and including conversions of the original buildings of Leverndale Hospital, alongside its newer facilities. Haugh Hill Woodland partially provides a natural barrier between Pollok and Crookston.

The Levern Water, a tributary of the White Cart, flows through Pollok from the south-west where the Househillwood and Priesthill residential areas are situated, with the Brock Burn bordering them and meeting the Levern Water in the centre of Pollok. In some contexts these neighbourhoods are referred to as separate localities, and otherwise are considered parts of &#x27;Greater Pollok&#x27; (a ward of Glasgow City Council), along with Nitshill, South Nitshill, Parkhouse and Darnley further south which share the same G53 postcode; Househillwood is next to the district&#x27;s central amenities and bus terminus.

==History==

Previously farmland which was purchased by the city from the Stirling-Maxwell family in 1935, Pollok was built by the old Glasgow Corporation and was the first of the &#x27;big four&#x27; peripheral housing schemes constructed to improve Glasgow&#x27;s slum housing conditions in the inner city.
The building of &quot;Old Pollok&quot;, as the first sector retrospectively became known, commenced in the 1930s but was interrupted by World War II. The urgent need for housing after the war along with budgetary constraints meant that the original plan to build a &#x27;garden suburb&#x27; was abandoned in favour of higher density, lower quality housing. Unusually, one of the &#x27;new&#x27; churches in Pollok (St James&#x27;) was transplanted from Pollokshields, away.
Pollok suffered the same social problems that also emerged from the other large housing schemes (Castlemilk, Drumchapel and Easterhouse). The slum clearance programme disrupted the networks of the old communities and the extended family. There were few shops (a central shopping centre was not added for three decades), no pubs, cinemas or leisure facilities. Even schools, something which eventually were well provisioned, were not built until some years after the main wave of housing, with pupils being transported to facilitates elsewhere at considerable cost and disruption. People lived far away from their places of work and there were very few employment opportunities locally.

The post-war tenement buildings were of poor quality and suffered from damp, condensation and lack of soundproofing. Glasgow Corporation (later Glasgow District Council) could not maintain the buildings in the face of budgetary cuts imposed by central Government. Local manufacturing jobs were outsourced to overseas countries and unemployment rates grew to unprecedented levels. Those who were able to left the area, the remaining population enduring poverty, lack of opportunities, ill-health and lower life expectancy.

In recent years there has been a sustained effort to improve the area. Most of the post-war tenement housing has been demolished or refurbished, and new private housing has also been built among the individual houses, which lasted more successfully than the multi-floor blocks.

To the east of the residential area, Pollok House is a Georgian building constructed in 1752 with many fine paintings, and Pollok Country Park was chosen to house the &quot;Burrell Collection&quot; in a modern contemporary and clean air green space. It is the largest park in Glasgow.

==Education==

Pollok has one secondary school: St Paul&#x27;s High School, recognised as one of the &#x27;schools of ambition&#x27; in Scotland. It was built on the site of another former school, &quot;Craigbank Secondary&quot;, which had lain empty for some years, and replaced the area&#x27;s previous Catholic school, &quot;St Robert Bellarmine Secondary&quot; which was sited where the southern sector of Silverburn now stands. However, St Paul&#x27;s associated primary schools are in neighbourhoods to the south of Pollok proper, whereas the Pollok-based primaries are part of the &#x27;learning community&#x27; of Lourdes Secondary School in Cardonald.

The nondenominational Rosshall Academy (completed in 2002) serves a large catchment area including much of Pollok, but replaced &quot;Penilee Secondary&quot; and &quot;Crookston Castle Secondary&quot; so was built on a site between its predecessors which falls outwith Pollok across the White Cart. In 2009 the area lost a local primary school, Bonnyholm Primary, which was merged with other schools to create &quot;Crookston Castle Primary School&quot;. It was officially opened in August 2007 on the grounds of the former Crookston Castle Secondary, close to the castle.

The former Cardonald College, now a campus of the merged Glasgow Clyde College, is near to Pollok between Cardonald and Mosspark.

==Shopping==

Pollok is home to the Silverburn Centre which opened in October 2007, replacing the old Pollok Shopping Centre dating from the late 1970s which itself was previously tenement housing built in the late 1940s which survived barely 30 years before being torn down. The largest of its kind in Scotland, Silverburn has brought hundreds of jobs to the area. Key stores include a 24-hour Tesco Extra adjoining the centre. This was the largest store in Scotland when it opened in July 2006. Other anchor stores are M&amp;S, Debenhams and Next. Altogether, the centre houses 95 shopping units and 14 restaurants and cafés. A cinema complex with further restaurants was later added as an extension in 2015.

==Other amenities==

Next to the Silverburn Centre is the &quot;Pollok civic realm&quot;, renovated in 2009 containing an extended Health Centre and the Pollok Library and Swimming Pool. There is another sports centre, Nethercraigs, at the north-east of Pollok near Corkerhill.

==Transport==
Pollok is about from Glasgow International Airport, and from Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The area is accessible from Junctions 2 and 3 of the M77 motorway, and the main bus terminus is Silverburn bus station.

Pollok is served by four nearby railway stations which run to central Glasgow, although none in the district itself; these are and to the south on the Glasgow South Western Line, and and to the north on the Paisley Canal line.

<text>The Knights of the Golden Eagle (KGE) was an American fraternal organization founded in Baltimore, Maryland in 1872. At its height in the 1920s, the organization had 73,340 members in 26 states. It ceased operations in the late 1960s or early 1970s.

== History ==

Knights of the Golden Eagle was established in Baltimore, Maryland in 1872. The order&#x27;s original objectives were to help its members find employment and aid them while unemployed. Membership was open to white males over 18, without physical or mental handicaps, who were able to write and support themselves, were law-abiding, of sound moral character, and the Christian faith. There was a female auxiliary called the Ladies of the Golden Eagle.

In the early years of its existence, the group received assistance from other secret societies and fraternal groups. The Odd Fellows helped them become established in Philadelphia in 1875 and the Knights of Pythias helped them become established in Massachusetts in 1880.

== Organization ==
Local lodges were called &quot;Castles&quot;, statewide structures were called &quot;Grand Castles&quot;, and the overall group &quot;Supreme Castle&quot;. In the early 1920s, the Knights were headquartered at 814−816 North Broad Street, Philadelphia. The last known headquarters of the group was in North Wales, Pennsylvania.

== Membership ==
Membership was open to Christian white men over 18 who were of good moral character, sound mental and physical health, able to write and support themselves, and were law-abiding citizens. By the early 1920s, the group had 73,340 members in 26 states. Membership began to decline in the 1930s. In 1965, the group had 15,000 members, mostly concentrated in Pennsylvania. In the late 1970s, scholar Alvin J. Schmidt was unable to locate a current address for the group and determined that it was extinct.

== Ritual ==

The Knights&#x27; ritual worked three degrees, based on the history of the Crusades: the first degree accented the pilgrim and taught the candidate fidelity to God and man; the second degree used the medieval knight as its role model to teach the member to revere religion, fidelity, valor, charity, courtesy and hospitality; the third degree was based on the figure of the crusader and it &quot;equipped the member against the evil of his enemies.&quot; Members of the Ladies of the Golden Eagle took one degree, the Temple Degree, upon being initiated. Oaths were sworn on an open Bible.

== Eagle Home Association ==
This was the mutual benefit arm of the Knights, whose object was to protect aged members of the order, as well as their orphans and widows. It was supported by a per capita tax on such Castles as were enrolled in it.

== Notable members ==

* Leon Czolgosz, anarchist who assassinated United States President William McKinley
* Richard H. Koch, judge and railroad magnate
* John Buchanan Robinson, U.S. House of Representatives, Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and Pennsylvania State Senate

<text>Fanny Howe (born October 15, 1940, in Buffalo, New York) is an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. She was raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Howe has written more than 20 books of poetry and prose. Her major works include poetry such as &quot;One Crossed Out&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, and &quot;Second Childhood;&quot; the novels &quot;Nod&quot;, &quot;The Deep North&quot;, and &quot;Indivisible;&quot; and collected essays such as &quot;The Wedding Dress: Meditations on Word and Life&quot; and &quot;The Winter Sun: Notes on a Vocation&quot;. 

Howe has received praise and official recognition: she was awarded the 2009 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize by the Poetry Foundation. She also received the Gold Medal for Poetry from the Commonwealth Club of California. In addition, her &quot;Selected Poems&quot; received the 2001 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets for the most outstanding book of poetry published in 2000. She was a finalist for the 2015 International Booker Prize. She has also received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Poetry Foundation, the California Arts Council, and the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. She is professor emerita of Writing and Literature at the University of California, San Diego. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Early life, education and marriage ==
Howe was born in Buffalo, New York. Her father Mark De Wolfe Howe was then teaching at the state university law school. When her father Mark De Wolfe Howe left to join the fighting in World War II, her mother, Irish playwright Mary Manning, took Howe and her older sister Susan Howe to Cambridge, Massachusetts. (Their younger sister Helen was born after their father&#x27;s return from the war.) There the family lived through the children&#x27;s childhoods. 

Her father became a colonel and served in Sicily and North Africa. After the war he went to Potsdam as a legal adviser in the Allies&#x27; reorganization of Europe. Returning to peacetime, her father continued his work as a lawyer and became a professor at Harvard Law School.

Howe&#x27;s mother was an actress at the Abbey Theatre of Dublin for some time, before coming to the United States in 1935. She also wrote several plays to be performed there and at the Gate Theatre. Her maternal aunt was Helen Howe, a monologuist and novelist. Her sisters are Susan Howe, who also became a notable poet, and Helen Howe. 

Later recalling her early ambitions to be a poet, Fanny Howe attended Stanford University for three years. She was briefly attracted by the political activism, and communism. In 1961—the year she left Stanford—she married Frederick Delafield. They had no children and divorced two years later. 

As a civil rights activist in the 1970s, she met and married fellow activist Carl Senna. They also shared the literary world. Of African-American-Mexican descent, he is also a poet and was one of the youngest editors of a notable journal. 

They had three children in four years. Their middle child, Danzy Senna, became a novelist and essayist. She draws from her biracial family and her experience, exploring issues of race and class in the US. Howe and Senna separated when the children were young, and had a bitter divorce.

==Writing career==
Howe is one of the most widely read of American experimental poets. Her writing career began during the 1960s with two paperback original &quot;pulp&quot; novels, published under the pseudonym Della Field. Known as &quot;Nurse Novels&quot;, one book featured a nurse in the Vietnam War while the other was about a nurse living in San Francisco. 

These were not typical of her later works in poetry and prose. Some of her novels came close to her poetry in using experimental techniques and an abbreviated language. Howe had long studied the writings of Edith Stein and Simone Weil, and sometimes pursues questions similar to theirs. She converted to Catholicism at the age of 40.

As Zack Schlosberg writes in &quot;Cleveland Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Suffering and seeking are two major subjects of Howe&#x27;s fiction...&quot;, which he also found in her novel &quot;London-rose&quot;, written in the 1990s but not published until 2022.

Howe has continued to publish novels throughout her career, including &quot;Lives of the Spirit/Glasstown: Where Something Got Broken&quot; (2005). She has also continued to publish essays. Some of her essays have been collected, including &quot;The Wedding Dress: Meditations on Word and Life&quot; (2003)

Poet Michael Palmer says:
Fanny Howe employs a sometimes fierce, always passionate, spareness in her lifelong parsing of the exchange between matter and spirit. Her work displays as well a political urgency, that is to say, a profound concern for social justice and for the soundness and fate of the polis, the &quot;city on a hill&quot;. As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, &quot;The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty.&quot; Here&#x27;s the luminous and incontrovertible proof.

Joshua Glenn in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote:
Fanny Howe isn&#x27;t part of the local literary canon. But her seven novels about interracial love and utopian dreaming offer a rich social history of Boston in the 1960s and &#x27;70s.

Howe&#x27;s prose poems, &quot;Everything&#x27;s a Fake&quot; and &quot;Doubt&quot;, were selected by David Lehman for the anthology &quot;Great American Prose Poems: from Poe to the Present&quot; (2003). Her poem &quot;Catholic&quot; was selected by Lyn Hejinian for the 2004 volume of &quot;The Best American Poetry&quot;. 

Howe&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot; won the 2001 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize. &quot;On the Ground&quot; was on the international shortlist for the 2005 Griffin Poetry Prize. Howe received the 2009 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.

She was a judge for the 2015 Griffin Poetry Prize.

Howe has taught at Tufts University, Emerson College, Kenyon College, Columbia University, Yale University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Georgetown University.

<text>Neal Morse (born August 2, 1960) is an American singer, musician and composer based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1992, he formed the progressive rock band Spock&#x27;s Beard with his brother Alan and released an album which was moderately successful. In 1999, he joined Dream Theater&#x27;s co-founder and then drummer Mike Portnoy, together with Flower Kings&#x27; Roine Stolt and Marillion&#x27;s Pete Trewavas they formed the super-group Transatlantic. In 2002, Neal Morse became a born again Christian, left Spock&#x27;s Beard and began a Christian rock solo career, releasing many progressive rock concept albums about his new religious faith. In the meantime, he continued to play with Transatlantic and formed three new bands with Portnoy, Yellow Matter Custard, Flying Colors and The Neal Morse Band.

==Biography==

===Band career===
Morse grew up in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles as one of four children. His father was a choral director. Morse started to play the piano at the age of five and started to learn to play the guitar at the age of nine. During his twenties he wrote two musicals (&quot;Hit Man&quot; and &quot;Homeland&quot;), did some session jobs, tried to get a deal as a singer-songwriter in Los Angeles, and recorded a few country and western demos with his brother Richard.

After about ten years, having played in small Californian clubs with various groups including Burlesque, Morse founded Spock&#x27;s Beard together with his brother Alan, to give voice to his great passion for Progressive Rock. Their first album, &quot;The Light&quot; (1995), was moderately successful. Despite having released the first two Spock&#x27;s Beard albums to good critical acclaim, Morse found himself struggling economically. His brother Richard advised him to go to Germany to play hit songs as a one-man band in pubs, accompanying himself with piano or guitar, to generate income. Morse then began periodic travel between California and Germany, where from time to time he remained for several weeks to work as a pub musician. During his periods in California, Morse continued to alternate work on new compositions for Spock&#x27;s Beard, and live performance with them. At that time Morse was also part of the Eric Burdon band, touring with them, too. The popularity of Spock&#x27;s Beard&#x27;s continued to grow and they would soon become one of a number of successful progressive rock bands during the late nineties (along with Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, and The Flower Kings).

While with Spock&#x27;s Beard, Morse released two solo albums of more conventional straightforward rock music. In 1999, he joined former Dream Theater co-founder Mike Portnoy, Flower Kings&#x27; Roine Stolt and Marillion&#x27;s Pete Trewavas to form the supergroup Transatlantic. The band has released five studio albums (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Bridge Across Forever&quot;, &quot;The Whirlwind&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;The Absolute Universe&quot;) plus live albums from the tours behind each studio disc: &quot;Live in America&quot;, &quot;Live in Europe&quot;, &quot;Whirld Tour 2010: Live in London&quot;, &quot;More Never Is Enough&quot; and &quot;KaLIVEoscope&quot;. In concert, the group has included Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation, and occasionally Ted Leonard, Morse&#x27;s eventual replacement in Spock&#x27;s Beard.
In 2003, Morse, Mike Portnoy, Paul Gilbert and Matt Bissonette formed Yellow Matter Custard as a Beatles tribute supergroup. They took the name from a lyric in The Beatles song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;: &#x27;Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog&#x27;s eye...&#x27; On March 26, 2012, Morse released the first album of the newly formed band Flying Colors (Mike Portnoy on drums and vocals, Dave LaRue on bass, Neal Morse on keyboards and vocals, Casey McPherson on lead vocals, and guitar, and Steve Morse on lead guitar). In 2014, he gave life to another group, The Neal Morse Band (with Mike Portnoy, Randy George, Eric Gillette and Bill Hubauer), that released its first studio album &quot;The Grand Experiment&quot; in 2015. The group&#x27;s second outing, &quot;The Similitude of a Dream&quot;, was released on November 11, 2016, and the sequel to that album, &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, was released on January 25, 2019. Their fourth release, &quot;Innocence &amp; Danger&quot; was released on August 27, 2021.

In 2024, Morse announced a new progressive rock project, &quot;Neal Morse &amp; The Resonance&quot;, featuring local musicians from the Tennessee area. Their debut album, &quot;No Hill for a Climber&quot;, was released on November 8, 2024. 

In 2025, Morse announced a new project with legends Chester Thompson, Phil Keaggy, and Byron House. The band titled Cosmic Cathedral will release their first album April 25th 2025. 

=== Solo career ===
Morse became a born again Christian in 2002. He left both Spock&#x27;s Beard and Transatlantic immediately following the release of the Spock&#x27;s Beard album &quot;Snow&quot;, in response to a calling to make his personal faith more prominent in his recorded output. He felt this would not be possible or appropriate in a band context. The period leading to this decision is described on the solo album &quot;Testimony&quot; (2003), an epic, introspective composition which features Kerry Livgren of Kansas and Mike Portnoy. One part of his conversion to Christianity, omitted from &quot;Testimony&quot; but described in full on &quot;Testimony Live&quot; and later in the song &quot;Jayda&quot; on &quot;Testimony 2&quot;, was that his daughter Jayda had been diagnosed as having a hole in her heart that required open-heart surgery. However, before Jayda received surgery, the hole disappeared following a church service in which Morse&#x27;s wife and others prayed for God&#x27;s healing.

In 2004, Morse wrote and recorded a new concept album featuring Portnoy and Randy George (on bass guitar). Guitar virtuoso Phil Keaggy made a guest appearance on guitar and vocals. The album, titled &quot;One&quot;, is about man&#x27;s relationship with God from his Christian perspective and was released on November 2, 2004. In 2005, Morse released two non-prog Christian albums. In January, Morse recorded Lead Me Lord with the Christian Gospel Temple Choir, his children, and his friends. Morse wrote about half of the tracks. This was released in February and is available for a donation. In July, Morse released &quot;God Won&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, which was written around the &quot;Snow&quot; period. This is a pop album similar to &quot;It&#x27;s Not Too Late&quot;, but with Christian lyrics.
In the summer of 2005, a member of his church approached Morse to tell him that he should make an album based on the tabernacle and that he should keep it a secret. Morse nonetheless mentioned that he was working on a secret project before he had written a note or even committed himself to do the project. Mentioning it during a radio interview created enough buzz to convince him to make the album. There was a contest on his message board to guess the participants, theme, and meaning of the album based on a series of clues. The secret project was finally revealed to be &quot;?&quot; (also known as The Question Mark album, rumored to be influenced in title by The White Album) and is about the tabernacle in the wilderness and the tabernacle of the heart. The studio band is Neal, Mike Portnoy, and Randy George with guests Mark Leniger, Alan Morse, Roine Stolt, Steve Hackett, and Jordan Rudess.

In 2006, Morse issued &quot;Cover to Cover&quot;, a collection of cover versions by Mike Portnoy, Randy George and him, recorded during the production of &quot;?&quot;, &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Testimony&quot;, proving that despite the new focus of his solo career Morse wasn&#x27;t averse to tackling songs with non-religious themes. In early 2007, Morse released &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot;, a concept album detailing the life and struggles of the German theologian Martin Luther, and corruption within the medieval Church. Portnoy and George once again teamed with Morse and were joined by Paul Gilbert (of Racer X and Mr. Big) who contributed a few solo parts.

Immediately following &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot;, Morse released the acoustic folk album &quot;Songs from the Highway&quot;. The studio album &quot;Lifeline&quot; was released on September 30, 2008. Morse was once again joined by Portnoy and George, just four months after the release of the &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; live DVD. A live album, &quot;So Many Roads&quot;, recorded with his European band, was released on June 30, 2009. 
&quot;Testimony 2&quot;, a sequel and expansion of the autobiographical story from the first Testimony album, was released May 23, 2011. As had become Morse&#x27;s pattern, he followed that album with a tour and live DVD. Also in 2011, he released a book, &quot;Testimony&quot;, a continued autobiographical look at his life story and spiritual journey explored in more detail than in the associated Testimony albums.

Momentum was released on September 11, 2012, an album that, in structure, featured several shorter songs and one epic.

In recent years, Morse has recorded two more cover albums with George and Portnoy (&quot;Cover 2 Cover&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Cov3r to Cov3r&quot; in 2020), a guest-heavy prog rock musical retelling the life and Passion of Christ (&quot;Jesus Christ the Exorcist&quot;, released in 2019), a biographical album in the vein of &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; based on the conversion and writings of Paul the Apostle (&quot;Sola Gratia&quot;, released in 2020), and a two-part musical based on the story of Joseph from the Book of Genesis (&quot;The Dreamer&quot; and &quot;The Restoration&quot;, released in 2023 and 2024, respectively).

During his early solo years, Morse focused most of his touring in Europe and had a band made largely of European musicians. The incarnation that toured in Europe for Sola Scriptura, for example, included Collin Leijenaar (drums, music director), Paul Bielatowicz (guitars), Elisa Krijgsman (guitars), Wilco van Esschoten (bass guitar), Jessica Koomen (vocals, keyboards, percussion) and Henk Doest (keyboards). For Testimony 2, Morse reunited members from the band that toured the initial Testimony album, including Portnoy, George, Rick Altizer and others. He then held a contest to assemble a full-time band, which eventually toured behind Momentum. This new band consisted of Mike Portnoy (drums), Randy George (bass), Eric Gillette (guitars, keyboards) and Bill Hubauer (keyboards). Guitarist Adson Sodré was in the band until visa issues forced his departure.

===Guest appearances===

In 1997 he became a member of Eric Burdon&#x27;s I band. They also released the concert film &quot;Live at the Coachhouse&quot;. In 2000, Morse provided vocals for the song &quot;The First Man on Earth&quot; on &quot;The Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot;, one of Arjen Anthony Lucassen&#x27;s Ayreon albums. Neal Morse tracks have also appeared on the &quot;CPR Volume 1&quot; (2004), &quot;CPR Volume 2&quot;, and The Tsunami Projekt anthologies. Morse also participated in recording the ProgAID single &quot;All Around the World&quot;. The profits for both The Tsunami Projekt and the ProgAID single were donated for victims&#x27; relief from the 2004 Asian tsunami.

Morse has been a guest musician on several 2005 albums, including Ajalon&#x27;s &quot;Threshold of Eternity&quot;, Roine Stolt&#x27;s &quot;Wallstreet Voodoo&quot;, Salem Hill&#x27;s &quot;Mimi&#x27;s Magic Moment&quot;, and Mark Leniger&#x27;s &quot;Walk on Water&quot;. Morse was one of several musical guests to appear on Dream Theater&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;, on the song &quot;Repentance&quot;. These guests were recorded apologizing to important people in their lives for wrongdoings committed in the past. Morse provided vocals for the first track on Jordan Rudess&#x27; tribute album &quot;The Road Home&quot;.

In 2020, he joined Matt Smith of Theocracy in releasing &quot;And the Rest Is Mystery&quot; under the Project Aegis moniker.

==Radiant Records and Waterfall==
In 1998, Morse founded his own independent record label, Radiant Records. The label serves as an outlet for his work in a variety of capacities—including development, licensing, promotion and distribution.

In 2005, Morse created his fan club, the Inner Circle. The monthly membership provides an email newsletter and special releases to members every other month. Over the years, he has released many behind the scenes features, demo sessions, and bootlegs to the Inner Circle. See Inner Circle discography

In 2019, at the dissatisfaction of current streaming services and their treatment of artists, Morse created his own streaming service, Waterfall. Most of Morse&#x27;s and his collaborator&#x27;s discographies can be found exclusively on the platform.

==Morsefest==
In 2014, Morse created &quot;Morsefest&quot;, a weekend concert festival held at his local church, New Life Fellowship, in Cross Plains, TN. The name of the event was chosen by Mike Portnoy against Morse&#x27;s wishes, however the name stuck. The inaugural Morsefest occurred on November 14–15, 2014 and featured the &quot;Testimony&quot; and &quot;One&quot; albums played in their entirety with string, horn, percussion, and choir sections as well as a morning Inner Circle acoustic show. This two-day format with a large array of added musicians has continued annually featuring albums and musicians from all of Morse&#x27;s projects, The Neal Morse Band, Spock&#x27;s Beard, Flying Colors, and most recently in 2022, Transatlantic. 

In 2020 and 2021, Morsefest went on with &quot;Lockdown&quot; editions due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a limited live audience, and for the first time, a virtual streaming option.

In 2023, in addition to the show in Tennessee, Morse took &quot;Morsefest&quot; on the road to Europe for the first time to The Boerderij in Zoetermeer, Netherlands and again in 2024 to Trinity Church in Essex, United Kingdom. In celebration of its 20th anniversary, Morse and the NMB played Testimony along with Testimony 2 in their entirety.

<doc id="397335" wikidata="Q21892" url="?curid=397335" title="Democratic Party (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Democratic Party (DP) is a liberal political party in Hong Kong. Once the flagship party in the pro-democracy camp, it is expected to dissolve within 2025 after the party was unable to enter elections with national security threshold imposed.

The party was established in 1994 in a merger of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point in preparation for the 1995 Legislative Council election. The party won a landslide victory, received over 40 percent of the popular vote and became the largest party in the legislature in the final years of the British colonial era. It opposes the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and called for the end of one-party rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP); the party has long been seen as hostile to the Beijing authorities.

Led by Martin Lee, the Democratic Party boycotted the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) on the eve of the Hong Kong handover in 1997 in protest to Beijing&#x27;s decision to dismantle the agreed transition, but reemerged as the largest party in the first SAR Legislative Council election of 1998. Due to the Beijing-installed proportional representation voting system, the Democrats embattled in bitter factional conflicts in the early post-handover era. Although the party&#x27;s popularity briefly rebounded after the 2003 pro-democracy demonstration, its dominance was gradually eclipsed by the emergence of the new parties.

As a response to the electoral gains of the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats (LSD), the Democratic Party merged with Emily Lau&#x27;s The Frontier in 2008. The party made a surprising move by negotiating with the Beijing officials over the constitutional reform package in 2010. It resulted in a catastrophic split within the pro-democracy camp. Being ferociously attacked by the radical democrats, the party sharply lost support in the 2012 Legislative Council election, retaining only six seats. Afterwards, the Democrats underwent a rejuvenation process in which most veterans retired and made way for the new generation in the 2016 election.

Following the widespread anti-government movement in 2019, the party won a landslide victory in the local elections. After the imposition of the Hong Kong national security law in July 2020 and subsequent disqualifications of four pro-democracy camp legislators, all legislator of the party, along with the whole camp&#x27;s, resigned in protest. It left the party with no representation for the first time since 1998. In January 2021, the leading party seniors were arrested under the security law. The government introduced a requirement that all district councillors had to swear an oath of allegiance to Hong Kong and China, upon which many pro-democracy councillors, fearful of retroactive disqualification and bankruptcy threats, chose to resign from their office. The party did not run in any elections thereafter, which were limited to government-approved &quot;patriots&quot; only. Despite remaining a low profile in the later years, the party reportedly face pressure from Beijing and eventually choose to dissolve in 2025.

In February 2025, the party started preparations for dissolution as a motion for the party to dissolve was set and backed by the leadership of the party, and the central committee of the party set up a task force to look into procedures before dissolving itself.

==Party beliefs==

From the outset, the party supported the restoration of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. However, since the handover it has consistently stressed the &quot;two systems&quot; part of the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle. The party&#x27;s stance on Hong Kong&#x27;s future development differs from that of pro-Beijing parties. It believes Hong Kong must develop more democratic institutions and preserve freedoms and human rights to achieve prosperity.

The party proposed policies on various areas of governance through designated spokespersons, including:

*Amendment of the Basic Law to achieve more democracy and safeguard freedoms, while achieving closer economic co-operation with Mainland China.
*Protection of human rights.
*Maintain Hong Kong&#x27;s status as an international finance and trade centre and improve its economic infrastructure (concrete details not given), as well as a more flexible way to control public expenditure.
*Better monitoring of public services and utilities (i.e. more accountability), and strengthened measures to protect the environment.
*More resources for education, with less vague policies.
*Reasonable (i.e. larger) share of economic achievements by the employee for the employee, and increased involvement by the Government to protect labour laws in accordance with social needs.
*Adopt measures to regulate property prices from fluctuation, and provide adequate public housing
*Increase spending on social welfare.

The party&#x27;s position on social or cultural issues is not well-defined but verges on the moderate, partly due to some support from centrist and Catholic supporters. In a way that may seem contradictory to traditional liberal ideology, the party generally opposes the legalisation of commercial sex or gambling operations. Although there is no official stance on same-sex marriage, the Democratic Party generally support to legalise laws which would prohibit discrimination against the LGBT community, despite part of the conservative wing of the party against it.

In recent years with the emergence of the pro-Hong Kong independence tide, the Democratic Party has been criticised by pro-independence voices for its perceived pro-China position. However the party has also been accused for years by pro-Beijing media of being anti-China, as many of the party leaders including Szeto Wah, Martin Lee and Albert Ho are self-proclaimed patriots who oppose only the one-party rule of the Chinese Communist Party but not the country in general and support the Chinese democracy movement. The party has also stated that it does not support Hong Kong being separated from China.

==History==

===Founding===

The Democratic Party was founded with the merger of the two major pro-democracy parties at the time, the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) and the Meeting Point (MP). The Meeting Point was formed in 1983 by a group of liberal intellectuals and people from middle class in the background of the Sino-British negotiations on the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. The group favoured the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China but called for a &quot;free, democratic and autonomous Hong Kong government under Chinese sovereignty&quot;. Together with the Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL) and the Hong Kong Affairs Society (HKAS), they were the three major pro-democracy organisations actively participated in the local and municipal elections in the 1980s.

The like-minded liberals also formed the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government (JCPDG) and the Group of 190 to strive for the 1988 Legislative Council election and the faster democratisation the political structure towards 1997 and after 1997 during the drafting of the Hong Kong Basic Law, under the leadership of liberal drafters Martin Lee and Szeto Wah. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the liberals stood firmly with the student protestors, formed the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (HKASPDMC) and condemned the bloody suppression on 4 June.

In preparation for the first Legislative Council direct election in 1991, members of the three political groups and many liberal activists of the JCPDG joined together and formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong in April 1990. Chaired by the Martin Lee, the United Democrats of Hong Kong formed an alliance with Anthony Cheung Bing-leung&#x27;s Meeting Point in the campaign. The liberal alliance won a landslide victory in the direct election, receiving over 52% of the vote and winning 14 of the 16 geographical constituency seats in September. The popularity of the pro-democratic alliance was principally rose from its position towards the Tiananmen Square protests and the widespread fear towards the Beijing government afterwards.

The United Democrats stood a firm anti-Beijing stances, criticising the Tiananmen crackdown and also the democratic situation. As a result, Lee and Szeto were deprived their posts in the Basic Law Drafting Committee and were accused of &quot;treason&quot;. The United Democrats supported the last governor Chris Patten&#x27;s democratic reform proposal, which allowed a much extended electorate for the first fully elected Legislative Council election in 1995 and was ferociously opposed by Beijing.

The United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point further united by announcing the formation of the Democratic Party on 18 April 1994. They formally merged into the Democratic Party on 2 October 1994, in eve of the three-tier elections in 1994 and 1995. Martin Lee became the first Chairman of the party and Anthony Cheung and Yeung Sum became the Vice-Chairmen, elected on the first general meeting on the establishment day. The ADPL continued to keep its own identity, arguing that it represented grassroots&#x27; interest whereas the Democratic Party was more focused on the &quot;middle class&quot;.

The founding manifesto of the Democratic Party said it would seek to further unite democratic forces, strive for a high degree of autonomy and an open, democratic government, and would promote welfare and equality in Hong Kong. The party also tried to appropriate the discourse of nationalism as it stated &quot;We care for China and, as part of the Chinese citizenry, we have the rights and obligations to participate in and comment on the affairs of China.&quot; It also called for the condemnation of the 1989 Tiananmen Incident as well as an amendment of the Hong Kong Basic Law before 1997 to allow full election of the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

===Late colonial period (1994–1998)===
The electorate base of the 1995 LegCo election was largely extended by the Governor Chris Patten&#x27;s controversial electoral reform package supported by the pro-democrats. Facing the challenge from the newly formed business conservative Liberal Party and pro-Beijing loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), the Democratic Party was able to win handsome victories in the three-tier elections in 1994 and 1995. In the LegCo election in September 1995, the party secured 42% of the vote and 19 of the 60 total seats, emerging as the largest party in the Legislative Council, compared to Liberal Party&#x27;s 10 seats and DAB&#x27;s 6 seats. Together with the ADPL and other pro-democracy independents, the democratic coalition was able to garner one- or two-vote majorities on certain anti-government issues during the last term of the legislature.

The party&#x27;s stance conflicted with the PRC government&#x27;s, which, for a while, earned the party more popularity and recognition both locally and overseas. The party chairman Martin Lee became well-known internationally in the run-up to reunification as a human rights and democracy fighter, and won a number of international human rights awards.

After Patten&#x27;s reform package was passed, Beijing decided that the legislature elected in 1995 could not ride the &quot;through train&quot; beyond the handover of Hong Kong, as the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). Instead, Beijing set up a highly controlled Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) in December 1996. The Democratic Party refused to join the Selection Committee as it opposed to Beijing&#x27;s decision &quot;to scrap Hong Kong&#x27;s elected legislature and replace it with a hand-picked version.&quot; The party thus lost all 19 seats until the PLC was replaced by the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR in 1998.

At the midnight on 30 June just after the handover ceremony, the Democratic Party LegCo members protested against the abrupt termination of their tenure and call for the establishment of democratic government at the balcony of the Legislative Council Building, and vow to return to the legislature by means of election in 1998.

===Early divisions (1998–2002)===
Decided by the Provisional Legislative Council, the first-past-the-post voting system was replaced by the proportional representation system in the first LegCo election in 1998. The proportional representation gave an advantage to the weaker pro-Beijing DAB as it did not require a majority to win a seat. Thus in 1995 the Democratic Party won 12 seats in the geographical constituencies with 42.3% of the vote, but it got only 9 seat with 40.2% of the vote in 1998.

After the handover, the Right of Abode litigation was initiated immediately and reached its climax in the Court of Final Appeal&#x27;s (CFA) decisions favouring the right of abode seekers in &quot;Ng Ka Ling&quot; and &quot;Chan Kam Nga&quot; lawsuits in January 1999. The Democratic Party supported the right of abode seekers and opposed strongly to the government&#x27;s decision to refer the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) to interpret the Basic Law. Party chairman Martin Lee condemned this move as &quot;a dagger striking at the heart of the rule of law&quot; and in symbolic protest walked out of the Legislative Council with 18 other members, all dressed in black. However, the party appeared to suffer from popular discontent with the party&#x27;s position. The party was also criticised for failing to broaden its post-1997 agenda and develop a well-defined social base.

The party also appeared to suffer from the internal dissension. In December 1998, the &quot;Young Turks&quot; led by Andrew To staged a successful coup d&#x27;état in the party leadership election, which promptly brought the party into a phase of factional struggle. The Young Turks formed their own list of about ten candidates to run for the Central Committee and nominated Lau Chin-shek to run for vice-chairman against the former Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung. Some hoped to make Lau as their factional leader, to lead the party from the Meeting Point faction&#x27;s pro-middle class, pro-laissez-faire and pro-Beijing positions to a more pro-grassroots and confrontational position.
Although Lau was elected vice-chairman, he resigned after the election. Lau was subsequently forced to leave the party in June 2000 after a one-year membership freeze, due to Lau&#x27;s Democratic Party/Frontier dual membership.

In a general meeting in September 1999, the Young Turks also proposed to put the minimum wage legislation on the 2000 LegCo election platform of the party. The Mainstreamers which included the &quot;triumvirate&quot;, Yeung Sum, Cheung Man-kwong and Lee Wing-tat, saw the minimum wage debate was a challenge to the party authority and decide to fight back by joining hands with the Meeting Point faction to defeat the Young Turks. Andrew To wrote a newspaper article accusing the Mainstreamers of suppressing intra-party dissent, &quot;just like the butchers in the Tiananmen massacre.&quot; To&#x27;s comment led to a backlash of opinion within the party and led to the defeat of the minimum wage motion. The debate, largely took place in the mass media, publicised the factional rivalries and created a bad image within the party.

The popular discontent and internal fragmentation appeared to have marked a turning point in the prospects of the Democratic Party and the DAB. In the 1999 District Council elections, the DAB more than doubled its representation, while Democratic Party performed less well than anticipated, winning 86 seats. In the second LegCo election in the following year, Tsang Kin-shing and Steve Chan Kwok-leung left the party and ran as independents after failing to be nominated on the candidates list by the Central Committee. The election results showed the party&#x27;s share in the geographical constituencies dropped to 35%, and the party secured 9 out of the 24 directly elected seats. Its total number of seats in LegCo remained at 12.

In December 2002, Yeung Sum succeeded Martin Lee as Party chairman in the leadership change, legislator Albert Chan, belonging to the pro-grassroots relatively &quot;radical&quot; faction, left the party. By the end of 2002, more than 50 members of the party which had already formed a political group, Social Democratic Forum, defected to the Frontier, mostly Young Turks.

===Rebound in popularity (2002–2004)===
In 2002 and 2003 the party saw a rebound in popularity, largely due to the low popularity of the Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s administration, and more significantly the controversy over the Basic Law Article 23 legislation. The pro-democrats worried that the anti-subversion law would threaten the rights and freedom of the Hong Kong people and damaged the rule of law and &quot;One Country, Two Systems.&quot; The Article 23 legislation turned into a territory-wide debate and led to a re-awakening of civil society, mobilising different sectors to join the opposition movement. The Democratic Party used many of their 94 district offices for community-level mobilisation. In the weeks before the 1 July march, the Democratic Party managed to collect phone numbers of about 40,000 supporters. The party&#x27;s volunteers and staff called them one by one to call on them to join the demonstration. The demonstration resulted in a record-breaking number of people, more than 500,000 Hong Kong people joined the march. The SAR government had to back down and shelve the bill indefinitely.

In the following 2003 District Council elections in November, the pro-democracy camp turned the popular support into the demand of democratisation, universal suffrage of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council in 2007 and 2008, their primary goals for years. The Democratic Party received a great victory by claiming 95 seats out of the 120 candidates in the election.

The civil movement in 2003 also broadened the spectrum of the pro-democracy camp. A number of pro-democracy groups such as Article 45 Concern Group and individuals such as Leung Kwok-hung and Albert Cheng were elected in the 2004 LegCo election. Although the pan-democracy camp took 25 of 60 seats, the Democratic Party won only 9 seats, falling from the largest party in the Legislative Council to the third, behind DAB&#x27;s 13 (including the FTU members) and pro-business Liberal Party&#x27;s 10. Worried by pre-election surveys indicating that Martin Lee might be in danger, the Democratic Party sent out a last minute S.O.S. call to &quot;save Martin Lee&quot; who was listed second on the Democratic Party&#x27;s list behind chairman Yeung Sum in the Hong Kong Island constituency. As a result, Yeung&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s list absorbed too many votes at the expense of pro-democracy ally Cyd Ho losing by just 815 votes to DAB&#x27;s Choy So-yuk. It caused some dissatisfaction among some supporters of the party and the camp generally. Yeung Sum announced he would not seek for re-election as chairman after the election as a result and subsequently replaced by Lee Wing-tat in the party leadership election in December.

===Young Turks out and Frontier in (2004–2008)===
Although lack of breakthrough in the legislative elections, the pan-democracy maintains its basic position of seeking universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 for Chief Executive and Legislative Council respectively, even though the NPCSC&#x27;s interpretation of the Basic Law in April 2004 rejected the demand. After Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s resigned as Chief Executive in March 2005, Party chairman Lee Wing-tat attempted to run for the post against Donald Tsang but failed to get enough nominations in the Election Committee. Donald Tsang was elected uncontestedly in the Chief Executive election.

In October 2005, Donald Tsang&#x27;s administration issued a blueprint for the electoral reform. The proposal aimed to double to size of Election Committee to 1,600 and add 10 seats to the Legislative Council, half of which would be directly elected and the rest returned by District Councillors. The pro-democracy parties criticised the proposal as conservative as it did not move towards to universal suffrage. In December, the camp held a mass rally against the government&#x27;s reform package and demanded a timetable and road-map to democracy be attached to the proposal. The reform package was at last vetoed by the pan-democracy camp. In December 2006, 114 of the 137 pro-democracy candidates filled by the Democratic Party and the newly established Civic Party won the Election Committee subsector elections which secured the threshold of 100 nominations to enter the next Chief Executive election.

Since early 2005, 24 members had quit the party, including district councillor Stephen Fong Chun-bong (who was forced out by the party) and Lau Tak-cheung. Twelve district councillors also left the party. Another district councillor died in a car accident. The number of district councillors decreased by 13 to 79. In March 2006, the Mainstreamer faction alleged that some senior members were involved in spying activities of China. The &quot;suspects&quot; were all Young Turks Reformist members including vice-chairman Chan King-ming and Gary Fan. The Young Turk members were all ousted in the following leadership election in December, with Mainstreamer Albert Ho defeating Chan King-ming as the new party chairman.

The democrats suffered a humiliating defeat in the District Council elections in November 2007. The Democratic Party took the heaviest loss of 36 seats as compared with 2003. 23 of the party&#x27;s incumbent Councillors were ousted, with just over half of its candidates elected. The Democratic Party was by far outstripped by the Beijing loyalist DAB which won total of 115 seats, recapturing the loss in 2003 and also much expanding.

On 29 December 2007, the NPCSC unveiled a timetable for the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive in 2017 and for the entire Legislative Council by 2020 with a host of conditions. The NPCSC decision helped reducing the political pressure on Tsang while removing pan-democracy camp&#x27;s key rallying cry in the following LegCo election, although the pro-democratic parties were still calling for the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council in 2012.

In the 2008 LegCo election, the Democratic Party&#x27;s share of vote further dropped to 20.6%, winning only 8 seats. The emerging pro-democratic parties professionals-formed Civic Party and left-wing League of Social Democrats (LSD) took the share of 13.7% and 10.1% and won 5 and 3 seats respectively. Facing the emerging new parties, the two old political parties the Democratic Party and the Frontier merged. At the time, the Democratic Party had 636 members, 8 legislators and 57 District Council members, while the Frontier had one legislator, Emily Lau, three District Councillors and around 110 members. In the following month, Albert Ho was re-elected chairman, and Emily Lau became a Vice-Chairman of the new combined party in the party leadership election.

===2010 reform negotiations (2008–2012)===
In the following electoral reform for the 2012 Chief Executive and LegCo elections in 2009 and 2010, Donald Tsang proposed a reform package which had not much difference from the 2005 proposal. The pan-democracy camp were saying they were going to veto it again. The Civic Party and League of Social Democrats launched a &quot;de facto&quot; referendum by resigning and triggering territory-wide by-elections to let the voters voice out their demand on democracy. The Democratic Party refused to participate as it argued it was not an effective way. The party&#x27;s heavyweight veteran Szeto Wah said the Democratic Party would not join in the resignations itself, but would support pan-democrats who stood for re-election. In December 2009, the Democratic Party members voted 229 voted against, 54 in favour and one abstention not to join the resignation plan after a four-hour debate at a general meeting.

Instead in May 2010, the party leaders met with the officials of the Central Government&#x27;s Liaison Office in Hong Kong to negotiate on the reform package, which was the first meeting between Democratic Party leaders and senior officials from the central government since the Tiananmen massacre of 1989. The central government subsequently accepted the Democratic Party&#x27;s revised proposal in the run-up to the LegCo vote, which allowed the five new functional constituency members of LegCo to be elected by popular vote. However, the Democratic Party failed to get any promises on the 2017 Chief Executive and 2020 Legco elections. The Democratic Party&#x27;s move significantly divided the opinion within the pan-democracy camp but the bill was ultimately passed in June 2010 with the support of the Democratic Party. After the agreement with Beijing, 30 Young Turk Reformists (comprising 4% of the membership) left the party before the December Party leadership election, accusing their leaders of betraying the people and slowing the pace towards universal suffrage. LegCo member Andrew Cheng had also quit the party earlier at the LegCo voting in June.

The party&#x27;s refusal of participating the by-election and the agreement with Beijing heavily damaged the solidarity of the pan-democracy camp. The &quot;radical&quot; League of Social Democrats accused the Democratic Party for &quot;selling out&quot; Hong Kong people. During the annual 1 July march in 2010, the Democratic Party leaders were verbally attacked by other democratic protestors, who chanted &quot;Shame on you, Democratic Party, for selling out Hong Kong people.&quot; In the following District Council elections in November 2011, the newly formed People Power headed by Wong Yuk-man, who quit as the Chairman of the League of Social Democrats early the year, launched an anti-Democratic Party campaign and filled in candidates run against the Democratic Party members. The Democratic Party was able to retain 47 seats with an increase of the vote. The People Power failed to get any seat against the Democratic Party but one seat where there were no other democratic candidates.

In the Election Committee Subsector elections in December 2011, the pan-democracy camp was able to get more than 150 seats to secure the threshold of nominating a candidate in the 2012 Chief Executive election. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho won over Frederick Fung of ADPL in the pan-democracy primary election and stood for the camp in the election. The election was dominated by the two candidates from the pro-Beijing camp, Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying and marked by scandals, dirty tactics and smears from both sides. Albert Ho fell behind in the opinion poll throughout the campaign partly due to the impossibility of him being elected by the Beijing-controlled Election Committee. The pan-democracy camp called for casting blank votes on the election day. During the election 1,132 votes were cast, CY Leung received 689; Henry Tang received 285, and Albert Ho received 76.

In the LegCo election in the following September, the party successfully gained two of the five seats of the territory-wide based new District Council (Second) constituency which were created by its own proposal. However, the total seats of the party dropped from 8 to only 6 seats, the worst result in the party&#x27;s history. The party could only gain 13.7% of the popular vote, even less than Civic Party&#x27;s 14.1% and lost all its seats in the New Territories West. Chairman Albert Ho resigned after the election outcomes were announced; vice-chairwoman Emily Lau took over as acting chairman. Lau defeated Sin Chung-kai as the first chairwoman of the party in the December party leadership election. In December 2014, Emily Lau secured her chairwomanship against three challengers in the chairperson re-election, which was the most competitive leadership election in party&#x27;s history.

===Umbrella movement and aftermath (2012–2019)===
In March 2013, the Democrats formed the Alliance for True Democracy with other pan democratic parties for pressing the government to give out a genuinely democratic reform proposal. The party supported Benny Tai&#x27;s Occupy Central with Love and Peace proposal to launch a civil disobedience movement to further pressure the Beijing government. The party took a supporting role in the 2014 Hong Kong protests with many of its party figures arrested. In June 2015, the party voted against the government&#x27;s proposal.

In the 2015 District Council election, the Democrats won total number of 43 seats with several second-tier figures, including vice-chairman Lo Kin-hei and chief executive Lam Cheuk-ting, scored victories, while others like former chairman Albert Ho and vice-chairman Andrew Wan lost.

For the 2016 Legislative Council election, the party proposed an unprecedented pre-election primary to hold public debates before selecting candidates for each constituency. 14 nominations were received on 31 December 2015, in which three incumbents, chairperson Emily Lau and veterans Albert Ho and Sin Chung-kai did not seek for re-election to hasten the party&#x27;s rejuvenation. They chose to stand as second candidates behind young party colleagues, Lam Cheuk-ting, Andrew Wan and Hui Chi-fung respectively to boost the chances for them to get elected. Despite the decrease in their vote share, the Democrats gained seven seats, one more than the previous election, by retaking a seat in the New Territories West. Roy Kwong, a young progressive Democrat District Councillor also received most votes of nearly 500,000 in the District Council (Second) &quot;super seat&quot;. By taking seven seats, the Democrats retook the status of flagship pro-democracy party.

In the December leadership election, legislator Wu Chi-wai was elected new chairman uncontestedly. The Democrats supported former Financial Secretary John Tsang, making the first time a pro-democracy party to support an establishment candidate, after the pro-democrats decided not to field their candidate to boost the chance of an alternative candidate against incumbent Leung Chun-ying. The Democrats opposed former Chief Secretary for Administration Carrie Lam, the eventual winner of the election. However, the party has developed a warmer relationship with Carrie Lam government, evident in the attendance and donation of the Chief Executive to the party&#x27;s 2018 anniversary dinner.

The Democrats suffered a historic loss of headcount on 12 December 2018 when 59 members, including five District Councillors from New Territories East, resigned en masse, after a row over the 2019 District Council election, accusing Legislative Councillor Lam Cheuk-ting of despicable character, his lack of political ethics and conflict of interest.

The relations between the party and Carrie Lam turned sour as the administration was embattled numerous controversies including the raising of the age threshold for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and the dropping of Leung Chun-ying&#x27;s UGL case. Lam was not invited to the party&#x27;s 24th anniversary dinner in March 2019. The relations between Lam and the party completely fell out in May 2019 over the extradition law controversy in which the Democrats strongly opposed. Party chairman Wu Chi-wai even shouted at Lam &quot;Why don&#x27;t you die? You&#x27;re a waste of life, bitch!&quot; at a LegCo meeting after Lam dismissed the opposition views as &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;unnecessary fear&quot; and called the claims that it was a deliberate decision by the colonial government to exclude the mainland from any rendition arrangements in the 1990s as &quot;nonsense&quot;. On 29 May, Democrat Andrew Wan moved the first motion of no confidence against Lam since she took the office on the grounds that she &quot;blatantly lied&quot; about the extradition bill and misled the public and the international community. The motion was defeated by the pro-Beijing majority.

=== Anti-extradition protest and security law (2019–2023) ===
The Democratic Party quickly warned about the possibility that the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill could be used by China to have political dissidents extradited, and was supportive to the protestors, subsequently became the largest party in the 2019 local elections. Democratic party member Lam Cheuk-ting was injured in the 2019 Yuen Long attack. In August 2020, he was arrested on charges of rioting during that attack, and again in December 2020 for allegedly disclosing the personal information of individuals connected to it.

The Hong Kong national security law was imposed by the Chinese Government in 2020, criticised as silencing the dissidents. The Party faced political pressure from the government and pro-Beijing camp. All LegCo members from the Party resigned later that year. Some party seniors, including former chairman Wu Chi-wai, ex-MP Lam Cheuk-ting, Andrew Wan, were arrested in early 2021 and remanded for collusion. Lo Kin-hei, the chairperson, along with three ex-chairs, Albert Ho, Martin Lee, Yeung Sum, each faced various charges. Majority of the district councillors resigned in July 2021 after reports of possible disqualification for not upholding the Basic Law.

The Democratic Party did not field a candidate for the 2021 legislative election, the first time since handover of Hong Kong in 1997, after a two-week application period to nominate party members ended without a candidate stepping forward. Beijing loyalists had warned the Party not to &quot;boycott&quot; the election. Party divisions were exposed as Fred Li, former Democratic MP, Edith Leung, vice-chairlady, and So Yat-hang, member of the Central Committee, supported non-establishment candidate without party&#x27;s consent, of which the former two were expelled from the party.

Democrats re-elected Lo Kin-hei in December 2022 as chairman, days after Lo was acquitted of participating in an unlawful assembly close to the 2019 Polytechnic University siege.

The party did not run in the 2023 local elections after its members failed to obtain enough nominations required after an overhaul of election rules, while Fred Li was not re-appointed by the government as member of the quango Travel Industry Authority. This left the Democratic Party without any elected representatives nor public office positions starting from 2024, for the first time since its formation.

=== Dissolution (2024–2025) ===
Democratic Party had been low profile and considered to have lost their influence in the city as the government remained hawkish to safeguarding national security law. During the short consultation of the domestic national security law, also known as Article 23, the Democratic Party argued the wording of the bill was overly vague and the low threshold to incriminate others, which could create more &quot;chilling effect&quot; and harming the international reputation of Hong Kong. Their suggestions, along with the allied parties, were not accepted and the bill was fast-tracked in the Legislative Council in March 2024 for passage. In the ensuing months, the party met the press on several polices only, which effectively turned itself to a &quot;pressure group&quot;. In December, Lo was again re-elected party chair with an expanded central committee but leaving one of the vice-chairmanship vacant. The chair said the party would continue its work.

It was later reported that the a party member was approached by someone &quot;with Beijing official background&quot; in November or December, conveying the message that the Chinese government believed &quot;the historic mission of the party is over&quot;. That person said Beijing would not allow the party, which no longer has any intrinsic value, to run in the December Legislative Council election. Multiple colleagues in the party received similar information from the &quot;messenger&quot; which was interpreted as an attempt to clear all remaining opposition voices. Fred Li said the &quot;messenger&quot; suggested the party cannot survive until the election month.

Media reported that there were internal discussions on the future of the group, and inclined to closure with the possible legal and safety risks. The central committee, although with divisions, agreed to end the party after a meeting on 20 February 2025, just days after reports emerged over the possible closure. Lo Kin-hei declined to comment on whether they were pressurized, but stated that the decision was made after considering the political factors and the party was not in financial difficulties.

The dissolution came as a surprise amidst calm political atmosphere in the city, given that Democratic Party was one of the modest and patriotic party in the opposition camp. Pro-Beijing media and politicians waged attacks on the flagship party, saying the disbandment is self-inflicted and the only way ahead. Sing Tao Daily said the senior democrats did not apologise or take up responsibilities for the anti-extradition bill protests, which led to the decision by Beijing to bar the party from participating in elections.

In February 2025, the party started preparing for dissolution, with the central committee of the party setting up a task force to look into procedures before dissolving the political party itself. Lo stated that dissolving the Democratic Party would require support from 75% of the attending members of the general assembly.

==Organisation==
The Democratic Party is governed by a Central Committee, originally 30-member large but reduced to 10 in 2022, including one chairmanship and two vice-chairmanships elected by the party congress. All public office holders, including the members of the Legislative Council and District Councils, are eligible to vote in the party congress. The electoral method changed since 2014, the eligibility of members electing a delegate who holds one vote in the congress from 30 members each delegate to only 5 members. Candidate for the chairmanship also needs a majority to claim victory. A 14-member Executive Committee including the secretary and treasurer posts is elected by the Central Committee members.

==Factions and Ideology==
The Democratic Party is considered by different scholars a big tent, right-wing, centre or centre-left. It had around 400 members at the time of dissolution, down from 600 in 2002 and 700 in 2017.
* Mainstreamers – led by the &quot;triumvirate&quot;, Yeung Sum, Cheung Man-kwong and Lee Wing-tat and consisting of members including Albert Ho, Sin Chung-kai and In 1999, Lee asserted that the Democratic Party should strive to serve as representative of middle class interests, and take balance between parliamentary politics and street action. Yeung and Lee were the party chairmen from 2002 to 2004 and 2004 to 2006 respectively.
* Meeting Point – consisting of former members of the Meeting Point, including Lo Chi-kin, Andrew Fung and led by the former Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung. The Meeting Point faction prefers a more pro-middle class, pro-market and moderate agenda. It also stresses dialogue with Beijing and Hong Kong governments over struggle, and parliamentary politics over street action. Anthony Cheung quit the party in 2004 and was appointed to the Secretary for Transport and Housing by Leung Chun-ying in 2012; Andrew Fung quit the party in 2012 in an unpleasant manner and was appointed government&#x27;s information coordinator in 2013.
* Young Turks – consisting of the relatively radical, left-wing and pro-grassroots activists and local-level party members including Steve Chan Kwok-leung, Tsang Kin-shing, Andrew Cheng, Albert Chan and Eric Wong Chung-ki. Led by Andrew To, the Young Turks believed that the party should take struggle over dialogue and mass movements over parliamentary politics as the party&#x27;s strategy. They also suggested adopting more grassroots platform such as minimum wage. The Young Turks were more like a &quot;factional clique&quot; than an organised faction as they were a group of young politicians with poor discipline and only had some vague common ideas, without a clear leader, coherent ideologies or positions. The Young Turks attempted to challenge the party leadership by nominating Lau Chin-shek to run for vice-chairman against Anthony Cheung in the 1998 party leadership election. Lau was expelled from the party in 2000 and Andrew To, Tsang Kin-shing and Albert Chan left the party and subsequently formed the left-wing League of Social Democrats in 2006. 
* Reformists – as many original Young Turks left, a new Reformist group emerged as the main opposition faction against the Mainstreamers party leadership, which included Chan King-ming who contested for chairman in the 2004 election and 2006 election and Legislative Council member Andrew Cheng. New Territories East was the Reformists&#x27; stronghold; Chan King-ming was the Chairman of the New Territories East branch and Andrew Cheng was the legislator from the same constituency. The faction was involved in alleged spying activities of China which led to the intra-party investigation in 2006. Andrew Cheng and other Reformists quit after the party supported the controversial electoral reform package. Many of them became the backbone of the Neo Democrats formed in 2010.

<text>The Independent Order of Vikings is a Swedish-American fraternal organization promoting Swedish and culture and language. It was founded in Chicago the 1890s and has members throughout the United States. 

Authorities differ as to the order&#x27;s date of foundation. Alan Axelrod states that it was founded on June 2, 1890, in Chicago, while Alvin J. Schmidt states it was founded in 1896, at the same city.

== Benefits ==

The group provides insurance benefits, as well as organizing events celebrating Swedish traditions and culture. These activities have included languages classes on Scandinavian languages as well as song and dance programs for traditional Scandinavian music and dance. Lodges have also sponsored bowling and golfing events.

Its charitable activities have included participating in blood drives, visiting hospitalized and sick members and sponsoring scholarships. By 1923 it operated a home for aged members.

The group provides life insurance and other financial products to its members as well as conducting social activities celebrating Scandinavian culture. By 1923 it did business in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Nebraska.

== Membership ==

In 1923 the order was open to men of Swedish birth or descent and had 10,643 benefit members and 58 social members.

By the 1970s membership was open to Swedes, people of Swedish descent or a person married to the same. There were 10,500 members in the mid 1960s and 9,500 in 1978. There were 9,300 members in 1995.

== Organization ==

The order is organized on a two-level structure. Local chapters are called &quot;lodges&quot; and the national body is the &quot;grand lodge&quot; which meets biennially. There were 80 lodges in the mid-1960s and 63 in 1978. The head officer is called the grand chief. In 1979, the headquarters of the group were in Chicago, Illinois, though now it appears to be based in Springfield, Illinois.

In the early 1920s the order&#x27;s &quot;Grand Lodge&quot; was located at 80 W. Washington Street, Chicago and there were 58 subordinate lodges.

Edward Myrbeck, the founder of a Viking Club in Braintree, served as grand chief of the Independent Order of Vikings from 1963 to 1965. He was later knighted by Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden for &quot;cultivating&quot; relations between Sweden and the United States. Following Myrbeck&#x27;s death in July 1995, the Independent Order of Vikings held a service in honor of him.

<doc id="397340" wikidata="Q148886" url="?curid=397340" title="Bruno Schulz">
<text>Bruno Schulz (12 July 1892 – 19 November 1942) was a Polish Jewish writer, fine artist, literary critic and art teacher. He is regarded as one of the great Polish-language prose stylists of the 20th century. In 1938, he was awarded the Polish Academy of Literature&#x27;s prestigious Golden Laurel award. Several of Schulz&#x27;s works were lost in the Holocaust, including short stories from the early 1940s and his final, unfinished novel &quot;The Messiah&quot;. Schulz was shot and killed by a Gestapo officer in 1942 while walking back home toward Drohobycz Ghetto with a loaf of bread.

==Biography==
Schulz was born in Drohobych, Austrian Galicia, historically part of the Kingdom of Poland before the three partitions, and today part of Ukraine. After World War One, Drohobycz became part of the Lwów Voivodeship. Bruno Schulz was the son of cloth merchant Jakub Schulz and Henrietta née Kuhmerker. At a very early age, he developed an interest in the arts. He attended Władysław Jagiełło Middle School in Drohobych from 1902 to 1910, graduating with honours. Then he studied architecture at Lviv Polytechnic. His studies were interrupted by illness in 1911 but he resumed them in 1913 after two years of convalescence. In 1917 he briefly studied architecture in Vienna. At the end of World War I, when Schulz was 26, Drohobycz became part of the newly reborn Polish Second Republic. Schulz returned to Władysław Jagiełło Middle School, teaching crafts and drawing from 1924 to 1941. His employment kept him in his hometown, although he disliked the teaching, apparently maintaining his job only because it was his sole source of income. He also amused himself by telling his students stories during classes.

Schulz developed his extraordinary imagination in a swarm of identities and nationalities: he was a Jew who thought and wrote in Polish, was fluent in German, immersed in Jewish culture, yet unfamiliar with the Yiddish language. He drew inspiration from specific local and ethnic sources, looking inward and close to home rather than to the world at large. Avoiding travel, he preferred to remain in his provincial hometown, which over the course of his life belonged to or was fought over by successive states: the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1792–1919); the short-lived West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (1919); the Second Polish Republic (1919–1939); the Soviet Ukraine from the invasion of Poland in 1939; and, during Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany after the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. His writings avoided explicit mention of world events of the time period.

Schulz was discouraged by influential colleagues from publishing his first short stories. However, his aspirations were refreshed when several letters that he wrote to a friend, Debora Vogel, in which he gave highly original accounts of his solitary life and the details of the lives of his family and fellow citizens, were brought to the attention of the novelist Zofia Nałkowska. She encouraged Schulz to have them published as short fiction. They were published as &quot;The Cinnamon Shops&quot; (&quot;Sklepy Cynamonowe&quot;) in 1934. In English-speaking countries, it is most often referred to as &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot;, a title derived from one of its chapters. &quot;The Cinnamon Shops&quot; was followed three years later by &quot;Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass&quot;, (&quot;Sanatorium Pod Klepsydrą&quot;). The original publications were illustrated by Schulz; in later editions of his works, however, these illustrations were often left out or poorly reproduced. In 1936 he helped his fiancée, Józefina Szelińska, translate Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; into Polish. In 1938, he was awarded the Polish Academy of Literature&#x27;s prestigious Golden Laurel award.
In 1939, after the Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in World War II, Drohobych was occupied by the Soviet Union. At the time, Schulz was known to have been working on a novel called &quot;The Messiah&quot;, but no trace of the manuscript survived his death. When the Germans launched their Operation Barbarossa against the Soviets in 1941, they forced Schulz into the newly formed Drohobycz Ghetto along with thousands of other dispossessed Jews, most of whom perished at the Belzec extermination camp before the end of 1942. A Nazi Gestapo officer, Felix Landau, however, admired Schulz&#x27;s artwork and extended him protection in exchange for painting a mural in his Drohobych residence. Shortly after completing the work in 1942, Schulz was walking home through the &quot;Aryan quarter&quot; with a loaf of bread, when another Gestapo officer, Karl Günther, shot him with a small pistol, killing him. This murder was in revenge for Landau&#x27;s having murdered Günther&#x27;s own &quot;personal Jew,&quot; a dentist named Löw. Subsequently, Schulz&#x27;s mural was painted over and forgotten – only to be rediscovered in 2001.

==Writings==
Schulz&#x27;s body of written work is small: &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot;, &quot;Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass&quot; and a few other compositions that the author did not add to the first edition of his short story collection. A collection of Schulz&#x27;s letters was published in Polish in 1975, entitled &quot;The Book of Letters&quot;, as well as a number of critical essays that Schulz wrote for various newspapers. Several of Schulz&#x27;s works have been lost, including short stories from the early 1940s that the author had sent to be published in magazines, and his final, unfinished novel, &quot;The Messiah&quot;.

From May 2024, the only surviving literary manuscript by Bruno Schulz (short story &quot;Second Autumn&quot; (Polish: &quot;Druga jesień&quot;) is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

==English translations==
&quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot; and &quot;Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass&quot; were featured in Penguin&#x27;s series &quot;Writers from the Other Europe&quot; from the 1970s. Philip Roth was the general editor, and the series included authors such as Danilo Kiš, Tadeusz Borowski, Jiří Weil, and Milan Kundera.

An edition of Schulz&#x27;s stories was published in 1957, leading to French, German, and later English translations. The first English translations were &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot;, New York: Walker and Company, 1963 (translation by Celina Wieniewska of &quot;Sklepy Cynamonowe (Cinnamon Shops)&quot;) and &quot;Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass&quot; New York: Penguin, 1979, (translation by Celina Wieniewska of &quot;Sanatorium Pod Klepsydrą&quot;, with an introduction by John Updike) . The two were later combined into one collection, published as &quot;The Complete Fiction of Bruno Schulz&quot;. New York: Walker and Company, 1989 

Madeline G. Levine translated Schulz&#x27;s fiction as &quot;Collected Stories&quot; for Northwestern University Press (2018), which won the Found in Translation Award in 2019.

In 2020, Sublunary Editions published Frank Garrett&#x27;s translation of &quot;Undula&quot;, an early story by Schulz which appeared in &quot;Dawn: The Journal of Petroleum Officials in Boryslav&quot; under the pseudonym Marceli Weron.

Stanley Bill&#x27;s translation of 13 of Schulz&#x27;s stories (including &quot;Undula&quot;) was published under the title &quot;Nocturnal Apparitions: Essential Stories&quot; in 2022.

==Adaptations==
Schulz&#x27;s work has provided the basis for three films. Wojciech Has&#x27; &quot;The Hour-Glass Sanatorium&quot; (1973) draws from a dozen of his stories and recreates the dreamlike quality of his writings. A 21-minute stop-motion animated 1986 film, &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot;, by the Quay Brothers, was inspired by Schulz&#x27;s writing, as was their 2024 feature &quot;Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass&quot; which combines stop-motion animation and live action. 

In 1992, an experimental theatre piece based on &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot; was conceived and directed by Simon McBurney and produced by Theatre de Complicite in collaboration with the National Theatre in London. A highly complex interweaving of image, movement, text, puppetry, object manipulation, naturalistic and stylised performance underscored by music from Alfred Schnittke, Vladimir Martynov drew on Schulz&#x27;s stories, his letters and biography. It received six Olivier Award nominations (1992) after its initial run and was revived four times in London in the years that followed influencing a whole generation of British theatre makers. It subsequently played to audiences and festivals all over the world such as Quebec (Prix du Festival 1994), Moscow, Munich (teatre der Welt 1994), Vilnius and many other countries. It was last revived in 1998 when it played in New York (Lincoln Center Festival) and other cities in the United States, Tokyo and Australia before returning the London to play an 8-week sell out season at the Queens Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. It has been published by Methuen, a UK publishing house, in a collection of plays by Complicite.

In 2006, as part of a site-specific series in a historic Minneapolis office building, Skewed Visions created the multimedia performance/installation &quot;The Hidden Room&quot;. Combining aspects of Schulz&#x27;s life with his writings and drawings, the piece depicted the complex stories of his life through movement, imagery and highly stylized manipulation of objects and puppets.

In 2007, physical theatre company Double Edge Theatre premiered a piece called &quot;Republic of Dreams&quot;, based on the life and works of Bruno Schulz. In 2008, a play based on &quot;Cinnamon Shops&quot;, directed by Frank Soehnle and performed by the Puppet Theater from Białystok, was performed at the Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków. A performance based on the writings and art of Bruno Schulz, called &quot;From A Dream to A Dream&quot;, was created collaboratively by Hand2Mouth Theatre (Portland, Oregon) and Teatr Stacja Szamocin (Szamocin, Poland) under the direction of Luba Zarembinska between 2006–2008. The production premiered in Portland in 2008.

==Literary references and biography==
Cynthia Ozick&#x27;s 1987 novel, &quot;The Messiah of Stockholm&quot;, makes reference to Schulz&#x27;s work. The story is of a Swedish man who&#x27;s convinced that he is the son of Schulz, and comes into possession of what he believes to be a manuscript of Schulz&#x27;s final project, &quot;The Messiah&quot;. Schulz&#x27;s character appears again in Israeli novelist David Grossman&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;See Under: Love.&quot; In a chapter entitled &quot;Bruno,&quot; the narrator imagines Schulz embarking on a phantasmagoric sea voyage rather than remaining in Drohobych to be killed. That entire novel has been described by Grossman as a tribute to Schulz.

In the last chapter of Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Distant Star&quot;, the narrator, Arturo B, reads from a book titled &quot;The Complete Works of Bruno Schulz&quot; in a bar while waiting to confirm the identity of a Nazi-like character, Carlos Wieder, for a detective. When Wieder appears in the bar, the words of Schulz&#x27;s stories &#x27;...had taken on a monstrous character that was almost intolerable&#x27; for Arturo B.

Polish writer and critic Jerzy Ficowski spent sixty years researching and uncovering the writings and drawings of Schulz. His study, &quot;Regions of the Great Heresy&quot;, was published in an English translation in 2003, containing two additional chapters to the Polish edition; one on Schulz&#x27;s lost work, &quot;Messiah&quot;, the other on the rediscovery of Schulz&#x27;s murals.

China Miéville&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;The City &amp; the City&quot; begins with an epigraph from John Curran Davis&#x27;s translation of Schulz&#x27;s &quot;The Cinnamon Shops&quot;: &quot;Deep inside the town there open up, so to speak, double streets, doppelgänger streets, mendacious and delusive streets&quot;. In addition to directly alluding to the dual nature of the cities in Miéville&#x27;s novel, the epigraph also hints at the political implications of the book, since Schulz himself was murdered for appearing in the &quot;wrong&quot; quarter of the city.

In 2010 Jonathan Safran Foer &quot;wrote&quot; his &quot;Tree of Codes&quot; by cutting into the pages of an English language edition of Schulz&#x27; &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot; thus creating a new text. In 2011, the Austrian Rock and Roll Band &quot;Nebenjob&quot; published the song &quot;Wer erschoss Bruno Schulz?&quot; (&quot;who shot Bruno Schulz?&quot;), a homage on the poet and accusation of the murderer, written by T.G. Huemer (see &#x27;references&#x27; below). Schulz and &quot;The Street of Crocodiles&quot; are mentioned several times in 2005 novel &quot;The History of Love&quot; by Nicole Krauss, with a version of Schulz (having survived the Holocaust) playing a supporting role.

==Mural controversy==
In February 2001, Benjamin Geissler, a German documentary filmmaker, discovered the mural that Schulz had created for Landau. Polish conservation workers, who had begun the meticulous task of restoration, informed Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s official Holocaust remembrance authority, of the findings. In May of that year representatives of Yad Vashem went to Drohobych to examine the mural. They removed five fragments of it and transported them to Jerusalem.

International controversy ensued. Yad Vashem said that parts of the mural were legally purchased, but the owner of the property said that no such agreement was made, and Yad Vashem did not obtain permission from the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture despite legal requirements. The fragments left in place by Yad Vashem have since been restored and, after touring Polish museums, are now part of the collection at the Bruno Schulz Museum in Drohobych.

This gesture by Yad Vashem instigated public outrage in Poland and Ukraine, where Schulz is a beloved figure.

The issue reached a settlement in 2008 when Israel recognized the works as &quot;the property and cultural wealth&quot; of Ukraine, and Ukraine&#x27;s Drohobychyna Museum agreed to let Yad Vashem keep them as a long-term loan. In February 2009, Yad Vashem opened its display of the murals to the public.

<doc id="397342" wikidata="Q717407" url="?curid=397342" title="Gayageum">
<text>The gayageum or kayagum () is a traditional Korean musical instrument. It is a plucked zither with 12 strings, though some more recent variants have 18, 21 or 25 strings. It is probably the best known traditional Korean musical instrument. 
It is based on the Chinese &quot;guzheng&quot; and is similar to the Japanese &quot;koto&quot;, Mongolian &quot;yatga&quot;, Vietnamese &quot;đàn tranh&quot;, Sundanese &quot;kacapi&quot; and Kazakh &quot;jetigen&quot;.

== History ==

=== Pungryu gayageum (beopgeum, jeongak gayageum) ===
According to the &quot;Samguksagi&quot; (1146), a history of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, the &quot;gayageum&quot; was developed around the sixth century in the Gaya confederacy by King Gasil (also known as Haji of Daegaya) after he observed an old Chinese instrument Guzheng. He ordered a musician named Wu Ruk to compose music that could be played on the instrument. The original name was &quot;gayago&quot;(or &quot;gayatgo&quot;) and later&quot; gayageum&quot;. The &quot;gayageum&quot; was then further improved by Wu Ruk during the reign of Jinheung in the Shilla dynasty.
The ancient &quot;gayageum&quot; of King Gasil was called by several names, including &quot;beopgeum&quot; (law-zither, 법금), &quot;pungnyu&quot; (elegance, 풍류), or &quot;jeong-ak&quot; (right music, 정악) &quot;gayageum&quot;. It is normally associated with accompaniment for court music, chamber music, and lyric songs. This type of &quot;gayageum&quot; has a wider spacing between the strings and plays slower-tempo music such as &quot;Yeongsan hoesang&quot; and &quot;Mit-doduri&quot;.

=== Sanjo gayageum ===
The &quot;sanjo gayageum&quot; is believed to have evolved in the 19th century with the emergence of &quot;sanjo&quot; music, which in Korean literally means &quot;scattered melodies&quot;, a musical form that involves fast tempos and some improvisation. The &quot;sanjo gayageum&quot; version of the instrument has closer string spacing and a shorter length to let musicians play the faster passages required for &quot;sanjo&quot;. The &quot;sanjo gayageum&quot; is now the most widespread form of &quot;gayageum&quot;. All traditional &quot;gayageum&quot; use silk strings, though since the late 20th century, some musicians use nylon.

=== Modern gayageum ===
Modern versions of the &quot;gayageum&quot; with more strings often use nylon-wrapped steel strings, similar to those used for the Chinese &quot;guzheng&quot;. Brass strings have also been introduced to produce a louder sound, which is preferred for accompanying dance. To play modern music, &quot;gayageum&quot; with a greater number of strings have been developed, increasing the instrument&#x27;s range. &quot;Gayageum&quot; are available with 13, 17, 18, 21, 22, or 25 strings, though instruments with more strings are available custom-made. The 21-string gayageum is normally found in North Korea.

==Playing method==

The gayageum is traditionally played when sitting on the floor with crossed legs, the head of the instrument resting on the right knee and the tail resting on the floor. When played whilst seated on a chair or stool, the tail end is usually placed on a special fold-out stand, similar to a camp-stool, or another chair/stool. For modern &quot;gayageum&quot;, they may be placed on a special stand with the player seated on a chair behind the instrument. The people of North Korea usually play whilst seated on a chair, but they do not use a stand of the tail end. Instead, the &quot;gayageum&quot; has detachable legs that are fixed into the end to raise the tail high enough.

The &quot;gayageum&quot; is played with both right and left hands. The right hand plucks and flicks the strings close to the bridge of the gayageum, whilst the left hand pushes the strings on the left side of the bridges to raise the pitch and adds vibrato and other ornamentation.

=== Techniques and notation ===

==== Right Hand Fingering Notation and Techniques ====
These notations are placed above the staff in contemporary sheet music. If not explicitly stated, the strings are typically struck using the index finger. 
==Tunings and modes==

The &quot;gayageum &quot;can be tuned to a variety of pitches depending on use, though no standard exists as to what exact pitches they should be tuned. They include:
* E♭, F, A♭, B♭, E♭, F, A♭, B♭, c, e♭, f, a♭
* E♭, F, A♭, B♭, E♭, E♭, A♭, B♭, d♭, e♭, f, a♭
* E♭, A♭, B♭, E♭, F, A♭, B♭, c, e♭, f, a♭, b♭
* G, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, C, D, E, G, A, c, d

When noted in staff notation, however, the pitch series is usually transposed as the following, regardless of the actual pitches tuned on the strings:
* D, G, A, D, E, G, A, B, d, e, g, a
This is to avoid switching between the bass and treble clefs to make reading the music easier.

Traditionally, three modes are used:
*羽調 (우조): G key
*平調 (평조): C key
*界面調 (계면조): B♭ key

==Construction==
The &quot;beobgeum gayageum&quot; is 160 cm long by 30 cm wide by 10 cm deep. Its body is made of a single piece of paulownia wood. The resonator chamber is hollowed out of the piece of paulownia.

The &quot;sanjo gayageum&quot; is about 142 cm long by 23 cm wide by 10 cm deep. The soundboard is made of paulownia, but the sides and back are of a harder wood such as chestnut or walnut.

On the soundboard, &quot;anjok&quot; (movable bridges) support the strings. These bridges move to adjust the tuning and intonation. The strings enter the top of the body from &quot;tolgwae&quot; (string pegs) beneath. At the other end, the strings wind around loops at the end of thick cords, which pass over the nut then looped through holes at the bottom of the instrument and secured, and then the cords are all tied in a decorative coil.

The left hand presses the strings to raise the pitch, and finger movements perform various movements such as shaking, bending, and vibrating the strings. The right hand plucks or strums the strings. The &quot;gayageum&#x27;s&quot; tone is soft, delicate, and subtle. Legend says the instrument was first made by King Gasil in the Kaya Kingdom around the sixth century, and was further developed by a musician named Ureuk () in the time of King of Jinhung in the Silla dynasty.

According to some evidence, however, it dates to a much earlier time than the Silla dynasty. Recent archaeological excavations in the Kwangsan areas in Jeolla-namdo Province revealed fragments of a &quot;gayageum&quot; from around the first century BCE.

The &quot;gayageum&quot; is employed in different types of music, leading to variations of the instrument, including the following:
*&quot;Pungryu gayageum&quot; is the original form, with more widely spaced strings for slower-tempo works.
*&quot;Sanjo gayageum&quot; is a smaller, modern version with more closely spaced strings to accommodate rapid playing.
*Modern &quot;gayageum&quot; instruments broaden the body and add more strings to increase the pitch range to accommodate contemporary music.

== Music ==

=== Sanjo and folk ===
The six or more schools of the &quot;gayageum sanjo&quot; include Seong Geum Yeon, Kim Juk Pa, Kim Yoon Deok, Kang Tae Hong, Kim Byeong Ho, and Choi Ok Sam schools.

=== Contemporary ===
Contemporary music composers have been creating modern music for the &quot;gayageum&quot;. Hwang Byung Ki composed &quot;Forest&quot; as a first modern &quot;gayageum&quot; piece, Sungcheon Lee created 21-string &quot;gayageum&quot; and new pieces. Beomhoon Park composed the &quot;gayageum&quot; concerto &quot;New Sanjo&quot; (새산조) for 25-string &quot;gayageum&quot;, and following generation&#x27;s composers and western musicians have been composing modern music for it.

<text>William John Hamilton (5 July 1805 – 27 June 1867) was a British geologist who served as a Conservative Member of Parliament.

== Early life ==
Hamilton was born in Wishaw, Lanarkshire on 5 July 1805. He was the eldest son of William Richard Hamilton, FRS, and the former Julia Udny. His younger brothers were Alexander Edmund Hamilton (who drowned in India in 1827), Capt. Henry George Hamilton of the Royal Navy (father of Adm. Sir Frederick Hamilton), Charles Anthony Hamilton (who worked in the Privy Council office), Arthur Richard Hamilton, and Gen. Frederick William Hamilton.

His paternal grandfather was Anthony Hamilton, the Archdeacon of Colchester. His maternal grandparents were John Udny, British Counsul at Venice and Leghorn, and Selina Shore Clevland (a daughter of John Clevland MP). His uncle, Lt.-Col. John Robert Fullerton Udny inherited Udny Castle in Aberdeen from his uncle, Robert Udny, the prominent merchant and art collector.

He was educated at Charterhouse School and the University of Göttingen.

== Career ==
He became a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1831. In 1835 he made a geological tour of the Levant with Hugh Edwin Strickland, continuing on his own through Armenia and across Asia Minor. This journey was described in &quot;Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus, and Armenia&quot; (1842). Hamilton was the first known person to have successfully climbed Mount Erciyes.

He was a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Newport, Isle of Wight, from 1841 to 1847.

Hamilton was president of the Royal Geographical Society for 1848–1849 and of the Geological Society between 1854 and 1866. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1855. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

He made excursions in France and Belgium and wrote on the rocks and minerals of Tuscany, the agate quarries of Oberstein, and on the geology of the Mayence basin and the Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) district.

== Personal life ==
On 26 April 1832, Hamilton married Martin Trotter, a daughter of John Trotter. Before her death in March 1833, they had a son:

* Robert William Hamilton (1833–1883), who married Charlotte Maria Palmer, a daughter of Lt.-Col. George Palmer.

On 26 July 1838, he married the Hon. Margaret Frances Florence Dillon, a daughter of Henry Augustus Dillon-Lee, 13th Viscount Dillon, and Henrietta Browne (sister to Dominick Browne, 1st Baron Oranmore and Browne). They had six children:

* Margaret Wilhelmina Hamilton (d. 1915), who married Louis Eric Ames, son Henry Ames of Linden.
* Florence Selina Hamilton (d. 1904), who married Sir Thomas Villiers Lister, son of Thomas Henry Lister, in 1877.
* Victoria Henrietta Hamilton (d. 1917), who married of James Graham Goodenough (parents of Adm. Sir William Edmund Goodenough).
* Alexander Charles Hamilton (1840–1920), who successfully claimed the title of 10th Lord Belhaven and Stenton.
* Constantine Henry Hamilton (1843–1885), a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Artillery who died unmarried.
* Archibald William Hamilton (1847–1886), who married Elizabeth Ann Billyard, daughter of W. Billyard, in 1869.

Hamilton died in London in 1867, his wife survived him.

<doc id="397351" wikidata="Q4438364" url="?curid=397351" title="Battle of Lost River">
<text>The Battle of Lost River in November 1872 was the first battle in the Modoc War in the northwestern United States. The skirmish, which was fought near the Lost River along the California–Oregon border, was the result of an attempt by the U.S. 1st Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army to force a band of the Modoc tribe to relocate back to the Klamath Reservation, which they had left in objection of its conditions. 

In the subsequent war, Captain Jack of the Modoc and 53 warriors held off more than 1000 U.S. soldiers for 7 months in the area of the present-day Lava Beds National Monument. Part of this was named Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold in his honor.

==Description==
In the 1860s, the Modoc had been removed from their traditional home near the Lost River in California to the newly established Klamath Reservation in Oregon. The more numerous Klamath were traditional enemies, and the peoples had conflicts on the reservation. 

In 1872, Kintpuash (Captain Jack) led his band of about 100 Modoc back to their traditional home on Lost River. White settlers had moved into the area during their absence and complained to the government about the returning Modoc, asking that the Indians be forced back to the reservation. On November 27, Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent T. B. Odeneal requested Major John Green, commanding officer at Fort Klamath, to furnish sufficient troops to compel Captain Jack to return to the reservation. On November 28, Captain James Jackson, commanding 40 troops, left Fort Klamath for Captain Jack&#x27;s camp. Reinforced by citizens from Linkville (now Klamath Falls, Oregon), the troops reached Jack&#x27;s camp on the Lost River about a mile above Emigrant Crossing (now Stone Bridge, Oregon) on November 29.

Wishing to avoid conflict, Captain Jack agreed to go to the reservation. The situation became tense when Captain Jackson demanded he and his warriors disarm. Captain Jack had never fought the army, and was alarmed at this command, but finally agreed to put down his weapons.

The rest of the Modoc were following his lead, when warrior Scarfaced Charley and an unidentified army sergeant reportedly got into a verbal argument, pulled their revolvers, and shot at each other, both missing. The Modoc scrambled to regain their weapons, and fought a short battle before fleeing toward the border with California. After driving the Modoc from camp, Captain Jackson ordered his troops to retreat to await reinforcements. The casualties in this short battle included one U.S. soldier killed and seven wounded, and two Modoc killed and three wounded.

On their way to the Lava Beds south of Tule Lake, a small band of Modoc under the leadership of Hooker Jim killed 18 settlers on the afternoon of November 29 and morning of November 30. This attack added to calls for the US Army troops to be reinforced and the Modoc suppressed.

<doc id="397353" wikidata="Q303015" url="?curid=397353" title="Fălticeni">
<text>Fălticeni (; &quot;; ;&quot; ) is a town in Suceava County, northeastern Romania. It is situated in the historical region of Western Moldavia. According to the 2021 census, Fălticeni is the third largest urban settlement in the county. It was declared a municipality in 1995, along with two other cities in Suceava County: Rădăuți and Câmpulung Moldovenesc.

Fălticeni covers an area of , of which 25% are orchards and lakes, and it administers two villages: Șoldănești and Țarna Mare. It was the capital of former Baia County (1929–1950). The town is known for the high number of Romanian writers, artists, and scientists who were born, lived, studied, or have created here.

== Geography ==
Fălticeni is located in the southern part of Suceava County, away from Suceava, the county seat. The European route E85 crosses the city. Fălticeni is connected to the Romanian national railway system, through Dolhasca train station (24 km away). The city of Roman is to the south, on the E85 road.

== Administration and local politics ==

=== Town council ===
The town&#x27;s current local council has the following political composition, according to the results of the 2020 Romanian local elections:

==History==
The earliest written mention of the village &quot;Folticeni&quot; is from March 1490, and the second from March 1554, when Moldavian Prince Alexandru Lăpuşneanu awarded the estate and the village bearing the aforesaid name to Moldovița Monastery.

Fălticeni was first mentioned as an urban settlement in August 1780 as Târgul Șoldănești (&quot;Șoldănești Market&quot;), after the name of a local boyar&#x27;s estate, in a document issued by the chancellery of Prince Constantin Moruzi. In March 1826, an edict issued by Prince Ioan Sturdza changed the name of the town to Fălticeni.

Fălticeni was bombed by the Bolsheviks during World War I.

Before World War I, Fălticeni was the capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom’s Suceava County. After the Union of Bukovina with Romania and an administrative reform from 1925, Fălticeni became the capital of Baia County, remaining as such until 1950. Since the revival of counties in 1968, the city has been part of Suceava County.

In 1921 the Faltishan (Yiddish for Fălticeni) Hasidic dynasty was founded in Fălticeni, by Rabbi Eluzar Twersky, a scion of the Skver Hasidic sect, and part of the prestigious royal Hasidic Twersky family. Today they are Jewish communities in Brooklyn, New York carrying on the name Faltishan, led by Rabbi Twersky&#x27;s descendants.

== Demographics ==
Fălticeni reached its peak population in 1992, when almost 33,000 people were living within the city limits. As of 2016, the town of Fălticeni was the third largest urban settlement in Suceava County, after the county capital, Suceava, and the town of Rădăuți.

According to the 2011 census data, 24,619 inhabitants lived in Fălticeni, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, when the city had a population of 29,787 inhabitants. In 2011, of the city total population, 98.15% were ethnic Romanians, 0.76% Roma, 0.75% Russians (including Lipovans), 0.07% Hungarians, 0.04% Germans (namely, Regat Germans), 0.02% Ukrainians, and 0.01% Poles.

At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 23,902; of those, 85.26% were Romanians and 1.51% Roma.

==Culture==

There are four museums in Fălticeni. &quot;Ion Irimescu&quot; Art Museum (&quot;Muzeul de Artă &quot;Ion Irimescu&quot;&quot;) houses the largest collection of works of art by a single artist, Ion Irimescu, one of Romania&#x27;s greatest sculptors and sketchers, as well as a member of the Romanian Academy. The museum building is a historic monument, dating from the middle of the 19th century and had various destinations until 1974, when it was given to the art museum. In 1974 Ion Irimescu took the initiative to establish the museum, at first as a department of the Town Museum and made some donations. Later the value of the collection grew, currently being the richest author collection, and in 1991 an independent museum emerged. It comprises the most representative works by the sculptor Ion Irimescu: 313 sculptures and 1000 drawings: portraits, compositions, monument project carried out in the rondebosse or alterorelief technique, in gypsum, wood, terracotta, marble, bronze works of graphics especially donated to the museum by the author. The museum also includes the artist&#x27;s personal library (1500 volumes).

&quot;Mihai Băcescu&quot; Water Museum (&quot;Muzeul Apelor &quot;Mihai Băcescu&quot;&quot;) was founded in 1982 by the Romanian zoologist Mihai Băcescu, who was also a member of the Romanian Academy. This museum of natural sciences represents the enhancement and the development of the first museum established in Fălticeni, in 1914, by the professor Vasile Ciurea.

Fălticeni is the hometown of the Lovinescu family, which gave Romania four of its most distinguished men of letters of the 20th century: literary critic Eugen Lovinescu, playwright Horia Lovinescu, esoterist Vasile Lovinescu and novelist Anton Holban. The Lovinescu family contributed to founding a memorial museum in Fălticeni, House of Notable People (&quot;Galeria Oamenilor de Seamă&quot;). The museum was opened in 1972 and represents a synthesis of the city&#x27;s cultural and intellectual life.

Classics of Romanian literature, such as Ion Creangă, Mihail Sadoveanu, Vasile Alecsandri, or Nicolae Labiș, at some point in their life linked their name with that of the city by both studying and living in Fălticeni. &quot;Mihail Sadoveanu&quot; Memorial House (&quot;Casa memorială &quot;Mihail Sadoveanu&quot;&quot;) is a museum founded in 1987 in Fălticeni, in the house where Mihail Sadoveanu lived and created between 1909 and 1918.

<doc id="397360" wikidata="Q934918" url="?curid=397360" title="Dalton Gang">
<text>The Dalton Gang was a group of outlaws in the American Old West during 1890–1892. It was also known as The Dalton Brothers because four of its members were brothers. The gang specialized in bank and train robberies. During an attempted double bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1892, two of the brothers and two other gang members were killed; Emmett Dalton survived, was captured, and later pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, although he later asserted that he never fired a shot during the robbery. He was paroled after serving 14 years in prison.

Brothers Bob, &quot;Grat&quot;, and Emmett had first worked as lawmen for the federal court at Fort Smith, Arkansas and then for the Osage Nation. They started stealing horses to make more money, and then fled the area. They decided to form a gang and started robbing trains and banks. While their older brother &quot;Bill&quot; Dalton never joined any heists, he served as their spy and informant.

Due to the sensationalism that surrounded the Dalton Gang&#x27;s exploits, they were accused of robberies all over the country but operated chiefly in California, Kansas, Oklahoma Territory, and Indian Territory. Numerous myths were published about the gang. After Bob and Grat were killed at Coffeyville, Bill Dalton formed another gang with Bill Doolin, known as the Wild Bunch or the Dalton-Doolin Gang.

== Beginnings ==
James Lewis Dalton from Jackson County, Missouri and Kentucky was the father of all four boys. He was a saloon keeper in Kansas City, Missouri when he married Adeline Lee Younger. Through her half-brother, Adeline was an aunt of Cole and Jim Younger, of the famous James-Younger Gang. The Daltons may have been inspired by their famous cousins&#x27; exploits— the Youngers were much older and imprisoned at the time of the Dalton Gang&#x27;s activities.

The Dalton children were:
* Charles Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Dalton (1852–1936)
* Henry Coleman &quot;Cole&quot; Dalton (1853–1920)
* Littleton &quot;Lit&quot; Lee Dalton (1857–1942)
* Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Dalton (1859–1887)
* Gratton Hanley &quot;Grat&quot; Dalton (1861–1892)
* Mason Frakes &quot;Bill&quot; Dalton (1863–1894)
* Eva May Dalton (1867–1939)
* Robert Rennick &quot;Bob&quot; Dalton (1869–1892)
* Emmett Dalton (1871–1937)
* Leona Randolph Dalton (1875–1964)
* Nancy May Dalton (1876–1901)
* Simon Noel &quot;Si&quot; Dalton (1878–1928)

The brothers who were members of the Dalton Gang were Bob, Grat, Emmett, and Bill.

==Lawmen==

On November 27, 1887, Frank Dalton and another deputy marshal, Jim Cole, went across the river from Fort Smith to arrest three whiskey bootleggers. As they approached the camp the bootleggers began to fire on them. Frank shot and killed two, but his gun jammed and he was killed by the remaining bootlegger. His deputy abandoned him after being wounded. Frank is buried in Coffeyville, Kansas.

After Frank&#x27;s death, Grat moved back from California and took over his brother&#x27;s job as deputy marshal at Fort Smith. He also brought Bob along as a posse member. In August 1888, the two formed a posse to arrest a man named Charley Montgomery. Montgomery was alleged to be posing as a deputy marshal. Bob discovered his location in Timber Hills while Grat was away searching in Coffeyville and went ahead to lead the posse in making the arrest himself before Montgomery could escape the territory. The stakeout ended in Montgomery’s death. 

In January 1889, Grat and Bob both became deputies first under Marshal Jones and later under Marshal R.L. Walker in Wichita. Looking to earn more money, Bob also became part of the Osage Nation police force in addition to his job as a deputy. Unlike the marshals office, the Osage Police paid a monthly salary. Bob also hired Emmett under him to guard prisoners. 

==Outlaws==
===Alila Robbery===
On the night of February 6, 1891, two masked men carrying 44-calibre revolvers held up a Southern Pacific Railroad passenger train near the town of Alila (present day Earlimart, California). The outlaws had worn masks during the Alila robbery, concealing their identities. Some years later, Lit Dalton asserted that Bob and Emmett had told him many times that they had robbed the train.

Bob and Emmett were hiding out in a ranch barn a mile west of Malaga, and after arriving the brothers talked until morning. Lit noticed that Grat&#x27;s horse was indeed limp and agreed to help Grat sell it. Since the horse was lame, they could only get $60 for it and Grat was unable to find another horse afterwards. Grat shipped his saddle and riding rig to Delano and took the train to Traver where he met Bob and Emmett. They played poker all night in Traver and then traveled to Tulare to do the same. They had been following the Southern Pacific pay car as it made its way down the valley from Oakland to Bakersfield to pay railroad employees. This train was always accompanied by a crowd of gamblers and prostitutes, and Grat and Bob had &quot;followed the pay car&quot; together several times before.

===Pursuit across the Southwest===
In the two weeks following the robbery, Bob and Emmett hid out in the mountains near Bill&#x27;s ranch. Bill left his brothers supplies and food and obtained horses to evade pursuit. 

Despite these efforts, Bill was arrested in Paso Robles by Sheriff Kay and taken to Visalia. After a hearing, Bill was held for trial for the Alila robbery, but he secured bondsmen and was released.

Sheriff Kay decided to pursue Bob and Emmett with his deputy, Jim Ford.

Kay tracked the Daltons to their mother&#x27;s home, and kept watch of the house for a few days before being forced to return to Kingfisher because of bad weather. When he returned the next day to watch the house, he discovered that Bob and Emmett had escaped. Kay talked to their mother for several hours and she even invited him in for breakfast. She denied any wrongdoing by her sons, stating that they were in fact lawmen, and told Kay they had gone to Guthrie if he wanted to talk with them.

Kay and Ford traveled the fifty miles to Guthrie, but soon came into problems when dealing with different tribal jurisdictions. At Guthrie, Kay and Ford noticed that there had been some sort of celebration the night before as they were greeted by three white men hanging from a large tree at the entrance to town and noticed the streets were lined with several groups of black men playing Craps on the sidewalks. Kay found out that, before they had arrived, Bob and Emmett had got into a fight at one of the saloons there and badly beat up two cowboys before leaving for Topeka.

Sheriff Kay was forced to give up the chase in order to return to California for Grat&#x27;s trial. The Daltons had plenty of friends in the area willing to hide them and easily lost Kay once they were in familiar territory. After they realized they were no longer being pursued, Bob and Emmett began to form what would be known as the Dalton Gang.

===Grat&#x27;s trial===
For the four months that Bob and Emmett spent trying to lose Sheriff Kay in the desert, Grat sat in the Tulare County jail in Visalia awaiting his trial. After securing bondsmen, Bill immediately went to Merced and hired John W. Beckenridge, the best attorney in the San Joaquin Valley, to defend Grat. What Bill did not know is that Beckenridge was also a consulting attorney for the Southern Pacific railroad. To help pay him the two thousand dollars he asked for, Bill sold almost all of his horses and mules. Their mother also came to California from Kingfisher to pay Beckenridge after she mortgaged her home and borrowed money from neighbors. She then traveled to Visalia with her two daughters, as well as her sons Ben, Cole, Lit and Bill, for Grat&#x27;s trial.

Grat&#x27;s trial did not start until that June and it lasted three weeks. Though much of the evidence showed that Grat was in Fresno the night of the Alila robbery, including the testimony of several witnesses, the influence of the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad caused him to receive an unfair trial. Beckenridge showed up to the trial late and drunk, and neither the defense, nor the prosecution mentioned that the fireman had been accidentally killed by the expressman. This was unknown to Grat, since the Dalton brothers had all assumed that Emmett had killed the fireman. Almost all of Beckenridge&#x27;s witnesses were bar keepers, gamblers, saloon hanger-ons, or pimps. Sheriff Kay even pointed out during the trial that Beckenridge had overlooked Grat&#x27;s rights. Southern Pacific detective Will Smith visited Grat&#x27;s cell almost every day during the trial trying to get a confession out of him and Grat began to despise Smith.

Kay knew that, besides Beckenridge&#x27;s sabotage of the case, Grat would probably be found innocent and their case against Bob and Emmett would fall through.
Towards the end of the trial, Sheriff Kay, Detective Smith, and District Attorney Power talked to Grat while taking him back to his cell from the court room when Beckenridge was not present. Kay told Grat that he knew neither Bob or Emmett killed the fireman. He offered to admit this in court if Grat and Bill told the true story of the robbery. Detective Smith decided to chime in, but Grat said he would not say a word while Smith was present. Smith was told to leave and both Bill and Grat agreed to tell their story, but only if they showed that there was no first degree murder in the robbery. The Daltons told their stories, but neither Kay or Beckenridge ever cleared up the murder point and ruined Grat&#x27;s case.

===Ceres robbery===
Grat was taken back to jail to await his sentence. While in jail, a train robbery occurred near Ceres, on September 3, 1891, but was unsuccessful with no money being taken. The only evidence found at the robbery was a coat made from a tailor from Visalia. Kay suspected that this was probably the work of some suspects he had from Visalia, but the railroad detectives demanded the arrest of the remaining Dalton brothers. Kay telegraphed his deputy George Witty and told him to check on Bill Dalton and to immediately notify him when he was found. Kay checked on his Visalia suspects, who at the time were running a livery stable in Modesto, and was convinced they were not involved with the Ceres robbery. He then went to Fresno to check on Lit and Cole Dalton, and was convinced of the same.

When Kay returned to Visalia, he immediately went with detective Smith to the tailor of the coat found at the Ceres robbery. The tailor remembered the coat, but he could not remember who had bought it, only that some girl had picked it up once it was clean. After Kay finished talking to the cleaner, Deputy George Witty reported to him that telegrams from the coast said Bill was not in Paso Robles or Estrella. Neither was he in Merced or Livingston. Witty did have a clue from another deputy that two strange men had been seen hanging around after dark on the open plain near Traver and at the abandoned Overland Stage station at Cross Creek. Kay suspected that Bob and Emmett might be back in California to free Grat from jail, and took Deputy Witty with him to the Cross Creek station in his buggy.

Late in the afternoon, Kay and Witty were about four hundred yards from the station when they saw two men crouching as they crossed the road from the old stage barn to the station. Kay&#x27;s buggy was directly facing the setting sun, so they could not tell who the men were. The road curved behind some willow trees, and Kay told Witty to drive past the house, passing close to the door, and then to drive back. With his revolver in hand, Kay dropped to the ground as they passed the door and slowly entered the station. Maggie Rucker, the woman who once ran the Cross Creek Overland station, was sitting with another girl alone in the front room, silently making dresses. Kay asked Rucker if there was anyone else around and she replied that there was not. Right as she said this, Kay heard someone rush across the floor of an adjoining room and through the crack in the door he could see a man taking position at the window.

Kay moved quietly across the floor and pushed the door a little farther open with his revolver. Standing with his back towards him was Bill Dalton, watching the horses and buggy Kay had just left, while nervously working the lever of his winchester. Kay nudged the door open with his elbow, aimed his revolver at Bill and said, &quot;Bill! Hello!&quot;. Bill, thrown off his guard, quickly turned around and mimicked the greeting, &quot;Kay! Hello!&quot;. He then threw the butt of his winchester to the ground and the two nervously laughed at each other. Kay had Bill put his rifle down, backed him into the front room, and checked him for any other weapons. When they came back into the front room both Maggie Rucker and the girl remained quiet as they both expected Kay to have been killed.

Deputy Witty entered shortly after, and was told by Kay to go in the room and grab Bill&#x27;s rifle. As Witty entered the room, he heard a noise come from somewhere inside. Thinking it might be Bob, Kay demanded that Bill tell him where he was. Bill told Kay that Bob was not in the country, that he had stopped at Rucker&#x27;s place alone to spend the night. Kay knew this was untrue as he had seen two men cross the road. He soon discovered a worn place in the carpet and found a trap door hidden underneath. He had Bill lift the carpet and open the trap door and, instead of Bob, they discovered a man named Riley Dean, a saloon hanger-on from Visalia and Traver. It became apparent to Kay that Bill had been busy hiding Dean when he arrived, otherwise they would have heard him come in. Kay decided to place both men under arrest and took them to Visalia.

After Bill and Riley Dean were brought to the Visalia jail, Sheriff Pervis of Stanislaus County, S.P. detective Will Smith, and Wells Fargo detectives Hume and Thacker arrived to bring the two men to Modesto to stand trial for the Ceres robbery. When Bill and Dean were acquitted, Bill was rearrested by Kay after his bondsmen were convinced to withdraw by detective Hume. He was then taken back to Visalia to await his trial for the Alila robbery.

Bill was interviewed by the Fresno &quot;Expositor&quot; in September 1891 saying, &quot;The truth is I am like Paddy Miles&#x27; boy --- no matter what goes wrong or what depredation is committed, Bill Dalton is always charged with the same.&quot;

===Formation of the gang===
Bob and Emmett, meanwhile, had been busy in Oklahoma forming their gang. After their unsuccessful career in California, they decided they could do much better in their home country, and unlike their first attempts, they began carefully planning their robberies. As a former lawman, Bob knew the difficulty officers had enforcing laws in Indian and Oklahoma Territories. While the Indian Nations had their own tribal law enforcement, these agencies had no jurisdiction over non-Indians. The newly formed Oklahoma Territory had organized their own sheriff and city police departments, but there was so far very little cooperation between them. The only agency with jurisdiction over the whole territory was the U.S. Marshals Service, but it was quickly becoming fragmented due to power struggles between newly formed district courts and jealousy between marshals over their different jurisdictions. There was also little incentive among Deputy Marshals to search for potentially dangerous outlaws, their only pay being for fees and a set amount for each criminal they arrested. Unless there was a high enough reward being offered, they would instead choose to focus their attention on petty criminals. 

With Bob as the leader, the boys recruited mostly men who had grown up with them in Oklahoma. First recruited were George &quot;Bitter Creek&quot; Newcomb and &quot;Blackfaced&quot; Charlie Bryant, who had received his nickname because of a gunpowder burn on one cheek. Even though Sheriff Kay had given up his pursuit of the boys, they still had a $3000 bounty on their heads posted by Wells Fargo and the Southern Pacific Railroad, encouraging lawmen in the area to pick up where Kay had left off. Leading the pursuit was Bob&#x27;s old friend, Deputy Marshal Heck Thomas, whose renown skills as a deputy kept the gang constantly on the move and in hiding. Angered by the charges against Grat and Bill which he knew to be false, Bob decided that the best way to help his brothers would be to acquire enough money to pay for their bail and defense. This resulted in the first robbery at Whorton, May 1891, where the gang stole $1200.

Joining afterwards were Bill Doolin, Dick Broadwell, Bill Powers, and Charley Pierce. The gang was also assisted by Bob&#x27;s lover Eugenia Moore, known by her aliases &quot;Tom King&quot; and &quot;Miss Mundays&quot;, who acted as their informant, but was also a notorious horse thief and outlaw.

When not preying on the railroads, the gang spent their time digging out large rooms into the steep hills in the cedar brakes on the Northern Canadian River. This was on the property of a man named Jim Riley, about eight miles from the present-day town of Taloga, Oklahoma. The deep canyons of the area, covered with dwarf cedar and blackjack oaks, made it an ideal hiding place. Riley would feed the outlaws, and would do the same for any passing officers, but he would never reveal each other&#x27;s whereabouts to either parties.

In August 1891, Charlie Bryant was spotted in Hennessey, Oklahoma, after leaving the gang&#x27;s hideout to visit his brother in Mulhall. The locals who identified him notified a deputy marshal named Ed Short. He arrested Bryant and took him on a train to be committed to the jail at Wichita, Kansas, without notifying Marshal Grimes at Fort Smith. Ignoring the advice of the people in Hennessy, he also took the prisoner without a guard. After the train left Hennessey, and was approaching the stop at Waukomis, Oklahoma, Short noticed a group of mounted men who looked as if they were trying to beat the train, and feared it was the Dalton Gang coming to free Bryant. Short took the prisoner back and placed him in the baggage car. He then put the baggage man in charge of Bryant and gave him his revolver. Short then went to the rear platform with his rifle. The baggageman carelessly stuck the revolver into a pigeon-hole messagebox and went to work at the other end of the car. Without making any noise, Bryant went to the messagebox and secured the revolver. He then ordered the baggageman to ignore him and to go back to his work. Bryant opened the door to the rear platform, and, while Short had his attention on the mounted men, shot him in the back point blank. Short then turned and the two shot each other to death.

The second train robbery by the Dalton Gang in Oklahoma was at a small station called Lelietta on September 15, 1891, about four miles north of Wagoner, Oklahoma. Here, they secured more than $19,000. Many members of the gang, including Emmett, complained that the $3500 each was not enough to meet their needs. Bill Doolin complained that Bob was not dividing the money fairly, and accused Bob of squandering their money on women and gamblers. Doolin quit the gang, along with Newcomb and Pierce, due to the mismanagement of finances.

===Grat&#x27;s escape===
On September 21, Grat Dalton was brought into court to face sentencing, but this was instead postponed to October 6. This was a date that Grat had no intention on making. Rumors had circulated for months that Bob had planned to come and liberate Grat, so two of sheriff Kay&#x27;s deputies, Jim Wagy and Bob Hockett, had been hired by Wells Fargo to guard Grat&#x27;s cell until he was sentenced and sent to San Quentin. This was in addition to the jailer, J.M. Williams. One night, Jim Wagy heard a noise in the basement and upon investigation discovered that someone had tried to break the lock to the grated window. He decided to watch the outside of the place at night to see if he could catch in the act whoever was trying to open the grating. Wagy hid all night in a yard across the street but saw nothing. Instead he caught a cold from sitting in the fog all night. The next morning, Grat called Wagy over to his cell and asked him where he got such a cold. Wagy told him that he must&#x27;ve slept in a draft, to which Grat replied, &quot;Yes, it must have been pretty cold in the yard over there last night.&quot; Grat could not see the yard Wagy had laid in from his cell and the deputy had not told anyone what he had done that night. Expecting there to be an escape, and because none of the other deputies would listen to him, Wagy decided to quit.

On the night of September 27, Grat and two cellmates, Arvil Beck and W.B. Smith, escaped from the Tulare County jail in Visalia while Sheriff Kay was in San Francisco. At first, it looked to Kay as if it had been an inside job as it was obvious Grat had simply unlocked the cell door with a key and broke through the basement window to get out. They did however find pieces of a file and a hack saw blade in the prisoner&#x27;s toilet. Bill had been in a separate cell from Grat, located upstairs. When approached by Kay, Bill told him, &quot;The boys were there when I went to sleep, and when I awakened they had unlocked and gone. Why in the world do you suppose they went away and left me behind?&quot;

Jim Wagy also showed up after the break out to overlook the scene. By that time, Bill had been moved downstairs into what was Grat&#x27;s cell. When Jim approached Bill said, &quot;Jim, the birds have flown.&quot; When they entered the cell, Bill took out his guitar, sat on a soap box, leaned against the bars of the corridor and began to play a popular song he put his own words to and titled, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Miss My Brother Till He&#x27;s Gone&quot;. While Bill was playing his guitar, Wagy noticed that he was trying to cover up where the break had been made. One of the bars had been cut out and replaced with a broom handle blackened by soot. Wagy said, &quot;Here is your hole&quot;, and kicked the broom handle onto the floor. Bill immediately threw his guitar on the bed and exclaimed, &quot;Now what in the world do you know about that? How did they ever cut that bar out without my knowing it?&quot;

Most officers believed that Grat immediately escaped the county, but Sheriff Kay thought otherwise. After spending a few weeks tracking and arresting Arvil Beck and W.B. Smith, Sheriff Kay learned from them that Grat had actually made the opening in the bars several days before the robbery after being slipped a saw from someone on the outside. The sawing was hid from the jailer by a large box that they would put a blanket over and use to play cards. The cellmates would sing and talk to drown out the sound of the saw. Each time they stopped sawing, they plugged the hole with soap and soot. After making the opening, they ran around the corridors, kitchen, and basement for several nights. This is why Grat was able to notice Deputy Wagy hiding in a yard across the street from the jail. The last night they dug a hole in the brickwall of the wood room, but found heavy iron bars embedded in the wall that they could not get in between. They used the bar they had cut out to pry open the grating in the wood room window and, instead of risking going and putting it back, left the broom handle in its place.

After the escape, Beck separated from the others and went north, while Grat and Smith went to a friend of Grat&#x27;s named Joe Middleton, who lived in Hanford. Grat and Middleton told Smith they planned to hide out in the Coast Range and invited him to come with them. Smith instead went north and several weeks later was arrested by Kay. Threatened with prison time, Smith told Kay that Middleton could be followed to Dalton&#x27;s camp when he carried him supplies.

After having a deputy watch Middleton&#x27;s place, he learned that Middleton was buying enough groceries to last three months and was seen driving east of Sanger. When Middleton returned, Kay arrested him at his home and threatened to send him to San Quentin if he did not give up Grat&#x27;s hideout. Middleton had been threatened by Dalton for not helping him escape the country fast enough and was afraid of him. He told Kay that Grat&#x27;s camp was on a steep mountain in the Sierra Nevada, close to the Kings River and about fifteen miles northeast of Sanger, but that they would never find the place. The mountain was a natural fortress, rocky and heavily wooded, with a good view of the surrounding countryside. This mountain would later be known as Dalton Mountain. He also said that Grat was accompanied by Riley Dean, the man who had been arrested with Bill for the Ceres robbery, as well as a dog. Kay promised Middleton secrecy, and a horse and buggy, if he led him to within a half mile of Dalton&#x27;s camp.

Since Grat&#x27;s location was in Fresno County, Kay telegraphed Sheriff Hensley in Fresno, and the two made plans to assemble a posse in Centerville. After pointing out the location of the camp, Middleton left in a hurry and the two posses spent the night on the living room floor of the nearby Elwood ranch. The next day, Christmas Eve, 1891, the posse of both Sheriff Kay and Sheriff Hensley woke up at three in the morning and ascended the mountain to Dalton&#x27;s camp. It had been raining for several days prior, and it was so cold the ground was covered in ice. The posse reached Dalton&#x27;s camp at nine and split into two groups in order to surround the camp, Kay leading one and Hensley the other. Kay and his men made their way to a rock ledge that Middleton told them would bring them within a few feet above Dalton&#x27;s camp.

From their position, Kay and his deputies were fifty yards from Dalton and Dean, who were both discussing their plan to hunt one of Elwood&#x27;s hogs for Christmas dinner. Kay&#x27;s deputies were carrying ten gauge, double-barrel shotguns, loaded with buckshot, and they leveled them at Dalton. There was a moment where Dalton could have been shot in cold blood, and some of Kay&#x27;s deputies wanted to do it, but Kay and Hensley would not allow it. Grat and Riley then made their way out of camp with their rifles on their backs and Kay decided they would set up an ambush and wait for their return. The men split into three groups to cover all approaches to the camp.

Sheriff Hensley and deputy Ed McCardle where guarding a trail that led to the summit of small and narrow ridge. Around eleven, they noticed Dalton and Dean returning from their hunt, so they sent deputy Perry Byrd to go and retrieve Kay. They hid behind some rocks and an oak tree and waited as one of the men approached them. They waited until the heavy bearded, two-hundred and thirty pound man was thirty feet from them. The lawmen aimed their rifles at the man and Hensley ordered him to drop his rifle and unbuckle his revolver belt. The man was Riley Dean and he did as he was told. Hensley grabbed Dean and took him over the ridge to Kay so they could handcuff him to an oak tree.

Right as Hensley left, deputy McCardle heard the sound of footsteps come from the same direction where they had spotted Dean. He then saw Grat begin to approach over the hill and planned to wait until he was thirty feet from him before making an arrest. Right before the deputy ordered Grat to drop his weapon, a dog appeared ten feet from Grat and began barking at the lawman. Grat and McCardle fired at each other almost simultaneously. Grat lowered his winchester, fired, and jumped behind cover all in one quick motion. McCardle&#x27;s bullet flew straight over Dalton, but Grat&#x27;s bullet struck the tree within inches of McCardle&#x27;s face and filled his eyes with bark. Grat dropped to the ground and rolled into a gulch about ten feet away. He then quickly charged down the mountainside tearing through the brush.

The posse tried firing at Grat through the brush, but he managed to run the mile back to Elwood&#x27;s ranch. Judson Elwood was plowing his six-horse team when he heard the shots up the mountain. He began walking behind his plow when he felt a rifle poke him in the ribs. Grat ordered Elwood to unhitch one of his horses, which he did. Grat rode away from the house, jumped the horse over an old rock fence, and began yelling and firing his revolver in the air so that Dean would know that he had escaped. He then rode away with the dog running ahead of him.

Grat first rode to Charles Owen&#x27;s ranch across from Clovis Cole where he stayed for a few days. Officers were watching Lit at Clovis Cole&#x27;s, but did not think to watch Owen&#x27;s place. Grat then rode to a home seven miles south of Livingston, the home of his friend ex-supervisor W.W. Gray. The weather conditions during his escape led him to becoming sick with pneumonia, so he stayed near Livingston for several weeks, sleeping in Gray&#x27;s cupola and watching the surrounding plains with an eyeglass for any sight of a posse. When Grat recovered, he was able to escape with the help of his brother Cole. They cut through Antelope Valley and skirted the desert down to San Diego County before taking the old trail to Yuma. The two left California in February 1892 and rode for a hundred and seven days before reaching Kingfisher. By the time Grat reached his mother&#x27;s he had lost forty pounds. Cole had split up with Grat at Gila Bend, Arizona after the two got in argument in which Cole was trying to convince Grat not to join Bob and Emmett.

===Oklahoma===
Grat returned to Oklahoma in the spring of 1892 and shortly afterward joined his brothers gang. Some time later, the three dissatisfied members also returned and new plans began to form. Bill had returned to Oklahoma several months earlier, living at his mother&#x27;s house near Kingsfisher. After being found innocent by a Visalia jury, Bill was acquitted and released on October 15. He then sold the lease to his ranch in San Luis Obispo County, moved his family to his wife&#x27;s parents in Livingston, California, and left for Kingfisher. Though he did not participate in any of the hold-ups with his brothers, he acted as their spy and advisor.

On June 1, 1892, the gang robbed the Santa Fe train at a small station called Red Rock at 10pm. Here, the Santa Fe had found out about the Daltons&#x27; plans and attempted to set up a trap for the gang, filling the train with heavily armed officers. They made the mistake of leaving the train dark, though, which made Bob suspicious, and the gang allowed the train to go by. They then robbed the next train a few minutes later, securing about $50,000. The $50,000, however, came out to only $1800 after drafts and securities had been thrown out. After splitting the money among themselves, the gang soon realized they needed to rob another train.

The night before the robbery at Red Rock, Judge Burford, US District Attorney for Oklahoma Horace Speed, and deputy marshal George Yoes (son of Marshal Jacob Yoes, the Daltons former employer at Fort Smith) were sitting in a hotel lobby in Kingfisher, where they were talking about the cases that would be in court the next day. Bill Dalton came into the hotel lobby and began to speak to deputy Yoes in a loud voice, so everyone around them could hear. At 10pm he looked at his watch and announced to Yoes aloud that it was his bedtime, but that he would be back to have breakfast with him in the morning. After he left, the judge asked Yoes who the man was, as he seemed educated and well-informed. Yoes told the judge that he was Bill Dalton, the brother of the notorious train robbers, and the judge asked him to introduce them when he came to breakfast. Bill arrived for breakfast like he said, and the four of them took the same table. At about 8am, a telegraph messenger came into the room and handed the deputy marshal a telegram, reporting the robbery at Red Rock by the Daltons at 10pm the previous night. The deputy handed the message to Judge Burford, who read it aloud to the audience. As soon as the judge had finished, Bill announced, &quot;Well, I can prove that I was not there, and not by accident either.&quot;

The next robbery was on July 14, at Adair, Oklahoma, near the Arkansas border. At the station, the gang took what they could find in the express and baggage rooms. They sat to wait for the next train on a bench on the platform, talking and smoking, with their Winchester rifles across their knees. When the train came in at 9:45 pm, they backed a wagon up to the express car and unloaded all the contents. The eight armed guards on the train all happened to be at the back of the train when it pulled in. They fired at the bandits through the car windows and from behind the train. In the gunfight, 200 shots were fired. None of the Dalton gang was hit. Doctors W. L. Goff and Youngblood were sitting on the porch of the drug store near the depot. Both men were hit several times by stray shots; Dr Goff was fatally wounded. Also wounded were captains Kinney and LaFlore, but they recovered. The gang secured about $18,000. They were also accused of robbing a bank in El Reno, Oklahoma, on July 28, but this was based on little evidence, as no one identified any members of the gang.

After the robbery at Adair, officials of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad offered a reward of $40,000 for anyone who could capture and convict the Dalton Gang, and a reward of $5,000 for the arrest of any of them.

==Coffeyville bank robbery==
Bob Dalton had ambitions. He would, he claimed, &quot;beat anything Jesse James ever did—rob two banks at once, in broad daylight.&quot; On October 5, 1892, the Dalton gang attempted this feat when they set out to rob the C.M. Condon &amp; Company&#x27;s Bank and the First National Bank on opposite sides of the street in Coffeyville, Kansas. Bob had planned the entire robbery. Emmett, however, was against the idea. He had gone to school at Robbins Corners near Coffeyville, and knew several hundred people in town. He was afraid some of his friends would be hurt, but Bob assured him there would not be any shooting, and that it would all be over before anyone knew what happened. The plan was that Bob and Emmett were to rob the First National Bank while Grat, Broadwell, and Powers robbed the Condon Bank across the street. Emmett thought Grat would mess things up if he went alone with Powers and Broadwell, and thought they should trade places. This led to a heavy argument between Bob and Emmett and created bitterness between them on the way to the robbery.

Bob had planned for the gang to tie their horses to a post behind the Condon Bank, where it was protected from the center of town by brick walls. They had not been to the town for several years, though, and the hitching post had since been removed during street work. Bob would not allow Emmett to check out the town beforehand in fear that he would be recognized, so this was not factored into their plan. When they arrived, Bob had to think quickly, and decided instead to tie their horses in an alley across from the bank to the west, near the city jail, which offered them little protection. This is now known as Dalton Alley.

On the morning of October 5, the gang emerged from the alley onto the plaza of Coffeyville. A storekeeper who was sweeping the sidewalk a few feet away noticed Bob, Emmett, and even Grat, who was wearing a fake mustache, and ran inside his store. In close order, the five crossed Walnut Street from the alley to the Condon Bank, holding Winchester rifles close along their legs. Grat, Broadwell, and Powers entered the Condon Bank and Emmett and Bob hurried across Union Street to the First National Bank. Street work was being done at the time, and one of the workers noticed the men dog-trotting across the alley with rifles, and began to yell, &quot;The Daltons are robbing the bank!&quot; Very soon, half the businessmen around the plaza knew what was going on, and the message quickly passed throughout the town.

Grat entered the Condon Bank and pointed his Winchester at the cashier, ordering his hands up, while Powers and Broadwell took positions at the door. Grat went to the back office and ordered the manager into the front, he then handed the cashier a sack bag and ordered him to fill it with cash from the money drawer. Then, noticing the vault door was open, Grat ordered both of them into the vault, where the safe with the gold was. When told to open the safe, the manager lied, telling Grat it was a time lock and that it would not open for another 10 minutes. Grat believed him and decided he would wait until it opened. He then ordered the bags of silver on the vault floor into his bag, containing $1000 and weighing about 200 lb.

Meanwhile, Emmett and Bob had entered the First National Bank, covered the officers and two customers, and ordered the cashier, Thomas Ayres, to open the safe with gold and cash. They put the gold into the sack, forced Ayres in front of them as cover, and went out the front door. They had planned to meet with Grat and cross the plaza to the alley, where they could make their escape, but word of the robbery had spread through town. As they exited the door, an American Express agent opened fire with his revolver. Bob and Emmett returned fire and left Ayres on the sidewalk. They turned around, and went through the back door, carrying both rifles and sack bags, while taking two other bank employees as cover.

Grat heard the revolver shots from the Express agent. He then decided the sack bag was too heavy to carry, and ordered the silver taken out, then stashed what cash he could fit into his coat pockets. Two hardware stores in the town had, meanwhile, begun passing out guns to the local civilians, who began firing through the windows at the Condon Bank. The three returned fire and held out, waiting for the time lock to open. Several civilians were wounded in the fighting.

When Emmett and Bob went out the back door of the First National Bank, they were met by Lucius Baldwin, who had been watching the door with his pistol. Bob ordered him to drop the gun, and when he failed to answer, shot him with his Winchester, killing him. Bob and Emmett then made their way to the end of the back alley onto Eighth Street, where they could hear the townspeople shooting at the Condon Bank. Outside of a drug store across from the First National, George Cubine was standing with his Winchester aimed at the front door of the bank, awaiting the exit of Bob and Emmett. Bob shot him in the head, killing him. Cubine&#x27;s partner, Charles Brown, was standing unarmed next to him and went to pick up his Winchester. As he lifted the rifle up, Bob shot and killed him.

After being left on the sidewalk by Bob and Emmett, Thomas Ayres had run into one of the hardware stores and grabbed a rifle. He spotted Bob just as he had killed Brown and aimed his rifle at him from behind the store window. Bob saw Ayres from about 200 ft away and quickly shot him in the head. Ayres was not killed, but he remained paralyzed for life.

In the midst of the shooting, Powers told Grat he had been hit in the arm. Grat ordered the employees to lay on the floor in the back office, and after receiving the signal from Bob, told Powers and Broadwell that it was time to leave. The three went out the side door crouching and dashing across Walnut Street to the alley where they had hitched their horses. Bob and Emmett met Grat and the others in the alley, the sacks of money still over their arms.

As the Daltons made their way west down the alley towards the horses, Town Marshal Charles T. Connelly came through the livery stable into the alley and ran east towards the plaza without noticing the bandits behind him. Grat then shot him in the head and killed him. Following behind Marshal Connelly was John Kloehr, still in the stable. Grat noticed him, but before he could aim, Kloehr shot him in the throat.

Taking fire from the hardware store, Bob was hit in the head and the heart, killing him instantly. Powers tried to mount his horse, but shots from the store also killed him. Emmett was able to mount his horse unwounded, and began riding away, but after noticing Bob was hit, turned around and attempted to lift Bob onto his horse. Emmett was then hit in the back with a load of buckshot. Broadwell was hit several times, but managed to ride away. He was found 2 miles away, dead.

Bill Dalton and Bill Doolin had been waiting several miles away with extra horses to aid the gang&#x27;s escape. After getting tired of waiting, they left, only to learn later the fate of the gang.

Grat and Bob Dalton, Dick Broadwell, and Bill Powers were all killed. Emmett Dalton received 23 gunshot wounds and survived (he was shot through the right arm, below the shoulder, through the left – right, in some accounts – hip and groin, and received 18-23 buckshot in his back). He was given a life sentence in the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas, of which he served 14 years before being pardoned by Governor Ed Hoch in 1907. He moved to Hollywood, California, and became a real estate agent, author, and actor, and died in 1937 at age 66. Bill Doolin, &quot;Bitter Creek&quot; Newcomb, and Charlie Pierce, none of whom was at Coffeyville, were the only members left of the original Dalton Gang.

Years after the robberies and his release from prison, Emmett Dalton said that the relentless pressure put on them by Deputy US Marshal Heck Thomas as he hunted for them was a key factor in his gang&#x27;s decision to commit the robberies. They hoped that a big haul from the banks would allow them to leave the territory and escape Thomas&#x27; heat.

==Afterward==

For a time, Bill Doolin and his partners operated under outlaw Henry Starr (Cherokee), hiding out about 75 miles northeast of Kingfisher, from where they made several raids. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce visited the Daltons&#x27; mother in Kingfisher to console her after her sons&#x27; deaths. Brothers Lit and Bill Dalton were also visiting their mother, and Doolin proposed that they join his group to avenge their brothers. Bill Dalton agreed to join them and soon took part in several robberies, but Lit refused in disgust. Henry Starr was arrested in 1893 and held for trial at Fort Smith.

As Doolin and Dalton were accepted as leaders of the gang, it became known as the Doolin-Dalton Gang, and also as the Wild Bunch. Dalton took part in several robberies with the Wild Bunch, including a gun battle on September 1, 1893, at Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory, where three deputy U. S. marshals were killed. Eventually, Bill Dalton left Doolin to form his own Dalton Gang. On May 23, 1894, Dalton and his new gang robbed the First National Bank at Longview, Texas. During the robbery, one member of the gang and four citizens were killed in a shootout. This was the gang&#x27;s only job. After the gang separated with their share of the loot, Bill hid out with his family in a cabin near Elk, Indian Territory. A posse assembled by U.S. Marshal S.T. Lindsey in Ardmore, Oklahoma, tracked him to the cabin and surrounded it on June 8, 1894. Bill escaped through a window at the back of the house, but as he ran through a patch of corn he was shot and killed by the deputy marshals.

Lit, the last surviving Dalton brother, responded to a book written by his brother Emmett after the latter&#x27;s death. Lit said that Emmett&#x27;s book, &quot;When the Daltons Rode&quot; (1931), was largely fabrication. Emmett had denied accompanying Bob to California. On his death bed, Emmett told Frank Forrest Latta that he had robbed a train in California, and had used the alias William McElhanie. He asked Latta not to publish the information until after his death.

In her unpublished novella, &quot;Grat Dalton&#x27;s Ride&quot;, Eva Evans, the daughter of the famous California outlaw Chris Evans, tells the story of Grat Dalton&#x27;s escape from California after the Alila robbery. In it she implied that her father was the one who helped Grat Dalton escape from the Visalia Jail, lending credibility to an earlier claim made by Sheriff Gene Kay of this being true. Most of Sheriff Kay&#x27;s information on Chris Evans came from his deputy Perry Byrd, who also happened to be Evans&#x27; brother-in-law, but Kay had other supporting information as well.

Chris Evans and Grat Dalton had become friends while working together in Tulare County during the summer of 1888, at the Grangers Bank of California&#x27;s wheat warehouses in Tipton and Pixley. This would&#x27;ve been while Grat was on active duty as Deputy Marshal in Indian Territory, but Sheriff Kay claimed that Grat had told him that he had made two extended trips to California while serving as U.S. Marshal. This was also confirmed by Lit Dalton, who had owned a saloon in San Miguel from 1889 to 1890. He claimed that Bob, Grat, and Emmett had all made at least two trips to Bill&#x27;s ranch in California during that time and that at least one of them would show up to his saloon to get a gallon demijohn full of whiskey to bring back to the rest.

Sometime before the Alila robbery, but after Grat, Bob and Emmett had all arrived at Bill&#x27;s ranch in 1890, Grat had been rumored to have been in possession of rare two dollar bills. This was only a few months after $2,000 in rare two dollar bills had been stolen during a train robbery outside of Goshen (a robbery later attributed to Chris Evans and John Sontag). Grat had already been known in the San Joaquin Valley as a heavy drinker, fighter, and gambler, so when Kay passed Grat on the street while in Modesto his deputy George Witty was easily able to recognize him. Kay stopped Grat in the street and said, &quot;Say, I hear you have some two-dollar bills. I haven&#x27;t seen one since I left Missouri. Let me look at one.&quot; Kay noticed the bills were perfectly new and asked Grat where he got them. Grat began to say something about a horse, but then became suspicious. Knowing Grat must&#x27;ve sold or hired a horse, Kay sent Witty to investigate while he kept Grat in sight. Kay hung around Grat for a few hours and talked to him most of the time until Witty returned. Witty had gone to the livery stable in Modesto, at the time being jointly run by Chris Evans and John Sontag, and learned that Grat had sold the horse to Evans who in turn gave him the two dollar bills. Evans, however, claimed that he had received the bills from the Sol Sweet store after cashing a check there. Kay apologized to Grat and let him go, but upon visiting the Sol Sweet store Kay learned that Evans had received gold instead of two dollar bills when cashing his check. Kay did not think much of this until later, when Perry Byrd mentioned Chris breaking Grat out of jail. Kay believed Chris was either protecting himself by helping Grat break from jail or returning the favor for Grat protecting him. Chris was also reported by a Visalia newspaper to have attended every day of Grat&#x27;s trial for the Alila robbery. This was also confirmed by Lit Dalton who had also attended the trial and claimed to have had several hour long conversations with Evans.

There has been much debate over the identity of the, &quot;sixth man at Coffeyville&quot; reported by witnesses who claimed was accompanying the gang as they arrived in town right before the robbery. The account given on October 7, 1892, by Coffeyville&#x27;s &quot;The Journal&quot; is considered to be the most authentic on events the day of the robbery. &quot;The Journal&quot; acknowledged witnesses statements then and in a later article that there were two major unanswered questions: who was the sixth man seen riding into town with the gang, and what happened to him?

&quot;The Journal&quot; then went to state that, &quot;The other dead body proved to be that of Tom Evans...&quot; and marked number six on their map of the shooting area as &quot;Where Tom Evans fell&quot; and in three other references to him &quot;The Journal&quot; called him Tom. For some reason, however, the body was buried as Bill Powers. While six men were confirmed to had been seen riding into town, other witnesses that day were all in agreement that upon reaching town there were only five men in the group. After the attempted robbery, Emmett was taken upstairs above the drug store to be treated by Dr. Wells. In order to persuade the townsfolk not to hang him, he agreed to tell them everything they wanted to know. As Emmett reviewed the roles of the various participants, he concluded by saying, &quot;Then there was Tom Evans down tending the horses.&quot; He then corrected himself, saying that he meant Bill Powers. No one then or later asked him about the horse tending remark, but it could not have referred to Bill Powers because his role as an active participant is well recorded. Many newspapers at the time assumed that an unknown member of the gang escaped. Since Emmett had originally attempted to convince his captors that he was Charles Dryden, until he realized that it was hopeless, his word is considered by many to be of questionable value. If someone in the gang had escaped, there would be nothing gained by Emmett for admitting it. It has been speculated by those seeking to answer the confusion that Bill Powers possibly escaped and it was Tom Evans who was killed, as originally reported, or that Tom Evans was just an alias of Bill Powers.

Bill Powers was somewhat of a man of mystery. &quot;The Journal&quot; reported that, &quot;no one has yet been found who knows him or anything of his antecedents or history.&quot; Tom Evans, on the other hand, was reported to be the fraternal twin of outlaw Chris Evans, who at the time of the Coffeyville raid was a fugitive hiding out in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains. Chris Evans&#x27; family ridiculed reports of any such involvement or that Tom had been killed, but otherwise never disclosed his actual whereabouts. Chris had continually attested his innocence and any confirmation of his already rumored association with the Dalton Gang would have damaged his case. A later report in the &quot;Visalia Times-Delta&quot;, a major newspaper in Visalia, California, attributed to &quot;a relative of Mrs. Evans&quot; (most likely Chris Evans brother-in-law Perry Byrd, a deputy of Sheriff Gene Kay) stated, &quot;Tom Evans killed at Coffeyville, Kansas, when the Dalton brothers made their famous raid on the banks of that town, was the twin brother of Chris.&quot;

There have been several other nominees suggested to be the sixth man seen riding into Coffeyville, including Bill Dalton, George Newcomb, and Bill Doolin, all of which have never been confirmed.

* The 1954 Franco-Belgian comic book &quot;Hors-la-loi&quot;, part of the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; series, embroiders the Coffeyville events, with the gang made up only of Dalton brothers, all four of whom are killed in the end. Morris&#x27;s comical depiction of the outlaws — as mustachioed and identically dressed quadruplets differing only in their height — having proved popular, a second fictional gang of Dalton brothers physically indistinguishable from the originals and presented as their (bungling) cousins became recurring villains in the Lucky Luke series, later written by René Goscinny.

* The May 25, 1959, episode of &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; was called &quot;The Daltons&quot;.
* &quot;Three Minutes to Eternity&quot; is a half-hour, 1963 episode (season 12, episode 9, narrated by Stanley Andrews, known as &quot;The Old Ranger&quot;) of the TV series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; about their last robbery in Coffeyville, with Forrest Tucker as Bob Dalton, Jim Davis as Grat, and Tom Skerritt as Emmett.
* In Charles Portis&#x27;s novel &quot;True Grit&quot; (1968), the young heroine Mattie Ross refers to Bob and Grat Dalton as &quot;upright men gone bad&quot; and to Bill Doolin as &quot;a cowboy gone wrong&quot;.
* The 1973 song &quot;Doolin-Dalton&quot;, by the Eagles, is a song about the Dalton Gang. The album from which the song came, &quot;Desperado&quot;, has a photograph on its back cover that shows the Eagles band members and songwriters re-enacting the image of the capture and death of the Dalton Gang.
* Robert Conrad starred as Bob Dalton in &quot;The Last Day&quot; (1975), depicting the events leading up to the gang&#x27;s attempted robbery of two banks in Coffeyville. The film has a documentary-style voice-over by Harry Morgan.
* Randy Quaid starred in &quot;The Last Ride of the Dalton Gang&quot; (1979), a portrayal of the gang&#x27;s attempted robbery of two banks simultaneously in Coffeyville. (The following year, the actor would co-star in &quot;The Long Riders&quot;, about Jesse James&#x27;s bank robbery attempt in Northfield, Minnesota, which similarly led to destruction of his gang.)

* Joe Dassin wrote a song called &quot;Les Dalton&quot;, inspired by the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; characters.
* Hanna-Barbera created various versions of the Dalton Gang in animated productions, most notably with Huckleberry Hound.
* In &quot;Payday 2&quot;, one of the medic&#x27;s lines is &quot;You guys are going down like the Daltons&quot;, in reference to the gang.
* The video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; has a gang called &quot;Walton&#x27;s gang&quot;, loosely based on the Dalton gang.

<doc id="397362" wikidata="Q2664799" url="?curid=397362" title="Michael J. McGivney">
<text>Michael Joseph McGivney (August 12, 1852August 14, 1890) was an American Catholic priest based in New Haven, Connecticut. He founded the Knights of Columbus at a local parish to serve as a mutual aid and insurance organization, particularly for immigrants and their families. It developed through the 20th century as the world&#x27;s largest Catholic fraternal organization.

The cause for his canonization started in the Archdiocese of Hartford in 1996; in March 2008, Pope Benedict XVI declared McGivney &quot;Venerable&quot; in recognition of his &quot;heroic virtue&quot;. On May 27, 2020, Pope Francis announced that McGivney had been approved for beatification, which officially occurred on October 31, 2020.

==Early life==
He was born to Irish immigrant parents, Patrick and Mary (née Lynch) McGivney. He was the eldest of 13 children, six of whom died in infancy or childhood. His father worked as a molder in a Waterbury, Connecticut, brass mill. Michael attended the local Waterbury district school but left at 13 to work in one of the brass mills&#x27; spoon-making departments.

==Studies==
In 1868, at the age of 16, he entered the Séminaire de Saint-Hyacinthe in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada. He continued his studies at Our Lady of Angels Seminary, near Niagara Falls, New York (1871–1872) and at the Jesuits&#x27; St. Mary&#x27;s College, in Montreal, Quebec. While in seminary, he and other seminarians formed a baseball team and McGivney was a &quot;naturally talented ballplayer.&quot; He had to leave the seminary, returning home to help finish raising his siblings after his father&#x27;s death in June 1873. McGivney later resumed his studies at St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, in Baltimore, Maryland; he was ordained a priest on December 22, 1877, by James Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore at the Cathedral of the National Shrine of the Assumption.
==Knights of Columbus==
From his own experience, McGivney recognized the devastating effect on immigrant families of the father and wage earner&#x27;s untimely death. Many Catholics were still struggling to assimilate into the American economy. On March 29, 1882, while an assistant pastor at Saint Mary&#x27;s Church in New Haven, Connecticut, McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus, with a small group of parishioners, as a mutual aid society, to provide financial assistance, in the event of the men&#x27;s deaths, to their widows and orphans. The organization developed as a fraternal society. McGivney was also known for his tireless work among his parishioners.

McGivney spent seven years at St. Mary&#x27;s, then became pastor of St. Thomas Church in Thomaston in 1884. He died from pneumonia at the age of 38 in Thomaston on the eve of the Assumption in 1890. 
The Knights of Columbus was among the first groups to recruit blood donors, with formal efforts dating to 1937 during the Great Depression. As of 2013, the order had more than 1.8 million member families and 15,000 councils. During the 2012 fraternal year, the order donated $167 million and 70 million man-hours to charity.

By 2020, the order reached the 2 million member mark. During the 2022 fraternal year, the order donated $185 million and 49 million man-hours to charity.

==Cause of beatification and canonization==

In 1996, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford opened the cause for canonization, an investigation into McGivney&#x27;s life with a view towards formal recognition by the Catholic Church of his sainthood. Gabriel O&#x27;Donnell is the postulator of McGivney&#x27;s cause. He is also the director of the Fr. McGivney Guild, which now has 150,000 members supporting his cause.

The diocesan investigation was closed in 2000, and the case was passed to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican City. On March 15, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI approved a decree recognizing McGivney&#x27;s heroic virtue, thus declaring him as &quot;Venerable.&quot;

, a miracle attributed to McGivney&#x27;s intercession was under investigation at the Vatican. On May 27, 2020, the miracle attributed to the intercession of McGivney was approved by Congregation for the Causes of Saints and authorized by Pope Francis. The Miracle involved the healing of Michael &quot;Mikey&quot; Schachle in his mother&#x27;s womb after being given a zero percent chance of survival by doctors at Vanderbilt Medical Center in 2015.

On October 31, 2020, the beatification Mass of Michael McGivney was celebrated at the Cathedral of Saint Joseph in Hartford, Connecticut with Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin presiding on the Pope&#x27;s behalf.

<text>Pascal Sébah (1823 – June 25, 1886) was an Ottoman photographer in Istanbul and Cairo. Best known for his prolific photography of Anatolia, Egypt, and Greece, Sébah established the studio that would later become Sébah &amp; Joaillier.

==Life and work==

Pascal Sébah was born in Istanbul, then the capital of the Ottoman Empire, to a Syrian father and an Armenian mother.

He initially worked in collaboration with the French photographer, Henri Bechard. After receiving medals at the International Exhibition in Paris, he decided to open his own studio in Constantinople in 1857. Sébah&#x27;s studio was known as &quot;&quot;El Chark&quot; (meaning &quot;The Orient&quot;), situated at 439 Grande Rue de Pera in the center of the city and close to the embassies and hotels where tourists met.

Sébah primarily produced photographs for the tourist trade. By the second half of the 19th century, tourist travel to Egypt had created a strong demand for photographs as souvenirs. Sébah was among a group of early photographers in Constantinople and Cairo to capitalise on this demand. These pioneering photographers included Félix Bonfils (1831-1885); Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884), brothers Henri and Emile Bechard; the British-Italian brothers Antonio Beato (c. 1832–1906) and Felice Beato and the Greek Zangaki brothers. By 1873 Sébah was successful enough to open a second studio in Cairo. The same year, he exhibited at the Ottoman pavilion of the Universal Exhibition in Vienna, Austria.

He established a valuable working relationship with Turkish painter and archeologist Osman Hamdi Bey, taking photographs as part of the artist&#x27;s preparation, and in which he experimented with light and shade. In turn, Hamdi Bey selected Sébah to illustrate his text on the popular costumes worn by Turkish and other ethnic groups, entitled &quot;Les Costumes Populaires de la Turquie en 1873: ouvrage publié sous le patronage de la Commission impériale ottomane pour l&#x27;Exposition universelle de Vienne&quot; and published in 1873.

Following his death on 25 June 1886, the studio continued in business. It was managed by his brother, Cosmi, and in 1888 Polycarpe Joiallier became a partner. At this time, the company was renamed Sebah &amp; Joaillier Pascal&#x27;s son, Jean Pascal Sébah, also joined in 1888 and went on to run the studio with other photographers. The firm developed a reputation as the leading representative of Orientalist photography and in 1889 was appointed the Photographers by Appointment to the Prussian Court. Sébah&#x27;s studio continued operations, in one form or another, until 1952 at the same address and then moved until its closure in 1973.

Sébah, a Syrian Catholic, was buried in the Feriköy Latin Catholic Cemetery in Istanbul. His son, Jean Pascal Sébah, is also buried there.

<text>Maria Fidelis Catholic School FCJ is a Roman Catholic co-educational secondary school in the London Borough of Camden, England. It was founded by the Faithful Companions of Jesus.

==History==

The school was founded in 1830 by the Faithful Companions of Jesus, or more specifically, their founder, Marie-Madeleine d&#x27;Houët. Just months after the school&#x27;s opening, Marie later realised she could not keep running the school and passed the role of headteacher to Julie Guillemet, a friend of hers and FCJ sister.

It was at first an industrial school financed by charitable appeals. The school then progressed to being a convent boarding school and then to a selective non-fee paying grammar school known as St. Aloysius.

The school then became a comprehensive in 1974 with the merger of St. Aloysius with St. Vincent&#x27;s Schools which was run by the Sisters of Charity. The name &quot;Maria Fidelis&quot; was chosen by the Sisters meaning &quot;Mary Most Faithful.&quot;

Maria Fidelis today stands on Drummond Crescent in the Somers Town area of Camden, near Euston.

The school won BBC&#x27;s &#x27;School Choir Of The Year&#x27; and are known for their vocal arrangements under the direction of Karen Gibson. The choir performed for Pope Benedict XVI at The Big Assembly at St Mary&#x27;s University College, Twickenham on during his visit to the UK.

Since , the school admits boys as well as girls, in co-education.

==Current Building==
The High Speed 2 rail network&#x27;s planned route was to go through North Gower Street, the location of the school&#x27;s previous building. This meant the school was required to move locations to Drummond Crescent, nearby to Euston Road. Work began on the site in and the school started moving in , before its official opening in .

<doc id="397388" wikidata="Q1192131" url="?curid=397388" title="Rankine–Hugoniot conditions">
<text>The Rankine–Hugoniot conditions, also referred to as Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions or Rankine–Hugoniot relations, describe the relationship between the states on both sides of a shock wave or a combustion wave (deflagration or detonation) in a one-dimensional flow in fluids or a one-dimensional deformation in solids. They are named in recognition of the work carried out by Scottish engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine and French engineer Pierre Henri Hugoniot.

The basic idea of the jump conditions is to consider what happens to a fluid when it undergoes a rapid change. Consider, for example, driving a piston into a tube filled with non-reacting gas. A disturbance is propagated through the fluid somewhat faster than the speed of sound. Because the disturbance propagates supersonically, it is a shock wave, and the fluid downstream of the shock has no advance information of it. In a frame of reference moving with the wave, atoms or molecules in front of the wave slam into the wave supersonically. On a microscopic level, they undergo collisions on the scale of the mean free path length until they come to rest in the post-shock flow (but moving in the frame of reference of the wave or of the tube). The bulk transfer of kinetic energy heats the post-shock flow. Because the mean free path length is assumed to be negligible in comparison to all other length scales in a hydrodynamic treatment, the shock front is essentially a hydrodynamic discontinuity. The jump conditions then establish the transition between the pre- and post-shock flow, based solely upon the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The conditions are correct even though the shock actually has a positive thickness. This non-reacting example of a shock wave also generalizes to reacting flows, where a combustion front (either a detonation or a deflagration) can be modeled as a discontinuity in a first approximation.

==Governing Equations==

In a coordinate system that is moving with the discontinuity, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions can be expressed as:

where &quot;m&quot; is the mass flow rate per unit area, &quot;ρ&quot;1 and &quot;ρ&quot;2 are the mass density of the fluid upstream and downstream of the wave, &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2 are the fluid velocity upstream and downstream of the wave, &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 are the pressures in the two regions, and &quot;h&quot;1 and &quot;h&quot;2 are the &quot;specific&quot; (with the sense of &quot;per unit mass&quot;) enthalpies in the two regions. If in addition, the flow is reactive, then the species conservation equations demands that

:formula_1

to vanish both upstream and downstream of the discontinuity. Here, formula_2 is the mass production rate of the &quot;i&quot;-th species of total &quot;N&quot; species involved in the reaction.

Combining conservation of mass and momentum gives us

:formula_3

which defines a straight line known as the Michelson–Rayleigh line, named after the Russian physicist Vladimir A. Mikhelson (usually anglicized as Michelson) and Lord Rayleigh, that has a negative slope (since formula_4 is always positive) in the formula_5 plane. Using the Rankine–Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum to eliminate &quot;u&quot;1 and &quot;u&quot;2, the equation for the conservation of energy can be expressed as the Hugoniot equation:
:formula_6

The inverse of the density can also be expressed as the specific volume, formula_7. Along with these, one has to specify the relation between the upstream and downstream equation of state
:formula_8
where formula_9 is the mass fraction of the species. Finally, the calorific equation of state formula_10 is assumed to be known, i.e.,
:formula_11

==Simplified Rankine–Hugoniot relations==

The following assumptions are made in order to simplify the Rankine–Hugoniot equations. The mixture is assumed to obey the ideal gas law, so that relation between the downstream and upstream equation of state can be written as

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the universal gas constant and the mean molecular weight formula_14 is assumed to be constant (otherwise, formula_14 would depend on the mass fraction of the all species). If one assumes that the specific heat at constant pressure formula_16 is also constant across the wave, the change in enthalpies (calorific equation of state) can be simply written as

:formula_17

where the first term in the above expression represents the amount of heat released per unit mass of the upstream mixture by the wave and the second term represents the sensible heating. Eliminating temperature using the equation of state and substituting the above expression for the change in enthalpies into the Hugoniot equation, one obtains an Hugoniot equation expressed only in terms of pressure and densities,

:formula_18

where formula_19 is the specific heat ratio, which for ordinary room temperature air (298 KELVIN) = 1.40. An Hugoniot curve without heat release (formula_20) is often called a &quot;shock Hugoniot&quot;, or simply a(n) &quot;Hugoniot&quot;. Along with the Rayleigh line equation, the above equation completely determines the state of the system. These two equations can be written compactly by introducing the following non-dimensional scales,

:formula_21

The Rayleigh line equation and the Hugoniot equation then simplifies to

:formula_22

Given the upstream conditions, the intersection of above two equations in the formula_23-formula_24 plane determine the downstream conditions; in the formula_23-formula_24 plane, the upstream condition correspond to the point formula_27. If no heat release occurs, for example, shock waves without chemical reaction, then formula_28. The Hugoniot curves asymptote to the lines formula_29 and formula_30, which are depicted as dashed lines in the figure. As mentioned in the figure, only the white region bounded by these two asymptotes are allowed so that formula_31 is positive. Shock waves and detonations correspond to the top-left white region wherein formula_32 and formula_33, that is to say, the pressure increases and the specific volume decreases across the wave (the Chapman–Jouguet condition for detonation is where Rayleigh line is tangent to the Hugoniot curve). Deflagrations, on the other hand, correspond to the bottom-right white region wherein formula_34 and formula_35, that is to say, the pressure decreases and the specific volume increases across the wave; the pressure decrease a flame is typically very small which is seldom considered when studying deflagrations.

For shock waves and detonations, the pressure increase across the wave can take any values between formula_36; the steeper the slope of the Rayleigh line, the stronger is the wave. On the contrary, here the specific volume ratio is restricted to the finite interval formula_37 (the upper bound is derived for the case formula_38 because pressure cannot take negative values). If formula_39 (diatomic gas without the vibrational mode excitation), the interval is formula_40, in other words, the shock wave can increase the density at most by a factor of 6. For monatomic gas, formula_41, the allowed interval is formula_42. For diatomic gases with vibrational mode excited, we have formula_43 leading to the interval formula_44. In reality, the specific heat ratio is not constant in the shock wave due to molecular dissociation and ionization, but even in these cases, density ratio in general do not exceed a factor of about .

==Derivation from Euler equations==
Consider gas in a one-dimensional container (e.g., a long thin tube). Assume that the fluid is inviscid (i.e., it shows no viscosity effects as for example friction with the tube walls). Furthermore, assume that there is no heat transfer by conduction or radiation and that gravitational acceleration can be neglected. Such a system can be described by the following system of conservation laws, known as the 1D Euler equations, that in conservation form is:

where
*formula_45 fluid mass density, 
*formula_46 fluid velocity, 
*formula_47 specific internal energy of the fluid, 
*formula_48 fluid pressure, and
*formula_49 is the total energy density of the fluid, [J/m3], while &quot;e&quot; is its specific internal energy

Assume further that the gas is calorically ideal and that therefore a polytropic equation-of-state of the simple form

is valid, where formula_19 is the constant ratio of specific heats formula_51. This quantity also appears as the &quot;polytropic exponent&quot; of the polytropic process described by

For an extensive list of compressible flow equations, etc., refer to NACA Report 1135 (1953).

Note: For a calorically ideal gas formula_52 is a constant and for a thermally ideal gas formula_52 is a function of temperature. In the latter case, the dependence of pressure on mass density and internal energy might differ from that given by equation ().

===The jump condition===
Before proceeding further it is necessary to introduce the concept of a &quot;jump condition&quot; – a condition that holds at a discontinuity or abrupt change.

Consider a 1D situation where there is a jump in the scalar conserved physical quantity formula_54, which is governed by integral conservation law
for any formula_55, formula_56, formula_57, and, therefore, by partial differential equation 
for smooth solutions.

Let the solution exhibit a jump (or shock) at formula_58, where formula_59 and formula_60, then


The subscripts 1 and 2 indicate conditions &quot;just upstream&quot; and &quot;just downstream&quot; of the jump respectively, i.e. formula_61 and w\left(x_s + \epsilon\right)&lt;/math&gt;.}} formula_62 is the therefore sign.

Note, to arrive at equation () we have used the fact that formula_63 and formula_64.

Now, let formula_65 and formula_66, when we have formula_67 and formula_68, and in the limit

where we have defined formula_69 (the system &quot;characteristic&quot; or &quot;shock speed&quot;), which by simple division is given by

Equation () represents the jump condition for conservation law (). A shock situation arises in a system where its &quot;characteristics&quot; intersect, and under these conditions a requirement for a unique single-valued solution is that the solution should satisfy the &quot;admissibility condition&quot; or &quot;entropy condition&quot;. For physically real applications this means that the solution should satisfy the &quot;Lax entropy condition&quot;

where formula_70 and formula_71 represent &quot;characteristic speeds&quot; at upstream and downstream conditions respectively.

===Shock condition===
In the case of the hyperbolic conservation law (), we have seen that the shock speed can be obtained by simple division. However, for the 1D Euler equations (), () and (), we have the vector state variable formula_72 and the jump conditions become

Equations (), () and () are known as the &quot;Rankine–Hugoniot conditions&quot; for the Euler equations and are derived by enforcing the conservation laws in integral form over a control volume that includes the shock. For this situation formula_73 cannot be obtained by simple division. However, it can be shown by transforming the problem to a moving co-ordinate system
(setting formula_74, formula_75, formula_76 to remove formula_77) and some algebraic manipulation (involving the elimination of formula_78 from the transformed equation () using the transformed equation ()), that the shock speed is given by

where formula_79 is the speed of sound in the fluid at upstream conditions.

== Shock Hugoniot and Rayleigh line in solids ==
For shocks in solids, a closed form expression such as equation () cannot be derived from first principles. Instead, experimental observations indicate that a linear relation can be used instead (called the shock Hugoniot in the &quot;u&quot;s-&quot;u&quot;p plane) that has the form

where &quot;c&quot;0 is the bulk speed of sound in the material (in uniaxial compression), &quot;s&quot; is a parameter (the slope of the shock Hugoniot) obtained from fits to experimental data, and is the particle velocity inside the compressed region behind the shock front.

The above relation, when combined with the Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, can be used to determine the shock Hugoniot in the &quot;p&quot;-&quot;v&quot; plane, where &quot;v&quot; is the specific volume (per unit mass):

Alternative equations of state, such as the Mie–Grüneisen equation of state may also be used instead of the above equation.

The shock Hugoniot describes the locus of all possible thermodynamic states a material can exist in behind a shock, projected onto a two dimensional state-state plane. It is therefore a set of equilibrium states and does not specifically represent the path through which a material undergoes transformation.

Weak shocks are isentropic and that the isentrope represents the path through which the material is loaded from the initial to final states by a compression wave with converging characteristics. In the case of weak shocks, the Hugoniot will therefore fall directly on the isentrope and can be used directly as the equivalent path. In the case of a strong shock we can no longer make that simplification directly. However, for engineering calculations, it is deemed that the isentrope is close enough to the Hugoniot that the same assumption can be made.

If the Hugoniot is approximately the loading path between states for an &quot;equivalent&quot; compression wave, then the jump conditions for the shock loading path can be determined by drawing a straight line between the initial and final states. This line is called the Rayleigh line and has the following equation:

=== Hugoniot elastic limit ===
Most solid materials undergo plastic deformations when subjected to strong shocks. The point on the shock Hugoniot at which a material transitions from a purely elastic state to an elastic-plastic state is called the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and the pressure at which this transition takes place is denoted &quot;p&quot;HEL. Values of &quot;p&quot;HEL can range from 0.2 GPa to 20 GPa. Above the HEL, the material loses much of its shear strength and starts behaving like a fluid.

==Magnetohydrodynamics==

Rankine–Hugoniot conditions in magnetohydrodynamics are interesting to consider since they are very relevant to astrophysical applications. Across the discontinuity the normal component formula_80 of the magnetic field formula_81 and the tangential component formula_82 of the electric field formula_83 (infinite conductivity limit) must be continuous. We thus have

:formula_84

where formula_85 is the difference between the values of any physical quantity on the two sides of the discontinuity. The remaining conditions are given by

:formula_86

These conditions are general in the sense that they include contact discontinuities (formula_87) tangential discontinuities (formula_88), rotational or Alfvén discontinuities (formula_89) and shock waves (formula_90).

<doc id="397390" wikidata="Q1426724" url="?curid=397390" title="Bottom bracket">
<text>The bottom bracket on a bicycle connects the crankset (chainset) to the bicycle and allows the crankset to rotate freely. It contains a spindle to which the crankset attaches, and the bearings that allow the spindle and crankset to rotate. The chainrings and pedals attach to the cranks. Bottom bracket bearings fit inside the bottom bracket shell, which connects the seat tube, down tube and chain stays as part of the bicycle frame.

The term &quot;bracket&quot; refers to the tube fittings that are used to hold frame tubes together in lugged steel frames which also form the shell that contains the spindle and bearings; the term is now used for all frames, bracketed or not.

There is some disagreement as to whether the word &quot;axle&quot; or &quot;spindle&quot; should be used in particular contexts. The distinction is based on whether the unit is stationary, as in a hub, or rotates, as in a bottom bracket. American bicycle mechanic and author Sheldon Brown uses &quot;axle&quot; once and &quot;spindle&quot; four times in his bottom bracket glossary entry. This article uses &quot;spindle&quot; throughout for consistency.

Bottom brackets are available in several types, and can be split into whether they are assembled and disassembled with screw threads or whether they are pressed into the bottom bracket shell. Since the 2000s and especially the 2010s, a lack of standardization, or rather the constant introduction of new standards that disappear after relatively short periods, has been described as a complex topic to deal with for those who want to buy bicycle components or maintain bicycles. Many bicycle brands have introduced their own dimensions for bottom bracket bearings, and the different use of terminology by the various manufacturers has been described as confusing.

An old American term for the bottom bracket is &quot;hanger&quot;. This is usually used in connection with Ashtabula cranks, alternatively termed &quot;one-piece&quot; cranks.

==Bottom bracket types==
===Three-piece===
In typical modern utility bikes, the bottom bracket spindle is separate from the cranks. This is known as a three-piece crankset (spindle, left crank-arm and right crank-arm). The cranks attach to the spindle via a common square taper, cotter or splined interface.

====Loose bearing (adjustable cup and cone) ====
Earlier three-piece cranks consist of a spindle incorporating bearing cones (facing out), a fixed cup on the drive side (with a cone), an adjustable cup on the non-drive side (also with a cone), and loose bearing balls (or held by a cage). Overhauling requires removing at least one cup, cleaning the cups, cleaning or (more usually) replacing the bearing balls, reinstalling the spindle, and adjusting the cups. The design is nowadays mostly found on affordable bikes due to its simple and affordable design, and is also an easily serviceable design.

====Bayliss Wiley unit bottom bracket====

The Bayliss Wiley unit bottom bracket is a self-contained unit that fits into a plain, slightly larger-than-usual bottom bracket shell in a bicycle frame. It comprises a standard spindle and bearings in a steel cylinder with a slightly-modified bearing cup at each end. The cylinder, bearing and spindle are placed in the shell and held in place by the bearing cups, each of which has a narrow flange that bears against the edge of the shell.

The Bayliss-Wiley Unit Bottom Bracket was introduced in the mid-1940s. It was fitted to various English lightweights through the 1950s and was used by Royal Enfield on its &#x27;Revelation&#x27; small wheeler in the mid-1960s. However, the unit bottom bracket was never popular and it had a reputation for being troublesome. A lack of positive location allowed it to rotate within the frame, loosening the bearing cups. Contemporary users overcome the problem by fixing the unit in the frame using adhesive or a screw.

====Cartridge bearing====
Many modern bicycles use what is called a &quot;cartridge&quot; bottom bracket instead. &quot;Cartridge&quot; here refers to the bottom bracket unit being a pre-mounted assembly containing the spindle (or axle) as well as its bearings, as opposed to them being separate parts which must be mounted separately. Cartridge hence refers to the functional assembly unit, and does not indicate what type of bearings the cartridge utilizes. Either loose ball bearings (adjustable cup and cones), sealed bearings or other types of bearings may be used in a cartridge assembly. Independent of the type of bearing used, the cartridge often has some sealing to protect the assembly from the environment.

Sealed cartridge bottom brackets are normally two pieces, a unit holding the spindle and bearings that screws into the bottom bracket shell from the drive side and a screw-in support cup (often made of light alloy or plastic) that supports the spindle and bearing assembly on the non-drive side. Other designs are three piece, the spindle is separate, but the bearing cups incorporate cheaply replaceable pairs of standard industrial sealed bearings. Either arrangement makes servicing the bottom bracket a simple matter of removing the old cartridge from the bottom bracket shell, and installing a new one in its place. Cartridge bottom brackets generally have seals to prevent the ingress of water and dirt. The early Shimano LP bottom brackets from the 1990s had the support cup on the drive side and used loose bearings inside; they could be dismantled and serviced much like adjustable cup and cone bearings.

In general use, the term &#x27;three piece&#x27; refers to the former design, with sealed bottom brackets being seen as the &#x27;standard&#x27;. Designs utilizing separate bearings are usually found on low end bikes, due to the low cost.

===One-piece (Ashtabula)===

With a one-piece (also called Ashtabula) crank and bottom bracket, the spindle and crank arms are a single piece. The bottom bracket shell is large to accommodate removal of this S-shaped crank. Bearing cups are pressed into the bottom bracket shell. The crank holds the cones, facing in; adjustment is made via the left-threaded non-drive side cone.

One-piece cranks are easily maintained and reliable, but heavy. They are found on BMX bikes as well as children&#x27;s bicycles and low-end road and mountain bikes. They fit only frames with American sized (also known as &quot;Pro size&quot;) bottom brackets.

The bearings are normally open to the elements and easily contaminated, although this rarely causes failure. Ball retainers (caged bearings) are used to facilitate assembly and to reduce the number of balls required.

===Thompson===
The Thompson bottom bracket uses adjustable spindle cones and cups pressed into the bottom bracket shell like the Ashtabula bottom bracket. Unlike the Ashtabula crank, the non-drive side crank is removable, allowing for a smaller bottom bracket shell. Frames with either Italian or English bottom bracket shell diameters (independent of threading) may be fitted with Thompson bottom brackets. Thompson bottom brackets are rare. The design is similar to a typical hub bearing and theoretically supports the load better but is hard to seal effectively against dirt and water.

===External bearings===
Since around the late 2000s, several designs with integrated bottom brackets with outboard bearings have emerged. The sales pitch of these systems have been to enable reduced weight and increased stiffness compared to internal bottom brackets. Because of the relatively small 1.37″ (34.9 mm for ISO, or 36 mm for shells threaded to the Italian standard) diameter shell, designs that place the bearings inside the shell can either have large bearings and a thinner spindle, which lacks stiffness, or smaller bearings and a thicker spindle (such as the original Shimano Octalink), which lacks durability. External bearings allow for a large diameter (hence stiff) and hollow (hence light) spindle. They also offer more distance between the two bearing surfaces, which contributes to stiffness while allowing lighter components (but also may increase the Q factor).

A different approach than to move to threaded external bearings could be to standardize on one of the larger diameter press-fit BMX shell standards for all bicycles, or the press-fit BB30 standard originally introduced by Cannondale.

Several implementations of external bearings have been brought to market.

====X-type and Hollowtech II====
In one design, the driveside (right) crankarm and the bottom bracket spindle are an integrated unit and the bearing cups are placed outside of the bottom bracket shell, threaded into the bottom bracket shell. There are a number of versions of this design available: Shimano&#x27;s Hollowtech II, RaceFace&#x27;s X-type, FSA&#x27;s MegaExo. The terms &#x27;X-Type&#x27; and &#x27;Hollowtech II&#x27; are both used to refer to any design of this type, but are in fact trademarks of the corporations marketing the systems. These external bearings are compatible with those from other manufacturers. With this new standard have come several cranksets designed to use the external bearings of other manufacturers, such as DMR&#x27;s &quot;Ex type&quot; and Charge Bikes &quot;Regular&quot; cranks.

In the early 1990s at Magic Motorcycle, a small USA component manufacturer later purchased by Cannondale, and re-formed into Cannondale&#x27;s CODA brand (Coda Magic 900 cranks), made a proprietary external bearing bottom bracket, oversized spindle and crank system. The design resembles the external bottom bracket designs marketed by FSA, RaceFace and Shimano. The modern versions used the same sealed bearing size (6805-RS, 25 mm inner diameter, 37 mm outer diameter) and the original mounting tool fits. The crank had intricately CNC machined wide hollow crank arms made of two halves glued together. However, Cannondale moved on from that system and developed the SI cranks and the new BB30 unthreaded press-fit bottom bracket standard. BB30 requires special frames which have a 42 mm diameter unthreaded bottom bracket shell (which is larger than the 34.9 mm threaded ISO standard threads) allowing use of internal sealed bearings while their top level SI crankarms are still two machined aluminum halves glued together.

Another precursor of the current external bearings/through spindle design was developed by Sweet Parts, a micro-manufacturer of high end cranks and stems. Their Sweet Wings cranks from the early 1990s incorporated the through spindle concept by attaching the two half pipes coming off each crank arm and held together with a single bolt that resided within the cavity of the spindle itself. Their bottom bracket bearing arrangement was a hybrid internal/external bottom bracket, with the right-side bearing being internal inside the bottom bracket shell, and the left-side bearing being external (and having the 6805-RS sealed bearing, too).

====Giga-X-Pipe====
Giga-X-Pipe was Truvativ&#x27;s (later bought by SRAM in 2004) approach, and is an evolution of the ISIS Drive bottom bracket, but with a longer spindle and the bearings outside the bottom bracket shell. The spindle is permanently pressed into the right crank. The left side spline interface looks similar, but is different so as to prevent installation of older ISIS Drive crankarms—which are no longer compatible because Q-factor and chain line cannot be maintained using these older cranks with an external bearing bottom bracket. Truvativ refer to this design as &#x27;Giga-X-Pipe&#x27; or &#x27;GXP.&#x27; They also make a heavier duty external bearing bottom bracket called &#x27;Howitzer.&#x27; The Howitzer BB is more like a traditional bottom bracket in that the spindle is not permanently pressed into the right crank. Again, the Howitzer spline looks similar to the ISIS Drive standard spline but is actually different, so as to prevent the usage of ISIS Drive cranks on the external bearing bottom bracket, which would affect chainline and Q-factor.

====Ultra-Torque====
In late 2006, Campagnolo introduced an outboard bearing design called Ultra-Torque, which has both crank arms permanently attached to halves of the spindle (called semi-axles), which then join in the middle of the bottom bracket with a Hirth joint and a bolt.

====Pressed bearing standards====
Bicycle frames utilizing pressed bearing standards do not have any threads inside the bottom bracket shell. The bottom bracket is pressed directly into the frame. Using pressed in standards allows frame manufacturers greater flexibility in the frame design, and can offer greater stiffness and reduced mass.

A disadvantage is that assembly and disassembly of press-fit bottom bracket bearings require expensive special equipment. Some hobby-mechanics assemble and disassemble themselves using simple hand-tools, but there is a certain risk that the frame may become damaged. Another disadvantage is that many users report that they start to creak after a certain time. A third disadvantage is that there has become a wealth of competing and incompatible press-fit bottom bracket standards introduced by various bicycle manufacturers.

The current pressed-bearing standards (and the manufacturers who developed them) are:
* BB30 (Cannondale)
* PF30 (SRAM)
* BB90 and BB95 (Trek)
* BB86 and BB92 (Shimano)
* BB79 (Cervelo&#x27;s BBRight)
* BB386EVO (FSA and BH Bicycles)

In the BB30 (Cannondale), BB90 and BB95 (Trek) systems, the bearings are pressed directly into the frame. For PF30 (SRAM), BB86 and BB92 (Shimano), BB79 (Cervelo), and BB386EVO (FSA) the bearing is housed in a nylon plastic cup that is pressed into the frame’s bottom bracket shell. Pressed-in standards usually require two-piece cranksets where the spindle is attached to one of the crankarms, or at least a spindle which can be threaded through after the bearings have been mounted. Due to fixed spindle length and diameter, cranksets designed for one pressed standard may not be compatible with another. For example, a crankset made specifically for BB30 will not fit in a BB86 bottom bracket and frame. There are other instances where third-party adapters can be used to fit a crankset made for one standard into another. For example, a Shimano (two-piece Hollowtech II 24 mm outer diameter spindle) road crankset can fit into a BB30 bottom bracket shell (42 mm inner diameter) using aftermarket adapters.

===T47===
T47 is a size for bottom-brackets in 47mm with threads. This will account for enough room for an oversized axle, while also having enough room for big ball bearings, this in comparison to the traditional BSA in 34.6mm.
A bottom-bracket made for 46mm pressfit can be threaded up to a fit for a 47mm bottom-bracket and will have approximately a 46mm inside diameter.
The T47 standard had a shell width of 68mm. The T47a has a width of 77mm. The T47i has a width of 86.5mm.

===Other===
Lightning Cycle Dynamics, Inc. offers a carbon crank bottom bracket assembly with semi-axles that connect in the middle via a hirth-like joint to form the spindle.

Schlumpf makes a bottom bracket that incorporates a two-speed epicyclic transmission.

== Interface between spindle and crankset ==

As well as the different means to fit the bottom bracket into the frame, there are a number of ways of connecting the crank arms to the bottom bracket spindle. Shimano introduced a proprietary splined interface named &quot;Octalink&quot;. Several other manufacturers (King Cycle Group, Truvativ, and Race Face) created an &quot;open&quot; standard called &quot;ISIS Drive&quot; or simply &quot;ISIS&quot;, for International Splined Interface Standard.

===Cottered===
One of the earliest standards of crank interface, &#x27;cottered cranks are now considered obsolete in developed countries, but are still in common use in developing nations. The spindle is a cylinder and has a flat region across it (a land). The crank has a hole through it to fit onto the spindle, with a transverse hole for the cotter pin. The cotter pin is cylindrical with one side flattened at an angle to form a wedge to match the spindle land. When tightened, this produces a simple and effective interface. The problem is that normally the interface cannot be tightened enough without a cotter pin press, a highly specialized type of clamping tool, though still produced and for sale. Cotters can also be installed with an improvised tool designed for another purpose, such as a ball joint splitter or hammer, with mixed results.

All the load is on one very small area of the cotter pin and the crank land, the cotter pin deforms plastically under normal use and must therefore be replaced regularly. If this is not done the crank and the spindle wear and must be replaced. The rider will get a warning through a characteristic creak sound that aging pins cause the cranks to make.

===Square taper===

Previously referred to as &#x27;cotterless&#x27;, since this was the design that was introduced after cottered spindles, square taper was once the most popular (and only) style &#x27;cotterless&#x27; crank. This interface consists of a spindle with square tapered ends that fit into square tapered holes in each crank. It is still manufactured in great numbers for bicycles and maintains popularity for such applications as bicycles.

Not all square taper crank and bottom bracket combinations are compatible. Although nearly all spindles use a 2-degree taper, there are two competing standards, defined by the measurement across the flat at the end of the spindle. The JIS size is used by Shimano and most other Asian manufacturers. The ISO size is primarily used by Campagnolo and other European manufacturers, in addition to cranks that adhere to the Nihon Jitensha Shinkokai (NJS) keirin standards (Sugino 75). Some manufacturers make cranks and bottom brackets to both specifications.

Some square tapered bottom bracket axles are threaded at the ends and use nuts. Other square tapered bottom brackets are hollow, allowing for crank bolts to thread into the ends.

Titanium has been used in an effort to make bottom brackets lighter, but early attempts were not entirely successful. Several manufacturers have built bottom brackets with titanium spindles and alloy cups but their durability was lower than that of steel. Early Campagnolo Super Record titanium spindles (which were hollow) were replaced by a later version that used solid, nutted spindles for improved reliability.

In recent years Shimano has migrated much of their product line away from square taper to a spline attachment called Octalink and to external bearing types. In late 2006, Campagnolo announced that it was abandoning the square taper interface for double chainsets in favor of an outboard bearing design called Ultra-Torque, which uses a splined interface between spindle halves.

===Splined===
Several different competing standards for splined interfaces exist. The tool drive for installing and removing these bottom brackets is often also a spline, instead of drives for regular hand tools.

====Octalink====
The Octalink system uses a spindle with eight splines. The splines provide a contact area between crank and spindle for an interface. Octalink exists in the marketplace in two variants Octalink v1 and Octalink v2, and the two are not compatible with each other. The difference between the two can be seen by the depth of mounting grooves on the bottom bracket spindle. v1 spline grooves are 5 mm long, while v2 grooves are 9 mm long. Shimano 105, Ultegra 6500 and Dura Ace 7700 cranksets mate to v1 spindles, while later mountain bike designs use the deeper-grooved v2. The system is proprietary and protected by Shimano patents and license fees.

====ISIS Drive====
ISIS Drive, the International Splined Interface Standard, is a non-proprietary splined specification for the interface between a bicycle crankset and the bottom bracket spindle. It was created by King Cycle Group, Truvativ, and Race Face. ISIS Drive is open source and free to the public to be used as seen fit.

====Other designs====
BMX 3-Piece bottom brackets typically use a spindle either 19 mm or 19.05 mm (3/4″), 22 mm or 22.2 mm (7/8″), or 24 mm in diameter. The majority of newer or Asian parts are made to metric round numbers, and mixes of metric and non-metric (e.g. 19 mm and 19.05 mm) spindles and bearings may not be compatible, and can result in stuck parts. In some cases, the spindles are splined and the number of splines depends on the manufacturer/model of the crankset, or in other cases, the spindle is specific to the crankset.

There are other designs in use that have varying degrees of popularity. One is Truvativ&#x27;s PowerSpline interface. It is a 12-spline spindle proprietary to Truvativ offered as a lower cost alternative to other spline designs. It is essentially a beefed-up square taper spindle with splines instead of tapers.

Phil Wood uses a similar splined design to the Shimano bottom bracket. The difference is an 18-tooth versus a 20-tooth as per the Shimano design.

== Bottom bracket shell sizes ==
Bottom brackets have several key size parameters: spindle length, shell width, and shell diameter.

===Shell width and spindle length===

There are a few standard shell widths (). Road bikes usually use ; Italian road bikes use ; Early model mountain bikes use . Later models (1995 and newer) use more commonly. Some downhill bikes even use an bottom bracket shell. Snow bikes use a shell.

Spindles come in a wider range of lengths (), and are sized to match not only the shell width but also the type of crankset it will support (longer for triple, shorter for single, etc.). Spindle length, along with the crank&#x27;s shape, determines the Q factor or tread.

===Shell diameters and threading===
There are a few standard shell diameters () with associated thread pitches around 1 mm (24–28 TPI).

Most (except for Italian and French) designs use right-hand (normal) threading for the left side and left-hand (reverse) threading for the right (drive) side. This is opposite of most pedal threading and is done for the same reason: to keep the bottom bracket cup from backing out of the bottom bracket shell due to precession. These have become rare to encounter on newer bikes. As of 2015, bikes with French bottom brackets were very rare to encounter, but there was still some aftermarket support for components. According to an article by Parktool from 2019, the French threading standard is &quot;considered obsolete&quot;. As of 2017, bikes with Italian bottom brackets were also rare to encounter, but aftermarket Italian bottom brackets were nonetheless still well-supported by many component manufacturers, including top-end kits from Shimano and Campagnolo.

With the development of external bearing designs, the standard shell diameter has become a considerable constraint, limiting both the diameter of the bottom bracket spindle and the size of the actual bearing balls in the races. Consequently, these external bearing designs can be less durable than older internal bearing designs. To address this problem several designers have promoted new standards for larger diameter bottom bracket shells, the best known of which is BB30 promoted by Cannondale. The name BB30 refers to the diameter of the spindle, not of the shell. Most of these larger diameter designs are using bearings that are pressed in. Since about 2015 there is now a T47 standard with a larger shell diameter and also threading. Some manufacturers (like Trek) are starting to implement this into their bicycles, while it is also possible to have threading cut into an existing 46 mm pressfit and have T47 cups fit in there.

==Bottom bracket height==

The bottom bracket height is the vertical distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the ground, and it expresses clearance of the frame over obstacles. The height of the bottom bracket is of concern when designing the frame. The height of the bottom bracket is the baseline for the rider&#x27;s height while riding. Combined with the length of the cranks, it determines the bicycle&#x27;s ground clearance.

A higher bottom bracket is useful for mountain bikes. In a fixed-gear bicycle, the bottom bracket should be high enough to prevent the pedals from coming in contact with the ground while cornering but is not always achieved.

A lower bottom bracket creates a lower center of gravity and allows for a larger frame without creating an uncomfortable standover height.

==Eccentric bottom brackets==
An eccentric is a cylindrical plug or bearing cup that fits into an enlarged bottom bracket shell. The plug is machined to accept a typical bottom bracket, but offset from the center of the plug, so that by rotating the plug, the location of the bottom bracket (and hence the chain tension) may be adjusted (fore and aft to tension the chain, the upper or lower eccentric position for a given chain length can be chosen to fine tune bottom bracket height). Once properly adjusted the plug is then fixed in place by a pair of set screws, a clamping bottom bracket shell, an expanding wedge in the plug, or the plug may be manufactured in left and right halves that clamp against the faces of the bottom bracket shell with screws that connect the two halves.

Eccentric bottom bracket shell inner diameters vary between manufacturers from 42mm-55mm (nominally).

Eccentrics are used in applications that require precise chain tension adjustment such as the timing chain of tandem bicycles, the chain that connects the stoker&#x27;s and captain&#x27;s cranks. They may also be employed on bicycles that do not have an adjustable rear wheel position, due to vertical dropouts or a rear disc brake, and that do not have an external rear derailleur such as single-speeds or bikes with an internal-geared hub.

== Compatibility issues ==
The bottom bracket shell and bottom bracket assembly as a whole have changed drastically as bike frames and part manufacturing continues to evolve. While the progression in technology has led to many new standards which is great for the consumer, it has proven to play a challenging role in frame design and aftermarket parts, as well as servicing and changing of parts. Around 2001, Shimano was manufacturing proprietary bottom bracket components with patents. Bike frame manufacturers would then create bikes with the patented bottom brackets as a guiding light around the shell area. This caused aftermarket brands to struggle in creating a bottom bracket that would fit into bikes that came with OEM Shimano parts. Companies such as RaceFace, Chris King, and Truvativ (SRAM Corporation) sat down in 1998 and collaborated on a standard bottom bracket specification. In August 2001, the ISIS Drive Standard was published and made into open source for anyone to create products using the designated specifications. Frame manufacturers took to the idea and created bikes that accepted the standard, allowing for a broader market. This success would prove to be short-lived due to failures and need for the industry to continue progressing and creating better specifications. Now in 2019, Shimano creates non-proprietary as well as proprietary bottom bracket designs such as HollowTech II and BBR60. Many &quot;non OEM&quot; part manufacturers have created bottom bracket conversion kits, giving consumers the ability to install crank sets designed for one standard into another (Example BB/PF30 cranks into a 22/24mm spindle).

<text>The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game (a.k.a. LOTR TCG) is an out-of-print collectible card game produced by Decipher, Inc. Released November 2001, it is based on Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy and the J. R. R. Tolkien novel on which the films were based. Decipher also had the rights to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; novel but did not release any cards based on it. In addition to images taken from the films, in 2004 Weta Workshop produced artwork depicting characters and items from the novel absent from the films for use on cards. In 2002, &quot;LOTR TCG&quot; won the Origins Awards for &quot;Best Trading Card Game of 2001&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game 2001&quot;. Decipher&#x27;s license to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; expired on July 30, 2007, after which all official promotion and distribution of the game stopped.

The game also had an online version that maintained identical gameplay as well as a market economy. However, since the game&#x27;s print run has ended, sales for online cards have been stopped and the servers closed in June 2010.

==Game concept==
&quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot; is a game for two or more players, each of who uses his or her own deck consisting of equal numbers of &quot;Free Peoples&quot; and &quot;Shadow&quot; cards, with a minimum of 30 of each. On a player&#x27;s turn they are considered to be the Free Peoples player and their Fellowship and Free Peoples cards both in their Support Area and on their characters are &quot;active&quot;. A player uses his Free Peoples cards to attempt to traverse the site-path and destroy the One Ring by reaching the ninth site. Each of his or her opponents, the Shadow Players, use their Shadow cards to prevent this by attempting to kill or corrupt the ring-bearer, or by forcing the Fellowship to slow down long enough for their Fellowship to race to victory. At the end of each turn the position of Free Peoples player rotates to the next player in turn. The game is won by the first Free Peoples player to survive to the ninth, and final, site or the last player whose Fellowship is left alive or when you corrupt the opposing fellowships ring-bearer.

An innovative mechanic called the &quot;twilight pool&quot; is used as a costing mechanism for cards. Each card has a numerical cost (which can be zero). When the Free Peoples player plays a card, tokens are added to the twilight pool equal to the cost of that card. The Shadow players, however, remove twilight tokens equal to the twilight cost of their cards in order to play their cards. Thus the more powerful cards the Fellowship the Free Peoples player plays, the greater the threat from the Shadow players. Each Free People and Shadow card belonged to a specific culture such as Gondor, Gollum or Isengard with cards within a culture complementing or even requiring one another, but players were free to construct their decks with a mix of cards from any culture.

Throughout a game, a player will play &quot;companions&quot; (or Free People characters) to help defend the ring-bearer. When it is his turn to play as the Shadow player, he then can play &quot;minions&quot; (or Shadow characters) to attack the opponent&#x27;s companions. The Free People&#x27;s player (the defender) has the opportunity to choose which of his companions will fight in one-to-one duels, called &quot;skirmishes&quot;, with the opponent&#x27;s minions. This is called &quot;assignment&quot;. Since the Free Peoples player wants to defend his ring-bearer, the only way a Shadow player can attack the Free Peoples player is by playing more minions than the Free Peoples player has companions, thus allowing the Shadow player to assign extra minions to any companion he chooses, including the ring-bearer, or by using minions whose game text allows the Shadow player to assign them to the ring-bearer. The character in a skirmish with less strength takes a wound, but if the total difference in strength is double or higher, the losing character is killed immediately instead. Other types of cards are &quot;possessions&quot; that character can bear to gain additional bonuses, &quot;conditions&quot; that retain their effect until they are discarded and &quot;events&quot;, which are discarded immediately after being used.

However, the Ring-bearer does not only face minions on his journey to destroy the Ring. The Ring-bearer has to resist the temptation of the Ring. In the trading card game, when the ring-bearer succumbs to the temptation of the Ring, &quot;burdens&quot; are added and most versions of the One Ring enable the Ring-bearer to take burdens instead of impending wounds. Each companion has a given resistance stat, and whenever a burden is added, each companion&#x27;s resistance is lowered by one. Once the ring-bearer&#x27;s resistance reaches zero, he is corrupted by the power of the ring and the player is eliminated from the game.

==Game sets and distribution==
When the game&#x27;s run had ended in mid-2007, nineteen sets in total had been released. Three of expansions (&quot;Expanded Middle-earth Deluxe Draft Box&quot;, &quot;The Wraith Collection&quot;, and &quot;Age&#x27;s End&quot;) were not available in booster packs.

===The movie years===
For the first three years the game&#x27;s releases followed the movies. A 365 &quot;base set&quot; was released each November containing material from the upcoming movie. These were followed by two 122 card expansions at four-month intervals. Each base set and the following two expansions formed a &quot;block&quot; named for that base set.

Cards were sold in eleven card booster packs consisting of one rare, three uncommon and seven common cards. In approximately one in six packs a common was replaced by a foiled version of a random card from that set. Each set also had two sixty-three card starter decks containing two copies of a promotional face card, three random rares and sixty fixed commons/uncommons (sets 5 and 6 had sixty card starters with three alternate image rares in place of the random rares).

Between the second and third expansions of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; block an extra set, &quot;Reflections&quot;, was released. This consisted of 52 new cards, all foiled, half of which were designated rare plus and half rare. The new cards took material from all three films and material produced by Weta specifically for the game and did not belong to any block. Reflections boosters contained two of the new cards (with one R+ every 2.4 packs) and sixteen repackaged random cards from the first six sets. One of these old cards was always non-English.

===&quot;Shadows&quot; and beyond===
In November 2004 the new base set, &quot;Shadows&quot;, marked an overhaul to the game. All sets would contain sixty rare, uncommon, and common cards each, in addition to a varying amount of fixed cards, only available in Starter Decks. Instead of foiling every card, each expansion would only have eighteen pre-selected rare foil cards that would be randomly inserted into one out of every seven booster packs. &quot;Shadows&quot; also had four, rather than two, different starter decks. The material used for the cards would also cover the entire trilogy instead of being tied to the films&#x27; releases.

Additionally, a system of rotation was announced to be introduced to the game. Starting in March 2005, the entire &quot;Fellowship&quot; block ceased to be legal for use in the Standard tournament format. Then, each November, the oldest block remaining would also be &quot;rotated out&quot;. Decipher claimed this helped keep the card pool down to a manageable size and would keep established players buying new cards. Detractors claimed it was a money grab and did not like being forced to purchase what they felt were inferior cards.

===Set list===
Where two dates are listed, the first date refers to starter decks and the second to booster packs:

# &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (November 6, 2001) - The first base set that introduced the core mechanics of the game. The cards were divided between [Dwarves], [Elves], [Gandalf], [Gondor] and [Shire] cultures on the Free People sides and [Isengard], [Moria], [Ringwraith] and [Sauron] cultures on the Shadow side. The set is notable for having the largest number of &quot;Ally&quot; type of cards, characters who did not travel with the Fellowship and only provided aid through special abilities. Each subsequent set would see increasingly fewer &quot;Ally&quot; cards released, until they were completely phased out. It was sold in 50-card starter decks and 11-card booster packs.
# &quot;Mines of Moria&quot; (March 6 &amp; 13, 2002) - The first game expansion introduces the &quot;Artifact&quot; type of cards, which functioned similarly to &quot;possessions&quot;, but did not suffer penalties from cards directly targeting them. This expansion significantly boosted the [Dwarves] and [Moria] faction, most notably featuring the Balrog, which posed a significant danger to the Free People at the unavoidable &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dûm&quot; site.
# &quot;Realms of the Elf-lords&quot; (June 19 &amp; July 3, 2002) - This set significantly boosted the [Elves] and [Isengard] cultures by adding a large number of Elven allies, introducing Isengard orcs in addition to the Uruk-hai and featuring the first playable versions of Saruman.
# &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (November 6, 2002) - The second base set brought the first significant overhaul of the game scene. The set contained no cards of [Moria], [Ringwraith] and [Sauron] cultures; instead new Shadow cultures of [Dunland] and [Raiders] (which combined the Southrons and the Easterlings) were added along with the [Rohan] Free People culture, and each culture now contained cards which could contain a number of that culture&#x27;s tokens. The site path from &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was completely replaced with the new sites from &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and sites could now be controlled by Shadow Players and liberated by the Free Peoples.
# &quot;Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep&quot; (March 12, 2003) - This set brought back the [Sauron] culture and also introduced the new [Gollum] culture, which reflecting the character&#x27;s duality consisted of both Free People and Shadow cards, which could alternatively reinforce or combat one another.
# &quot;Ents of Fangorn&quot; (July 2, 2003) - This set brought back the [Ringwraith] culture and introduced new versions of the Ents which were more pro-active in combat than the previous versions, which had specific requirements to be allowed to skirmish. It also contained new cards of the [Moria] culture, including a version of the Balrog who could be played on sites other than &quot;Underground&quot;.
# &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (November 5, 2003) - In addition to completely replacing the site path once again, the third base set added the new mechanics of &quot;threats&quot; (tokens that had to be assigned as wounds when a companion or ally was killed) and &quot;initiative&quot;, which either Free Peoples or Shadow player had based on the number of cards in their hands. This set contained no cards of [Dunland], [Isengard] and [Moria] cultures, but added Minas Morgul orcs to the previously Nazgûl-only [Ringwraith] culture.
# &quot;Siege of Gondor&quot; (March 10, 2004) - This set significantly boosted the [Raiders] culture by enhancing it with the Corsairs of Umbar and added the Dead Men of Dunharrow to the [Gondor] culture. It also introduces Shelob as the only other minion for the [Gollum] culture and featured characters with the powerful keyword &quot;enduring&quot;, who increased in strength after gaining each subsequent wound.
# &quot;Reflections&quot; (May 12, 2004) - Released in between two expansions of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; block, this special set was the most innovative at the time. Characters from the Prologue of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; such as Elendil and Gil-Galad were introduced for the first time and characters from the books that were absent from the movies such as Glorfindel and Tom Bombadil were added through the designs created by Weta Workshop specifically for the game. Most importantly, characters other than Frodo were allowed to be the Ringbearer for the first time, featuring versions of Galadriel, Boromir, Smeagol and others who could bear the One Ring instead. More alternative Ringbearers would be added in later sets.
# &quot;Mount Doom&quot; (July 14, 2004) - The final set of the &quot;movie&quot; release era introduced new powerful versions of several characters such as Éowyn, Arwen and Sam that would remain the preferred choices for many of the deck strategies.
# &quot;Shadows&quot; (November 3, 2004) - The release of the new &quot;base set&quot; saw the most significant overhaul of the game, which would remain to be seen unfavorably by many players. Existing faction-based Shadow cultures of [Dunland], [Isengard], [Moria], [Raiders] and [Sauron] were replaced with more generic [Orcs], [Uruk-Hai] and [Evil Men], leaving only [Ringwraith] and [Gollum] unchanged and making the majority of the old cards incompatible with the new cultures. Companions other than the Ring-Bearer now also had Resistance, which was affected by both Free People and Shadow cards. Most importantly, instead of a numbered site path based on an individual movie, the nine sites from all three films could now be played in any order and replaced continuously by both Free People and Shadow cards. While this allowed for new gameplay strategies, many felt that the core aspect of the game no longer made sense story-wise.
# &quot;Black Rider&quot; (March 18, 2005) - The first post-&quot;Shadows&quot; expansion was notable for reprinting many prominent cards from &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; block, which because of the recently introduced block rotation were no longer legal in the Standard tournament format.
# &quot;Bloodlines&quot; (August 12, 2005) - This set introduced the new &quot;Follower&quot; card type - minor characters who could provide their &quot;Aid&quot; to the Fellowship for a cost that must be paid each turn. It also included the only cards that could change their card type in the form of conditions that could turn into minions and back.
# &quot;Expanded Middle-earth Deluxe Draft Box&quot; (February 17, 2006) - Similar to &quot;Reflections&quot;, this 15-card set used artwork by Weta Workshop to represent characters from the books not included in the films, such as Halbarad, Grimbeorn and Dáin Ironfoot.
# &quot;The Hunters&quot; (June 9, 2006) - Released after a significant delay due to the financial problems experienced by Decipher, Inc., this new base set introduced a new powerful keyword &quot;Hunter&quot; and doubled the amount of available Followers.
# &quot;The Wraith Collection&quot; (August 26, 2006) - This Deluxe set had only six cards and consisted entirely of Minions of the [Ringwraith] culture, half of whom used artwork by Weta Workshop to represent the Barrow-wights.
# &quot;Rise of Saruman&quot; (March 1, 2007) - Released after another long delay, this set featured the only Free People character to be represented by more than one culture by introducing the [Rohan] version of Aragorn. It also contained no less than five different versions of Saruman, one for each culture, including the only Shadow follower in the game.
# &quot;Treachery and Deceit&quot; (May 2007) - Rushed to release before the impending expiration of the license, this set suffered from a lack of playtesting and contained the largest number of overpowered or &quot;broken&quot; cards, for which official errata had to be released almost immediately. This set also received the smallest printing of all and remains incredibly hard to find in circulation.
# &quot;Age&#x27;s End&quot; (June 2007) - Released mere weeks before Decipher&#x27;s license expired, this final &quot;farewell&quot; set consisted of 40 Promo-rarity cards available in a single Deluxe box. It featured the final versions of many prominent characters, some of which have been noted to be more powerful than any of those that came before.

In addition, a number of boutique products have been released:
*Oversized Cards (August 2001 - Summer 2003)
*Promotional Cards (Spring 2002 - Summer 2007)
*&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring Anthology&quot; (July 23, 2003)
*&quot;The Two Towers Anthology&quot; (February 25, 2004)
*&quot;The Return of the King Anthology&quot; (September 2004)
*&quot;The War of the Ring Anthology&quot; (September 2005)

The seven-month delay of &quot;The Hunters&quot; expansion release (from November 2005 to June 2006) made the game suffer a significant drop in popularity amongst its players as well as eventually force Decipher Inc. to remove the expansions &quot;The Great Eye&quot; and &quot;Shelob&#x27;s Lair&quot; from its intended expansion since Decipher&#x27;s license for &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; related material was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2007. Following the release of the final expansion &quot;Age&#x27;s End&quot; in June 2007 the game was discontinued and Decipher was forced to stop all production, distribution, and advertising.

==Deck strategies==
As the game expanded beyond the first base set, several basic deck strategies were identified and developed. As decks are separated into Shadow and Free People sides, the two sides are to some extent interchangeable, but the best decks usually contain some synergy between both types of cards. Later sets have introduced multiple additional keywords and mechanics and greatly increased the pool of available cards, massively expanding the possibilities for unique strategies, often depending on a specific card.

For the Free Peoples side, the common basic strategies are &quot;tank&quot;, &quot;choke&quot;, &quot;minion wounding&quot; and &quot;mass healing&quot;.

;Tank: Tank decks try to play as many companions as possible to combat the opponent&#x27;s Shadow side with force.
;Choke: Choke decks, the opposite of tank decks, try to put out as little twilight as possible, denying the opponent resources to play their minions, and clogging their hand with unplayable Shadow cards, thus hampering the set up of their Fellowship.
;Archery/Wounding: Minion wounding decks try to use &quot;archery fire&quot; and direct wounding to destroy the minions before they even have a chance to attack.
;Mass Healing: Mass healing decks rely on the cards that heal companions, with the expectation that if the Free People&#x27;s removal of wounds can out-pace the Shadow player&#x27;s placement of wounds, the Fellowship will be unkillable.

For the Shadow side, the common basic strategies are &quot;beat-down&quot;, &quot;swarm&quot;, &quot;bomb&quot;, &quot; companion wounding&quot; and &quot;corruption&quot;.

;Beat-down: Beat down decks focus on making one or two minions very powerful with big damage bonuses, with the intention of killing all of the companions one by one; eventually killing the ring-bearer.
;Swarm: Swarm decks have an opposite strategy of a beat-down: their goal is to play as many minions as possible as cheaply as possible. While one swarm minion might not be very powerful by itself, each minion is very cheap which allows many to be played, easily outnumbering the companions and assigning themselves to the Ring-bearer.
;Bomb: A bomb deck combines the strategies of both beat-down decks and swarm decks. Instead of focusing on one or two powerful minions, they play several minions of medium strength. The goal of a bomb deck is to destroy the weaker companions, and then swarm the Free Peoples player.
;Archery/Wounding: Archery and wounding decks rely on wounding companions outside of the skirmish so much that they die from their wounds. A variation of this strategy focuses on wounding the ring-bearer and killing him.
;Corruption: Corruption decks focus on adding enough burdens to corrupt the ring-bearer, or playing cards that require certain conditions to be met to corrupt the ring-bearer outright.

;Discard: Used by both Free People and Shadow sides, discard decks focus on discarding cards from either your opponent&#x27;s hand or their draw deck, disrupting their strategy and eventually leaving them with no cards to oppose you in later turns.

==Lord of the Rings Online TCG==
In 2003 Worlds Apart partnered with Decipher to produce an online version of the Lord of the Rings TCG. The online game&#x27;s rules matched the physical game&#x27;s rules, but utilized tradeable virtual cards that could be purchased through the system via starter decks, booster packs, or in draft. In addition to casual play, the online LOTR TCG system supported tournament play, league play, and sealed play including draft. The online system introduced a number of cards and formats that were online-only (for example, King-block draft packs), and offered players exclusive physical promotional cards and online avatars and movement tokens for participating in online events. The LOTR Online TCG software included collection management and robust deckbuilding features. For this reason alone many players have used the software to construct decks and print decklists.

In 2005 Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) bought Worlds Apart, but continued to support LOTR Online TCG. On May 22, 2007 SOE-Decipher announced the closure of all support for the Online gaming system. The LOTR Online TCG software was available and the SOE servers ran until June 30, 2010 when they were shut down for good, though no new cards could be purchased after May 2007.

Though not sanctioned or approved by Decipher, various alternate ways to play the game online have at various points been developed by players.

==Pro tour events==
In July 2002, the first pro tour event was held at Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio and it was won by John Lolli. 212 players participated in the event, and first place was $2,500. Christopher Schaut finished in 2nd place winning $1,000. Lolli used a unique deck designed to pass the ring from Frodo to Sam, and deny twilight to its opponent. Almost all of the top players were using later banned card called The Mirror of Galadriel, and Lolli used that strategy against his opponents designing a Minion half of the deck to counteract it.

==Organized play==

=== 2007 World Championship controversy ===

There has been much debate as to the legitimacy of the 2007 World Champions (Vince Accetturo &amp; Chris Thompson). Since the rights to produce the Lord of the Rings TCG was not renewed by Decipher, there was no legal way for the company to promote a World Championship, but they did still hold an unofficial event where the 2007 World Champions were crowned. The event was still held in Indianapolis, IN at GenCon on Friday, August 17, 2007 at 11:00 AM. The field was bested by Vince Accetturo and Chris Thompson, both members of the player group Team Bison Bucks. They decided to split the championship in the finals.

=== 2010 World Championship ===

With no official governing body for the game existing for years after 2007, no official World Championships could be held. No group stepped up to attempt an unofficial World Championship event until 2010 when the Star Wars CCG Players Committee decided to run a de facto World Championship for Lord of the Rings at their annual Worlds Weekend event. Brian Fred was crowned champion as the only undefeated player at the event, in which close to 20 players participated.

=== 2023 World Championship ===
With the establishment of the Player&#x27;s Council in 2020 (see below), an organization finally existed that could claim the right to once again crown a World Champion. In 2023 the first all-digital World Championship was held on the Gemp platform over weekends in October of that year. 30 players competed worldwide, ultimately leading to basmelis being declared the World Champion, with the runner-up thefaker being dubbed the World Challenger.

== The Player&#x27;s Council ==
On May 22, 2007, Decipher announced that the game&#x27;s official lifetime would be expiring later that year, with no further product to be produced or sold after the end of June 2007. Fans were eager to establish a &quot;Players Committee&quot; to continue managing the game (which would mirror the official group established for the Star Wars CCG or the unofficial one made by fans for the Star Trek CCG), but that conflict over whether to pursue an &quot;official&quot; or &quot;unofficial&quot; avenue stymied every attempt to organize for many years.

The mass quarantines during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a resurgence of interest in the game (as it did for many others during that time), and riding that wave a group in the &quot;unofficial&quot; camp finally overcame the historical friction and organized under the name of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Council&quot; in 2020. The PC quickly subsumed the various scattered community websites dedicated to the LOTR-TCG, and took on the upkeep and maintenance of the card database, the dedicated wiki, and other tools and platforms.

In 2023, the PC ran the first World Championship in 13 years on the digital platform Gemp, crowning basmelis as the new World Champion.

<text>The George Medal (GM), instituted on 24 September 1940 by King George VI, is a decoration of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, awarded for gallantry, typically by civilians, or in circumstances where military honours are not appropriate.

==History==
In 1940, at the height of the Blitz, there was a strong desire to reward many acts of civilian courage. Existing awards open to civilians were not considered suitable to meet the new situation, so the George Cross and the George Medal were instituted to recognise civilian gallantry in the face of enemy bombing, and brave deeds more generally.

Announcing the new awards, the King said

The warrant for the GM (along with that of the GC), dated 24 January 1941, was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 31 January 1941.

==Criteria==
The medal is granted in recognition of &quot;acts of great bravery&quot;. The original warrant for the George Medal did not explicitly permit it to be awarded posthumously. The position was clarified in December 1977 expressly to allow posthumous awards, several of which have subsequently been made.

The medal is primarily a civilian award, but it may be awarded to military personnel for gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy. As the warrant states:

Recipients are entitled to the post-nominal letters &quot;GM&quot;.

Bars to the GM may be awarded in recognition of further acts of bravery meriting the award. In undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to indicate each bar.

Details of all awards to British and Commonwealth recipients are published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. Approximately 2,122 medals have been awarded since inception in 1940, with 27 second-award bars.

==Description==
The GM is a circular silver medal in diameter, with the ribbon suspended from a ring. It has the following design.

The obverse depicts the crowned effigy of the reigning monarch, using the designs of Percy Metcalfe (George VI) and Cecil Thomas (Elizabeth II) To date, there have been four types:
The reverse shows Saint George on horseback slaying the dragon on the coast of England, with the legend around the top edge of the medal.

The medal was designed by George Kruger Gray based on a bookplate designed by Stephen Gooden for the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.

The ribbon is wide, crimson with five narrow blue stripes. The blue colour is taken from the George Cross ribbon. The medal is worn on the left chest by men; women not in uniform wear the medal on the left shoulder, with the ribbon fashioned into a bow.

The name of the recipient is engraved on the rim of the medal, although some Army awards have impressed naming.

==Recipients==

The first recipients, listed in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 30 September 1940, were Chief Officer Ernest Herbert Harmer and Second Officer Cyril William Arthur Brown of the Dover Fire Brigade, and Section Officer Alexander Edmund Campbell of the Dover Auxiliary Fire Service, who on 29 July had volunteered to return to a ship loaded with explosives in Dover Harbour to fight fires aboard while an air raid was in progress. Seven other people were also awarded the medal, including the first women; Ambulance Driver Dorothy Clarke and Ambulance Attendant Bessie Jane Hepburn of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, for rescuing a man badly injured in an explosion.

The first recipient chronologically was Coxswain Robert Cross, commander of the RNLI lifeboat &quot;City of Bradford&quot;, based at Spurn Point, whose award was gazetted on 7 February 1941. It was awarded for an incident on 2 February 1940 when Cross took the lifeboat out in gale force winds, snow squalls, and very rough seas to rescue the crew of a steam trawler.

The youngest recipient was Charity Anne Bick, who lied about her age to join the ARP service at 14 years old, and who delivered several messages by bicycle during a heavy air raid in West Bromwich in late 1940. The youngest male was 14 year old schoolboy Brian Gibbons who saved his infant nephew when his house caught fire following the 1958 Independent Air Travel Vickers Viking crash in Southall in 1959.

The first person to receive a second award was George Samuel Sewell, an engineer working for Shell-Mex and BP Ltd., based at the oil terminal at Salt End, near Hull, for his actions during an air raid. Having been one of the first recipients (in September 1940) his bar to the George Medal was gazetted on 4 July 1941.

The year 2015 included the 75th anniversary of the creation of the award, and was marked by a ceremony in London.

<doc id="397398" wikidata="Q592078" url="?curid=397398" title="The Bourne Identity (novel)">
<text>The Bourne Identity is a 1980 spy fiction thriller novel by Robert Ludlum that tells the story of Jason Bourne, a man with remarkable survival abilities who has retrograde amnesia, and must seek to discover his true identity. In the process, he must also determine why several shadowy groups, a professional assassin, and the CIA want him dead. It is the first novel of the original Bourne Trilogy, which also includes &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;.

Peter Cannon of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; named &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carré&#x27;s &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;.

The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente, and Chris Cooper.

==Plot==
The preface of the novel consists of two real-life newspaper articles from 1975 about terrorist Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, known as &quot;Carlos the Jackal.&quot;

The story opens with gunfire on a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. One man is cast into the waves before the boat explodes, and is later picked up by fishermen, who find him clinging to debris. They also find he has amnesia, apparently as a result of a traumatic head injury, with occasional erratic intrusions or flashbacks to the past, but is unable to make sense of them. The only definite evidence of his former life is a small film negative found embedded in his hip containing the information required to access a bank account in Zurich.

After being nursed back to health by a local doctor, he goes to Zurich to gain access to the bank, where a clerk recognizes him. The man determines that his name is &quot;Jason Charles Bourne&quot;, that he has relations with a firm called Treadstone Seventy-One Corporation, and that his account holds 7.5 million Swiss francs (equivalent to $5 million in the novel). Circumstantial evidence leads Bourne to suspect that he should go to Paris, so he wires most of the money there. At the bank and his hotel, men try to kill Bourne, so he quickly takes another hotel guest, Canadian government economist Marie St. Jacques, as a hostage in order to escape. After escaping from Bourne, St. Jacques reports his whereabouts to men she thinks are police, but they turn out to be Bourne&#x27;s pursuers and professional killers who try to rape and kill her. When Bourne rescues her at the risk of his own life, St. Jacques decides to help him.

They head to Paris to find clues about Bourne&#x27;s past. Once in Paris, Bourne learns that his attackers&#x27; leader may be &quot;Carlos,&quot; who is described as the most dangerous terrorist of his time, responsible for numerous killings in many countries and well connected in the highest government circles. For reasons only partly comprehensible to himself, Bourne develops a compulsion to hunt Carlos. As the story develops, Bourne follows clues that bring him closer to Carlos, leading him to places such as a designer clothing store used as a relay for Carlos. Though Bourne twice briefly sees Carlos, he does not manage to catch or kill him. To his distress, Bourne also finds mounting evidence that he himself is a rival assassin called &quot;Cain&quot;. Meanwhile, he and St. Jacques fall in love. Marie tries to convince Bourne that he is not the killer he thinks he was. 

It turns out that Cain is an alias that had been assumed by Bourne to hunt down Carlos; Cain took credit for kills as a way of challenging Carlos as part of a top-secret American plot. The plot is called Treadstone Seventy-One, and the truth is known only to eight men selected by covert agencies of the U.S. government; everyone else assumes Cain to be a real person. Due to Bourne&#x27;s six-month silence (while he was recuperating) and the unauthorized diversion of millions of dollars from the Zurich account, the Treadstone men start to believe that Bourne has become a traitor. They are entirely convinced of his guilt when Carlos has two of his operatives storm the building in which Treadstone is based and kill those inside, and then frame Bourne for the murders. The man now responsible for Treadstone, Alexander Conklin, attempts to lure Bourne into a meeting outside of Paris to kill him. Bourne escapes the trap, but does not succeed in proving his innocence.

In Paris, Bourne has managed to convince a French general named Villiers to help him. Bourne realizes that Villiers&#x27; wife is a mole for Carlos. When the General hears about it, he kills his wife, but Bourne takes the blame in order to bait Carlos into following him to the United States. Only after Bourne has left do St. Jacques and Villiers manage to convince Treadstone members that Bourne is innocent, and is continuing to hunt Carlos. In New York, Bourne is confronted by Carlos. They wound each other, but when Carlos is on the verge of killing Bourne, some of the remaining Treadstone members arrive at the scene and force Carlos to retreat.

The epilogue sees St. Jacques being told about Bourne&#x27;s past, most of which had been revealed in fragments already: He had been an American Foreign Service officer stationed in Asia during the Vietnam War as part of an operation codenamed Medusa. When his wife and two children were killed, he joined a paramilitary Special Forces unit in Vietnam. During a mission, he discovered and executed the double agent Jason Bourne. He took the name years later when he was recruited for Treadstone.

At the novel&#x27;s end, it is revealed that &quot;Bourne&quot; has recovered from the encounter with Carlos and presumably lives together with St. Jacques. He remains the only one to ever have seen the face of Carlos and may be able to recognize him, but is unable to do so due to his erratic memory. As a consequence, he is protected day and night by armed watchmen, in the hope he will one day recover enough to identify Carlos. The plot closes with him remembering his first name, David.

==Concept==
Robert Ludlum gave two interviews to Don Swaim of CBS: in 1984 and then two years later in 1986. Ludlum discusses how he came up with the first two novels in the Jason Bourne 
trilogy—&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. The idea behind the Bourne trilogy came after he had a bout of temporary amnesia. After his first book, &quot;The Scarlatti Inheritance&quot;, was published, he could not remember 12 hours of his life. This event, combined with thrilling real-life spy stories, inspired him to write the Jason Bourne trilogy.

==The name &quot;Bourne&quot;==
ABC News speculated that the name was actually &quot;most likely&quot; inspired by Ansel Bourne, a famous 19th-century psychology case due to his experience of a probable dissociative fugue. Ansel Bourne one day left his previous life and built himself a new life with a new profession elsewhere under a new name (&quot;A. J. Brown&quot;); after two months, he woke up with no memories of this new life, but with memories recovered up to this time and returned to his old life. The rare and controversial dissociative fugue has been described &quot;a state in which an individual has lost their identity&quot; by Harvard psychologist Daniel Schacter. &quot;They don&#x27;t know who they are, and they&#x27;ve lost all information about their past. They go on functioning automatically.&quot;

==Sequels==
Ludlum wrote two sequels to &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;: &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, forming the Bourne Trilogy. After Ludlum&#x27;s death, author Eric Van Lustbader continued the story of Jason Bourne in &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2004), &quot;The Bourne Betrayal&quot; (2007), &quot;The Bourne Sanction&quot; (2008), &quot;The Bourne Deception&quot; (2009), &quot;The Bourne Objective&quot; (2010), &quot;The Bourne Dominion&quot; (2011), &quot;The Bourne Imperative&quot; (2012), &quot;The Bourne Retribution&quot; (2013), &quot;The Bourne Ascendancy&quot; (2014), &quot;The Bourne Enigma&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Bourne Initiative&quot; (2017).

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted as &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, a 1988 television movie starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. The story was also partially adapted in the 1989 Tamil language film &quot;Vetri Vizha&quot; starring Kamal Haasan.

The 2002 film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper has largely modernized the material and is only very loosely based on the central premise of the novel.

<text>Joanne Kyger (November 19, 1934 – March 22, 2017) was an American poet. The author of over 30 books of poetry and prose, Kyger was associated with the poets of the San Francisco Renaissance, the Beat Generation, Black Mountain, and the New York School.

Although Kyger is often characterized as a prominent female Beat poet in the predominately male inner circle of Beat Generation writers, she never considered herself as belonging to the Beat movement. Nor did she formally identify with any other movement; her work invokes various schools of poetry without belonging to any of them. In &quot;Reconstructing the Beats&quot;, Amy L. Friedman calls Kyger &quot;an important link between several major axes of American poetry and writing in the twentieth century.&quot; Linda Russo, in the webzine Jacket&#x27;s edition devoted to Kyger, notes that &quot;there is no one way to talk about her work except as that of a singular individual.&quot;

Kyger&#x27;s early poetry was influenced by Charles Olson&#x27;s &quot;projective verse&quot; concept of letting breath and open construction, rather than rhyme and syntax, guide poetic composition. This influence continued to shape her mature work. In a 2010 interview Kyger says, &quot;You want to make it so that someone could say it. I try to &#x27;score&#x27; the lines for the page with that in mind, the breathing, the timing.&quot; Unlike Olson, notes Dale Smith in his essay &quot;Joanne Kyger and the Narrative of Every Day,&quot; Kyger &quot;focuses on events and happenings, moving herself out of the way as a kind of recording instrument . . . faithful to specific moments in time and attendant to the many spirits or moods of landscape.&quot; In a 2007 review of Kyger&#x27;s book &quot;About Now: Collected Poems&quot;, Lewis MacAdams describes Kyger as from the &quot;School of Backyard Poets, who look out their kitchen windows and see the universe.&quot;

Kyger&#x27;s poems emerged from a daily literary practice of recording thoughts, events, and dreams. Most of the poems are dated, either in the title or at the end. Much like journals, they include everything from philosophical musings to the weather. Themes—arising from her practice of Zen Buddhism, study of consciousness, explorations of ancient Greek and Native American mythologies, frequent travels to Mexico, observations of the natural landscape, and daily life in a small coastal town—continue from book to book, like installments in an autobiography. In a 2011 interview, Kyger says, &quot;I think of notebook writing like a practice—I try and do it whether I have anything good or bad or interesting to say. And the chronology becomes the narrative, a history of a writing &#x27;self.&#x27;&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Joanne Elizabeth Kyger was born on November 19, 1934, in Vallejo, California, to Jacob Kyger, a Navy captain, and Anne (Lamont) Kyger, a Santa Barbara, California, city employee of Canadian descent. Kyger moved often, living in China, California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, until the age of 14, when the family (including Kyger&#x27;s two sisters) settled in Santa Barbara. Her parents separated permanently in 1949.

Kyger&#x27;s first published poem appeared in her school&#x27;s literary magazine when she was five. At Santa Barbara High School, Kyger co-edited the features column of the school newspaper with Leland Hickman. In 1952, she enrolled at Santa Barbara College (later University of California, Santa Barbara), where she studied philosophy and literature and started the school&#x27;s first literary magazine. Renowned critic Hugh Kenner introduced her to the works of Modernist poets, such as W. B. Yeats and William Carlos Williams, while Paul Wienpahl introduced her to the works of Wittgenstein and Heidegger. In her 2015 notes from an earlier interview, Kyger recalls that the philosophers inspired her interest in Zen Buddhism: &quot;Heidegger had come to the study of &#x27;nothing.&#x27; Then I found D. T. Suzuki&#x27;s book on Japanese Zen and I thought, Oh! this is where you go with this mind. This &#x27;nothing&#x27; is really &#x27;something.&#x27;&quot; Kyger left the university in 1956, one freshman biology course short of a degree in philosophy and literature.

===San Francisco Renaissance and the Beats===

Kyger moved to San Francisco 1957 at the age of 22, where she met Richard Brautigan, who introduced her to City Lights Bookstore and the bohemian neighborhood of North Beach. Working in Brentano&#x27;s bookstore in the City of Paris department store by day and sharing her poetry at The Place bar by night, Kyger became a part of the literary scene and she was invited to join the Sunday Meetings where she read her poems aloud.

In 1958, Kyger met Gary Snyder, whom she would marry in 1960. Snyder introduced Kyger to Philip Whalen, and they became lifelong friends, sharing the sensibilities that defined their similar poetic styles. Kyger&#x27;s print debut, &quot;Tapestry #3,&quot; appeared in Spicer&#x27;s mimeographed magazine &quot;J&quot; No. 4 in 1959, and she gave her first public poetry reading on March 7, 1959, at the Beer and Wine Mission. During this period she moved to the East-West House, a communal center for those interested in Asian studies, and studied with Shunryū Suzuki Roshi at the Sokoji Temple in Japantown.

===Japan and India===
On January 30, 1960, Kyger left California by ship to join Snyder in Kyoto, Japan. Since Japanese customs frowned upon unmarried couples living together, they were married at the American Consulate in Kobe on February 23, three days after Kyger arrived in Japan, followed by a Zen marriage ceremony performed at Daitoku-ji in Kyoto five days later. While living in Japan, Kyger wrote poetry, studied Buddhism with Ruth Fuller Sasaki at Ryosen-an—the zendo of the First Zen Institute&#x27;s Kyoto branch, learned flower arranging, taught English, and acted in small roles in Japanese B movies.

In December 1961, Kyger and Snyder traveled to India with Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky. They met with the Dalai Lama in March 1962. The following month, Kyger and Snyder continued their travels in Singapore, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.

During this period, in addition to writing poems that would be included in her first book, Kyger recorded her travels in diaries, which were published in 1981 as &quot;The Japan and India Journals 1960–1964&quot;. The autobiographical text—which chronicles, in part, her growing frustration with Snyder&#x27;s expectations and Ginsberg&#x27;s antics—is considered an important document of the Beat era, offering a rare female perspective on the male-centric movement. In the foreword of the 2000 reissue of the book, Anne Waldman calls it &quot;one of the finest books ever in the genre of &#x27;journal writing&#x27;&quot; and &quot;a surprisingly (surreptitiously) feminist tract as well: woman artist struggles for identity and independence in the 1960s.&quot;

===Early successes===
In January 1964, Kyger left Snyder to his studies in Japan and returned alone, her marriage disintegrated, to San Francisco. She met painter and student of Buddhism Jack Boyce and married him in 1965 after divorcing Snyder. The same year, she participated in the Berkeley Poetry Conference, meeting poets Charles Olson and Ted Berrigan. She edited an edition of &quot;Wild Dog&quot; magazine, and &quot;The Tapestry and the Web&quot;, her first book of poems—with drawings by Boyce—was published.

The following year, Kyger and Boyce visited Europe and settled in New York City for a year.

In 1967, Kyger received a residency at the National Center for Experiments in Television in San Francisco. Drawing on Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, she translated the philosopher&#x27;s work into a poem-video titled &quot;Descartes and the Splendor of. A Real Drama of Everyday Life. In Six Parts.&quot; The video, Kyger&#x27;s only one, aired in November 1968. During this period, she met Carlos Castaneda and Michael Harner and discussed the illusions of a peyote vision she had in 1959.

===The Bolinas years===
At the end of the &#x27;60s, Kyger joined other poets following the back-to-the-land movement. In 1969 she settled in the small coastal town of Bolinas, California, with Jack Boyce. The community and the landscape of Bolinas would feature prominently in her work from that point on.

In 1970, she separated from Jack Boyce, and the following year, she bought a house on the Bolinas Mesa, which she shared with Peter Warshall. In 1971, she accompanied Warshall and a group of Harvard students to Puerto Rico to study a colony of rhesus monkeys, and embarked on a Carl Jung–inspired study of dreams that became &quot;Desecheo Notebook&quot;, published the same year. Kyger and Warshall also traveled to Chiapas, Mexico. Kyger&#x27;s &quot;All This Every Day&quot;, was written at that time and published in 1975, the year her relationship with Warshall ended.

In the mid-70s, she began teaching occasionally at the New College of California, an activity she continued until 2001. In 1977, she also became a regular teacher in the summer writing program at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. There she met Canadian-American writer, artist, and naturalist Donald Guravich, who would become her lifelong partner and collaborator. He joined her permanently in Bolinas in 1978 and they were married in 2013. They lived in Bolinas until her death in 2017.

===Mexico===
Beginning in the mid-80s and continuing for almost three decades, Kyger and Guravich frequently traveled to Mexico, often to Oaxaca, but also to Quintana Roo, Yucatán, Chiapis, Patzcuaro, Michoacan and Veracruz. These trips provided inspiration for several volumes of Kyger&#x27;s poetry, including &quot;Phenomenological&quot;, an edition in the series A Curriculum of the Soul that explores the nature of consciousness.

===Later life and death===
Kyger became the Wednesday editor of the &quot;Bolinas Hearsay News&quot; in 1984, a post she held for over 20 years. During this period, she continued teaching occasionally at Naropa University and the New College, as well as teaching at Mills College and offering writing classes in Bolinas. In 2000, her 1981 collection of autobiographical writings was reissued as &quot;Strange Big Moon: Japan and India Journals, 1960–1964&quot;. More recent poetry collections include&quot; Again: Poems 1989–2000&quot;, &quot;As Ever: Selected Poems&quot;, &quot;The Distressed Look&quot;, and&quot; God Never Dies&quot;. In 2006 she was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. &quot;About Now: Collected Poems&quot; was published in 2007 by the National Poetry Foundation and received the 2008 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles National Literary Award for Poetry. &quot;On Time: Poems 2005–2014&quot;, one of her last book of poems, was published by City Lights in 2015. Kyger describes her work in her 2005 artist statement: 
Buddhism Without A Book

Joanne Kyger was not just a student of Zen Buddhism, but an advocate for the simpler, calmer way of life it practiced. Though she often took hallucinogenic medication to achieve such a state, she only encouraged others to search for serenity of mind, body, and soul. Per definition, &quot;Zen meditation, is a way of vigilance and self-discovery which is practiced while sitting on a meditation cushion. It is the experience of living from moment to moment, in the here and now.&quot; She embraced this lifestyle completely as shown throughout her poetry, even in her later works. In &quot;Buddhism Without A Book,&quot; the speaker highlights how Buddhism is not just a religion but a state of being, which one can partake in even if they do not possess an instruction manual. As the speaker states, &quot;another person passed simplicity on to you,&quot; which suggests it is a lifestyle to be shared in hopes of helping those with &quot;fear and hate&quot; (2-3, 11). For those who are fearful of the proper way to meditate, she calms them with the reassurance that it is &quot;not perfect, but intimate;&quot; therefore, one does not need to have all the right yoga positions because all one needs is his/her &quot;mind&quot; (6,5). She does not want to pressure people into a philosophy, but rather a release from &quot;the futility of maintaining/ those troublesome states&quot; (8-9). This way of life is an antidote to a world of violence, hate, and hostility. All it takes is a moment to &quot;lift the corners of your mouth slightly/ and take three breaths&quot; to achieve a state of calm in a world in constant turmoil (12-3).  

Kyger died at age 82 on March 22, 2017, at her home in Bolinas, California, from lung cancer, in the company of her husband, Donald Guravich. Kyger had been working on a new book, &quot;There You Are: Interviews, Journals, and Ephemera&quot;. It was published in September 2017 by Wave Books. She was described by the San Francisco Gate as &quot;a leading poet of the San Francisco Renaissance and a rare female voice of the male-dominated Beat generation.&quot;

<text>The Honorable Order of the Blue Goose, International is a fraternal and charitable organization of men and women that work in the insurance industry. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred on April 18, sending shock waves through the insurance industry, threatening to destroy its entire existence. With this gloom hanging over the industry, the group was founded as a one-time joke to initiate three new unsuspecting insurance fieldmen into a fake lodge, the &quot;Ancient and Honorable Order of the Blue Goose&quot;, during the Wisconsin Fieldmen&#x27;s Meeting on the evening of June 19, 1906, at the Oakwood Hotel in Green Lake, Wisconsin, United States. The &quot;fake lodge&quot; soon grew to have thousands of members throughout the United States and Canada. International Headquarters are maintained near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States at the &quot;Wisconsin Home Nest&quot;.

== Organization ==

Local chapters are called &quot;Ponds&quot;. Each Pond has six officers: Most Loyal Gander, the president; Supervisor of the Flock, vice-president; Custodian of the Goslings, warden; Guardian of the Pond, door guard; Wielder of the Goose Quill, secretary; Keeper of the Golden Goose Egg, treasurer. Some Ponds are further split into &quot;Puddles&quot;, where there are multiple cities in each state or province, and at one time one Puddle even had a &quot;Pothole&quot;. A fledgling group was even started in Australia. Blue Goose is governed by the &quot;Grand Nest&quot;, with each Pond sending two delegates, and which then elects a group of officers, one each from each of the five regions.

Blue Goose has an annual &quot;Grand Nest Meeting&quot; of delegates, which is a Summer convention held at various locations throughout the United States and Canada, where its members (&quot;Ganders&quot;) and their families meet for fun and fellowship. There is usually a large class of new members (&quot;Goslings&quot;) initiated at that meeting.

== Membership ==

In 1922 there were reportedly 5,000 members of the Order. There were 10,000 members in 1989. As of June 22, 2013, membership stood at 3800 Ganders.

== Ritual ==

The &quot;Cardinal Principles&quot; of the order are &quot;Character, Charity&quot; and &quot;Fellowship&quot;. There is a secret &quot;key honk&quot; (password) and a secret &quot;salutation&quot; that have existed since the flight of the first Blue Goose on June 19, 1906.

== Philanthropy ==

The Order promotes fellowship among insurance professionals and charitable giving. Although the official international charity is Special Olympics, each Pond is free to support whatever local charitable endeavor they choose such as food donations, clothing drives, and donations of time and service to charitable causes. The International Charity Report for FY July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013, reports that the organization gave a reported $171,164.98 in cash donations to various charities. Some Ponds did not submit reports. Ponds also gave hundreds of man-hours to charitable endeavors, plus unknown quantities of donations-in-kind of books, clothing, food, games, toys, etc. Additionally, Ponds gave scholarships totaling $7,750.

== Grand Nest of the Blue Goose ==
There was also a splinter or imitation of the society, known as the Grand Nest of the Blue Goose, founded in 1906 and based in Kansas and Missouri. Like the mainstream Blue Goose its lodges were called &quot;Ponds&quot;. The chief officer was the &quot;Most Loyal Grand Gander&quot;, and other officers included the &quot;Grand Custodian of Goslings&quot;, &quot;Grand Guardian of the Nest&quot; and the &quot;Grand Keeper of the Golden Goose Egg&quot;.

<doc id="397424" wikidata="Q21587996" url="?curid=397424" title="The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)">
<text>The Three Bears are animated cartoon characters in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. The dysfunctional family consists of Henry &quot;Papa&quot; Bear, Mama Bear, and Junior Bear (sometimes spelled Junyer or Joonyer). The characters were featured in five theatrical cartoons released between 1944 and 1951, based on Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

==Characters==
*Papa Bear (also known as Henry Bear) is the father of Junior Bear and the husband of Mama Bear. Papa Bear is a loud-mouthed, short-tempered and stubborn bear. While Papa and Junior are the two who are constantly at each other&#x27;s hair, usually Junior is at the receiving end of Papa&#x27;s wrath and Papa will spontaneously become enraged, while Mama Bear always ended up mild-mannered and innocent, although she resorts to thwack Papa or Junior with a newspaper to keep the peace.
*Mama Bear is the mother of Junior Bear and the wife of Papa Bear. Mama Bear is a mild-mannered, long-suffering bear. When she tries to tell Henry something important, he usually tells her to &quot;shut up&quot; and refuses to listen. While she does not seem to show it, she has a great deal of affection for her husband and son.
*Junior Bear (sometimes spelled Junyer) is the child of Henry Bear and Mama Bear. Junior Bear is an oversized, good-natured, buffoon bear. He is 7-years-old, yet he is twice as tall as his parents, and has a heavy voice. He is very dim-witted, naïve, and childish, but has a good heart and is always in a good mood. He idolizes his father Henry, who is often abusive toward him. Junior wears a diaper.

==Appearance==
===First theatrical film===
Animator Chuck Jones introduced the trio in the 1944 cartoon &quot;Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears&quot;, in which Bugs Bunny invades the home of the three bears, and Mama Bear takes a fancy to him. In the short, Papa Bear tries to feed his starving family by having them act out their roles in the traditional fairy tale from which they derive their name. Unfortunately for them, when they were out of porridge, Mama substitutes carrot soup for it, and the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; they lure turns out to be Bugs. Purcell and Liepien, in &quot;Parallel Curriculum Units for Social Studies, Grades 6-12&quot;, recommended this film as part of the study of the sociological implications of humor; Steven Case, in &quot;Toons That Teach&quot;, also mines this work for pedagogic value.

===Further theatrical appearances===
Jones brought back the Bears for his 1948 cartoon &quot;What&#x27;s Brewin&#x27;, Bruin?&quot;, this time without Bugs. Here, Papa Bear decides that it is time for the Bears to hibernate; however, various disturbances interfere. Junior&#x27;s voice is here supplied by Stan Freberg.

Other Three Bears cartoons included &quot;Bee-Deviled Bruin&quot; and &quot;Bear Feat&quot;, both released in 1949. The final Three Bears cartoon of the classic era, &quot;A Bear for Punishment&quot; (1951), parodies cultural values surrounding the celebration of Father&#x27;s Day.

===Film appearances===
The entire Bear Family appears in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; movie as tourists from Paris (Papa Bear is voiced by Will Ryan, Mama Bear by Joe Alaskey and Stan Freberg returns as the voice of Junior Bear).

The Three Bears make a cameo appearance in &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot; as Daffy&#x27;s employees.

The Three Bears make a cameo appearance in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; in Bugs Bunny&#x27;s flashback alongside other Looney Tunes leaving Tune World.

===Television appearances===
The Bear Family made several appearances in Warner Bros. 1990 animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, all in Season 1:

* &quot;Prom-ise Her Anything&quot;: Ma Bear cameos as a canteen cook at the ACME Looniversity junior prom.
* &quot;Bear Necessities&quot;, a short that was part of the episode &quot;Fairy Tales for the 90s&quot;. Framed as modern re-telling of &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, the episode is a satire on 1990s suburbia, where the Bears have moved to a modern home, complete with updated technology. Elmyra, a neighbor, enters the house after the Bears leave for a shopping trip to ACME Acres Mall. Elmyra goes through the requisite porridge sampling and trying out the various beds (eventually falling to sleep in Junior&#x27;s). When the Bears return, Elmyra instantly is smitten and smothers each of them – especially Pa – with over-affection. Eventually, the police are called, but the officers mistake the Bears as the trespassers and they are sent to the zoo to live ... which frustrates Papa but Junior likes.
* &quot;Teddy Bears Picnic&quot;, as part of &quot;The Acme Home Shopping Show&quot;. Once again, the Bears are teamed with Elmyra, who follows the family to a picnic and singing happily about the antics that follow. Junior tries to get Pa enthused about the various activities, but Pa gets the worst end of either Junior&#x27;s clumsiness or, more than once, the ire of a larger, muscular bear that doesn&#x27;t like or appreciate having his picnic interrupted by Pa. In the end, after Pa, Junior and the larger father bear get the worst end of a gas grill explosion, Junior lands on Elmyra, crushing her just seconds after she finishes her song.

The entire Bear Family appears in a painting on the bedroom wall in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;Nighty-Night Toon&quot;.

Papa Bear (listed in the credits as Vern) appears in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;Garage Sale of the Century&quot; (voiced by Ed Asner) as a bachelor, where he has a garage sale, swindling his customers out of their money, and refusing to give refunds, but the Warners took the expression too literally and wanted to buy his garage. Papa Bear refused to sell his garage, and after the Warners attempted to bargain with him and auction off his garage, he saw through their ruse, but his customers demanded refunds. Papa Bear attempted to lie about donating all of his &quot;profits&quot; to charity, but Wakko used his garage door opener (which he repaired after accidentally breaking it earlier) to expose his money, and his customers (including Batman, Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Dizzy Devil), and especially an old woman who he rudely refused her a refund (a penny) and threw into a tree earlier in the episode, got their refunds by force, leaving Papa Bear broke, and so he caved in and sold his garage to the Warners for 26¢ (even though the actual value was $20,000) as it was attached to his house.

The Three Bears appear in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; episode &quot;Ridiculous Journey&quot; from its second season (Papa Bear voiced by Maurice LaMarche, Mama Bear voiced by Grey DeLisle and Junior Bear voiced by John DiMaggio). They are seen driving on a vacation trip, with Junior frequently causing mishaps.

The Three Bears star in the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; episodes &quot;Moody at the Movies&quot; and &quot;Life&#x27;s a Beach&quot;, featuring their ill-fated trips to the theatre and the beach. The Bears also make a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;Happy Birthday Bugs Bunny!&quot;

The Three Bears appear in the &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; episode &quot;Honey Bunny&quot;. Here, while ill-fated and unlucky as usual, Henry is depicted without his short temper or abusive nature, due to the show being aimed towards preschoolers.

<doc id="397430" wikidata="Q4743973" url="?curid=397430" title="American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association">
<text>The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA, usually referred to as the Order of AHEPA) is a fraternal organization founded on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, Georgia. AHEPA was founded with a focus on civil rights, particularly to counteract the Ku Klux Klan. It is the largest and oldest grassroots association of American citizens of Greek heritage and Philhellenes with more than 400 chapters across the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe.

The mission of AHEPA is to promote the ancient Hellenic ideals of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family, and individual excellence through community service and volunteerism.

== History ==
The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA) fraternity was established in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 26, 1922. Its eight founders were residents of Atlanta who were of Greek descent, including Harry Angelopoulos, George Campbell, James Campbell, Nicholas D. Chotas, George A. Polos, Spiro J. Stamos, and James Vlass. Its initial mission was to promote the image of Greeks in America, assist them with citizenship and assimilation into American culture, and combat prejudice. At that meeting Chotas was elected its first president.

As Greek Americans assimilated into American society, AHEPA&#x27;s mission shifted toward e ancient Hellenic ideals of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family, and individual excellence through community service and volunteerism. AHEPA expanded to countries in Europe, including Austria, Belgium, Cypras, France, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

The mission of AHEPA is to promote the ancient Hellenic ideals of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family, and individual excellence through community service and volunteerism.

The AHEPA Family consists of four organizations: the AHEPA (men), Daughters of Penelope (women), Sons of Pericles (young men) and Maids of Athena (young women). AHEPA publishes &quot;The AHEPAN&quot;, which is the second largest Greek American publication in circulation. The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association also maintains ties with the similar Australasian Hellenic Educational Progressive Association.

== Symbols ==
The association&#x27;s colors are blue and white, based on the traditional colors of Greece. It also uses the color red.

== Membership ==

Originally, membership was restricted to only Greeks. At its third meeting, the Order decided to change this, allowing non-Greeks to join. In 1979, AHEPA had over 25,000 members in 400 chapters. By 1989, the number climbed to 60,000, despite an overall decline in memberships of fraternal groups during this period. An estimated 500,000 men have been inducted into the Order of AHEPA over its 90-year history.

== Governance ==

Originally, AHEPA was organized on a lodge system like that of the Masons or Oddfellows. Local units were called Subordinate Lodges and state or territory structures were called Superior Lodges. Today, it consists of the supreme lodge, districts, and chapters.

=== Supreme Lodge ===

The Supreme Lodge is the main governing body of the AHEPA. The Supreme Lodge is headquartered at 1909 Q St NW in Washington, D.C. It is elected at the Supreme Convention of the Order of AHEPA, a session including the majority of the organization&#x27;s members. It consist of the following officers:
* Supreme President
* Supreme Vice President
* Canadian President
* Supreme Secretary
* Supreme Treasurer
* Supreme Counselor
* Supreme Athletic Director
* National Sons of Pericles Advisor
* Supreme/Regional Governor (9) 

=== Chapters ===

Local groups of AHEPA are called chapters. The Supreme Lodge can charter a chapter to a group of at least ten men. The chapter&#x27;s main officer positions are president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, chaplain, warden, and captain of the Guard. There have been 540 chapters chartered in the United States, 16 chartered in Canada, 30 chartered in Greece, 5 chartered in Cyprus, and 10 chartered in Europe. Over 400 chapters are active in the United States, Canada, and Europe. There are &quot;sister&quot; chapters in AHEPA Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). 

===Districts===

Chapters are organized into 28 districts. Districts elect officers at annual district conventions, held in May, June, or July. District officers include district governor, lieutenant governor, district secretary, district treasurer, district marshal, district warden, and district athletic director. Current districts include:
== Activities ==

=== Politics ===
AHEPA has taken a stand on the Cyprus issue since 1955 when it formed the &quot;Justice for Cyprus&quot; committee to support Cyprus&#x27; independence. Through the decades, the organization has continued to advocate on issues relating to Greece and Cyprus in Washington, while also educating the public about these topics.

For each Congress, AHEPA compiles a Congressional scorecard on issues of importance to the American Hellenic community and the organization. The purpose of the scorecard is to educate AHEPA&#x27;s membership and the community on how engaged members of Congress are on these issues, or at the least, their level of awareness.

=== Awards ===
AHEPA recognizes distinguished achievements in various categories such as public service, government, law, business, journalism, science, the arts, military service, and humanitarian. Some of its awards include the Academy of Achievement Award, AHEPAN of the Year, and the Pericles Award.

<text>Francis Joseph Bough (; 15 January 1933 – 21 October 2020) was an English television presenter. He was best known as the host of BBC sports and current affairs shows including &quot;Grandstand&quot;, &quot;Nationwide&quot; and &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, which he launched alongside Selina Scott and Nick Ross.

Over his broadcasting career, Bough became known for his smooth, relaxed and professional approach to live broadcasts, once being described as &quot;the most unassailable performer on British television&quot;. In 1987, Michael Parkinson said, &quot;If my life depended on the smooth handling of a TV show, Bough would be my first choice to be in charge.&quot; In 1988, Bough was sacked by the BBC following revelations that he had taken cocaine and used prostitutes. He later presented programmes on London Weekend Television, ITV, Sky TV and on LBC radio in London before his retirement in 1998.

==Early life==
Francis Joseph Bough was born on 15 January 1933 at his parents&#x27; terraced house in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, son of Austin Joseph Bough (died 1963) and Annie Tyrer, née Moulton. The family later moved to Oswestry, Shropshire. His father was a furniture upholsterer and his mother painted pots in a pottery factory, and also made curtains and cushions.

After passing his eleven-plus exam, Bough was educated at Oswestry Boys&#x27; High School (a Shropshire County Council secular grammar school), and at Merton College, Oxford, where he studied history and was a soccer blue. He played football for the university against Cambridge, entered the employment of ICI at Billingham-on-Tees, and did his national service in the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, serving in West Germany. He first broadcast for British Forces Radio, commenting on an army cup game football match between two regiments.

==Career==
===BBC===
Bough joined the BBC as a presenter and reporter, presenting a new Newcastle upon Tyne-based show called &quot;Home at Six&quot;, soon renamed &quot;North at Six&quot; and then in 1963 becoming &quot;BBC Look North&quot;. Between 1964 and 1968, he was the presenter of &quot;Sportsview&quot; and in 1964 became the presenter of the &quot;BBC Sports Review of the Year&quot;, which he hosted for 18 years. Between 1968 and 1983, he was a regular host of the BBC&#x27;s flagship Saturday afternoon sports programme, &quot;Grandstand&quot;.

Bough was one of the BBC&#x27;s football commentators for the 1966 World Cup in England and covered the match at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough where North Korea defeated Italy 1–0, in a game regarded as one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. Bough went on to present the early evening magazine programme &quot;Nationwide&quot;. This made him one of the most familiar faces on British television throughout the 1970s. For &quot;Nationwide&quot;, he covered the Watergate scandal that brought down President Nixon and, for both &quot;Nationwide&quot; and &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, he covered five UK general elections between 1974 and 1987 and four US presidential elections between 1972 and 1984.

Bough was twice a surprise guest on the &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; Christmas special, in 1977 performing a song and dance routine in a sailor&#x27;s outfit with other television personalities, including the film critic Barry Norman, the presenter Michael Aspel and the rugby league commentator Eddie Waring. The programme&#x27;s 21.3 million viewers remains one of the highest recorded viewing figures for UK Christmas viewing. Bough later said that he had to give Waring dancing lessons before the sketch, which was based on a comic version of the song &quot;There is Nothing Like a Dame&quot; from the musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;. The same year Bough received the Richard Dimbleby Award for outstanding contribution to factual television.

Bough was the main presenter of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1978 World Cup finals in Argentina.

Bough&#x27;s prominence increased in January 1983 when he became the first presenter of the BBC&#x27;s inaugural breakfast television programme, &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; along with Selina Scott and Nick Ross. Bough was chosen by Ron Neil for his experience of presenting three hours of live television every week on &quot;Grandstand&quot;. As fellow presenter Ross recounted:
None of us had remotely the experience of long, unscripted slabs of live TV that Frank had from his sports broadcasting. He brought a sense of serenity and reassurance. His unruffled composure made us feel this had all been done before, and on the first morning, as the last minutes ticked down to our opening transmission, when hearts were thumping and nerves were jangling, he clapped his hands and—addressing the producers and the technicians as much as Selina and me—gently and firmly said, &quot;Calm down.&quot; We did.

Scott later said that Bough would deliberately undermine her by interrupting mid-question and in other ways. When she attempted to complain she said that senior management simply was not interested. &quot;They seemed to have no emotional intelligence, and they let men like Frank Bough roam the BBC without any check on them.&quot; She said that there was a very sexist atmosphere at the BBC, &quot;this malevolence&quot;. The presenter Fern Britton found Bough equally difficult to work with. In her autobiography, published in 2008, she wrote early in their professional relationship, Bough asked her, &quot;Well, young lady, I wonder how long it will be before I&#x27;m having an affair with you.&quot; He was dismissive of Britton at pre-programme briefings: &quot;Oh, hers can wait. Now back to mine.&quot; Britton felt too junior to be able to complain.

Bough left breakfast television at the end of 1987 to concentrate on the &quot;Holiday&quot; programme where, having been a roving holidaymaker, he took over as the main presenter when Cliff Michelmore left the series in 1986.

In February 1989, Bough was hired by Sky News to present the &quot;Frank Bough Interview&quot; for Sky TV for two series. In September 1989, he also joined London Weekend Television where he fronted &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock Live&quot; until it was axed in summer 1992. In between his news duties he presented ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 1991 Rugby World Cup tournament.

===Sex and drugs scandal===
On 13 June 1988, Bough left the BBC for a rest before being sacked, after the &quot;News of the World&quot; reported he had taken cocaine and worn lingerie at parties involving prostitutes. The newspaper&#x27;s former deputy editor, Paul Connew, later said of the scandal, &quot;It caused a sensation at the time, given Bough&#x27;s public image as the squeaky clean front man of breakfast and sports television.&quot;

Roy Greenslade, professor of journalism at City University London, said that Bough made a &quot;terrible mistake&quot; by agreeing to speak to newspapers before publication of personal allegations, worsening the story.

In August 1992, Bough was reported to have been involved in a dungeon orgy. The press published photographs of him leaving the flat of a prostitute who specialised in sadomasochism. Bough later spoke of his regret over his actions, saying his behaviour had been &quot;exceedingly stupid&quot;. He said in a television interview, &quot;Everybody, when they have difficulties with their marriage or sexuality, surely has the right to sort out these things in the privacy of their own home.&quot; His role as a rugby presenter ended after this second scandal.

===Late career===
In 1993, after his activities were regularly ridiculed in monologues on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; by Angus Deayton (who himself was later dismissed from the show following cocaine and prostitute use), Bough agreed to appear as a guest on the programme. In the early 1990s, he was a presenter on LBC radio in London, staying on for the launch of London News Talk and moving to the News 97.3 service where he remained until 1996. He then presented &quot;Travel Live&quot; for the cable channel Travel.

In 2009, he contributed to a programme looking back on &quot;Nationwide&quot;, broadcast on BBC Four.

==Personal life and death==
Bough met Nesta Howells, a physiotherapist, while he was undertaking his national service in Park Hall camp at Oswestry, and they married after he left the army in 1959. They had three sons: David, Stephen and Andrew. Nesta stayed in the relationship after the exposés that affected Bough&#x27;s later career.

From 1994, he was a regular member of a Windsor-based choir, the Royal Free Singers. Bough had a liver transplant in 2001 after cancer was found, and later lived in retirement in Holyport, Berkshire.

A family friend said that Bough died on 21 October 2020, aged 87.

<text>William Nicolas Hutton (born 21 May 1950) is an English journalist. As of 2022, he writes a regular column for &quot;The Observer&quot;, co-chairs the Purposeful Company, and is the president-designate of the Academy of Social Sciences. He is the chair of the advisory board of the UK National Youth Corps. He was principal of Hertford College, University of Oxford from 2011 to 2020, and co-founder of the Big Innovation Centre, an initiative from the Work Foundation (formerly the Industrial Society), having been chief executive of the Work Foundation from 2000 to 2008. He was formerly editor-in-chief of &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==Early life==
Although born in Woolwich, where his father had worked at the Royal Ordnance factory (Royal Arsenal), Hutton began his education in Scotland. He went to Bishopton Primary School in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, then Paisley Grammar School when he was eight. His father moved to Bromley, then to Kent, and he attended Southborough Lane County Primary School in Petts Wood.

Hutton studied at Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School in Sidcup, where he was introduced to A level economics by a teacher, Garth Pinkney. He only got average marks at O-level but enjoyed the sixth form more, studying geography, history, and economics. He also organised the school tennis team. After studying sociology and economics at the University of Bristol, gaining a BSocSc (2.1), he started his career as an equity salesman for a brokerage firm, before leaving to study for an MBA at INSEAD at Fontainebleau near Paris.

==Career==
Hutton moved on to work in television and radio. He spent ten years with the BBC, including working as economics correspondent for &quot;Newsnight&quot; from 1983 to 1988, where he replaced Peter Hobday. He spent four years as editor-in-chief at &quot;The Observer&quot; and director of the Guardian National Newspapers, before joining the Industrial Society, now known as The Work Foundation, as chief executive in 2000. In 2010, he was criticised for his handling of the Industrial Society by a number of publications, including &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot;, for having used the company for campaigning purposes rather than focusing on it as a business enterprise. Under Hutton&#x27;s management, The Work Foundation became insolvent and was wound up. It was then sold to Lancaster University.

As well as a columnist, author, and chief executive, Hutton is a governor of the London School of Economics, a visiting professor at the University of Manchester Business School and the University of Bristol, a visiting fellow at Mansfield College, Oxford, a shareholder of the Scott Trust Limited, which owns the Guardian Media Group, rapporteur of the Kok Group, and a member of the Design Council&#x27;s Millennium Commission. In March 2011, he was appointed as Principal of Hertford College, Oxford, taking up the post later in the year and retiring in 2020. He sits on the European Advisory Board of Princeton University Press.

==Writing==
As an author, Hutton&#x27;s best-known and most influential works are &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot; (an economic and political look at Britain in the 1990s from a social democratic point of view) and &quot;The World We&#x27;re In&quot;, in which he expands his focus to include the relationship between the United States and Europe, emphasising cultural and social differences between the two blocs and analysing the UK as sitting between the two. In &quot;The World We&#x27;re In&quot;, Hutton argues that many viewpoints in this book are neo-Keynesian and that it is critical of short-termism, viewing stakeholder capitalism as an alternative.

Hutton&#x27;s book &quot;The Writing on the Wall&quot; was released in the UK in January 2007. The book examines Western concerns and responses to the rise of China and the emerging global division of labour, and argues that the Chinese economy is running up against a set of increasingly unsustainable contradictions that could have a damaging universal fallout. On 18 February 2007, Hutton was a featured guest on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Have Your Say&quot; programme, discussing the implications of China&#x27;s growth. The analysis in his books is characterised by a support for the European Union and its potential, alongside a disdain for what he calls American conservatism —defined, among other factors, as a certain attitude to markets, property, and the social contract. In 1992, he won the What the Papers Say award for Political Journalist of the Year. In 2003, he was made an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) by the University of Bristol.

In 2010, he published &quot;Them and Us: Changing Britain – Why We Need a Fair Society&quot;.

His latest book, &quot;How Good We Can Be: Ending the Mercenary Society and Building a Great Country&quot;, was published in 2015.

==Personal life==
Hutton married Jane Atkinson, the daughter of a neurosurgeon, in 1978, and lives in London. They have two daughters and a son. His wife, who died in 2016, was a director of a property development company called First Premise, based in Richmond upon Thames, which she founded in 1987. Hutton calls himself an agnostic.

<text>Christen Schiellerup Købke (26 May 1810 – 7 February 1848) was a Danish painter, and one of the best-known artists from the Golden Age of Danish Painting.
==Childhood and early training==
He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was one of 11 children born to Peter Berend Købke (1771–1843) and Cecilie Margrethe Petersen (1778–1867). In 1815 the family moved to Kastellet, a military fortification area in Copenhagen, where his father was head baker. At the age of 11 he suffered from a bout of rheumatic fever. He made many drawings during his convalescence and decided that he would become an artist.

In 1822 at 12 years of age he started his studies at Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi&quot;). He studied first in the drawing class of Christian August Lorentzen (1749–1828) and finally 4 years under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg (1783–1853) after Lorentzen&#x27;s death in 1828. Eckersberg stressed observance of nature, and Købke&#x27;s talent grew under Eckersberg&#x27;s disciplined training. Eckersberg&#x27;s influence is readily seen in Købke&#x27;s first mature work &quot;Parti af Århus Domkirke&quot; painted in 1829. The painting was purchased by the Art Union (&quot;Kunstforening&quot;) and is now in the collection of the National Art Museum (&quot;Statens Museum for Kunst&quot;).
He received the academy&#x27;s small silver medallion in 1831 and a large silver medallion in 1833.


==Early career==
He lived in Kastellet until 1833 and made many paintings of the area. His painting &quot;Gården ved bageriet i Kastellet&quot; (ca. 1832) hangs in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen.

In 1832 he shared a studio with his friend, landscape painter Frederik Hansen Sødring (1809–1862). He painted a portrait of Sødring which now hangs in the Hirschsprung Collection. In 1834 he moved, along with his parents, outside of Copenhagen&#x27;s fortifications near Sortedam Lake (&quot;Sortedamssøen&quot;). He painted many views overlooking the lake towards the city and the embankments surrounding the city. His work became larger, more monumental.

Like many of his contemporary artists he came under the influence of art historian Niels Lauritz Høyen (1798–1870), who promoted a nationalistic art. Høyen called for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other lands, such as Italy (which was at that time considered a requirement for an artist&#x27;s training). On a visit to Hillerød in 1835 he painted a romantic picture of Frederiksborg Palace, &quot;Frederiksborg Slot ved Aftenbelysning&quot; (1835).
At the end of 1837 he married Susanna Cecilie Krohn (1810–1849), and shortly afterwards painted a portrait of his young bride.

==Travel to Italy==
In 1838 he received a travel stipend from the academy, left his new wife and traveled via Dresden and Munich to Italy accompanied by decorative painter Georg Hilker (1807–1875). They arrived in Rome by year&#x27;s end where he met his brother-in-law, sculptor and medallionist, Frederik Christopher Krohn (1806–1883) and many other Danish artists. He traveled, along with Constantin Hansen (1804–1880) the following summer to Naples, Sorrento, Pompeii and Capri where he painted in the open air.


==Return to Denmark==

He returned home in 1840 with a large collection of sketches for later use and inspiration. Unfortunately, most of his later work with these Italian themes was uninspired, and they found little favor. Købke even considered at the time becoming a decorator, having participated in 1844–1845 in the decoration of the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, which is dedicated to the artistic works of neo-classicistical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770–1844).

Two years after his father died in 1843, the family sold the property outside Copenhagen, and Købke moved back into the city. His application for admission to the academy, which was accompanied by one of his failed Italian landscapes, was rejected in 1846. He died in 1848 of pneumonia, and is buried in Assistens Kirkegård.

==Aftermath==

Købke, a national romantic, painted portraits, landscapes and architectural paintings. Most of Købke&#x27;s portraits show friends, family members and fellow artists. He found most of his motifs in his immediate surroundings. Now he is recognized internationally for his well composed and harmonic paintings, for their coloristic qualities and for his sense of the everyday life. But in his lifetime he was almost forgotten, especially because of his early death and limited production. Despite his talent and the praise of various contemporaries, Købke had never been inundated with commissions.

Købke is recognized today as one of the most talented among Denmark&#x27;s Golden Age painters and the most internationally renowned Danish painter of his generation. The painterly interpretations he made of his surroundings stand as high points of the period.

His works are in the collections of not only Danish museums but also such international museums as the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh.

<text>Lysis ( ; from Greek &#x27;loosening&#x27;) is the breaking down of the membrane of a cell, often by viral, enzymic, or osmotic (that is, &quot;lytic&quot; ) mechanisms that compromise its integrity. A fluid containing the contents of lysed cells is called a &quot;lysate&quot;. In molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology laboratories, cell cultures may be subjected to lysis in the process of purifying their components, as in protein purification, DNA extraction, RNA extraction, or in purifying organelles. 

Many species of bacteria are subject to lysis by the enzyme lysozyme, found in animal saliva, egg white, and other secretions. Phage lytic enzymes (lysins) produced during bacteriophage infection are responsible for the ability of these viruses to lyse bacterial cells. Penicillin and related β-lactam antibiotics cause the death of bacteria through enzyme-mediated lysis that occurs after the drug causes the bacterium to form a defective cell wall. If the cell wall is completely lost and the penicillin was used on gram-positive bacteria, then the bacterium is referred to as a protoplast, but if penicillin was used on gram-negative bacteria, then it is called a spheroplast.

==Cytolysis==
Cytolysis occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to move into the cell.

Cytolysis can be prevented by several different mechanisms, including the contractile vacuole that exists in some paramecia, which rapidly pump water out of the cell. Cytolysis does not occur under normal conditions in plant cells because plant cells have a strong cell wall that contains the osmotic pressure, or turgor pressure, that would otherwise cause cytolysis to occur.

==Oncolysis==
Oncolysis is the destruction of neoplastic cells or of a tumour.

The term is also used to refer to the reduction of any swelling.

==Plasmolysis==
Plasmolysis is the contraction of cells within plants due to the loss of water through osmosis. In a hypertonic environment, the cell membrane peels off the cell wall and the vacuole collapses. These cells will eventually wilt and die unless the flow of water caused by osmosis can stop the contraction of the cell membrane.

==Immune response==
Erythrocytes&#x27; hemoglobin release free radicals in response to pathogens when lysed by them. This can damage the pathogens.

==Applications==

Cell lysis is used in laboratories to break open cells and purify or further study their contents. Lysis in the laboratory may be affected by enzymes or detergents or other chaotropic agents. Mechanical disruption of cell membranes, as by repeated freezing and thawing, sonication, pressure, or filtration may also be referred to as lysis. Many laboratory experiments are sensitive to the choice of lysis mechanism; often it is desirable to avoid mechanical shear forces that would denature or degrade sensitive macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA, and different types of detergents can yield different results. The unprocessed solution immediately after lysis but before any further extraction steps is often referred to as a &quot;crude lysate&quot;.

For example, lysis is used in western and Southern blotting to analyze the composition of specific proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids individually or as complexes. Depending on the detergent used, either all or some membranes are lysed. For example, if only the cell membrane is lysed then gradient centrifugation can be used to collect certain organelles. Lysis is also used for protein purification, DNA extraction, and RNA extraction.

==Methods==
Several methods for cell lysis exist, sometimes used in combination. Examples include liquid homogenization, freeze thawing, and physical disruption such as sonication, or the use of hypotonic solutions that cause osmotic swelling and eventual bursting of the cell. 

===Chemical lysis===
This method uses chemical disruption. It is the most popular and simple approach. Chemical lysis chemically deteriorates/solubilizes the proteins and lipids present within the membrane of targeted cells. Common lysis buffers contain sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Cell lysis is best done at a pH range of 11.5–12.5. Although simple, it is a slow process, taking anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.

===Acoustic lysis===
This method uses ultrasonic waves to generate areas of high and low pressure which causes cavitation and in turn, cell lysis. Though this method usually comes out clean, it fails to be cost effective and consistent. 

===Mechanical lysis===
This method uses physical penetration to pierce or cut a cell membrane.

===Enzymatic lysis===
This method uses enzymes such as lysozyme or proteases to disintegrate the cell membrane.

<text>Eygelshoven (, , Ripuarian: ) is a village, since 1982 part of the town of Kerkrade, in the southeast of the Netherlands, close to the German and Belgian borders.

It has two former coal mines, &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;Julia&quot;, which were named after the wives of the two owners. Both pits closed in 1974.
The local soccer club is also named after the former coal mines.

Eygelshoven has a small former church from the sixteenth century, which stands on top of a hill. In 1922, another church was built. Architect Alphons Boosten designed the new church. Plans to demolish the old church were abandoned in favour of a new use as a chapel and because of its historical worth.

A third Roman Catholic church was built in 1957, the Pastoor van Arskerk, which was torn down in 1994 when it became redundant.

The old mining village of Eygelshoven was a separate municipality until 1982, when after more than eight centuries it was merged with Kerkrade.

The dialect spoken in Eygelshoven is not the Ripuarian Kerkrade dialect, but a local East Limburgish variety called Egelzer plat. One of the biggest differences between the two is the pronunciation of the letter ; in Eygelshoven, it is pronounced as a voiced velar fricative, as in southern Standard Dutch, whereas in Kerkrade it is pronounced as a palatal approximant (as in Colognian), except after back vowels.

<doc id="397464" wikidata="Q460116" url="?curid=397464" title="Gheorghe Mureșan">
<text>Gheorghe Dumitru Mureșan (; born 14 February 1971), known as the Giant () is a Romanian-American former professional basketball player. At , he is one of the two tallest players to have played in the NBA.

==Early life==
Mureșan was born in Tritenii de Jos, Cluj County, Romania. Although his parents&#x27; heights were relatively typical, he grew to his remarkable height due to a pituitary gland disorder called gigantism.

==Professional career==
=== CS Universitatea Cluj-Napoca (1991–1992) ===
Mureșan played competitive basketball at Universitatea Cluj, becoming national champion in 1992.

=== Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez (1992–1993) ===
Mureșan played professionally in the French league with Pau-Orthez during the 1992–93 season and was an instant hit with fans, also managing to win the French League Cup.

=== Washington Bullets / Wizards (1993–1998) ===
Mureșan was selected by the NBA&#x27;s Washington Bullets in the 1993 NBA draft. He played in the NBA from 1993 to 2000 showing signs of a promising career that was derailed by injuries. His best season came in the 1995–1996 campaign, when he averaged 14.5 points per game.

Mureșan was named the NBA&#x27;s Most Improved Player for the 1995–96 season after averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.26 blocks per game while making a league-leading 58.4 percent of his field goals. He led in field goal percentage again the following season, with a 60.4% average. Overall, he holds career averages of 9.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 0.5 assists, 1.48 blocks per game and a .573 field goal percentage.

=== New Jersey Nets (1999–2000) ===
Mureșan joined the New Jersey Nets for the final 31 games of his NBA career.

=== Return to Pau-Orthez (2000–2001) ===
After ending his NBA career, Mureșan had another stint at Pau-Orthez where he won the French league before returning to the United States with his family. He normally wore number 77, in reference to his height.

On 11 March 2007, Mureșan played a game for the Maryland Nighthawks as part of the tallest lineup in the history of basketball. This was the only basketball game Mureșan played where he was not the tallest person on the court, as Sun Mingming is .

==Other work==
In 2004, Mureșan founded the Giant Basketball Academy (GBA), a program dedicated to teaching the proper fundamentals of basketball to boys and girls of all ages. The Academy is located in Ashburn, Virginia.

Mureșan is also part of the Washington Wizards marketing and public relations team, serving as an &quot;ambassador&quot; for the team.

Mureșan co-authored two young adult fitness and health books: &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Fitness Guide&quot; and &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Fitness Guide&quot;.

In 2013, Mureșan participated in the first annual 3v3 UMTTR (You Matter) Basketball Tournament to increase awareness, prevention and research of teen suicide, the leading cause of death among adults and children between the ages of 15 and 24.

=== Acting ===
Outside basketball, Mureșan has dabbled in acting, playing the title character in 1998 feature film &quot;My Giant&quot; starring comedian Billy Crystal. Mureșan also acted in the films &quot;Adventures of Serial Buddies&quot; (2011) and &quot;Manodrome&quot; (2023).

He appeared as a ventriloquist in the music video for Eminem&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;My Name Is&quot;. He has appeared in commercials for Snickers candy bars, and sports television network ESPN.

==Personal life==
Mureșan and his wife Liliana and sons George and Victor have resided in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, but they relocated to the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Since the 2016–2017 season, his oldest son, George, has played for the Georgetown University Hoyas as a walk-on forward. His younger son Victor joined the Hoyas as a walk-on in the 2020–2021 season. Victor is and .
