<text>The members of the family Percichthyidae are known as the temperate perches. They belong to the order Perciformes, the perch-like fishes.

The name Percichthyidae derives from the Latin &quot;perca&quot; for perch and Ancient Greek ἰχθύς, &quot;ichthys&quot; for fish.

== Evolution ==
Potential percichthyid fossil remains are known from the Early Paleocene of the El Molino Formation of Bolivia; these remains have been described as resembling those of the fossil &quot;Percichthys hondoensis&quot; from the Eocene of Argentina. One articulated specimen is known from the Paleocene portion of the formation, but other remains are known from the Maastrichtian beds of the formation, indicating that percichthyids could have potential Cretaceous origins. However, the condition of this material is unclear. Another fossil percichthyid, &quot;Percichthys lonquimayiensis&quot; from Chile, was initially dated to the Paleocene, but further studies have found it to be from the Miocene.

=== Classification ===
The temperate perches are closely related to the temperate basses of the family Moronidae, and older literature treats the latter as belonging to the family Percichthyidae. Australian freshwater percichthyids were once placed in the marine grouper family, Serranidae, and the two families are thought to be closely related.

Almost 40 species of percichthyids are now recognised, grouped in 11–12 genera. Most but not all are exclusively freshwater fishes. They are mainly found in Australia, but species are also found in southern South America (&quot;Percichthys&quot;).

More recently the Chinese perches have been classified in the separate family Sinipercidae while the genus &quot;Percilia&quot; has been found not to be closely related to either that family or the Percichthyidae and has been placed in its own monotypic family Perciliidae.

The following 8 genera are classified within the family Percichthyidae:

* &quot;Bostockia&quot; 
* &quot;Gadopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Guyu&quot; 
* &quot;Maccullochella&quot; 
* &quot;Macquaria&quot; 
* &quot;Nannatherina&quot; 
* &quot;Nannoperca&quot; 
* &quot;Percichthys&quot; 

Some workers have found that the genus &quot;Macquaria&quot; is polyphyletic and that the two catadromous species &quot;Macquaria colonorum&quot; and &quot;M. novemaculeata&quot; are not the closest relatives of the other two species in the genus and are placed in the genus &quot;Percalates&quot; in the monotypic family Percalatidae These authors also found that the Percichthyidae and the Percalatidae were part of one of three clades within a new order, the Centrarchiformes in the Percomorpha.

==Species==
Australia has the greatest number of percichthyid species, where they are represented by the Australian freshwater cods (&quot;Maccullochella&quot; spp.), which are Murray cod, Mary River cod, eastern freshwater cod, and trout cod, by the Australian freshwater blackfishes (&quot;Gadopsis&quot; spp.), which are river blackfish and two-spined blackfish, and by the Australian freshwater perches which are golden perch, Macquarie perch (&quot;Macquaria&quot; spp.), and Australian bass, and estuary perch (&quot;Percalates&quot; spp.).

Several other Australian freshwater species also sit within the family Percichthyidae, while research using mitochondrial DNA suggests the species of the family Nannopercidae are in reality percichthyids, as well. Australia is unique in having a freshwater fish fauna dominated by percichthyids and allied families/species. This in contrast to Europe and Asia, whose fish faunas are dominated by members of the Cyprinidae carp family. (Australia does not have a single naturally occurring cyprinid species; unfortunately, the illegal introduction of carp has now established the family&#x27;s presence in Australia.)

A single genus occurs outside Australia, &quot;Percichthys&quot; in southern South America.

A number of species are or have been important food species; some of these (e.g. the Murray cod, &quot;Maccullochella peelii peelii&quot;) have become threatened through overfishing and river regulation, while others are now farmed to some extent. Some smaller species (e.g. Balston&#x27;s pygmy perch, &quot;Nannatherina balstoni&quot;) are popular in aquaria.

The extremely rare Bloomfield River cod, &quot;Guyu wujalwujalensis&quot;, is only found in a short stretch of the Bloomfield River in north Queensland.

<text>G.E.V. (&quot;Ground Effect Vehicle&quot;) is a science fiction board wargame that simulates combat in the near future between armored hovercraft, supertanks and other futuristic weaponry. 

The game was designed by American game designer Steve Jackson as a sequel to his &quot;Ogre&quot; board game when he was working for Metagaming Concepts. When Jackson left Metagaming to form his own company, he took the rights to both &quot;G.E.V.&quot; and &quot;Ogre&quot; with him, and all subsequent editions have been produced by Steve Jackson Games. 

==Description==
&quot;G.E.V.&quot; is a two-player wargame set in the late 21st century that features GEVs as well as Ogres (large intelligent tanks), conventional tanks, infantry, and artillery. It developed as a sequel to &quot;Ogre&quot;, which had already featured GEVs as a secondary vehicle. GEVs were lightly-armed hovercraft that moved more quickly than the huge, lumbering Ogres. The new game expanded the GEV gameplay and gave scenarios fitted to a high-speed vehicle. A feature of the GEV gameplay was that the original move-fire turn sequence of typical combat games became a move-fire-move sequence, with GEVs allowed a second movement phase. This could be used for either hit-and-run attacks with a retreat phase out of range, or a charge emphasizing a high-speed advance, even without time to adequately defend.

===Components===
The game components of the original 1977 edition published by Metagames Concepts are:
* a map, printed on glossy paper
* 135 counters representing military units and machines
* a 22-page rulebook

===Scenarios===
Four scenarios are included with the game. All have a basic version for beginning players, an advanced version, and an &quot;Ogre&quot; version:
*Breakthrough: GEVs must try to break through a strong defended point
*Raid: The sequel to &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, as GEVs try to cause as much damage as possible before reinforcements can arrive.
*The Train: GEVs attack a supply train
* Ceasefire Collapse: Both sides races across a DMZ to capture as much land as possible.

===Movement===
Each piece has a movement factor which indicates the number of hexes it can move each turn, although certain types of terrain can penalize this. Most units are restricted to &quot;move &amp; shoot&quot; phases each turn (move phase first, then combat phase).

===Combat===
Attacks are resolved by comparing the attacking unit&#x27;s strength to the defending unit&#x27;s defense strength. Rules are also provided for overrun combat, spillover fire, and cover.

===Victory conditions===
Each scenario uses a points-based victory condition system.

==Publication history==
In 1977, Metagaming Concepts published &quot;Ogre&quot; and pioneered the microgame, a small, cheap and simple solitaire or two-player game, often with a science fiction or fantasy theme. &quot;Ogre&quot; was created by Steve Jackson, who then designed a sequel, &quot;G.E.V.&quot;, which was published by Metagaming as their 6th MicroGame in 1977.

When Jackson left Metagaming in 1982 over a dispute about some of his other games to found Steve Jackson Games (SJG), he took the rights to &quot;Ogre&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot; with him, and immediately published new editions of both games. He followed this with a number of popular sequels, including &quot;Shockwave&quot;,
&quot;Ogre Reinforcement Pack&quot;, and &quot;Ogre Battlefields&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Ogre&quot; was combined with &quot;G.E.V.&quot; as &quot;Ogre/G.E.V.&quot;, a single 5 3/8&quot; x 8 1/2&quot; box. The rules were combined into a single two-way booklet, with the rules for one game printed in one direction; the booklet was flipped over to see the other rules. 
==Reception==
In the inaugural issue of &quot;Ares&quot; (March 1980), David Ritchie commented that &quot;&quot;GEV&quot; is not as clean as &quot;Ogre&quot;, but probably has more replay value. There are some imaginative scenarios, including one involving an armored train.&quot; Ritchie concluded by giving the game a very good rating of 8 out of 9, saying, &quot;Possibly the best single micro game.&quot;

In Issue 30 of &quot;Phoenix&quot;, (March–April 1981), Michael Stoner thought it was a very quick-moving game, noting that in most scenarios, one player gains the upper hand within ten minutes of play. He concluded, &quot;It is not as much of a &#x27;fun&#x27; game as &quot;Ogre&quot; but is, rather, a realistic (and quite complex) game that tests your skill to the limit.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman thought that &quot;&quot;GEV&quot; suffers from the problem of all sequels: it&#x27;s hard to live up to the reputation created by the original. Since &quot;Ogre&quot; is one of the most remarkably successful games ever, &quot;GEV&quot; has a hard act to follow. It can be perhaps forgiven its small failures. As a game in its own right, it’s somewhat dull. Though the situation is hypothetical, the feel is exceptionally conventional. The battles could be lifted whole from [ Avalon Hill&#x27;s wargame] &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot;. Only when Ogres are added and the situation is reduced to the uncomplicated objectives of the earlier game does it come to life.&quot; Freeman concluded by give the game an Overall Evaluation of &quot;Good&quot;, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a good expansion kit, but only a fair game. If you have &quot;Ogre&quot; and like it, you&#x27;ll want this. If not, get &quot;Ogre&quot; first.&quot;

In Issue 27 of &quot;Simulacrum&quot;, Brian Train noted, &quot;Probably the high point of microgames. Small, fast and has a reasonable punch, just like the titular units.&quot;

<text>The Mariinsky Ballet () is the resident classical ballet company of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. 

Founded in the 18th century and originally known as the Imperial Russian Ballet, the Mariinsky Ballet is one of the world&#x27;s leading ballet companies. Internationally in some quarters, the Mariinsky Ballet continues to be known by its former Soviet name the Kirov Ballet. The Mariinsky Ballet is the parent company of the Vaganova Ballet Academy, a leading international ballet school.

==History==

The Mariinsky Ballet was founded in the 1740s, following the formation of the first Russian dance school in 1738.

The Imperial Theatre School, as it was originally known, was established on 4 May 1738, at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. It would become the predecessor of today&#x27;s Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet. The school&#x27;s founder director was the French ballet master and teacher Jean-Baptiste Landé and the purpose of creating the school was to train young dancers to form the first Russian ballet company.

As the Imperial Russian Ballet, the company premiered numerous ballets by choreographer Marius Petipa. A number of his ballets now form the basis of the traditional classical ballet repertoire, performed by ballet companies around the world, and often retaining much of Petipa&#x27;s choreography. These ballets include the original productions of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;La Bayadère&quot;, and &quot;Raymonda&quot;; and popular revivals of older ballets, including &quot;Coppélia&quot;, &quot;Giselle&quot;, and &quot;Le Corsaire&quot;. Petipa&#x27;s revival of the ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot; is perhaps his most famous work for the company. Originally choreographed by Julius Reisinger for the Bolshoi Theatre in 1877, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; was initially a critical and commercial failure. Petipa sought to revive the ballet with the blessing of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, but the composer died before the new ballet was created. Petipa consequently worked with his brother Modest Tchaikovsky, who significantly revised the story and rewrote the libretto to the version now commonly performed. The production was choreographed by Petipa and his collaborator Lev Ivanov. Premiering at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1895, the Petipa/Ivanov/Tchaikovsky production of Swan Lake was a success.
Following the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government decided that the ballet school and company were unwanted symbols of the tsarist regime and closed them both. The ballet company was the first to be re-established, becoming in 1920 known as the State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, with the school re-opening later as the Leningrad State Choreographic School, both in their previous locations.

After the assassination of prominent Soviet figure Sergey Kirov in 1934, the Ballet was renamed the Kirov Ballet in 1935, a name which is still sometimes incorrectly used. After the end of Communist rule, the ballet company and opera company were renamed for the theatre, becoming in 1992 the Mariinsky Ballet and Mariinsky Opera. Both companies are now run by the theatre itself.

==Today==

The Director of the Mariinsky Ballet is Yuri Fateyev.

<text>USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (SSBN-602), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States (1861–1865), the first being .

Her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine, on 1 November 1958. She was launched on 14 May 1960 sponsored by Mary L. Beckwith (great-granddaughter of President Abraham Lincoln), and commissioned on 8 March 1961 with Commander Leonard Erb commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Donald M. Miller commanding the Gold Crew.

==Atlantic operations==
&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; got underway on 20 March 1961 for shakedown and weapons testing at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and returned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 1 June for post-shakedown repairs. She left Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 17 July 1961 to return briefly to Cape Canaveral for further testing and then proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, for a final loadout. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; subsequently got underway on 28 August 1961 as a unit of SUBRON 14. She arrived at Holy Loch, Scotland, in October 1961. She underwent a refit alongside submarine tender during November 1961 and, upon its completion, commenced her first deterrent patrol.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; operated out of Holy Loch for the next four years. She alternated periods of upkeep at Holy Loch alongside &quot;Proteus&quot; or submarine tender with deterrent patrols from that port.

A highlight of this period occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was in the middle of a scheduled four-week upkeep period when she received orders to deploy. She departed in short order and successfully carried out a 65-day patrol.

On 13 October 1965, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; arrived at Groton, Connecticut, and entered the Electric Boat shipyard there on 25 October 1965 to begin an overhaul and refueling.

This work was completed on 3 June 1967, and &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; returned to her base at Holy Loch and resumed her schedule of deterrent patrols. She continued the pattern of alternating patrols with periods of upkeep alongside either submarine tender or submarine tender through 1972.

In early March 1972, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; departed for the United States and arrived at Naval Submarine Base New London at Groton, Connecticut, on 25 April 1972. She held two dependents&#x27; cruises before getting underway on 19 May for the United States West Coast to join the United States Pacific Fleet. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; made a brief visit to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, transited the Panama Canal on 1 June, sailed to Bangor, Washington, to offload her missiles, then pushed on to San Francisco. On 25 June 1972, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, to commence overhaul and refueling.

==Pacific operations==
The extensive overhaul was completed in December 1973. After shakedown in the areas around Puget Sound and San Diego &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 1 June 1974. She held tests and local operations at Cape Canaveral and Charleston, South Carolina. She retransitted the Panama Canal on 26 July 1974 and proceeded to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she arrived on 10 September 1974 to become part of CINCPAC Fleet and Squadron 15. She then continued on to her advanced base at Guam, arriving on 18 October 1974. She then began deterrent patrols in the Mariana Islands from Guam, which she carried out until 1978. She also participated in numerous tests and exercises. During this period, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; became the first ballistic missile submarine to have conducted 50 strategic deterrent patrols, completing her 50th in 1978.

==Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal==
&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; completed her last patrol in October 1979 and arrived at Bangor, Washington, on 30 October 1979 to commence offloading her missiles before beginning inactivation overhaul. Preparations for her retirement continued through 1980 and into 1981.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was decommissioned on 28 February 1981 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1982. She was disposed of through the Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 10 May 1994 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

Part of the sail from &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was used to replace the damaged sail on after its collision with &quot;Nissho Maru&quot;. This sail is on display at the Submarine Force Library and Museum, near Groton.

<doc id="407566" wikidata="Q2385299" url="?curid=407566" title="Vidna Obmana">
<text>Vidna Obmana (stylized vidnaObmana on many album covers) is a pseudonym used by Belgian composer and ambient musician Dirk Serries. The name &quot;Vidna Obmana&quot;, a phrase in Serbian, literally translates to &quot;optical illusion&quot; and was chosen by Serries because he felt it accurately described the music. Serries created music under the Vidna Obmana pseudonym from 1984 until 2007, when he officially retired the name. Most of his current work is released under the Fear Falls Burning pseudonym.

Vidna Obmana&#x27;s music has often been described as anamorphic and organic. He uses the techniques of looping and shaping harmonies, minimizing the configurations to a few notes.

Vidna Obmana has collaborated on several occasions with artists such as Asmus Tietchens, Brannan Lane, Capriolo Trifoglio, Diego Borotti, and Steve Roach. Some of these collaborations have become entire projects of their own, such as Continuum (collaboration with Bass Communion) and Principle of Silence (collaboration with Joris De Backer).

Vidna Obmana is often cited as one of the more notable dark ambient musicians.

<doc id="407574" wikidata="Q1136950" url="?curid=407574" title="Syncope (phonology)">
<text>In phonology, syncope (; from ) is the loss of one or more sounds from the interior of a word, especially the loss of an unstressed vowel. It is found in both synchronic and diachronic analyses of languages. Its opposite, whereby sounds are added, is epenthesis.

== Synchronic analysis ==
Synchronic analysis studies linguistic phenomena at one moment of a language&#x27;s history, usually the present, in contrast to diachronic analysis, which studies a language&#x27;s states and the patterns of change across a historical timeframe. In modern languages, syncope occurs in inflection, poetry, and informal speech.

=== Inflections ===
In languages such as Irish and Hebrew, the process of inflection can cause syncope:

Verbs:
* Irish: (to play) should become * (I play). However, the addition of the causes syncope and the second-last syllable vowel is lost so becomes .
* Hebrew: (katav), (he) wrote, becomes (katvu), (they) wrote, when the third-person plural ending (-u) is added. 
Nouns:
* Irish: (island) should become * in the genitive case. However, instead of *, road signs say, (the town of the island). Once again, there is the loss of the second .

If the present root form in Irish is the result of diachronic syncope, synchronic syncope for inflection is prevented.

=== As a poetic device ===
Sounds may be removed from the interior of a word as a rhetorical or poetic device: for embellishment or for the sake of the meter.

* Latin &gt; poetic (&quot;he had moved&quot;)
* English &quot;hastening&quot; &gt; poetic &quot;hast&#x27;ning&quot;
* English &quot;heaven&quot; &gt; poetic &quot;heav&#x27;n&quot;
* English &quot;over&quot; &gt; poetic &quot;o&#x27;er&quot;
* English &quot;ever&quot; &gt; poetic &quot;e&#x27;er&quot;, often confused with &quot;ere&quot; (&quot;before&quot;)

===Informal speech===
Various sorts of colloquial reductions might be called &quot;syncope&quot; or &quot;compression&quot;.

Contractions in English such as &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; are typically cases of syncope.

* English &quot;Australian&quot; &gt; colloquial &quot;Strine&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;did not&quot; &gt; &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;I would have&quot; &gt; &quot;I&#x27;d&#x27;ve&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;going to&quot; &gt; colloquial &quot;gonna&quot; (generally only when unstressed and when expressing intention rather than direction), pronounced or, before a vowel, 
*English &quot;library&quot; pronounced as (haplology)

== Diachronic analysis ==
In historical phonology, the term &quot;syncope&quot; is often limited to the loss of an unstressed vowel, in effect collapsing the syllable that contained it: trisyllabic Latin &quot;calidus&quot; (stress on first syllable) develops as bisyllabic &quot;caldo&quot; in several Romance languages.

=== Loss of any sound ===
* Old English &gt; &gt; Middle English &gt; Modern English &quot;lord&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;Worcester&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;Gloucester&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;Leicester&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;Towcester&quot;, pronounced 
* English &quot;Godmanchester&quot;, pronounced (archaic)

=== Loss of unstressed vowel ===
* Latin &gt; Italian &quot;hot&quot;
* Latin &gt; Italian &quot;eye&quot;
* Proto-Norse &gt; Old Norse &quot;arm&quot;
* Proto-Norse &gt; Old Norse &quot;books&quot;
* Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot; &gt; Old Norse &quot;heavens&quot;

A syncope rule has been identified in Tonkawa, an extinct American Indian language in which the second vowel of a word was deleted unless it was adjacent to a consonant cluster or a final consonant.

<text>Major Clifford Hugh Douglas, MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 – 29 September 1952), was a British engineer, economist and pioneer of the social credit economic reform movement.

==Education and engineering career==
C.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester, the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa (Hordern) Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railways and other institutions. He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry, he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating. He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), Deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. His second wife was Edith Mary Douglas, President of the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society.

==Social credit==
While he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I, Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, saying that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.

Troubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (&quot;delivery of goods and services&quot;, in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.

Douglas collected data from more than 100 large British businesses and found that all except those becoming bankrupt, spent less in salaries, wages and dividends than the value of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made. He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine &quot;English Review&quot; where he suggested: &quot;That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation&#x27;s goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.&quot; The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity. Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, &quot;Economic Democracy&quot; and &quot;Credit-Power and Democracy&quot;, followed in 1924 by &quot;Social Credit&quot;.

The basis of Douglas&#x27;s reform ideas was to free workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production, which became known as social credit. His proposal had two main elements: a national dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the &quot;just price&quot;, to forestall inflation. The just price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system. Douglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases, the just price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers can then buy as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas&#x27;s reform.

At the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta&#x27;s provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and the longer-lasting Social Credit Political League in New Zealand. Douglas also lectured on social credit in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Norway.

In 1923, he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee. In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of &quot;Social Credit&quot; made a reference to the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what &quot;is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
Douglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland. Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon&#x27;s trilogy &quot;A Scots Quair&quot;. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money&quot; (1936, p. 32). Douglas&#x27;s theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein&#x27;s first novel &quot;For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot; describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of social credit.

<text>Josef von Báky (23 March 1902, Zombor, Austria-Hungary – 28 July 1966, Munich, West Germany) was a Hungarian filmmaker. He was also known as &quot;Josef v. Baky&quot; and &quot;József Báky&quot;. He was born in the village of Zobor in the Kingdom of Hungary (today Zombor, Slovakia). He worked as an assistant to Géza von Bolváry.

He worked as director or producer on no less than 48 films. He died in Munich, Bavaria, West Germany.

Báky&#x27;s best known film is &quot;Münchhausen&quot;, which was released in 1943. It is a fantasy-comedy and is noted for how it avoids politics of its time. The film was ordered by Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels to celebrate the 25th anniversary of UFA and to compete with Hollywood productions.

<text>Adams is a town in northern Berkshire County, Massachusetts, United States. It is part of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 8,166 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Nathan Jones purchased the township of East Hoosac at auction in 1762 from the Province of Massachusetts Bay for £3,200. In 1778, the town was officially incorporated as Adams, named in honor of Samuel Adams, a revolutionary leader and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Much of the land had been subdivided into and lots. These were mostly farms with frontage on the Hoosic River, which over time would provide water power for woolen, cotton, lumber, and plastic mills.

First settled in 1745, North Adams was originally part of Adams until the town split in 1878. Although there has never been a town of South Adams, the name was used prior to 1878 to specify the southern part of the town that had long had two primary centers, and survives in the name of the South Adams Savings Bank, which was incorporated in 1869.

Early settlers in the 1760s included a group of Quakers, many of whom migrated together from Smithfield, Rhode Island. The Quaker civil rights leader, abolitionist, and suffragist Susan B. Anthony was born in 1820 in Adams, and her family lived there until she was six. They moved west into New York, and later moved again to western New York. Anthony&#x27;s childhood home has been preserved and is operated today as a museum.

The town&#x27;s population declined from 1810 to 1820 as farmers moved west for better soil. The War of 1812 had the unintended result of stimulating development of the textile industry in the United States because British textiles were no longer available. In 1814, the Adams South Village Cotton Manufacture Company opened. With the construction of a number of mills on the Hoosic River, the demand for labor increased greatly, and Adams&#x27; population more than doubled to 4,000 between 1820 and 1835. Growth in both halves of Adams also was stimulated by the opening of the Hoosac Tunnel in 1875. In the late 1800s, during the expansion of the cotton mills, four large brick buildings were constructed on Park Street: the P. J. Barrett Block, Jones Block, Armory Block, and the Mausert Block, opposite the Town Hall. They were used for retail stores and offices.

President William McKinley made two visits to the town, the second in 1897 to lay the cornerstone of the Adams Free Library. He was a friend of the Plunkett brothers (founders in 1889 of the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company), and of the textile industry generally. In 1903, the town honored the assassinated president by erecting a larger-than-life statue beside the library.

Berkshire Cotton later became a major part of Berkshire Hathaway; it continued to manufacture high-quality textiles through the mid-20th century. Its large factory in Adams was closed in 1958. Many textile jobs had moved South, as the industry relocated to states with lower wages and weak unions.

The mill town&#x27;s only major remaining mill, Specialty Minerals, mines and processes limestone for calcium carbonate. This is used in antacids and food supplements, as well as paper whiteners and other industrial purposes.

Since the late 20th century, the town has encouraged historic and destination tourism, part of a broader trend in the Berkshires. It has promoted its natural environment and outdoor activities, and its proximity to the galleries, museums and colleges of North Adams.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.33%, is water. The town lies along the valley surrounding the Hoosic River and its tributary brooks. Set between the Taconic Range to the west and the Hoosac Range of the Berkshires to the east, Adams includes the summit of Mount Greylock, elevation above sea level. The mountain, located within the state reservation of the same name, is the highest point in Massachusetts, a waypoint on the Appalachian Trail, and in the 19th century inspired writers including Herman Melville. The town also includes a corner of Savoy Mountain State Park.

Adams is bordered to the north by North Adams, to the east by Florida and Savoy, to the south by Savoy and Cheshire, and to the west by New Ashford and Williamstown.
=== Climate ===
In a typical year, temperatures fall below for 205 days per year. Annual precipitation is typically per year (high in the US) and snow covers the ground 77 days per year, or 21.1% of the year (the highest in the US).

<text>Hulk (also known as The Hulk) is a 2003 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Produced by Universal Pictures in association with Marvel Enterprises, Valhalla Motion Pictures, and Good Machine, and distributed by Universal, it was directed by Ang Lee and written by John Turman, James Schamus, and Michael France, from a story conceived by Schamus. The film stars Eric Bana as Bruce Banner and Hulk, alongside Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte. The film explores Bruce Banner&#x27;s origins. After a lab accident involving gamma radiation, he transforms into a giant green-skinned humanoid with superhuman strength known as the Hulk whenever stressed or emotionally provoked. The United States military pursues him, and he clashes with his biological father, who has dark plans for his son.

Development started in 1990. At one time, Joe Johnston and then Jonathan Hensleigh were to direct. Hensleigh, John Turman, Michael France, Zak Penn, J. J. Abrams, Michael Tolkin, David Hayter, and Scott Alexander &amp; Larry Karaszewski wrote more scripts before Ang Lee and James Schamus&#x27;s involvement. The project was filmed primarily in California from March to August 2002, mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area.

&quot;Hulk&quot; was released by Universal Pictures on June 20, 2003. The film grossed $245.4 million worldwide and received mixed reviews. A planned sequel which would have been released in May 2005 was repurposed as a reboot titled &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and released on June 13, 2008, as the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Plot==

At the end of the 1960s, David Banner is a genetics researcher for the government trying to improve human DNA and he experiments on himself. After his wife Edith gives birth to their son, Bruce Banner. David realizes Bruce inherited his mutant DNA and attempts to find a cure. In 1974, the government lead by David&#x27;s supervisor, Colonel Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross shuts down his research after learning of his dangerous experiments; in a fit of psychotic rage, David rigs Desert Base&#x27;s gamma reactor to explode as revenge. Believing he is dangerous, David tries to kill Bruce but accidentally murders Edith when she gets between them and tries to stop David; the trauma causes the subconscious suppression of Bruce&#x27;s early childhood memories. Ross arrests and sends David to a mental hospital, putting the 4-year-old Bruce into foster care. Mrs. Krenzler adopts him, and Bruce assumes the surname, growing up believing his birth parents are dead.

Thirty years later, Bruce is a brilliant scientist working at the Berkeley Lab with his ex-girlfriend and Ross&#x27;s estranged daughter, Betty Ross. Representing the private research company Atheon, the shady Glenn Talbot becomes interested in the scientists&#x27; nanomeds research to create regenerating soldiers for the military-industrial complex. David reappears as a janitor in the lab building to infiltrate Bruce&#x27;s life. The now-General Ross investigates, becoming concerned for Betty&#x27;s safety around Bruce.

Bruce saves a colleague named Harper from an accident with a malfunctioning gammasphere. Bruce awakens in a hospital bed and tells Betty he feels better than ever, but Betty cannot fathom his survival since the nanomeds killed everything else; unknown to them, the radiation merged with Bruce&#x27;s altered DNA. Later, David meets Bruce, revealing their relationship and hinting at Bruce&#x27;s mutation. He later uses samples of Bruce&#x27;s DNA for animal experimentation. At the lab, Bruce realizes that David is his father, triggering flashes of his repressed traumatic memories. Increasing rage from the realization activates his gamma-radiated DNA; he becomes the Hulk and demolishes the lab. Betty finds Bruce unconscious in his home the following day, who barely remembers the previous night. Ross arrives later to question Bruce and, after hours of interrogation, seizes the lab and places him under house arrest. Betty locates David and investigates him. David calls Bruce that night, revealing he mutated his three dogs and sent them to attack Betty, enraging Bruce. Bemoaning the lab&#x27;s destruction, Talbot attacks Bruce, who transforms and injures Talbot and Ross&#x27;s MPs. The Hulk finds Betty in her forest cabin, saves her from the dogs, and changes back.

Betty calls Ross the following day; the army tranquilizes and takes Bruce to Desert Base. Deeming him doomed to follow in David&#x27;s footsteps, Ross doubts helping Bruce, but Betty persuades Ross to let her try. David subjects himself to the nanomeds and gamma sphere, becoming able to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he touches. Talbot wrestles control from Ross, forcing Betty to return home. Seeking to profit from the Hulk&#x27;s power, Talbot fails to provoke Bruce and puts him in an isolation tank. David confronts Betty at her house, offering to surrender himself yet asking to speak to Bruce &quot;one last time.&quot; Talbot induces a nightmare from Bruce&#x27;s repressed memories and triggers a transformation. Following an unsuccessful attempt to take a sample of the Hulk, Talbot gets himself killed when he fires an explosive round that backfires; Ross resumes command. The Hulk escapes the base, battles the army in the desert, and leaps to San Francisco to find Betty. She convinces Ross to take her to the Hulk, returning Bruce to normal.

Bruce and David talk at a base in the city while Ross watches, threatening to incinerate them. David has descended into megalomania, wanting Bruce&#x27;s power to stabilize his unstable molecules so he may successfully destroy all his enemies. After Bruce refuses, David bites into a high-voltage cable when Ross powers it, absorbing the energy and mutating into a powerful electrical entity. Bruce becomes the Hulk and fights and overpowers him; they are presumed dead after Ross orders a Gamma Charge Bomb to end the battle. A year later, Ross constantly monitors Betty, as numerous Hulk sightings get reported, and reconciles with her. In exile in the Amazon Rainforest, Bruce is alive as a medical camp doctor. His camp gets overrun by soldiers who try to steal their supplies; after Bruce unsuccessfully warns their commander not to make him angry, the Hulk roars in rage.

==Cast==
* Eric Bana as Bruce Banner / Hulk:A gamma radiation research scientist. After exposure to elevated gamma radiation levels, he becomes an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated, and also has the ability to grow larger in size and become stronger when angered in his Hulk form. He is legally known as &quot;Bruce Krenzler&quot; throughout the film. Bana was cast in October 2001, signing for an additional two sequels. Ang Lee felt obliged to cast Bana upon seeing &quot;Chopper&quot; and first approached the actor in July 2001. Other actors heavily pursued the role. Bana was also in heavy contention for &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; but lost out to Nicolas Cage. Bana explained, &quot;I was obsessed with the TV show. I was never a huge comic book reader when I was a kid but was completely obsessed with the television show.&quot; It was widely reported Billy Crudup turned down the role. Johnny Depp and Steve Buscemi were reportedly under consideration for the lead. David Duchovny and Jeff Goldblum auditioned for the role. Edward Norton, who went on to play Bruce in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, expressed interest in the role but turned it down as he was disappointed with the script. Tom Cruise was also offered the role but he turned it down.
** Michael and David Kronenberg as young Bruce Banner
** Mike Erwin as teenage Bruce Banner
** Ang Lee provided the motion capture and voice acting of Hulk.
* Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross:Bruce&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and colleague, General Ross&#x27;s estranged daughter, and possibly the only one who can make the Hulk revert into Bruce. Director Ang Lee attracted Connelly to the role. &quot;He&#x27;s not talking about a guy running around in green tights and a glossy fun-filled movie for kids. He&#x27;s talking along the lines of tragedy and psychodrama. I find it interesting, the green monster of rage and greed, jealousy and fear in all of us.&quot;
** Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as young Betty Ross
* Sam Elliott as Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross:A four-star general and Betty&#x27;s estranged father. Ross was responsible for prohibiting David Banner from his lab work after learning of his dangerous experiments. Elliot said his performance was similar to his portrayal of Basil L. Plumley in &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;. Elliott accepted the role without reading the script, being excited to work with Ang Lee, and researched &quot;Hulk&quot; comic books for the part.
** Todd Tesen as young Thaddeus Ross
* Josh Lucas as Glenn Talbot:A ruthless and arrogant former soldier who has a history with Betty. He offers Bruce and Betty a chance to work for him at the research company Atheon and make self-healing super soldiers.
* Nick Nolte as David Banner:Bruce&#x27;s mentally unstable biological father who&#x27;s also a genetics research scientist. He spent several years locked away for causing a gamma reactor explosion and accidentally killing his wife, Edith. David eventually gains absorbing powers, reminiscent of the comic book character Absorbing Man, which first appeared in the film&#x27;s early scripts. At one point, he also becomes a towering creature composed of electricity, reminiscent of Zzzax, one of the Hulk&#x27;s enemies in the comic series. Nolte agreed to participate in the film when Lee described the project as a &quot;Greek tragedy.&quot;
** Paul Kersey as young David Banner
* Cara Buono as Edith Banner:Bruce&#x27;s biological mother, whom he cannot remember. She is heard but mostly appears in Bruce&#x27;s nightmares.
* Celia Weston as Mrs. Krenzler:Bruce&#x27;s adoptive mother, who cared for him after Edith&#x27;s death and David&#x27;s incarceration.
* Kevin Rankin as Harper:Bruce&#x27;s colleague, whom he saved from the gamma radiation.

Stan Lee, who co-created Hulk, and Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed the character in the 1970s series, make cameo appearances as security guards. Johnny Kastl and Daniel Dae Kim have small roles as soldiers.

==Production==
===Development===
====Jonathan Hensleigh====
Producers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd began developing &quot;Hulk&quot; in 1990, the same year of the airing of the final television film based on the 1970s TV series, &quot;The Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot;. They set the property up at Universal Pictures in 1992. Michael France and Stan Lee were invited into Universal&#x27;s offices in 1993, with France writing the script. Universal&#x27;s concept was to have the Hulk battle terrorists, an idea France disliked. John Turman, a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1994, getting Lee&#x27;s approval. Heavily influenced by the &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; issues, Turman wrote ten drafts and pitted the Hulk against General Ross, the military, and the Leader, also including Rick Jones and the atomic explosion origin from the comics along with Brian Banner as the explanation for Bruce&#x27;s inner anger. Universal had mixed feelings over Turman&#x27;s script, but future screenwriters would use many elements.

Hurd brought her husband Jonathan Hensleigh as co-producer the following year, and Universal hired Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) to create the Hulk with CGI. Universal was courting France once more to write the screenplay but changed when Joe Johnston became the director in April 1997. The studio wanted Hensleigh to rewrite the script due to his successful results on Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Jumanji&quot;. Universal fired France before he wrote a single page but gave him a buy-off. Johnston dropped out of directing in July 1997 in favor of &quot;October Sky&quot;, and Hensleigh convinced Universal to make the &quot;Hulk&quot; his directing debut. Universal brought Turman back a second time to write two more drafts. Zak Penn then rewrote it. His script featured a fight between the Hulk and a school of sharks, and two scenes he eventually used for the 2008 film: Banner realizing he cannot have sex, and triggering a transformation by falling out of a helicopter. Hensleigh rewrote from scratch, coming up with a brand new storyline featuring Bruce Banner, who, before the accident which turns him into the Hulk, experiments with gamma-irradiated insect DNA on three convicts, transforming them into &quot;insect men&quot; that cause havoc.

Filming was to start in December 1997 in Arizona for a mid 1999 release, but filming was pushed back for four months. Hensleigh subsequently rewrote the script with J. J. Abrams. Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were also brought on board to rewrite, with Hensleigh still attached as director. In October 1997, &quot;Hulk&quot; had entered pre-production with the creation of prosthetic makeup and computer animation already underway. Gregory Sporleder was cast as &quot;Novak&quot;, Banner&#x27;s archenemy, while Lynn Williams was cast as a convict who transforms into a combination of human, ant, and beetle. In March 1998, Universal put &quot;Hulk&quot; on hiatus due to its escalating $100 million budget and worries of Hensleigh directing his first film. $20 million was already spent on script development, computer animation, and prosthetics work. Hensleigh immediately went to rewrite the script to reduce the budget.

====Michael France====
Hensleigh found the rewriting process too complicated and resigned, saying he &quot;wasted nine months in pre-production&quot;. It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for the third time. France claimed, &quot;Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn&#x27;t in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie.&quot; France was writing the script on the fast track from July—September 1999. Filming for &quot;Hulk&quot; was to start in April 2000.

France stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his &quot;amiable, nerdy genius&quot; incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s &quot;Hulk&quot; stories, which introduced Brian Banner, Bruce&#x27;s abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities to convince himself that he is not like his father. However, he has anger management issues before the Hulk is born, which makes everything worse. The &quot;Don&#x27;t make me angry...&quot; line from the 1978 TV series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; became the dialogue that Banner&#x27;s father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the &quot;Gammasphere&quot;, Bruce and Betty&#x27;s tragic romance, and the black ops made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999 – January 2000.

====Ang Lee====
Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote the script even after the producers&#x27; positive response to France&#x27;s script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, and Universal brought Hayter in September. Hayter&#x27;s draft features the Leader, Zzzax, and Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as Banner&#x27;s colleagues and get caught in the same accident that creates the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film on January 20, 2001. Lee chose not to direct &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; and instead began work on the film. He was dissatisfied with Hayter&#x27;s script and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner&#x27;s father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, and Greek mythology to interpret the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.

Schamus was still rewriting the script in October 2001. In early 2002, as filming was underway, Michael France read all the scripts for the Writers Guild of America to determine who would get final credit. France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a more in-depth character, saddened they had denigrated his and Turman&#x27;s work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France said, &quot;James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner&#x27;s father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman&#x27;s scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that&#x27;s why we were credited.&quot; France, Turman, and Schamus received final credit. In December 2001, a theatrical release date for June 20, 2003, was announced, with the title of &quot;The Hulk&quot;. Schamus admitted that he was worried about making the film after seeing &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

===Filming===
Filming began on March 18, 2002, in Arizona and moved on April 19 to the San Francisco Bay Area. Locations included Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oakland, Treasure Island military base, and the sequoia forests of Porterville, before several weeks in the Utah and California deserts. The penultimate battle scene between Hulk and his father used the real Pear Lake in Sequoia National Park as a backdrop. Filming then moved to the Universal backlot in Los Angeles, using Stage 12 for the water tank scene, and finished in the first week of August. Filming of &quot;Hulk&quot; constituted hiring 3,000 local workers, generating over $10 million in the local economy. Mychael Danna, who previously collaborated with Lee on &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot; and &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, was set to compose the film score before dropping out. Danny Elfman was then hired.

===Visual effects and sound design===
Eric Bana commented that the shoot was &quot;Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid in a lot of ways.&quot; Lee told him that he was shooting a Greek tragedy and that he would be making a &quot;whole other movie&quot; about the Hulk at Industrial Light &amp; Magic. An example of Lee&#x27;s arthouse approach to the film was taking Bana to watch a bare-knuckle boxing match. Bana would later disfavorably reflect on his experience making the film as the majority of the time he was working indoors while the rest of the cast interacted with a CGI recreation of the Hulk, somewhat limiting his screen time. Computer animation supervisor Dennis Muren was on the set every day. One of the many visual images that presented an acting challenge for Bana was Lee&#x27;s split-screen technique to mimic comic book page panels cinematically. This technique required many more takes of individual scenes than usual. Muren and other ILM animators used previous technology from &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (for the Dobby character) to create the Hulk with computer-generated imagery. Additional software included PowerAnimator, Softimage 3D, Softimage XSI, and Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan. ILM started computer animation work in 2001 and completed it in May 2003, just one month before the film&#x27;s release. Lee provided some motion capture work in post-production. Gary Rydstrom handled sound design at Skywalker Sound.

=== Music ===

Danny Elfman composed the film score for &quot;Hulk&quot; as a replacement for Mychael Danna, whose score was rejected by the studio executives because it had a non-traditional approach and did not suit the film&#x27;s tone. Elfman&#x27;s involvement was confirmed nearly three months ahead of the film&#x27;s release and composed over two hours of music within 37 days. The soundtrack album was released on June 17, 2003, by Decca Records; the album features Elfman&#x27;s score as well as the song &quot;Set Me Free&quot; by Velvet Revolver, which plays during the end credits.

==Release==
===Marketing===
A 70-second teaser trailer debuted in theaters with the release of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; on May 3, 2002. This trailer was later attached to the home video releases of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. Universal Pictures spent $2.1 million to market the film in a 30-second television spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. A new trailer would premiere on February 14, 2003, in front of &quot;Daredevil&quot;″s screenings. Another trailer debuted on May 2, 2003 with the opening of &quot;X2&quot;. Just weeks before the film&#x27;s release, several workprints leaked on the Internet. The public already criticized the visual and special effects, although it was not the film&#x27;s final editing cut. The film received a novelization written by &quot;Hulk&quot; comic writer, Peter David. The tie-in &quot;Hulk&quot; video game was developed by Radical Entertainment and released by Vivendi Universal Games on May 28, 2003, and features a narrative that acts as a sequel to the film.

For the promotional campaign, Universal hired Nabisco, Post Consumer Brands, Pepsi, Hershey&#x27;s, Kraft Foods, Conagra Brands, Glad, and Snack Foods Limited.

===Home media===
&quot;Hulk&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on October 28, 2003. The DVD includes behind-the-scenes footage, enhanced viewing options that allow users to manipulate a 3-D Hulk model, and cast and crew commentaries. The film earned $61.2 million in DVD sales during 2003. &quot;Hulk&quot; was released on HD DVD on December 12, 2006, on Blu-ray on September 16, 2008, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray on July 9, 2019.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Hulk&quot; was released on June 20, 2003, grossing $24.3 million during its opening day. On its second day of release, it made $21.3 million. The film then earned $62.1 million in its opening weekend, which made it the 16th highest-ever opener at the time. It managed to top the box office upon opening, beating out &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. Moreover, it surpassed &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; to score the biggest June opening weekend. That record would last until 2004 when it was surpassed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. &quot;Hulk&quot; went on to score the fourth-highest opening weekend for a Universal film, behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, and &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;. It also achieved the fifth-highest opening weekend for a 2003 film, trailing only behind the latter film, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;X2&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Also, the film joined &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; and &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; to become one of three Universal films to make $50 million opening weekends. With a second-weekend drop of 70%, it was the first opener above $20 million to drop over 65%. At the time, the film had the second-highest second weekend decline of any superhero film, behind &quot;Steel&quot;. It eventually made $18.8 million during its second weekend, ranking in second place below &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;. The film grossed $132.2 million in North America on a budget of $137 million. It made $113.2 million in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $245.4 million. With a final North American gross of $132.2 million, it became the largest opener not to earn $150 million.

Internationally, &quot;Hulk&quot; had box office runs in several countries. It made $3.1 million from five Asian countries during its opening weekend, scoring a Hong Kong opening of $700,000 while doubling &quot;Gladiator&quot;. It grossed $122,000 in Malaysia, making it the country&#x27;s second-highest opening of a Universal film, after &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. In the UK, the film had made $5.6 million during its opening weekend, combined with $2.1 million from previews. In Mexico, &quot;Hulk&quot; became Universal&#x27;s biggest opening in the country, generating $4.6 million and surpassing &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. In total, the international grosses include Argentina ($1.2 million), Australia ($6.4 million), France ($9.6 million), Germany ($4.1 million), Italy ($8 million), Japan ($7.6 million), Mexico ($11.6 million), South Korea ($2.5 million), Spain ($7.7 million), Taiwan ($3.7 million), and the United Kingdom ($13.9 million).

===Critical response===
Upon opening, &quot;Hulk&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Hulk&quot; holds approval rating based on reviews and an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads, &quot;While Ang Lee&#x27;s ambitious film earns marks for style and an attempt at dramatic depth, there&#x27;s ultimately too much talking and not enough smashing.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave a positive review, explaining, &quot;Ang Lee is trying to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk, instead of simply cutting to brainless visual effects.&quot; Ebert also liked how the Hulk&#x27;s movements resembled King Kong. Although Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt &quot;Hulk&quot; should have been shorter, he heavily praised the action sequences, especially the climax and cliffhanger. Paul Clinton of CNN believed the cast gave strong performances, but in an otherwise positive review, criticized the computer-generated imagery, calling the Hulk &quot;a ticked-off version of Shrek&quot;.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; considered &quot;the film is more thoughtful and pleasing to the eye than any blockbuster in recent memory, but its epic length comes without an epic reward.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; felt &quot;Jennifer Connelly reprises her stand-by-your-messed-up-scientist turn from &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated, &quot;a big-budget comic-book adaptation has rarely felt so humorless and intellectually defensive about its own pulpy roots.&quot;

&quot;Hulk&quot; received retrospective praise from critics for its artistic difference from other superhero films such as those by Marvel and DC comics. In 2012, Matt Zoller Seitz cited it as one of the few big-budget superhero films that &quot;really departed from formula, in terms of subject matter or tone&quot;, writing that the film is &quot;pretty bizarre... in its old-school Freudian psychology, but interesting for that reason&quot;. In Scout Tafoya&#x27;s 2016 video essay on another film directed by Ang Lee, &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot;, he mentioned &quot;Hulk&quot; as &quot;Lee&#x27;s ill-fated but quietly soulful and deeply sad adaptation of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; comics&quot;. In 2018, Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com wrote that the film is &quot;a genuinely great example of cinematic pop art that deserves a reappraisal&quot;. One article calls it a &quot;road not taken&quot; in comic book adaptations. The author praised &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, and &quot;Hulk&quot; for their use of comic techniques such as &quot;masking, paneling, and page layout&quot; in ways the DC Extended Universe and Marvel Cinematic Universe do not.

===Accolades===
Connelly and Danny Elfman received nominations at the 30th Saturn Awards with Best Actress and Best Music. The film was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film but lost out to &quot;X2&quot;, another film based on Marvel characters. Dennis Muren, Michael Lantieri, and the special effects crew were nominated for Best Special Effects.

==Future==
===Cancelled sequel===
In March 2002, during filming for &quot;Hulk&quot;, producer Avi Arad targeted a May 2005 theatrical release date for a sequel. Upon the film&#x27;s release, screenwriter James Schamus started to plan a sequel featuring Hulk&#x27;s Grey Hulk persona and considered using the Leader and the Abomination as villains. Marvel asked for Abomination&#x27;s inclusion to be an actual threat to Hulk, unlike General Ross.

<doc id="407592" wikidata="Q1416413" url="?curid=407592" title="Hulk (ship type)">
<text>A hulk is a ship that is afloat, but incapable of going to sea. &#x27;Hulk&#x27; may be used to describe a ship that has been launched but not completed, an abandoned wreck or shell, or a ship whose propulsion system is no longer maintained or has been removed altogether. The word hulk also may be used as a verb: a ship is &quot;hulked&quot; to convert it to a hulk. The verb was also applied to crews of Royal Navy ships in dock, who were sent to the receiving ship for accommodation, or &quot;hulked&quot;. Hulks have a variety of uses such as housing, prisons, salvage pontoons, gambling sites, naval training, or cargo storage.

In the age of sail, many hulls served longer as hulks than they did as functional ships. Wooden ships were often hulked when the hull structure became too old and weak to withstand the stresses of sailing.

More recently, ships have been hulked when they become obsolete or when they become uneconomical to operate.

== Sheer hulk ==
A &quot;sheer hulk&quot; (or &quot;shear hulk&quot;) was used in shipbuilding and repair as a floating crane in the days of sailing ships, primarily to place the lower masts of a ship under construction or repair. Booms known as sheers were attached to the base of a hulk&#x27;s lower masts or beam, supported from the top of those masts. Blocks and tackle were then used in such tasks as placing or removing the lower masts of a vessel under construction or repair. These lower masts were the largest and most massive single timbers aboard a ship, and erecting them without the assistance of either a sheer hulk or land-based masting sheer was extremely difficult.

The concept of sheer hulks originated with the Royal Navy in the 1690s, and persisted in Britain until the early nineteenth century. Most sheer hulks were decommissioned warships; &quot;Chatham&quot;, built in 1694, was the first of only three purpose-built vessels. There were at least six sheer hulks in service in Britain at any time throughout the 1700s. The concept spread to France in the 1740s with the commissioning of a sheer hulk at the port of Rochefort.

By 1807 the Royal Navy had standardised sheer hulk crew numbers to comprise a boatswain, mate and six seamen, with larger numbers coming aboard only when the sheers were in use.
== Accommodation hulk ==
An &quot;accommodation hulk&quot; is a hulk used as housing, generally when there is a lack of quarters available ashore. An operational ship may be used for accommodation, but a hulk can accommodate more personnel than the same hull would accommodate as a functional ship. For this role, the hulk is often extensively modified to improve living conditions. Receiving hulks and prison hulks are specialized types of accommodation hulks. During World War II, purpose-built barracks ships were used in this role.

=== Receiving hulk ===

A &quot;receiving ship&quot; is a ship used in harbour to house newly recruited sailors before they are assigned to a ship&#x27;s crew.

During the wars of the 18th and 19th century, almost every nation&#x27;s navy suffered from a lack of volunteers and had to rely on some form of forced recruitment. The receiving ship partly solved the problem of unwilling recruits escaping; it was difficult to get off the ship without being detected, and most seamen of the era did not know how to swim.

Receiving ships were typically older vessels that could still be kept afloat, but were obsolete or no longer seaworthy. The practice was especially common in the age of wooden ships, since the old hulls would remain afloat for many years in relatively still waters after they had become too weak to withstand the rigors of the open ocean.

Receiving ships often served as floating hospitals as many were assigned in locations without shore-based station hospitals. Often the afloat surgeon would take up station on the receiving ship.

=== Prison hulk ===
A &quot;prison hulk&quot; was a hulk used as a floating prison. They were used extensively in Great Britain, the Royal Navy producing a steady supply of ships too worn-out to use in combat, but still afloat. Their widespread use was a result of the large number of French sailors captured during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and continued throughout the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars a half-century later. By 1814, there were eighteen prison hulks operating at Portsmouth, sixteen at Plymouth and ten at Chatham.

Prison hulks were also convenient for holding civilian prisoners, commencing in Britain in 1776 when the American Revolution prevented the sending of convicts to North America. Instead, increasingly large numbers of British convicts were held aboard hulks in the major seaports and landed ashore in daylight hours for manual labour such as harbor dredging. From 1786, prison hulks were also used as temporary &quot;gaols&quot; (jails) for convicts being transported to Australia.

== Hulks used for storage ==
A &quot;powder hulk&quot; was a hulk used to store gunpowder. The hulk was a floating warehouse which could be moved as needed to simplify the transfer of gunpowder to warships. Its location, away from land, also reduced the possible damage from an explosion.

Service as a &quot;coal hulk&quot; was usually, but not always, a ship&#x27;s last.

Of the fate of the fast and elegant clipper ships, William L. Carothers wrote, 

The famed clipper &quot;Red Jacket&quot; ended her days as a coaling hulk in the Cape Verde Islands.

== Salvage pontoon ==
Hulks were used in pairs during salvage operations. By passing heavy cables under a wreck and connecting them to two hulks, a wreck could be raised using the lifting force of the tide or by changing the buoyancy of the hulks.

== Hulk assemblages ==
A hulk assemblage (sometimes known as a ship graveyard) is where more than one vessel has been hulked in the same location. A project by Museum of London Archaeology (with the Thames Discovery Programme and the Nautical Archaeology Society) and in 2012 created a database of known hulk assemblages in England. They identified 199 separate hulk assemblages ranging in size from two vessels to over 80.

== Hulks in modern times ==
Several of the largest former oil tankers have been converted to floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units, effectively very large floating oil storage tanks. &quot;Knock Nevis&quot;, by some measures the largest ship ever built, served in this capacity from 2004 until 2010. In 2009 and 2010, two of the four TI-class supertankers, then the largest ships afloat, &quot;TI Asia&quot; and &quot;TI Africa&quot;, were converted to FPSOs.

== Other services ==
A vessel&#x27;s hulking may not be its final use. Scuttling as a blockship, breakwater, artificial reef, or recreational dive site may await. Some are repurposed, for example as a gambling ship; others are restored and put to new uses, such as a museum ship. Some even return revitalised to sea.

When lumber schooner , &quot;one of only two Pacific Coast steam schooners to be powered by steam turbines,&quot;
was hulked in 1928, she was moored off Long Beach, California and used as a gambling ship until destroyed by a fire of unknown cause.

One vessel rescued from this ignominious end was the barque &quot;Polly Woodside&quot;, now a museum ship in Melbourne, Australia. Another is the barque , rescued from Recherche Bay in Tasmania, now restored and regularly sailing from Sydney, Australia.

<text>In the context of Christian liturgy, a canticle (from the Latin &quot;canticulum&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;canticum&quot;, &quot;song&quot;) is a psalm-like song with biblical lyrics taken from elsewhere than the Book of Psalms, but included in psalters and books such as the breviary. Of special importance to the Divine Office are three New Testament Canticles that are the climaxes of the Offices of Lauds, Vespers and Compline; these are respectively Benedictus (Luke 1:68-79), Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55) and Nunc dimittis (Luke 2:29-32). There are also a number of Canticles taken from the Old Testament.

==Catholic Church==
Prior to the Pope Pius X&#x27;s 1911 reforms, the following cycle of seven Old Testament Canticles was used at Lauds:
* Sunday – The Song of the Three Holy Children ()
* Monday – The Song of Isaiah the Prophet ()
* Tuesday – The Song of Hezekiah ()
* Wednesday – The Song of Hannah ()
* Thursday – The (First) Song of Moses ()
* Friday – The Prayer of Habakkuk ()
* Saturday – The (Second) Song of Moses ()

These are rather long, and the weekday ones display something of a penitential theme, but some were not often used, as all feasts and the weekdays in Eastertide had the Canticle of Daniel, assigned to Sunday.

The 1911 reform introduced for weekdays not of penitential nature, and for lesser feasts and days of the lesser octaves, the following Canticles:
* Monday – The Song of David the King ()
* Tuesday – The Song of Tobit ()
* Wednesday – The Song of Judith ()
* Thursday – The Song of Jeremiah the Prophet ()
* Friday – The (Second) Song of Isaiah the Prophet ()
* Saturday – The Song of Ecclesiasticus ()

For weekdays in Advent, Pre-Lent, Lent and the quarterly Ember Days, if not superseded by higher-ranking feasts—due to the multitude of feasts in the rest of the year, these make up almost the totality of the days that did not have the Canticle of Daniel before—the original seven Canticles would still be used.

The Liturgy of the Hours (introduced in 1971) uses one canticle from the Old Testament each day at Lauds, &quot;each weekday of the four-week cycle [has] its own proper canticle and on Sunday the two sections of the Canticle of the Three Children may be alternated&quot;. The liturgy prior to the reform after Vatican II used fourteen Old Testament Canticles in two weekly cycles.

At Vespers according to the Liturgy of the Hours, a Canticle from the New Testament is used. These follow a weekly cycle, with some exceptions.

Additionally, the following Canticles from the Gospel of Luke (also called the “Evangelical Canticles”) are said daily:
* At Lauds, the &quot;Canticle of Zachary&quot; (Luke 1:68-79), commonly referred to as the &quot;Benedictus.&quot;
* At Vespers, the &quot;Canticle of Mary&quot; (Luke 1:46-55), commonly known as the &quot;Magnificat&quot;.
* At Compline, the &quot;Canticle of Simeon&quot; (Luke 2:29-32), commonly referred to as the &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot;.

This usage is also followed by Lutheran churches.

==Anglican==
In the Church of England, Morning and Evening Prayer according to the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; make extensive use of canticles, specifically those below and also in some enumerations, the Venite (Psalm 95). Nonetheless, the only text called a canticle in the rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer is the Benedicite, while the Song of Solomon is called the Canticles in the Lectionary.

* At Morning Prayer:
** Te Deum or Benedicite (Daniel 3:57–88 in the Apocrypha)
** Benedictus (Luke 1:68–79) or Jubilate Deo (Psalm 100)
* At Evening Prayer:
** Magnificat (Luke 1:46–55) or Cantate Domino (Psalm 98)
** Nunc dimittis (Luke 2:29–32) or Deus misereatur (Psalm 67)

==Eastern Christian==

In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches there are nine Biblical Canticles (or Odes) that are chanted at Matins. These form the basis of the Canon, a major component of Matins.

The nine Canticles are as follows:
* Canticle One — The (First) Song of Moses ()
* Canticle Two — The (Second) Song of Moses ()
* Canticle Three — The Prayer of Hannah ()
* Canticle Four — The Prayer of Habakkuk ()
* Canticle Five — The Prayer of Isaiah ()
* Canticle Six — The Prayer of Jonah ()
* Canticle Seven — The Prayer of the Three Holy Children (Daniel 3:26-56)
* Canticle Eight — The Song of the Three Holy Children (Daniel 3:57-88)
* Canticle Nine — The Song of the Theotokos (the &quot;Magnificat&quot;: ); the Song of Zacharias (the &quot;Benedictus&quot; )

Originally, these Canticles were chanted in their entirety every day, with a short refrain inserted between each verse. Eventually, short verses (troparia) were composed to replace these refrains, a process traditionally inaugurated by Saint Andrew of Crete.
Gradually over the centuries, the verses of the Biblical Canticles were omitted (except for the Magnificat) and only the composed troparia were read, linked to the original canticles by an Irmos. During Great Lent however, the original Biblical Canticles are still read.

Another Biblical Canticle, the &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; (), is either read or sung at Vespers.

==Armenian Liturgy==
At Matins (or Midnight Hour; Armenian: Ի մէջ Գիշերի &quot;i mej gisheri&quot;), one canticle from the Old Testament is sung, associated with a reading from the Psalter, followed by hymns according to tone, season, and feast. There are eight such canticles which are determined by the musical tone of the day. These are, along with their respective portions of the Psalter and their tones:

* Tone Eight — The (First) Song of Moses ()— Psalms 1-17
* Tone One — The (Second) Song of Moses () — Psalms 18-35
* Tone Two — The (Second) Song of Moses (, ) — Psalms 36-54
* Tone Three — The Prayer of Hannah () — Psalms 55-71
* Tone Four — The Prayer of Isaiah () — Psalms 72-88
* Tone Five — The Prayer of Hezekiah () — Psalms 89-105
* Tone Six — The Prayer of Jonah with material from Isaiah (, , ) — Psalms 106-118
* Tone Seven — The Prayer of Habakkuk () — Psalms 119-147
Note that Psalms 148-150 and Psalm 151 are not part of this system because they are read every day at the Morning Hour, following the canticles presented below.

At the Morning Hour (Armenian: Յառաւուտու Ժամ &quot;haṟavoutou zham&quot;), corresponding to Lauds, the following canticles are fixed parts of the service each day:

* The Prayer of the Three Holy Children (Daniel 3:26-88)
* The Song of the Theotokos (Magnificat: );
* The Song of Zacharias (the Benedictus )
* The Prayer of Simeon (Nunc dimittis )

Following the Song of the Three Youths and the Prayer of Simeon there are sets of hymns as well as other texts which are proper to the commemoration of the day or of the liturgical season.

In the other hours, sections of these and other canticles are included in fixed material, consisting of amalgams of verse material from the Old Testament:
Ninth Hour: a citation of Daniel 3:35;
Peace Hour (after Vespers): , ;
Rest Hour (after the Peace Hour): Daniel 3:29-34, Luke 2:29-32, Luke 1:16-55.

This list does not take into account citations of these texts in the Divine Liturgy (Armenian: Պատարագ &quot;patarag&quot;) or in the movable Old Testament verse material or in hymnody.

==Coptic Orthodoxy==

In the Coptic Orthodox Church there are four Biblical Canticles (or (hos, literally praise/song)) that are chanted during midnight praises. The fourth of these canticles is also chanted during vespers praises.

The four Canticles are as follows:

* The First Canticle - The Song of Moses ()
* The Second Canticle - (135 LXX)
* The Third Canticle - The Song of the Three Holy Children (Daniel 3:52-88 LXX, including The &quot;Benedicite&quot;)
* The Fourth Canticle -

<doc id="407597" wikidata="Q2076362" url="?curid=407597" title="Lenox, Massachusetts">
<text>Lenox is a town in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, United States. The town is in Western Massachusetts and part of the Pittsfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,095 at the 2020 census. Lenox is the site of Shakespeare &amp; Company and Tanglewood, summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Lenox includes the villages of New Lenox and Lenoxdale, and is a tourist destination during the summer.

==History==
The area was inhabited by Mahicans, Algonquian speakers who largely lived along the Hudson and Housatonic Rivers. Hostilities during the French and Indian Wars discouraged settlement by European colonial settlers until 1750, when Jonathan and Sarah Hinsdale from Hartford, Connecticut, established a small inn and general store. The Province of Massachusetts Bay thereupon auctioned large tracts of land for 10 townships in Berkshire County, set off in 1761 from Hampshire County.

For 2,250 pounds Josiah Dean purchased Lot Number 8, which included present-day Lenox and Richmond. After conflicting land claims were resolved, however, it went to Samuel Brown Jr., who had bought the land from the Mahican chief, on condition that he pay 650 pounds extra. It was founded as Richmond in 1765. But because the Berkshires divided the town in two, the village of Yokuntown (named for an indigenous chief) was set off as Lenox in 1767. The town was intended to be called Lennox, probably after Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond and Lennox (Scottish Gaelic &quot;Leamhnachd&quot;), but the name was misspelled by a clerk at incorporation.

Early industries included farming, sawmills, textile mills, potash production, glassworks, and quarrying. A vein of iron ore led to the digging of mines under the town, and the establishment by Job Gilbert in the 1780s of an iron works at Lenox Dale, also known as Lenox Furnace. In 1784, Lenox became the county seat, which it remained until 1868 when the title passed to Pittsfield. The county courthouse built in 1816 is today the Lenox Library.

The region&#x27;s rustic beauty helped Lenox develop into an art colony. In 1821, author Catharine Sedgwick moved here, followed by actress Fanny Kemble. Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family came from Salem in 1850, staying a year and a half. Other visitors to the area, including Timothy Dwight, Benjamin Silliman and Henry Ward Beecher, extolled its advantages. After an extension of the Housatonic Railroad arrived in 1838, tourists discovered the town in increasing numbers.

In 1844, Samuel Gray Ward of Boston, the American representative for Barings Bank of London, assembled tracts of land to create the first estate in Lenox. Called &quot;Highwood&quot;, the Italianate dwelling was designed in 1845 by Richard Upjohn. In 1876, Ward hired Charles F. McKim to design in the Shingle Style another property, &quot;Oakwood&quot;. The period from 1880 until 1920 would be dubbed the Berkshire Cottage era, when the small New England town was transformed into a Gilded Age resort similar to Newport, Rhode Island, and Bar Harbor, Maine. The wealthy and their entourage opened immense houses for recreation and entertaining during the Berkshire Season, which lasted from late summer until early fall. One event was the annual Tub Parade, when Main Street was lined with ornately decorated carriages. Property values jumped as millionaires competed for land on which to build showplaces. In 1903, an acre in Lenox cost $20,000, when an acre in nearby towns cost a few dollars.

The imposition of the federal income tax in 1913 ended construction of the country mansions in the Berkshires. The estates started to break up during the 1920s. Carnegie&#x27;s widow sold Shadowbrook to the Jesuits for a seminary in 1922. The Depression made it harder to maintain the estates, and labor was scarce during World War II. After the war, some of the estates were torn or burned down. Others became schools or seminaries. Some estates became preparatory schools, although they would close by the 1970s and 1980s.

The Shadowbrook property is now the Kripalu yoga center; another, The Mount, is the former home of Shakespeare &amp; Company. Some have been converted into vacation condominiums. Tanglewood, the former estate of the Tappan family which lies partially in Stockbridge, would in 1937 become summer home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Lenox remains a popular tourist destination.

<text>Sir Thomas Octave Murdoch Sopwith, CBE, Hon FRAeS (18 January 1888 – 27 January 1989) was a British aviation pioneer, businessman and yachtsman.

==Early life==
Sopwith was born in Kensington, London, on 18 January 1888. He was the eighth child and only son of Thomas Sopwith (a civil engineer and managing director of the Spanish Lead Mines Company in Linares, Jaén, Spain) and his wife, Lydia Gertrude Messiter. He was a grandson of mining engineer Thomas Sopwith. He was educated at Cottesmore School in Hove and at Seafield Park engineering college in Hill Head.

On 30 July 1898, when he was ten years old and on a family holiday at the Isle of Lismore near Oban in Scotland, a gun lying across young Thomas&#x27;s knee went off, killing his father. This accident haunted Sopwith for the rest of his life.

Sopwith was interested in motor cycles, and he took part in the 100-mile Tricar trial in 1904, where he was one of four medal winners. He also tried ballooning, his first ascent being in C.S. Rolls&#x27; balloon in June 1906. Together with Phil Paddon, he bought his own balloon from Short Brothers. For a while, he was in business with Phil Paddon selling automobiles as Paddon &amp; Sopwith on Albemarle Street in Piccadilly, London.

In his youth, he was an expert ice skater and played in goal during the Princes Ice Hockey Club&#x27;s 1908 match with C.P.P. Paris and during the 1909–10 season. He was also a member of the Great Britain national ice hockey team that won the gold medal at the first European Championships in 1910.

==Career in aviation==

Sopwith became interested in flying after seeing John Moisant flying the first cross-Channel passenger flight. His first flight was with Gustave Blondeau in a Farman at Brooklands. He soon taught himself to fly on a Howard Wright Avis monoplane and took to the air on his own for the first time on 22 October 1910. He crashed after travelling about 300 yards (275 m), but soon improved, and on 22 November was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviation Certificate No. 31, flying a Howard Wright 1910 Biplane.

On 18 December 1910, Sopwith won the £4000 Baron de Forest Prize for the longest flight from England to the Continent in a British-built aeroplane, flying 169 miles (272 km) in 3 hours 40 minutes. He used the winnings to set up the Sopwith School of Flying at Brooklands.

In June 1912, Sopwith, along with Fred Sigrist and others, set up the Sopwith Aviation Company, initially at Brooklands. On 24 October 1912 using a Wright Model B completely rebuilt by Sopwith and fitted with an ABC 40 hp engine, Harry Hawker took the British Michelin Endurance prize with a flight of 8h 23m.

Sopwith Aviation got its first military aircraft order in November 1912, and in December moved to larger premises in Canbury Park Road, Kingston upon Thames. The site of the factory is now a private gated housing estate. A small section of the original building still exists at the junction of Elm Crescent and Canbury Park Road; white painted bay windows can be seen extending from the building to allow as much light as possible to enter the large room in which Sopwith made blueprints for his aircraft designs.

The company produced more than 18,000 World War I aircraft for the allied forces, including 5747 of the Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter. Sopwith was awarded the CBE in 1918.

Bankrupted after the war by punitive anti-profiteering taxes and a failed venture into motorcycle manufacturing, he re-entered the aviation business in 1920 with a new firm named after his chief engineer and test pilot, Harry Hawker. Sopwith became chairman of the new firm, Hawker Aircraft.

He became a Knight Bachelor in 1953. After the nationalisation in 1977 of the aviation interests of what was by then Hawker Siddeley, he continued to work as a consultant to the company until 1980.

In 1979, Sopwith was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. He was a member of the Air Squadron flying club.

==Yachting==
Sopwith challenged the America&#x27;s Cup with his J-class yachts, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, in 1934, and with &quot;Endeavour II&quot; in 1937. Both yachts were designed by Charles E. Nicholson. Sopwith funded, organised and helmed the yachts. He did not win the Cup but he became a Cup legend by nearly winning it in 1934. He was inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame in 1995.

In 1927 Sopwith commissioned yacht builders Camper and Nicholsons to build a luxury motor yacht he named &quot;Vita&quot;. She was sold in 1929 to Sir John Shelley-Rolls who renamed her &quot;Alastor&quot;. During World War II the Royal Navy commandeered her to ferry provisions to Navy vessels moored at the entrance to Strangford Lough. In 1946 a fire gutted her and she sank in Ringhaddy Sound in Strangford Lough.

In 1937 Sopwith received the yacht &quot;Philante&quot;, also built for him by Camper and Nicholsons. In the Second World War the ship was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and used as a convoy escort vessel, HMS &quot;Philante&quot;. After the war the vessel was returned to Sopwith and he sold her to Norway in 1947, to become the royal yacht of the King of Norway.

==Personal life==

Sopwith married Beatrice Hore-Ruthven (1871–1930) in 1914, but they had no children. Beatrice was the daughter of Walter Hore-Ruthven, who was created Baron Ruthven of Gowrie in 1919. After Beatrice&#x27;s death, he married Phyllis Brodie Gordon (1892–1978) in 1932. Their son, Thomas Edward Brodie Sopwith, had success in car racing.

Sopwith&#x27;s house in Mayfair at No. 46 Green Street, where he lived from 1934 until 1940, has a blue plaque. In 1940, he moved to Warfield Hall in Berkshire, which he had acquired the previous year.

Sopwith&#x27;s 100th birthday was marked by a flypast of military aircraft over his home, Compton Manor in King&#x27;s Somborne, Hampshire. He died in Hampshire on 27 January 1989, nine days after his 101st birthday. His grave and that of his second wife (Phyllis Brodie) are in the churchyard of All Saints Church, Little Somborne, near Winchester.

==Legacy and tributes==

His authorised biography is &quot;Pure Luck&quot; (2005) by Alan Bramson, with a foreword by the Prince of Wales (). Sir Thomas was interviewed on 8 November 1978 by the art historian Anna Malinovska; the interview is reproduced in &quot;Voices in Flight&quot;, 2006.

A bronze bust of Sopwith was unveiled by his son at Kingston Library, London, on 26 September 2014. The sculptor was Ambrose Barber, a former executive of Hawker. Earlier in the same year, a plaque was unveiled at Canbury Gardens in Kingston upon Thames by Sopwith&#x27;s son to commemorate the Sopwith aviation company.

Sopwith Way in Kingston upon Thames was named after Thomas Sopwith. Sopwith Road, one of the roads built on the site of the former Heston Aerodrome, is also named after him. Sopwith Road in Warfield (Bracknell, Berkshire), located close to his former home Warfield Hall and the location of the newly built Woodhurst school (part of Warfield CE Primary School), is also named after him.

<text>A (&quot;pong&quot; (Korean); &quot;pang&quot; (Cantonese); &quot;bang&quot; (Mandarin); &quot;kun&quot; (Okinawan)) is a staff weapon used in Okinawa. &quot;Bō&quot; are typically around long and used in Okinawan martial arts, while being adopted into Japanese arts such particular bōjutsu. Other staff-related weapons are the &quot;jō&quot;, which is long, and the &quot;hanbō&quot; (half &quot;bō&quot;), which is long.

==Types==
The &quot;bō&quot; is usually made with unfinished (no varnish, stain, etc) hardwood or a flexible wood, such as red or white oak, although bamboo and pine wood have been used; more common still is rattan wood for its strength flexibility. The modern &quot;bō&quot; may be tapered in that it can be thicker in the center (&quot;chukon-bu&quot;) than at the ends (&quot;kontei&quot;) and is usually round or circular (&quot;maru-bo&quot;). Some bō are very light, with metallic sides, stripes and a grip which are used for XMA and competitions/demonstrations. Older bō were round (&quot;maru-bo&quot;), square (&quot;kaku-bo&quot;) (&quot;rokkaku-bo&quot;) or octagonal (&quot;hakkaku-bo&quot;). The average size of a bō is 6 shaku (around ) but they can be as long as (&quot;kyu-shaku-bō&quot;).

A &quot;bō&quot; is usually called a . This name derives from the Japanese words , meaning &quot;six&quot;; ; and &quot;bō&quot;. The &quot;shaku&quot; is a Japanese measurement equivalent to 30.3 centimeters (0.994 ft). Thus, &quot;rokushakubō&quot; refers to a staff about 6-&quot;shaku&quot; (1.82 m; 5.96 feet) long. The &quot;bō&quot; is typically 3 cm (1.25 inch) thick, sometimes gradually tapering from the middle (&quot;chukon-bu&quot;) to 2 cm (0.75 inch) at the end (&quot;kontei&quot;). Traditional bō are not tapered. This thickness allows the user to make a tight fist around it in order to block and counter an attack.

In some cases for training purposes or for a different style, and in more recent years, rattan is used. Some were inlaid or banded with strips of iron or other metals for extra strength. &quot;Bō&quot; range from heavy to light, from rigid to highly flexible, and from simple pieces of wood picked up from the side of the road to ornately decorated works of art.

==Martial arts==


The Japanese martial art of wielding the &quot;bō&quot; is &quot;bōjutsu&quot;. The basis of &quot;bō&quot; technique is &quot;te&quot;, or hand, techniques derived from &quot;quanfa&quot; and other martial arts that reached Okinawa via trade and Chinese monks. Thrusting, swinging, and striking techniques often resemble empty-hand movements, following the philosophy that the &quot;bō&quot; is merely an &quot;extension of one’s limbs&quot;. Consequently, bōjutsu is often incorporated into other styles of empty hand fighting, such as karate. The &quot;bō&quot; is also used as a spear and long sword in some of its motions, such as upward swing and slashing motion across the body as well as extensions by gripping one end and thus increasing its length as thus making it similar to a spear.

The &quot;bō&quot; is typically gripped in thirds, with one palm facing the opposite direction of the other palm, enabling the staff to rotate and to secure the weapon when blocking. The power is generated by the back hand pulling the staff, while the front hand is used for guidance. &quot;Bō&quot; technique includes a wide variety of blocks, strikes, sweeps, and entrapments. 

==History==

The earliest form of the &quot;bō&quot;, a staff, has been used throughout Asia since the beginning of recorded history. Used for self-defense by monks or commoners, the staff was an integral part of the Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, one of the martial arts oldest surviving styles. The staff evolved into the &quot;bō&quot; with the foundation of kobudō, a martial art using weapons, which emerged in Okinawa in the early 17th century.

Prior to the 15th century, Okinawa, a small island located south of Japan, was divided into three kingdoms: Chuzan, Hokuzan, and Nanzan. After much political turmoil, Okinawa was united under the First Sho Dynasty in 1429. In 1477, Emperor Sho Shin came into power. Determined to enforce his philosophical and ethical ideas, while banning feudalism, the emperor instituted a ban on weapons. It became a crime to carry or own weapons such as swords, in an attempt to prevent further turmoil and prevent an uprising.

In 1609, the temporary peace established by Sho Shin was violently overthrown when the powerful Shimazu clan of Satsuma invaded and conquered Okinawa. The Shimazu lords placed a new weapons ban, leaving the Okinawans defenseless against samurai weaponry. In an attempt to protect themselves, the people of Okinawa looked to simple farming implements, which the samurai would not be able to confiscate, as new methods of defense. This use of weapons developed into kobudo, or &quot;ancient martial way&quot; as known today.

Although the &quot;bō&quot; is now used as a weapon, its use is believed by some to have evolved from the long stick () which was used to balance buckets or baskets. Typically, one would carry baskets of harvested crops or buckets of water or fish, etc., one at each end of the &quot;tenbin&quot;, which is balanced across the middle of the back at the shoulder blades. In poorer agrarian economies, the &quot;tenbin&quot; remains a traditional farm work implement. In styles such as Yamanni-ryū or &quot;Kenshin-ryū&quot;, many of the strikes are the same as those used for &quot;yari&quot; (&quot;spear&quot;) or &quot;naginata&quot; (&quot;glaive&quot;).

<doc id="407603" wikidata="Q1131607" url="?curid=407603" title="Copy-on-write">
<text>Copy-on-write (COW), also called implicit sharing or shadowing, is a resource-management technique used in programming to manage shared data efficiently. Instead of copying data right away when multiple programs use it, the same data is shared between programs until one tries to modify it. If no changes are made, no private copy is created, saving resources. A copy is only made when needed, ensuring each program has its own version when modifications occur. This technique is commonly applied to memory, files, and data structures.

==In virtual memory management==
Copy-on-write finds its main use in operating systems, sharing the physical memory of computers running multiple processes, in the implementation of the fork() system call. Typically, the new process does not modify any memory and immediately executes a new process, replacing the address space entirely. It would waste processor time and memory to copy all of the old process&#x27;s memory during the fork only to immediately discard the copy.

Copy-on-write can be implemented efficiently using the page table by marking certain pages of memory as read-only and keeping a count of the number of references to the page. When data is written to these pages, the operating-system kernel intercepts the write attempt and allocates a new physical page, initialized with the copy-on-write data, although the allocation can be skipped if there is only one reference. The kernel then updates the page table with the new (writable) page, decrements the number of references, and performs the write. The new allocation ensures that a change in the memory of one process is not visible in another&#x27;s.

The copy-on-write technique can be extended to support efficient memory allocation by keeping one page of physical memory filled with zeros. When the memory is allocated, all the pages returned refer to the page of zeros and are all marked copy-on-write. This way, physical memory is not allocated for the process until data is written, allowing processes to reserve more virtual memory than physical memory and use memory sparsely, at the risk of running out of virtual address space. The combined algorithm is similar to demand paging.

Copy-on-write pages are also used in the Linux kernel&#x27;s same-page merging feature.

==In software==
COW is also used in library, application, and system code.

===Examples===
The string class provided by the C++ standard library was specifically designed to allow copy-on-write implementations in the initial C++98 standard, but not in the newer C++11 standard:

std::string x(&quot;Hello&quot;);

std::string y = x; // x and y use the same buffer.

y += &quot;, World!&quot;; // Now y uses a different buffer; x still uses the same old buffer.
In the PHP programming language, all types except references are implemented as copy-on-write. For example, strings and arrays are passed by reference, but when modified, they are duplicated if they have non-zero reference counts. This allows them to act as value types without the performance problems of copying on assignment or making them immutable.

In the Qt framework, many types are copy-on-write (&quot;implicitly shared&quot; in Qt&#x27;s terms). Qt uses atomic compare-and-swap operations to increment or decrement the internal reference counter. Since the copies are cheap, Qt types can often be safely used by multiple threads without the need of locking mechanisms such as mutexes. The benefits of COW are thus valid in both single- and multithreaded systems.

==In computer storage==
COW is used as the underlying mechanism in file systems like ZFS, Btrfs, ReFS, and Bcachefs, as well as in logical volume management and database servers such as Microsoft SQL Server.

In traditional file systems, file changes overwrite the original data. With COW, when changes are made, a new version of the file is created while keeping the original intact. This approach enables features like snapshots, which capture the state of a file at a specific time without consuming much additional space. Snapshots typically store only the modified data and are kept close to the original. However, they are considered a weak form of incremental backup and cannot replace a full backup.

<doc id="407613" wikidata="Q1166586" url="?curid=407613" title="Darrell Green">
<text>Darrell Ray Green (born February 15, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) for 20 seasons. Considered to be one of the greatest cornerbacks and fastest players in NFL history, he played college football for the Texas A&amp;M–Kingsville Javelinas and was drafted by the Redskins in the first round of the 1983 NFL draft. Green played in 295 games with Washington, winning Super Bowls XXII and XXVI, before retiring in 2003. He was named the 1996 NFL Man of the Year, inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2008, and included on the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Early life==
Green was born on February 15, 1960, in Houston, Texas, later attending Jesse H. Jones High School. While there, he was an All-State selection in track and an All-City pick in football. Green made the junior varsity football team his junior year, and then made the varsity team as a senior.

==College career==
Green attended and played college football and ran track at Texas A&amp;I University (now Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville). He finished his Bachelor of Science degree in general studies at St. Paul&#x27;s College in Lawrenceville, Virginia.

===Football===
In 1982, Green was selected by his teammates as captain, was named a first-team All-American, and was the Most Valuable Player in the Lone Star Conference. During his senior year, Green had 56 tackles, four interceptions and two punt returns for touchdowns. He was selected to the Lone Star Conference Team of the Decade for the 1980s.

===Track and field===
In track and field, Green set numerous national and conference records and earned ten All-America certificates. His first meet was in 1982 in San Angelo, Texas, where he ran a 10.08 in the 100 meters. The mark still stands as the all-time best in the Lone Star Conference. At the 1982 NCAA championships, Green finished sixth in the 100-meter dash and seventh in the 200-meter dash.

Green&#x27;s all-time collegiate best in the 100 was 10.08, 20.50 in the 200 meters and 45.90 in the 400 meters. He was named the most valuable track performer at the 1982 and 1983 Lone Star Conference Championships. He won gold medals at the LSC meet in the 100 meters in 1981 and in the 100 meters and 200 meters in 1982 and in 1983.

Green was named to the NCAA Division I All-America roster in 1981 and 1982, and was on the NCAA Division II All-America team in five events in 1981 and 1982. He was NAIA All-America in 1981 and 1982 in four events.

====Personal bests====
==Professional career==
Green was the last player selected in the first round (28th overall) of the 1983 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins. The first time he touched the ball, during a pre-season game against the Atlanta Falcons, he returned a punt 61 yards for a touchdown. During his first regular-season game, he made his first big play when he ran down running back Tony Dorsett of the Dallas Cowboys to prevent a touchdown. Green started all 16 regular season games during his rookie season and finished fourth on the team in tackles with 109 and led the team in solo tackles with 79. He was runner-up for the Associated Press NFL Rookie of the Year Award.

During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the Redskins went 11–4 and Green had a very successful year. He registered a career-high three interceptions in a game against the Detroit Lions on November 15, 1987. Two of his more notable performances occurred in that postseason. One happened during a divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears, where he returned a punt 52 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Green tore rib cartilage while vaulting over a tackler during the return, but he merely grabbed his side and kept running until he scored. Then in the 1987 NFC Championship game, on a pivotal fourth-down play at the Washington goal line with 56 seconds remaining, Green knocked away a pass intended for Minnesota&#x27;s Darrin Nelson to secure a Redskins 17–10 victory that enabled the team to go to Super Bowl XXII.

Green was also successful in the 1990s. In 1997, Green returned an interception 83 yards for a touchdown against the Philadelphia Eagles, which was the longest return of his career. Then on December 13, 1997, he played in his 217th career game as a Redskin, breaking Monte Coleman&#x27;s record for games played. In a 1999 game against the Arizona Cardinals, he intercepted his 50th NFL pass against Jake Plummer at FedExField.

In the last game of his career on December 29, 2002, Green and the Redskins defeated the Dallas Cowboys 20–14 at FedExField. During the game, he returned a punt on a reverse from Champ Bailey for 35 yards which is the longest gain of any kind for a player his age (42 years, 327 days).

Green retired after the 2002 season at the age of 42, the oldest Redskin, having played for six head coaches: Joe Gibbs, Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, and Steve Spurrier. For several years, Green and former Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams offensive tackle Jackie Slater were the only players in NFL history to play for the same team for 20 seasons; kicker Jason Hanson broke this record when he retired after 21 seasons with the Detroit Lions.

In his 20 NFL seasons, Green recorded 54 interceptions, which he returned for 621 yards and six touchdowns. He also added two additional touchdowns on interception returns in the postseason. Three times he recorded a career-best of five interceptions in a season (1984, 1986, and 1991). Green also returned 51 punts for 611 yards and recovered 10 fumbles, returning them for 131 yards and two touchdowns. Also known for staying healthy, he missed just 25 games throughout his career. He missed two months after sustaining a broken arm in a 24–17 win over the Atlanta Falcons on September 15, 1992.

He is the four-time winner of the NFL&#x27;s Fastest Man competition, and the only undefeated multiple winner in NFL history. Green is rumored to have the fastest recorded 40 yard dash time of 4.09, which he is said to have run in Washington&#x27;s 1986 training camp.

Green was with the Redskins for their victories in Super Bowls XXII and XXVI, and started in their loss to the Los Angeles Raiders in Super Bowl XVIII. Green recorded an interception in Super Bowl XXVI and a then-record 34-yard punt return in Super Bowl XVIII.

Green was named All-Pro in 1986, 1987, 1990, and 1991 and was voted to seven Pro Bowls. He is a member of the National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team as well as winning all four NFL Fastest Man competitions he participated in. His pre-game rituals included eating and sticking Tootsie Rolls in his sock claiming that the candy helped him run fast. Washington retired his number 28 during halftime of a home game against the Carolina Panthers on October 20, 2024.

==After football==
In 2006, Green was encouraged to run for the United States Senate by the Republican Party of Virginia. The Virginia Republicans wanted Green to enter into politics because of his longtime support for the community and dedication to Christianity.

Green was in the news on February 16, 2010, his 50th birthday, for reportedly running a 4.43-second 40-yard dash.

On April 26, 2013, Green announced that he had accepted a position as Special Assistant for Student–Athlete Development and Public Relations at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

On August 22, 2016, Green announced that he had accepted a position as an associate athletics director and special assistant to the athletic director at George Mason University.

===Business===
Green has a professional services company that manages his appearances and autograph requests, www.DarrellGreen.com. Green is currently an associate athletic director at George Mason University working with student-athletes to improve their well-being, and collaborating with the community. He also started an online fitness company promoting increased physical activity through simply walking called WalkFitHealth Nation.

===Charities and foundations===
In 1988, Green founded the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation, a faith-based charitable organization, in an effort to &quot;meet the needs of children, their families and the communities in which they live.&quot;

In addition, he served as a board member for the Baltimore-Washington 2012 Summer Olympics bid, NFL/NFLPA September 11 Relief Fund, and the Loudoun Education Foundation. In 2003, he was selected to serve as the Chair of President George W. Bush&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation. He currently sits on the boards of the Wolf Trap Foundation as its National Spokesman for Education and Marymount University.

===Honors===

In 1999, while still active, Green was ranked number 81 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

Green has received honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters from Marymount University in 1999, and St. Paul&#x27;s College and George Washington University in 2002.

In 2004, Green was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 2, 2008. His fellow Hall of Fame classmates include former Redskins teammate Art Monk, and his former position coach Emmitt Thomas. Green has also been inducted into the NCAA Division II Hall of Fame, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, the Lone Star Conference Hall of Honor and the Javelina Hall of Fame.

In December 2007, Green was voted the All-Time Redskins Legend in a WUSA-TV Channel 9 online poll.

In Loudoun County, Virginia, where Green lives, State Route 28 is named Darrell Green Boulevard.

On February 4, 2018, as part of the post-game celebrations for the Philadelphia Eagles winning Super Bowl LII, Green was given the honor of bringing the Lombardi Trophy to the podium as it was presented to the Eagles for their 41–33 victory over the New England Patriots.

==Personal life==
Green is married to his wife Jewel and has four children. His eldest son Jared is a pastor. He and his wife live in Ashburn, Virginia.

In 2013, he and Art Monk agreed that the name Redskins should possibly be changed.

<doc id="407614" wikidata="Q775208" url="?curid=407614" title="The Clash (album)">
<text>The Clash is the debut studio album by the English punk rock band the Clash, released on 8 April 1977 through CBS Records. Recorded and mixed over three weeks in February 1977 for £4,000, it would go on to reach No. 12 on the UK charts, and has been included on many retrospective rankings as one of the greatest punk albums of all time.

Songs on the album were composed by guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, with the notable exception of the reggae cover &quot;Police and Thieves&quot;. The song &quot;What&#x27;s My Name&quot; is co-credited to Clash founding member Keith Levene, who left the band in September 1976.

Several songs from the album&#x27;s recording sessions, including &quot;Janie Jones&quot;, &quot;White Riot&quot;, and &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; became classics of the punk genre and were among the first punk songs to see significant presence on singles charts. &quot;The Clash&quot; featured Jones and Strummer sharing guitar and vocal duties, with Paul Simonon on bass and Terry Chimes on drums, his only studio appearance with the band (Chimes and Rob Harper drummed intermittently with The Clash until Topper Headon joined the band as permanent drummer in May 1977). Chimes was credited as &quot;Tory Crimes&quot; on the album&#x27;s original sleeve.

&quot;The Clash&quot; was not released in the US until 1979, making it the band&#x27;s second US release. The US version also included a significantly different track listing, changing the track order and swapping out several songs for non-album tracks recorded in the interim.

== Background ==
Most of the album was conceived on the 18th floor of a council high rise on London&#x27;s Harrow Road, in a flat that was rented by Mick Jones&#x27;s grandmother, who frequently went to see their live concerts. The album was recorded over three weekend sessions at CBS Studio 3 in February 1977. By the third of these sessions, the album was recorded and mixed to completion, with the tapes being delivered to CBS at the start of March. It cost £4,000 to produce.

=== Album cover ===
The cover artwork was designed by Polish artist Rosław Szaybo. The album&#x27;s front cover photo, shot by Kate Simon, was taken in the alleyway directly opposite the front door of the band&#x27;s &#x27;Rehearsal Rehearsals&#x27; building in Camden Market. Drummer Terry Chimes, though a full member of the Clash at the time, did not appear in the picture as he had already decided to leave the group. Another picture from the same Kate Simon photoshoot appears on the UK Special Edition DVD of &quot;Rude Boy&quot;, released in 2003. The picture of the charging police officers on the rear, shot by Rocco Macauly, was taken during the 1976 riot at the Notting Hill Carnival—the inspiration for the track &quot;White Riot&quot;.

=== Songs ===
The subject of the opening track, &quot;Janie Jones&quot;, was a famous brothel keeper in London during the 1970s. &quot;Remote Control&quot; was written by Mick Jones after the &quot;Anarchy Tour&quot; and contains pointed observations about the civic hall bureaucrats who had cancelled concerts, the police, big business and especially record companies. CBS decided to release the song as a single without consulting the band. &quot;I&#x27;m So Bored with the USA&quot;, developed from a Mick Jones song titled &quot;I&#x27;m So Bored with You&quot;, condemns the Americanization of the UK. &quot;White Riot&quot; was the Clash&#x27;s debut single. The song is short and intense, in a punk style of two chords played very fast (five chords are used in the whole song). Lyrically, it is about class economics and race.

&quot;Career Opportunities&quot;, the opening track of the second side of the album, attacks the political and economic situation in England at the time, citing the lack of jobs available, and the dreariness and lack of appeal of those that were available.
&quot;Protex Blue&quot;, sung by Mick Jones, is about a 1970s brand of condom. It was inspired by the contraceptive vending machine in the Windsor Castle&#x27;s toilets. The song ends with the shouted phrase &quot;Johnny Johnny!&quot;, johnny being a British slang term for a condom.

The version of &quot;White Riot&quot; featured on the album was not recorded for the album; the original demo (recorded at Beaconsfield Studios before the band signed to CBS) was used instead.

&quot;Police &amp; Thieves&quot; was added to the album when the group realised that the track listing was too short. Another cover the band played at these sessions was The Wailers&#x27; &quot;Dancing Shoes&quot;. &quot;Garageland&quot; was written in response to Charles Shaar Murray&#x27;s damning review of the Clash&#x27;s early appearance at the Sex Pistols Screen on the Green concert – &quot;The Clash are the kind of garage band who should be returned to the garage immediately, preferably with the engine running&quot;. It was the final track recorded for the album.

== Release ==
&quot;The Clash&quot; was released in the United Kingdom through CBS Records on 8 April 1977, engineered by CBS staff engineer Simon Humphrey and produced by Clash live soundman Mickey Foote, at the (since demolished) CBS Whitfield Street Studio No. 3. &quot;The Clash&quot; was unusually musically varied for a punk band, with reggae and early rock and roll influences plainly evident.

=== Reception ===
&quot;The Clash&quot; received critical acclaim and peaked at number 12 in the UK charts.

When the album was released in April 1977, Tony Parsons wrote in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;: “Jones and Strummer write with graphic perception about contemporary Great British urban reality as though it’s suffocating them … Their songs don’t lie … The Clash have made an album that consists of some of the most exciting rock’n’roll in contemporary music.” Mark Perry declared in &quot;Sniffin’ Glue&quot;: “The Clash album is like a mirror. It reflects all the shit. It shows us the truth. To me, it is the most important album ever released.” The review by Kris Needs in April 1977&#x27;s &quot;Zigzag&quot; announced: “This is the most exciting album I’ve heard in years … it’s one of the most important records ever made.”

In his 1979 consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau gave the album&#x27;s US release an &quot;A&quot; grade and stated, &quot;Cut for cut, this may be the greatest rock and roll album (plus limited-edition bonus single) ever manufactured in the U.S. It offers 10 of the 14 titles on the band&#x27;s British debut as well as 7 of the 13 available only on 45. [...] The U.K. version of &quot;The Clash&quot; is the greatest rock and roll album ever manufactured anywhere&quot;. In his decade-end list for the newspaper, he ranked the UK version as the best album of the 1970s.

In 1993, the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; ranked the album number 13 on its list of the greatest albums of all time. &quot;NME&quot; also ranked &quot;The Clash&quot; number three on its list of the Greatest Albums of the &#x27;70s, and wrote in the review that &quot;the speed-freaked brain of punk set to the tinniest, most frantic guitars ever trapped on vinyl. Lives were changed beyond recognition by it&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Q&quot; magazine wrote that the Clash &quot;would never sound so punk as they did on 1977&#x27;s self-titled debut&quot;, calling it a &quot;lyrically intricate&quot; album that &quot;still howled with anger&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described &quot;The Clash&quot; as &quot;the eternal punk album&quot; and &quot;a blueprint for the pantomime of &#x27;punkier&#x27; rock acts&quot;, concluding that &quot;for all of its forced politics and angst, &quot;The Clash&quot; continues to sound crucial.&quot;

&quot;The Clash&quot; was voted number 180 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;The Clash&quot; at number 48 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; in 2000, and included the album in its &quot;100 Best Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list in 2002. &quot;Spin&quot; ranked the album at number three on its 2001 list of the &quot;50 Most Essential Punk Records&quot;, calling it &quot;punk as alienated rage, as anticorporate blather, as joyous racial confusion, as evangelic outreach and white knuckles and haywire impulses&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked &quot;The Clash&quot; at second place on its list of the &quot;Top 50 Punk Albums&quot;, deeming it &quot;the ultimate punk protest album&quot;. The same year, the US version was ranked number 77 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was re-ranked at number 81 in 2012, and at number 102 in the 2020 update. The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Noted Jamaican producer Lee Perry heard the album while in London in 1977, and played it to Bob Marley, who in turn mentioned the Clash on his own track &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot;.

==1979 US version==
In the United States, the Clash&#x27;s debut studio album was released one year after &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot;, making it their second release in the US. CBS in America had decided that the album was &#x27;not radio friendly&#x27;, so it was initially only available in the States during 1977–1978 as an import, and as such became the best-selling import of the year, selling over 100,000 copies.

In July 1979, Epic released a modified version of the album for the United States market. This version replaced four songs from the original version with five non-album singles and B-sides, some of which were recorded and released after the Clash&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; (1978). It also used the re-recorded single version of &quot;White Riot&quot;, rather than the original take featured on the UK version. Owing to its inclusion of non-album singles, the US edition of &quot;The Clash&quot; could be considered a de facto compilation album.

Omitted from the US version of &quot;The Clash&quot; were the following tracks:
* &quot;Deny&quot;
* &quot;Cheat&quot;
* &quot;Protex Blue&quot;
* &quot;48 Hours&quot;
* &quot;White Riot&quot; (original version)

Added were the following tracks:
* &quot;Clash City Rockers&quot; 
* &quot;Complete Control&quot; 
* &quot;White Riot&quot; (re-recorded version) 
* &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot; 
* &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; 
* &quot;Jail Guitar Doors&quot; 

Initial copies of the US version also came with a bonus 7-inch single which featured &quot;Groovy Times&quot; and &quot;Gates of the West&quot;. The liner notes incorrectly credit new drummer Nicky Headon for &quot;White Riot&quot;.

It was another moderately successful album for the Clash in the United States, even though the sales were likely diluted by the longstanding popularity of the UK version on the import market. &quot;The Clash&quot; peaked at number 126 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, setting the stage for the commercial breakthrough of &quot;London Calling&quot; later that year. Since the Clash&#x27;s first UK album had already been released in Canada by CBS Records, when CBS Canada released the US version, they changed the cover art so as to not confuse the record-buying public. The CBS Canada version of the LP has a dark blue border instead of green. Initial copies also contained the bonus &quot;Groovy Times&quot; 7&quot;. Some original cassette pressings of the US version featured &quot;What&#x27;s My Name?&quot; as track 4 and &quot;Complete Control&quot; as track 11. Though the back of these original pressings list the two songs as they are featured on recent versions of the album.

<doc id="407615" wikidata="Q339975" url="?curid=407615" title="Sodium nitrite">
<text>Sodium nitrite is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a white to slightly yellowish crystalline powder that is very soluble in water and is hygroscopic. From an industrial perspective, it is the most important nitrite salt. It is a precursor to a variety of organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, and pesticides, but it is probably best known as a food additive used in processed meats and (in some countries) in fish products.

== Uses ==

=== Industrial chemistry ===
The main use of sodium nitrite is for the industrial production of organonitrogen compounds. It is a reagent for conversion of amines into diazo compounds, which are key precursors to many dyes, such as diazo dyes. Nitroso compounds are produced from nitrites. These are used in the rubber industry.

It is used in a variety of metallurgical applications, for phosphatizing and detinning.

Sodium nitrite is an effective corrosion inhibitor and is used as an additive in industrial greases, as an aqueous solution in closed loop cooling systems, and in a molten state as a heat transfer medium.

=== Food additive and preservative ===
Sodium nitrite is used to speed up the curing of meat, inhibit the germination of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; spores, and also impart an attractive pink color. Nitrite reacts with the meat myoglobin to cause color changes, first converting to nitrosomyoglobin (bright red), then, on heating, to nitrosohemochrome (a pink pigment).

Historically, salt has been used for the preservation of meat. The salt-preserved meat product was usually brownish-gray in color. When sodium nitrite is added with the salt, the meat develops a red, then pink color, which is associated with cured meats such as ham, bacon, hot dogs, and bologna.

In the early 1900s, irregular curing was commonplace. This led to further research surrounding the use of sodium nitrite as an additive in food, standardizing the amount present in foods to minimize the amount needed while maximizing its food additive role. Through this research, sodium nitrite has been found to give taste and color to the meat and inhibit lipid oxidation that leads to rancidity, with varying degrees of effectiveness for controlling growth of disease-causing microorganisms. The ability of sodium nitrite to address the above-mentioned issues has led to production of meat with extended storage life and has improved desirable color and taste. According to scientists working for the meat industry, nitrite has improved food safety. This view is disputed in the light of the possible carcinogenic effects caused by adding nitrites to meat.

Nitrite has the E number E250. Potassium nitrite (E249) is used in the same way. It is approved for usage in the European Union, USA, and Australia and New Zealand.

In meat processing, sodium nitrite is never used in a pure state but always mixed with common salt. This mixture is known as nitrited salt, curing salt or nitrited curing salt. In Europe, nitrited curing salt contains between 99.1% and 99.5% common salt and between 0.5% and 0.9% nitrite. In the US, nitrited curing salt is dosed at 6.25% and must be remixed with salt before use.

==== Color and taste ====
The appearance and taste of meat is an important component of consumer acceptance. Sodium nitrite is responsible for the desirable red color (or shaded pink) of meat. Very little nitrite is needed to induce this change. It has been reported that as little as 2 to 14 parts per million (ppm) is needed to induce this desirable color change. However, to extend the lifespan of this color change, significantly higher levels are needed. The mechanism responsible for this color change is the formation of nitrosylating agents by nitrite, which has the ability to transfer nitric oxide that subsequently reacts with myoglobin to produce the cured meat color. The unique taste associated with cured meat is also affected by the addition of sodium nitrite. However, the mechanism underlying this change in taste is still not fully understood.

==== Inhibition of microbial pathogens ====
In conjunction with salt and pH levels, sodium nitrite reduces the ability of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; spores to grow to the point of producing toxin. Some dry-cured meat products are manufactured without nitrites. For example, Parma ham, which has been produced without nitrite since 1993, was reported in 2018 to have caused no cases of botulism. This is because the interior of the muscle is sterile and the surface is exposed to oxygen.

Sodium nitrite has shown varying degrees of effectiveness for controlling growth of other spoilage or disease causing microorganisms. Although the inhibitory mechanisms are not well known, its effectiveness depends on several factors including residual nitrite level, pH, salt concentration, reductants present and iron content. The type of bacteria also affects sodium nitrite&#x27;s effectiveness. It is generally agreed that sodium nitrite is not effective for controlling Gram-negative enteric pathogens such as &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

Other food additives (such as lactate and sorbate) provide similar protection against bacteria, but do not provide the desired pink color.

==== Inhibition of lipid peroxidation ====
Sodium nitrite is also able to effectively delay the development of oxidative rancidity. Lipid peroxidation is considered to be a major reason for the deterioration of quality of meat products (rancidity and unappetizing flavors). Sodium nitrite acts as an antioxidant in a mechanism similar to the one responsible for the coloring effect. Nitrite reacts with heme proteins and metal ions, neutralizing free radicals by nitric oxide (one of its byproducts). Neutralization of these free radicals terminates the cycle of lipid oxidation that leads to rancidity.

=== Medication ===

Sodium nitrite is used as a medication together with sodium thiosulfate to treat cyanide poisoning. It is recommended only in severe cases of cyanide poisoning and has largely been replaced by use of hydroxocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12, but given in much higher doses than needed nutritionally.
In those who have both cyanide poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning sodium thiosulfate by itself is usually recommended if the facility does not have sufficient hydroxycobalamin. It is given by slow injection into a vein.

 side effects are chiefly related to creation of methemoglobinemia and vasodilation. Side effects can include low blood pressure, headache, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, and vomiting. Greater care should be taken in people with underlying heart disease. The patient&#x27;s levels of methemoglobin should be regularly checked during treatment. While not well studied during pregnancy, there is some evidence of potential harm to the baby. Sodium nitrite works by creating methemoglobin, where the iron atom at the center of the heme group is in the oxidized ferric () state, which binds with cyanide with greater affinity than its binding to the cytochrome C oxidase, and thus removes it from blocking the metabolic function of mitochondria.

Sodium nitrite came into medical use in the 1920s and 1930s. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

=== Suicide ===
Several academic publications in 2020 and 2021 have discussed the toxicity of sodium nitrite, and an apparent recent increase in suicides using sodium nitrite which had been ordered online. The usage of sodium nitrite as a suicide method has been heavily discussed on suicide forums, primarily Sanctioned Suicide.

Sodium nitrite was also the focal-point of the &quot;McCarthy et al. v Amazon&quot; lawsuit alleging that Amazon knowingly assisted in the deaths of healthy children by selling them &quot;suicide kits&quot; as Amazon&#x27;s &quot;frequently bought together&quot; feature recommended buying sodium nitrite, an antiemetic, and a suicide instruction book together. This lawsuit was dismissed in June 2023. The online marketplace eBay has globally prohibited the sale of sodium nitrite since 2019. Some online vendors of sodium nitrite have been prosecuted for assisting suicide. Furthermore, legislation has been introduced in the United States with the aim of deeming sodium nitrite products with a sodium nitrite concentration of greater than 10% by volume to be banned consumer products under the Consumer Product Safety Act.

In cases of suspected suicide involving sodium nitrite, it is critical that responding individuals administer immediate methylene blue. Methylene blue is the antidote to the methemoglobinemia caused by intentional ingestion of sodium nitrite as a suicide agent.

==Toxicity ==
Sodium nitrite is toxic. The LD50 in rats is 180 mg/kg and in humans LDLo is 71 mg/kg. The mechanism by which sodium nitrite causes death is methemoglobinemia. The oftentimes severe methemoglobinemia found in sodium nitrite poisoning cases results in systemic hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, and cyanosis. The reported signs of sodium nitrite poisoning are as follows:

With prompt action, sodium nitrite poisoning is reversible using an antidote, methylene blue. It has been reported that sodium nitrite poisoning can also be detected post-mortem:

Death by sodium nitrite ingestion can happen at lower doses than the LDLo. Sodium nitrite has been used for homicide and suicide. To prevent accidental intoxication, sodium nitrite (blended with salt) sold as a food additive in the US is dyed bright pink to avoid mistaking it for plain salt or sugar. In other countries, nitrited curing salt is not dyed but is strictly regulated.

=== Occurrence in vegetables ===
Nitrites do not occur naturally in vegetables in significant quantities, but deliberate fermentation of celery juice, for instance, with a naturally high level of nitrates, can produce nitrite levels sufficient for commercial meat curing. Boiling vegetables does not affect nitrite levels.

The presence of nitrite in animal tissue is a consequence of metabolism of nitric oxide, an important neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide can be created &quot;&quot; from nitric oxide synthase utilizing arginine or from ingested nitrite.

=== Pigs ===
Due to sodium nitrite&#x27;s high level of toxicity to swine (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) it is now being developed in Australia to control feral pigs and wild boar. The sodium nitrite induces methemoglobinemia in swine, i.e. it reduces the amount of oxygen that is released from hemoglobin, so the animal will feel faint and pass out, and then die in a humane manner after first being rendered unconscious. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department operates a research facility at Kerr Wildlife Management Area, where they examine feral pig feeding preferences and bait tactics to administer sodium nitrite.

=== Cancer ===
Carcinogenicity is the ability or tendency of a chemical to induce tumors, increase their incidence or malignancy, or shorten the time of tumor occurrence.

Adding nitrites to meat has been shown to generate known carcinogens such as nitrosamines; the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that of &quot;processed meats&quot; a day would raise the risk of getting bowel cancer by 18% over a lifetime, and eating larger amounts raises the risk more. The World Health Organization&#x27;s review of more than 400 studies concluded, in 2015, that there was sufficient evidence that &quot;processed meats&quot; caused cancer, particularly colon cancer; the WHO&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified &quot;processed meats&quot; as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1); &quot;processed meat&quot; meaning meat that has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavour or improve preservation.).

Nitrosamines can be formed during the curing process used to preserve meats, when sodium nitrite-treated meat is cooked, and also from the reaction of nitrite with secondary amines under acidic conditions (such as occurs in the human stomach). Dietary sources of nitrosamines include US cured meats preserved with sodium nitrite as well as the dried salted fish eaten in Japan. In the 1920s, a significant change in US meat curing practices resulted in a 69% decrease in average nitrite content. This event preceded the beginning of a dramatic decline in gastric cancer mortality. Around 1970, it was found that ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an antioxidant, inhibits nitrosamine formation. Consequently, the addition of at least 550 ppm of ascorbic acid is required in meats manufactured in the United States. Manufacturers sometimes instead use erythorbic acid, a cheaper but equally effective isomer of ascorbic acid. Additionally, manufacturers may include α-tocopherol (vitamin E) to further inhibit nitrosamine production. α-Tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and erythorbic acid all inhibit nitrosamine production by their oxidation-reduction properties. Ascorbic acid, for example, forms dehydroascorbic acid when oxidized, which when in the presence of nitrosonium, a potent nitrosating agent formed from sodium nitrite, reduces the nitrosonium into nitric oxide. The nitrosonium ion formed in acidic nitrite solutions is commonly mislabeled nitrous anhydride, an unstable nitrogen oxide that cannot exist in vitro.

Ingesting nitrite under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation has been classified as &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot; by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

Sodium nitrite consumption has also been linked to the triggering of migraines in individuals who already experience them.

One study has found a correlation between highly frequent ingestion of meats cured with pink salt and the COPD form of lung disease. The study&#x27;s researchers suggest that the high amount of nitrites in the meats was responsible; however, the team did not prove the nitrite theory. Additionally, the study does not prove that nitrites or cured meat caused higher rates of COPD, merely a link. The researchers did adjust for many of COPD&#x27;s risk factors, but they commented they cannot rule out all possible unmeasurable causes or risks for COPD.

== Production ==
Industrial production of sodium nitrite follows one of two processes, the reduction of nitrate salts, or the oxidation of lower nitrogen oxides.

One method uses molten sodium nitrate as the salt, and lead which is oxidized, while a more modern method uses scrap iron filings to reduce the nitrate.

A more commonly used method involves the general reaction of nitrogen oxides in alkaline aqueous solution, with the addition of a catalyst. The exact conditions depend on which nitrogen oxides are used, and what the oxidant is, as the conditions need to be carefully controlled to avoid over oxidation of the nitrogen atom.
:

Sodium nitrite has also been produced by reduction of nitrate salts by exposure to heat, light, ionizing radiation, metals, hydrogen, and electrolytic reduction.

== Chemical reactions ==

In the laboratory, sodium nitrite can be used to destroy excess sodium azide.

Above 330 °C sodium nitrite decomposes (in air) to sodium oxide, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.

Sodium nitrite can also be used in the production of nitrous acid:

The nitrous acid then, under normal conditions, decomposes:

The resulting nitrogen dioxide hydrolyzes to a mixture of nitric and nitrous acids:

== Isotope labelling 15N ==

In organic synthesis isotope enriched sodium nitrite-15N can be used instead of normal sodium nitrite as their reactivity is nearly identical in most reactions.

The obtained products carry isotope 15N and hence nitrogen NMR can be efficiently carried out.

<text>Vietnam is divided into 63 first-level subdivisions, comprising fifty-seven provinces () and six municipalities under the command of the central government (). Municipalities are the highest-ranked cities in Vietnam. Municipalities are centrally-controlled cities and have special status equal to that of the provinces.

The provinces are divided into provincial cities (), municipal cities (&quot;thành phố trực thuộc thành phố trung ương&quot;), towns/borough (), urban district (&quot;quận&quot;), and rural districts () as the second-tier units. At the third tier, a provincial city or town is divided into wards (), communes (), and townships ().

==Governance==

===Provincial Committee of the Communist Party===
Provincial Committee of the Communist Party (&quot;Đảng bộ Đảng Cộng sản cấp tỉnh&quot; or &quot;Tỉnh ủy Đảng Cộng sản&quot;) is a provincial subordinate of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Since Vietnam is a one party state, the provincial committee of the Communist Party is the most prominent organ of provincial governance.

Each provincial committee of the Communist Party is headed by a Secretary (&quot;Bí thư&quot;). The Secretary is de facto leader of the province.

===People&#x27;s Council===
The legislative branch of a province is the People&#x27;s Council (&quot;Hội đồng Nhân dân&quot; or HDND for short). The People&#x27;s Council votes on the policy, regulations and orders for development of the province.

Members of the People&#x27;s Council are called delegates or councillors (&quot;đại biểu&quot;) and are elected by people living within that province. It is equivalent to the legislative National Assembly of Vietnam. The People&#x27;s Council is headed by a Chairman (&quot;Chủ tịch&quot;) and a Vice Chairman (&quot;Phó Chủ tịch&quot;).

The number of councillors varies from province to province, depending on the population of that province. The People&#x27;s Council appoints a People&#x27;s Committee, which acts as the executive arm of the provincial governance. This arrangement is a somewhat simplified version of the situation in Vietnam&#x27;s national government. Provincial governments are subordinates to the central government.

===People&#x27;s Committee===

The executive branch of a province is the People&#x27;s Committee (&quot;Uỷ ban Nhân dân&quot; or UBND for short). The People&#x27;s Committee is responsible for implementing policy and executing laws and orders. The People&#x27;s Committee is equivalent to the executive Government of Vietnam. People&#x27;s Committee also manages the provincial departments (&quot;Sở&quot;) which are equivalent to the Ministries.

Members of the People&#x27;s Committee are called commissioners (&quot;Ủy viên&quot;). The People&#x27;s Committee is headed by a Chairman (&quot;Chủ tịch&quot;) and Vice Chairmen (&quot;Phó Chủ tịch&quot;), and consists of between 4 and 7 commissioners. The number of commissioners depends on the population of the province. The chairman and Vice Chairmen of the People&#x27;s Committee are also councillors of the People&#x27;s Council.

===People&#x27;s Court===
The judiciary branch of a province is the People&#x27;s Court (&quot;Tòa án Nhân dân&quot; or TAND for short). The People&#x27;s Court is responsible for judiciary processes and trials. The People&#x27;s Court is equivalent to the judiciary Supreme People&#x27;s Court of Vietnam.

The People&#x27;s Court is headed by a Chief Judge (&quot;Chánh án&quot;) and consists of a number of judges (&quot;thẩm phán&quot;).

===Police Department===
The provincial police department is under direct command of the Ministry of Public Security.

===State Treasury===

===Provincial Military Command===

==List and statistics==

According to the census results of April 1, 2019, the population of Vietnam was 96,208,984. The most populous top-level administrative unit is Hồ Chí Minh City, one of the five centrally governed cities, having 9,125,000 people living within its official boundary. The second most populous administrative unit is the recently expanded Hà Nội with 8,146,000 people. Prior to the expansion of the capital city, this rank belonged to Thanh Hóa with 3,689,000 people. The least populous is Bắc Kạn, a mountainous province in the remote northeast with 338,000 people.

In land area, the largest province is Nghệ An, which runs from the city of Vinh up the wide Sông Cả valley. The smallest is Bắc Ninh, located in the populous Red River Delta region.

The following is a table of Vietnam&#x27;s provinces broken down by population and area, according to the 2023 Census and the 2018 area data from Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. Municipalities are written in bold.

==Regions==

The Vietnamese government often groups the various provinces into eight regions, which are often grouped into three macro-regions: Northern, Central and Southern. These regions are not always used, and alternative classifications are possible. The regions include:
 Municipality (thành phố trực thuộc trung ương)

<text>Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server (or pool of servers). This allows one server to share its resources, such as memory and processor cycles, without requiring all services provided to use the same host name. The term virtual hosting is usually used in reference to web servers but the principles do carry over to other Internet services.

One widely used application is shared web hosting. The price for shared web hosting is lower than for a dedicated web server because many customers can be hosted on a single server. It is also very common for a single entity to want to use multiple names on the same machine so that the names can reflect services offered rather than where those services happen to be hosted.

There are two main types of virtual hosting, name-based and IP-based. Name-based virtual hosting uses the host name presented by the client. This saves IP addresses and the associated administrative overhead but the protocol being served must supply the host name at an appropriate point. In particular, there are significant difficulties using name-based virtual hosting with SSL/TLS. IP-based virtual hosting uses a separate IP address for each host name, and it can be performed with any protocol but requires a dedicated IP address per domain name served. Port-based virtual hosting is also possible in principle but is rarely used in practice because it is unfriendly to users.

Name-based and IP-based virtual hosting can be combined: a server may have multiple IP addresses and serve multiple names on some or all of those IP addresses. This technique can be useful when using SSL/TLS with wildcard certificates. For example, if a server operator had two certificates, one for *.example.com and one for *.example.net, the operator could serve foo.example.com and bar.example.com off the same IP address but would need a separate IP address for baz.example.net.

==Name-based==
Name-based virtual hosts use multiple host names for the same IP address.

A technical prerequisite needed for name-based virtual hosts is a web browser with HTTP/1.1 support (commonplace today) to include the target hostname in the request. This allows a server hosting multiple sites behind one IP address to deliver the correct site&#x27;s content. More specifically it means setting the HTTP header, which is mandatory in HTTP/1.1.

For instance, a server could be receiving requests for two domains, and , both of which resolve to the same IP address. For , the server would send the HTML file from the directory , while requests for would make the server serve pages from . Equally two subdomains of the same domain may be hosted together. For instance, a blog server may host both blog1.example.com and blog2.example.com.

The biggest issue with name-based virtual hosting is that it is difficult to host multiple secure websites running SSL/TLS. Because the SSL/TLS handshake takes place before the expected hostname is sent to the server, the server doesn&#x27;t know which certificate to present in the handshake. It is possible for a single certificate to cover multiple names either through the &quot;subjectaltname&quot; field or through wildcards but the practical application of this approach is limited by administrative considerations and by the matching rules for wildcards. There is an extension to TLS called Server Name Indication, that presents the name at the start of the handshake to circumvent that issue, except for some older clients (in particular Internet Explorer on Windows XP or older Android versions) which do not implement SNI.

Furthermore, if the Domain Name System (DNS) is not properly functioning, it is difficult to access a virtually-hosted website even if the IP address is known. If the user tries to fall back to using the IP address to contact the system, as in , the web browser will send the IP address as the host name. Since the web server relies on the web browser client telling it what server name (vhost) to use, the server will respond with a default website—often not the site the user expects.

A workaround in this case is to add the IP address and host name to the client system&#x27;s hosts file. Accessing the server with the domain name should work again. Users should be careful when doing this, however, as any changes to the true mapping between host name and IP address will be overridden by the local setting. This workaround is not really useful for an average web user, but may be of some use to a site administrator while fixing DNS records.

==IP-based==
When IP-based virtual hosting is used, each site (either a DNS host name or a group of DNS host names that act the same) points to a unique IP address. The webserver is configured with multiple physical network interfaces, virtual network interfaces on the same physical interface or multiple IP addresses on one interface.
The web server can either open separate listening sockets for each IP address, or it can listen on all interfaces with a single socket and obtain the IP address the TCP connection was received on after accepting the connections. Either way, it can use the IP address to determine which website to serve. The client is not involved in this process and therefore (unlike with name-based virtual hosting) there are no compatibility issues.

The downside of this approach is the server needs a different IP address for every web site. This increases administrative overhead (both assigning addresses to servers and justifying the use of those addresses to internet registries) and contributes to IPv4 address exhaustion.

==Uses==
Virtual web hosting is often used on a large scale in companies whose business model is to provide low cost website hosting for customers. The vast majority of web hosting service customer websites worldwide are hosted on shared servers, using virtual hosting technology.

Many business companies utilize virtual servers for internal purposes, where there is a technological or administrative reason to operate several separate websites, such as a customer extranet website, employee extranet, internal intranet, and intranets for different departments. If there are no security concerns in the website architectures, they can be merged into a single server using virtual hosting technology, which reduces management and administrative overhead and the number of separate servers required to support the business.

<doc id="407620" wikidata="Q1618457" url="?curid=407620" title="Devil's club">
<text>Devil&#x27;s club or Devil&#x27;s walking stick (Oplopanax horridus, Araliaceae; syn. &quot;Echinopanax horridus&quot;, &quot;Fatsia horrida&quot;) is a large understory shrub native to the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, but also disjunct on islands in Lake Superior. It is noted for its large palmate leaves and erect, woody stems covered in noxious and irritating spines. It is also known as Alaskan ginseng and similar names, although it is not a true ginseng.

== Description ==

Devil&#x27;s club generally grows to tall. Some stands located in rainforest gullies or moist, undisturbed areas can reach heights of or more. The spines are found along the upper and lower surfaces of veins of its leaves as well as the stems. The leaves are spirally arranged on the stems, simple, palmately lobed with 5–13 lobes, across. The flowers are produced in dense umbels diameter, each flower small, with five greenish-white petals. The fruit is a small red drupe diameter.

The plant is covered with brittle yellow spines that break off easily if the plants are handled or disturbed, and the entire plant has been described as having a &quot;primordial&quot; appearance. The plants are slow growing and take many years to reach seed-bearing maturity; this makes them very sensitive to human impact as they do not reproduce quickly.

Devil&#x27;s club reproduces by forming clonal colonies by means of rhizomes. What can appear to be several different plants may actually have all been one plant originally, with the clones detaching themselves after becoming established by laying down roots.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species usually grows in moist, dense forest habitats, and is most abundant in old-growth conifer forests in the Pacific Northwest. It is found from southcentral Alaska south to Oregon, and eastward to western Alberta and Montana. Disjunct native populations also occur over away in Lake Superior on Isle Royale and Passage Island, Michigan and Porphyry Island and Slate Island, Ontario.

==Ecology==
Bears and other wildlife consume the berries.

==Adverse effects==
The berry is inedible to humans. Touching the spiny plant may cause irritation.

==Uses==

Traditionally, the charcoal from the stalks is still used to make ceremonial and protective face paints, and among the Ditidaht and neighboring groups, it was equally significant to red ochre as a symbolic link to the spirit world. Indigenous peoples such as the Tlingit and Haida have used the plant as traditional medicine for ailments such as adult-onset diabetes, as well as rheumatoid arthritis.

The plant has been used ceremonially by the Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Haida people residing in Southeast Alaska and coastal British Columbia. A piece of Devil&#x27;s club hung over a doorway is said to ward off evil. The plant is harvested and used in a variety of ways, most commonly as an oral tea in traditional settings, but also poultices and ointments. Native Americans also dried and powdered the bark for use as a deodorant and used the mashed berries to clean hair.

Because devil&#x27;s club is related to American ginseng, some people try to market the plant as an &#x27;adaptogen&#x27;. The plant has been harvested for this purpose and sold widely as &quot;Alaskan ginseng&quot;. Despite some morphological similarities between the araliaceous members &quot;Panax&quot; (&#x27;true&#x27; ginseng), &quot;Eleutherococcus senticosus&quot; (&quot;Siberian ginseng&quot;) and devil&#x27;s club, the different genera are chemically diverse.

===Research===
An &quot;in vitro&quot; study showed that extracts of devil&#x27;s club might inhibit tuberculosis. Another study suggested devil&#x27;s club may reduce leukemia burden in mice engrafted with murine C1498 acute myeloid leukemia cells.

<text>Mark Henry Belanger (June 8, 1944 – October 6, 1998), nicknamed &quot;the Blade,&quot; was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from through , most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won six American League East division titles, five American League pennants, and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1979.

A defensive standout, Belanger won eight Gold Glove Awards between 1969 and 1978, leading the American League in assists and fielding percentage three times each; he retired with the highest career fielding percentage by an AL shortstop (.977). In defensive Wins Above Replacement (WAR), Belanger is tied with Ozzie Smith and Joe Tinker for most times as league leader with six. Belanger set franchise records for career games, assists, and double plays as a shortstop, all of which were later broken by Cal Ripken Jr. After his playing career, he became an official with the Major League Baseball Players Association. In 1983, Belanger was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame. He has been described as &quot;the most electrifying defensive shortstop of his generation...&quot;

==Early life==
Belanger was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and attended Pittsfield High School, where he played baseball and basketball. On the basketball court, he became the school&#x27;s first 1,000-point scorer, scoring 1,455 points in three years. He led his team to the 1962 Western Massachusetts championship game and a 59-10 record over those three years. He was recruited by the Orioles as an amateur in and made his debut with the club on August 7, .

==Career==
Belanger took over as the Orioles&#x27; regular shortstop in late from future hall of famer Luis Aparicio, and held the position for more than a decade. He hit his first Major League home run at Yankee Stadium on May 14, 1967, off Yankees&#x27; ace Mel Stottlemyre. This was in the same game that Mickey Mantle hit his 500th home run. 

Belanger was nicknamed &quot;The Blade&quot; because of his tall and narrow frame—6&#x27;1&quot; (1.85 m) and 170 pounds (77 kg). Despite his reputation as one of the best fielding shortstops in Major League history, Belanger was known as a poor hitter. In 1970, he finished last among qualifying AL players in all three Triple Crown categories. In his 18 seasons in the Major Leagues, Belanger hit only 20 home runs and had a lifetime batting average of .228, only topping the .230 mark over a full season three times. His .228 lifetime batting average is the third-lowest of any Major League player with more than 5,000 career at bats, ahead of only George McBride (.218) and Ed Brinkman (.224), another gold glove shortstop of that era. Belanger also finished his career with the seventh-lowest batting average of any non-catcher with at least 2,500 at bats since 1920. Despite his famously poor hitting, Belanger had substantial success against some of the best pitchers of his era, including Bert Blyleven, Nolan Ryan and Tommy John.
Belanger was a flashy fielder and won eight AL Gold Gloves (1969, 1971, and 1973–78). He was also named to the All-Star team in 1976. Belanger joined a select group of shortstop-second baseman combinations who each won Gold Gloves in the same season while playing together (in and with Davey Johnson and again with Bobby Grich each year between and ). Because Brooks Robinson won the AL Gold Glove at third base each season during the 1960–1975 stretch, the left side of the Orioles&#x27; infield was seemingly impenetrable.

He hit a rare home run in the first American League Championship Series game ever played in 1969. After uncharacteristically hitting .333 in the 1970 ALCS, his contributions led to the Orioles&#x27; 1970 World Series victory, the team&#x27;s second title in five years. During the series, he caught a line drive to end a 4–3 victory in Game 1 with the tying run on first base, and he had an assist to end Game 3. Belanger played in six ALCS series and set league playoff records for career games, putouts, assists, total chances, and double plays by a shortstop. (All these records were broken between 1998 and 2002 by Omar Vizquel and Derek Jeter.)

In 1969, Belanger had his best offensive season, after instruction from Charlie Lau. He also won his first gold glove. He hit .287 with 50 RBI and 76 runs scored.  He was 29th in the voting for the 1969 American League Most Valuable Player award. Reflecting his high level of fielding ability, he finished 21st in the MVP voting in 1973 while hitting only .226 with no home runs and 27 RBI, and 26th in 1974 with a .225 batting average, five home runs and 36 RBI. He won gold gloves in both of those years.

On June 3, 1977, Belanger was part of what sportswriter Fred Rothenberg called &quot;one of the strangest triple plays in baseball history.&quot; With the bases loaded for the Royals in the ninth inning, and Kansas City down 7–5, John Wathan hit a fly ball to right field that Pat Kelly caught for the first out. All the runners tagged to advance a base, but Kelly threw to Belanger, who caught Freddie Patek in a rundown between first and second base and tagged him out. While this was going on, Dave Nelson, who had successfully advanced to third base, attempted to score. Upon tagging out Patek, Belanger ran towards the third base line and caught up with Nelson ten feet from home plate, tagging him out to complete the triple play and end the game.

Belanger was granted free agency in —perhaps in response to his public criticism of manager Earl Weaver—and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the season; he retired at the end of the season.

Following Belanger&#x27;s departure from the Orioles, former teammate Rich Dauer said, &quot;Anyone would miss Mark Belanger. You&#x27;re talking about the greatest shortstop in the world. He never put you in a bad position with his double-play throws...He&#x27;d put you where you should be to make the play... I never had to think out there. If there was any question in my mind, I&#x27;d look at Blade, and he&#x27;d have a finger out, pointing which way I should move.&quot;

Hall of fame manager Earl Weaver, who managed Belanger&#x27;s minor league teams in Elmira and Rochester, New York, and then managed him with the Orioles, once told Belanger, &quot;&#x27;You’re my shortstop if you hit .0001.&#x27;&quot; In the 1960s, future hall of fame manager Whitey Herzog, after seeing Belanger play in the minor league for only seven days, said Belanger was the best shortstop he had ever seen, based on Belanger&#x27;s play in those games.

In 2019, Belanger was inducted into the Western Massachusetts Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Later life==
Belanger served as the Orioles&#x27; union representative for several years. He was one of the four players who led negotiations during the 1981 strike.

After Belanger&#x27;s retirement as an active player (and until his death), he was employed by the MLB Players Association as a liaison to its membership. He worked closely with its chief counsel Donald Fehr for years.

Belanger and his first wife, Daryl (Dee), had two homes—in Timonium, Maryland and Key Biscayne, Florida—and had two sons, Richard and Robert. Belanger and his wife Dee would host Orioles players at their homes. He married his second wife, Virginia French, who survives him, in early 1997.

A long-time cigarette smoker, Belanger was diagnosed with lung cancer in the late 1990s and died in New York City at the age of 54. He was survived by his second wife, Virginia, sons Richard and Robert, his parents, and three siblings. He is interred in St. Joseph Cemetery in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

<doc id="407626" wikidata="Q235316" url="?curid=407626" title="Chant of the Saudi Nation">
<text>The Chant of the Saudi Nation () is the national anthem of Saudi Arabia. It was first officially adopted in 1950 without lyrics. The piece was gifted by the King Faruq () when King Abd al-Aziz () made a visit to Egypt. It was then adopted again in 1984 with lyrics written by Ibrahim Khafaji. The original composition was by Abd al-Rahman al-Khatib in 1947, and the brass instrumental version was later arranged by Siraj Umar.

==Overview==
In 1947, because Saudi Arabia did not have a national anthem like other neighbouring countries, King Abdulaziz visited Egypt and asked Egyptian composer Abd al-Raḥman al-Khaṭīb to create a national anthem, and thus &quot;Āsh al-Malīk&quot; was created. The melody is based on an Arab fanfare style, and is similar to the national anthems of other Arab states in the area at the time. In 1958, Mohammed Talat wrote the first set of lyrics, which were not often heard, so King Fahd asked poet Ibrāhīm Khafājī in 1984 to come up with a new set of lyrics, which were completed within six months on 29 June 1984. Khafājī&#x27;s lyrics are the ones that are used officially today. Saudis listened to their anthem for the first time during the celebrations of Eid al-Fitr in 1984.

&quot;Āsh al-Malīk&quot; is referred to by Saudi Arabians as &quot;The National Anthem&quot; (, ), although it is commonly known by its incipit, &quot;Hasten&quot; (, ). The lyrics call upon the country to hasten to greatness and raise the flag, glorify God, and asks Him to grant the King of Saudi Arabia long life.

The instrumental version is called &quot;The Royal Salute&quot; (, ), which is also the name of the ceremony in which it is played to salute senior members of the royal family as well as diplomatic figures.

===Official lyrics===

Notes: Some variations remove the word قَدْ qad before &quot;عِشْتَ فَخْرَ الْمُسْلِمِيْن ʿišta faxra l-muslimīn!&quot; and other variations use the word المَلِيك al-malīk instead of المَلِك al-malik.

<text>Jack Cohen (19 September 1933 – 6 May 2019) was a British reproductive biologist also known for his science books and involvement with science fiction.

==Life==
Cohen was born 19 September 1933 in Norwich, but grew up in Stoke Newington. His father was killed shortly after the end of the Second World War, 1 September 1945. His grandfather was a rabbi and Cohen was an observant Jew in his youth. He continued to attend the synagogue for cultural reasons. He was married three times, and had six children.

==Academic career==
Cohen studied at University College, Hull, where he obtained a BSc (external degree of the University of London) in 1954. He obtained his PhD in zoology at the same institution (by then Hull University) in 1957. He went to the University of Birmingham for post-doctoral work, and was appointed lecturer in the Department of Zoology and Comparative physiology in 1959. He worked for a year at Harvard Medical School then returned to Birmingham as a senior lecturer in 1968, a position he held until 1987. His former students include Sir Paul Nurse, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Medicine. In 1974 the University of Birmingham awarded him a DSc for his work.

From 1987 to 1989 he was senior embryological advisor and manager of laboratories at the IVF/Infertility Clinic of a London private hospital. From 1995 to 1996 he was visiting professor at the Weizmann Institute, Israel. From 1996 to 2000 he was a consultant at the University of Warwick, jointly to the Ecosystems Unit of the Biology Dept and the Mathematics Institute. He was an honorary professor at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick and a visiting professor at Durham Business School.

He published in prestigious journals such as &quot;Nature&quot; and wrote textbooks such as &quot;Living Embryos – an Introduction to the Study of Animal Development&quot; (1967) and &quot;Reproduction&quot; (1977). His theory of sperm redundancy was important in studies of fertility and treatment of infertility. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Biology.

==Other activities==
Cohen worked as a consultant for science fiction television shows and science fiction novels regarding the creation of plausible aliens. The writers who acknowledged his assistance included Anne McCaffrey for the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot;; Harry Harrison for his &quot;Eden&quot; trilogy; Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes for their &quot;Legacy of Heorot&quot;; James White of Sector General fame; David Gerrold for the Chtorr ecology; and Terry Pratchett for several works.

Cohen and fellow University of Warwick researcher Ian Stewart, a mathematician, collaborated with Terry Pratchett to write four &quot;Science of Discworld&quot; books, which accompany his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. Pratchett made them both &quot;Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University&quot; at the same 1999 ceremony where the University of Warwick gave Pratchett an honorary degree. Anne McCaffrey dedicated &quot;All the Weyrs of Pern&quot; (1991) to Jack and Judy Cohen and credited Jack with making fact of her fiction.

Cohen and Stewart also co-authored books on epistemology.

Cohen was a member of the high IQ society Mensa. He was one of the small group of British Mensans who persuaded science fiction author Isaac Asimov to visit the United Kingdom in June 1974.

He had a long-standing interest in the design and natural balance of (particularly manmade) lake ecosystems, having designed new filtration systems but also led in reinstating Victorian designed systems at various locations around the UK.

In 2009, he became a patron of the anti-circumcision charity NORM-UK.

His hobbies, according to the author profiles in his books, included boomerang-throwing and keeping strange animals.

<text>The Chicago Democrat was the first newspaper in Chicago, Illinois. It was published from 1833 to 1861. In 2017 Atom, LLC restarted Chicago Democrat and has built a website aimed at statewide coverage of news, sports, weather and information in Illinois. 

==History==

Publisher John Calhoun was a Jacksonian Democrat, lured west at the end of 1833 from Watertown, New York to start the &quot;Democrat&quot; inspired by traveler&#x27;s stories about Chicago after a series of newspaper business failures in his home state of New York. Printing paid better than newspaper publishing, but the paper was valuable to the new community both to boost the town and bring more people to it and to forward the affairs of its avowed political party.

Publishing a newspaper on the frontier was challenging. In May 1835 Calhoun issued a second prospectus that apologized for the paper&#x27;s virtual disappearance over the previous four months and promised a new editor would upgrade the quality of news when the &quot;Democrat&quot; re-appeared. He cited a lack of available paper on which to print during the winter of 1834-1835. He did not cite, but presumably was responding to, the appearance of his first competition, the &quot;Chicago&#x27;s American&quot; (sponsored by a rival political party, the Whigs). 

In 1836 Calhoun handed the paper over to a syndicate of Democratic politicians, perhaps in return for the party position to which he was appointed, Cook County Treasurer. The syndicate meanwhile hired &quot;Long&quot; John Wentworth, newly arrived in the city with solid Democratic credentials. Wentworth bought the paper outright from this syndicate within a few years.

Wentworth&#x27;s rivals were probably at least partially correct when they accused him of printing more news about himself than the city. This strategy appears to have been successful, since Wentworth represented Chicago in the United States Congress on and off throughout this period, and also served as mayor of Chicago twice. 

Lack of circulation figures for the &quot;Democrat&quot; makes it hard to know much about the paper&#x27;s audience, but it seems likely that in the 1850s their number dwindled. The staff was kept small while the number of reporters at other papers grew, and the printing presses failed to keep up with the times and other newspapers such as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (started in 1847). 

Wentworth, owner of the &quot;Democrat&quot;, had become by the end of the 1850s a member of the new Republican Party — a turnabout that can be said, with some oversimplification, to have resulted from the politics of the years before the American Civil War when feelings about slavery caused shifting alliances and political turmoil throughout the country. 

In 1861, just before the war started, Wentworth closed the &quot;Democrat&quot;. He said he was tired from his recent term as mayor and unable to continue after the death of his assistant, David Bradley. Others speculated he did not care to invest the money it would take to modernize and adequately cover the war many expected at any moment. A more pressing cause was a $250,000 libel lawsuit by another of Chicago&#x27;s Old Settlers, J. Young Scammon. Scammon was angry because Wentworth had published a cartoon depicting him as a &quot;wildcat&quot; banker (the fat cat in the picture wore a pair of Scammon’s distinctive spectacles). 

Wentworth gave his subscription list to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, whose publishers induced Scammon to drop the suit in return. Wentworth’s political career went on but his paper was gone; although his own complete run of the paper was burned in the 1871 Chicago Fire, many issues are now available through the Chicago History Museum, Chicago Public Library, and other repositories.

<doc id="407642" wikidata="Q3396223" url="?curid=407642" title="Pongidae">
<text>Pongidae , or the pongids is an obsolete primate taxon containing chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. By this definition pongids were also called &quot;great apes&quot;. This taxon is not used today but is of historical significance. The great apes are currently classified as Hominidae. This entry addresses the old usage of pongid.

The words &quot;Pongidae&quot; and &quot;pongids&quot; are sometimes used informally for the primate taxon containing orangutans and their extinct fossil relations. For this usage the currently most widely accepted name is Ponginae (or informally Asian hominids or pongines), the orangutan subfamily of the Hominidae or hominids. In current hominid taxonomy there is no “pongid” taxon. The orangutan taxon is now known to be paraphyletic to other (African) hominids. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which genetically diverged from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees and humans) between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago. The subfamilies split somewhat later. The corresponding crown group for this taxon is Hominidae.

==Distinction of great apes (formerly pongids) to hominins==
===Skull===
The great ape (formerly pongid) skull contains the following features that are absent or less pronounced in humans:
* a sulcus behind the brow ridges
* prognathism
* a protruding occipital region
* large, bony eye sockets
* a large nasal opening
* constriction just behind the orbital region
* stout facial bones
* a diastema
* a simian shelf
* a larger, well pronounced brow ridge

===Adaptations for locomotion===
The following great ape (formerly Pongid) adaptations are for arboreal and knuckle walking locomotion and are not found in humans:
==Similarity to hominins==
The australopithecines show intermediate character states between great apes (formerly pongids) and humans, with &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (formerly &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot;) intermediate between australopithecines and humans. Members of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; share many key features with anatomically modern man.

<doc id="407648" wikidata="Q245160" url="?curid=407648" title="Democratic Republic of Georgia">
<text>The Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG; ) was the first modern establishment of a republic of Georgia, which existed from May 1918 to February 1921. Recognized by all major European powers of the time, DRG was created in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and allowed territories formerly under Russia&#x27;s rule to assert independence. In contrast to Bolshevik Russia, DRG was governed by a moderate, multi-party political system led by the Georgian Social Democratic Party (Mensheviks).

Initially, DRG was a protectorate of the German Empire. However, after the German defeat in World War I, the country was partially occupied by British troops, who were sent there to counter a proposed Bolshevik invasion. The British had to leave in 1920 because of the Treaty of Moscow, in which Russia recognized Georgia&#x27;s independence in exchange for DRG not hosting forces hostile to Russia&#x27;s interests. Now that Western European powers were no longer present in Georgia, in February 1921 the Bolshevik Red Army proceeded to invade the country, leading to DRG&#x27;s defeat and collapse by March of that year, with Georgia becoming a Soviet republic. The Georgian Government, led by Prime Minister Noe Zhordania, moved to France where it continued to work in exile. The government-in-exile was recognized by France, Britain, Belgium, and Poland as the only legitimate government of Georgia until the 1930s, when growing Soviet power and political processes in Europe made it impractical to do so indefinitely.

Although short-lived, DRG continues to be an inspiration for modern day Georgia due to its legacy of democracy and pluralism. DRG was one of the first countries in Europe to grant women the right to vote as enshrined in the Georgian constitution, which was &quot;unusual in most European constitutions at the time&quot;. Several women of varying backgrounds were elected to the Georgian parliament, as were representatives of nine ethnicities, including Germans, Russians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, and Jews. DRG also saw the founding of Georgia&#x27;s first fully fledged university, thereby realizing a longstanding goal cherished by generations of Georgian intellectuals whose efforts were, up to that point, consistently frustrated by the Imperial Russian authorities.

== Background ==

After the February Revolution of 1917 and collapse of the tsarist administration in the Caucasus, most powers were held by the Special Transcaucasian Committee (&quot;Ozakom&quot;, short for &quot;Osobyi Zakavkazskii Komitet&quot;) of the Russian Provisional Government. All of the soviets in Georgia were firmly controlled by the Georgian Social Democratic Party, who followed the lead of the Petrograd Soviet and supported the Provisional Government. The Bolshevist October Revolution changed the situation drastically. The Caucasian Soviets refused to recognize Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s regime. Threats from the increasingly Bolshevistic deserting soldiers of the former Caucasus army, ethnic clashes and anarchy in the region forced Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani politicians to create a unified regional authority known as the Transcaucasian Commissariat (14 November 1917) and later a legislature, the Sejm (23 January 1918). On 22 April 1918, the Sejm – Nikolay Chkheidze was the president – declared the Transcaucasus an independent democratic federation with an executive Transcaucasian government chaired by Evgeni Gegechkori and later by Akaki Chkhenkeli.

Many Georgians, influenced by the ideas of Ilia Chavchavadze and other intellectuals from the late 19th century, insisted on national independence. A cultural national awakening was further strengthened by the restoration of the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church (12 March 1917) and the establishment of a national university in Tbilisi (1918). In contrast, the Georgian Mensheviks regarded independence from Russia as a temporary step against the Bolshevik revolution and considered calls for Georgia&#x27;s independence chauvinistic and separatist. The union of Transcaucasus was short-lived though. Undermined by increasing internal tensions and by pressure from the German and Ottoman empires, the federation collapsed on 26 May 1918, when Georgia declared independence. Two days later both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared their independence as well.

== History ==
===Recognition===

Georgia was immediately recognized by Germany and the Ottoman Empire. The young state had to place itself under German protection in the Treaty of Poti and to cede its largely Muslim-inhabited regions (including the cities of Batumi, Ardahan, Artvin, Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki) to the Ottoman government in the 4 June Treaty of Batum. However, German support enabled the Georgians to repel the Bolshevik threat from Abkhazia. German forces were almost certainly under the command of Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein. Following the German defeat in the First World War, British occupation forces arrived in the country, with the permission of the Georgian government. Relations between the British and the local population were more strained than they had been with the Germans. British-held Batumi remained out of Georgia&#x27;s control until 1920. In December 1918, a British force was deployed in Tbilisi too.
Georgia&#x27;s relations with its neighbors were uneasy. Territorial disputes with Armenia, Denikin&#x27;s White Russian government and Azerbaijan led to armed conflicts in the first two cases. A British military mission attempted to mediate these conflicts in order to consolidate all anti-Bolshevik forces in the region. To prevent White Russian army forces from crossing into the newly established states, the British commander in the region drew a line across the Caucasus that Denikin would not be permitted to cross, giving both Georgia and Azerbaijan temporary relief. The threat of invasion by Denikin&#x27;s forces, notwithstanding the British position, brought Georgia and Azerbaijan together in a mutual defense alliance on 16 June 1919.

On 14 February 1919, Georgia held parliamentary elections won by the Social Democratic Party of Georgia with 81.5% of the vote. On 21 March, Noe Zhordania formed the third government, which had to deal with armed peasants&#x27; revolts incited by local Bolshevik activists and largely supported by Russia. These became more troublesome when carried out by ethnic minorities such as Abkhazians and Ossetians.

However, the land reform was finally well handled by the Georgian Social Democratic Party government and the country established a multi-party system. In 1919, reforms in the judicial system and local self-governance were carried out. Abkhazia was granted autonomy. Nevertheless, ethnic issues continued to trouble the country, especially on the part of the Ossetians, as witnessed in May 1920. Nikolay Chkheidze proposed a white mandate for Georgia, vying to protect Georgia in event of an invasion by the Red Army. Many opposed him though. It is unknown whether or not the Kingdom of Italy wanted to place Georgia under its protection as a white mandate, but they were considering it. Nevertheless, Georgia did not become a mandate, resulting in the Red Army invasion of Georgia.

===Downfall===


The year 1920 was marked by increased threats from the Russian SFSR. With the defeat of the White movement and the Red Armies&#x27; advance to the Caucasus frontiers, the republic&#x27;s situation became extremely tense. In January, the Soviet leadership offered Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan an alliance against the White armies in South Russia and the Caucasus. The Government of the DRG refused to enter any military alliance, referring to its policy of neutrality and noninterference, but suggested negotiations towards a political settlement of the relations between two countries in the hope that this might lead to recognition of Georgia&#x27;s independence by Moscow. Severe criticism of the Georgian refusal by Russian leaders was followed by several unsuccessful attempts by local communists to organize mass anti-government protests.
In April 1920, the 11th Red Army established a Soviet regime in Azerbaijan, and the Georgian Bolshevik Sergo Orjonikidze requested permission from Moscow to advance into Georgia. Though official consent was not granted by Lenin and &quot;Sovnarkom&quot;, local Bolsheviks attempted to seize the Military School of Tbilisi as a preliminary to a coup d&#x27;état on 3 May 1920, but were successfully repelled by General Kvinitadze. The Georgian government began mobilization and appointed Giorgi Kvinitadze commander-in-chief. In the meantime, in response to Georgia&#x27;s alleged provision of assistance to the Azeri nationalist rebellion in Ganja, Soviet forces attempted to penetrate Georgian territory, but were repelled by Kvinitadze in brief border clashes at the Red Bridge. Within a few days, peace talks resumed in Moscow. Under the terms of the controversial Moscow Peace Treaty of 7 May, Georgian independence was recognized in return for the legalization of Bolshevik organizations and a commitment not to allow foreign troops on Georgian soil.

A vote at the League of Nations on granting membership to Georgia was held on 16 December 1920, with the resolution defeated: 10 voted for it, 13 against, and 19 abstained. Georgia gained &quot;de jure&quot; recognition from the Allies on 27 January 1921. This, however, did not prevent the country from being annexed by the Red Army to Soviet Russia.

After Azerbaijan and Armenia had been Sovietized by the Red Army, Georgia found itself surrounded by hostile Soviet republics. Moreover, as the British had already evacuated the Caucasus, the country was left without any foreign support.

According to Soviet sources, relations with Georgia deteriorated over alleged violations of the peace treaty, re-arrests of Georgian Bolsheviks, obstruction of convoys passing through Georgia to Armenia, and a strong suspicion that Georgia was aiding armed rebels in the North Caucasus. For its part, Georgia accused Moscow of fomenting anti-government riots in various regions of the country, and of provoking border incidents in the Zaqatala region, disputed with the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The Lori &quot;neutral zone&quot; was another challenge, as Soviet Armenia categorically demanded that Georgia withdraw the troops that had been stationed in the region since the fall of the Armenian Republic.

== Government and law ==

&quot;The Act of Independence of Georgia&quot;, declared on 26 May 1918, in brief, outlined the main principles of the nation&#x27;s future democracy. According to this act, &quot;the Democratic Republic of Georgia equally guarantees to every citizen within her limits political rights irrespective of nationality, creed, social rank or sex&quot;. The first government, formed the same day, was led by Noe Ramishvili. In October 1918, the National Council of Georgia has renamed the Parliament and announced new elections to be held on 14 February 1919.
During its two-year history (1919–1921), the newly elected Constituent Assembly of Georgia, with Nikolay Chkheidze as president, adopted 126 laws; these included laws on citizenship, local elections, defence, the official language, agriculture, the legal system, political and administrative arrangements for ethnic minorities (including an act about the People&#x27;s Council of Abkhazia), a national system of public education, and some other laws and regulations on fiscal and monetary policy, railways, and trade and domestic production. On 21 February 1921, facing the onset of Soviet aggression, the Constituent Assembly adopted a constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, the first modern fundamental law in the nation&#x27;s history, placing emphasis on human rights.
The country was governed as a type of decentralized unitary parliamentary republic with an executive, with the constitution stating that &quot;the state belongs to all the people. Parliament exercises the sovereignty of the nation within the framework of this constitution.&quot; The three decentralized regions included the Abkhaz Autonomy, the Autonomy of Muslim Georgia, and the Zaqatala Region, which were granted autonomy in local affairs. The Chairman of the Government was the chief executive post, approved by the parliament for one-year terms of office (the post could not be held for more than two consecutive terms). The chairman appointed ministers and was responsible for governing the country and representing Georgia in foreign relations. However, the person in the position did not have some privileges common to dual-heads of state and heads of government, such as the ability to dissolve parliament or veto legislation. The 1919 government of Georgia adopted a law on jury trials. The right to trial by jury for serious criminal, political and print cases was incorporated into the 1921 Constitution. The highest court was the Senate, indirectly elected by the parliament. Any changes to the constitution must have first been approved by 2/3 of the legislature, and then a majority of the voting public in a referendum.

== Territorial structure ==
During the Democratic Republic of Georgia, in accordance with the Project for dividing the territory of Georgia into new administrative units (regions), developed by the Self-Government Commission of the Constituent Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1920 (Publication of the Committee of the Union of the elected bodies of local self-government of Georgia No. 2, 1920 (State printing house), Tiflis. – 103 p.; National Library of the Parliament of Georgia, Archive Fund, F 7.876/4 – პროექტი საქართველოს ტერიტორიის დანაწილებისა ახალ საადმინისტრაციო ერთეულებად (ოლქებად)) the division into Governorates and Oblasts was eliminated, uezds and okrugs were preserved, renamed to regions. The names of the regions were mainly proposed by the names of their administrative centers. Minor changes were made to their borders and several former uezds and okrugs were united: Batumi and Artvin okrugs – into the Batumi region, Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki uezds – into the Akhaltsikhe region, Dusheti and Tianet uezds into the Ananuri region. In addition, three autonomous entities were created: Abkhazian autonomy (Sukhumi region), Autonomy of Muslim Georgia (Batumi region) and Zagatala region. Two-level local self-government was introduced: 18 regions and equivalent to regions, the capital of Georgia – Tiflis (Tbilisi) at the regional level and 356 cities and communities at the local level. The southern part of the Ardahan district and the Olta district – if the Democratic Republic of Georgia establishes control over them, will be part of the created Artaani region.

New administrative-territorial units (regions – «olki») of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, created in accordance with the Project, on the basis of existing uezds and okrugs of the Russian Empire, (alternative names of areas are given in brackets):

1 – Tiflis region (Samokalako), capital – Tiflis

2 – Borchaly region (Kvemo Kartli), capital – Ratevani / Ekaterinenfeld (or Kveshi)

3 – Akhaltsikhe region (Samtskhe-Javakheti), capital – Akhaltsikhe

4 – Gori region (Shida Kartli), capital – Gori

5 – Ananur region (Mtiuleti), capital – Ananuri

6 – Telavi region (Shida Kakheti), capital – Telavi

7 – Sighnaghi region (Kiziki), capital – Sighnaghi

8 – Zaqatala region (Saingilo), capital – Zaqatala

9 – Kutaisi region (Kvemo Imereti), capital – Kutaisi

10 – Zestaponi region (Zemo Imereti), capital – Zestaponi / Kvirily

11 – Oni region (Racha), capital – Oni

12 – Tsageri region (Lechkhum-Svaneti), capital – Tsageri

13 – Sukhumi region (Abkhazia-Samurzakano), capital – Sukhumi

14 – Zugdidi region (Zemo Odishi), capital – Zugdidi

15 – Senaki region (Kvemo Odishi), capital – Ahal-Senaki / Novo-Senaki

16 – Ozurgeti region (Guria), capital – Ozurgeti

17 – Batumi region (Adjara-Klarjeti), capital – Batumi

18 – Artaani region (Tao-Artaani), capital – Artaani / Ardagan

19 – Tiflis (Tbilisi) – capital of the Democratic Republic of Georgia.

== International recognition ==
Under the terms of the Moscow Peace Treaty of 7 May, Georgian independence was recognized by Soviet Russia in return for the legalization of Bolshevik organizations and a commitment not to allow foreign troops on Georgian soil.

The independence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia was &quot;de jure&quot; recognized by Romania, Argentina, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Siam and Estonia, among other countries.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile continued to be recognized by many European states as the only legal government of Georgia for some time after 1921. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile lasted until 1954 continuing to oppose Soviet rule in Georgia.

== Political geography ==
Georgia&#x27;s 1918–1921 borders were formed through the border conflicts with its neighbors and ensuing treaties and conventions.

In the north, Georgia was bordered by various Russian Civil War polities until Bolshevik power was established in the North Caucasus in the spring of 1920. The international border between Soviet Russia and Georgia was regulated by the 1920 Moscow Treaty. During the Sochi conflict with the Russian White movement, Georgia briefly controlled the Sochi district in 1918.
In the southwest, the DRG&#x27;s border with the Ottoman Empire changed with the course of World War I and was modified after the Ottoman defeat in the hostilities. Georgia regained control over Artvin, Ardahan, part of Batum province, Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki. Batum was finally incorporated into the republic after the British evacuated the area in 1920. The Treaty of Sèvres of 1920 granted Georgia control over eastern Lazistan including Rize and Hopa. However, the Georgian government, unwilling to become embroiled in a new war with Turkish Revolutionaries, took no steps to take control of these areas.

The border disputes with the First Republic of Armenia over a part of Borchalo district led to a brief war between the two countries in December 1918. With the British intervention the Lori &quot;neutral zone&quot; was created, only to be reoccupied by Georgia after the fall of the Armenian Republic at the end of 1920.

In the southeast, Georgia was bordered by Azerbaijan, which claimed control of Zaqatala district, and parts of . The dispute, however, never led to hostilities and relations between the two countries were generally peaceful until the Sovietization of Azerbaijan.

The 1919 projects and the 1921 constitution of Georgia granted Abkhazia, Ajaria and Zaqatala a degree of autonomy. Article 107 of the constitution gave autonomy to Abkhazia and Zaqatala. However, due to the Red Army invasion, the exact nature of this autonomy was never determined. It did however serve as the first time in the modern era that Abkhazia was defined as a geographic entity.

The territory of the Democratic Republic of Georgia included some territories that today belong to other countries. It was circa 107,600 km2, compared to 69,700 km2 in modern Georgia. The Soviet occupation of the DRG led to significant territorial rearrangements by which Georgia lost almost a third of its territory. Artvin, Ardahan and part of Batumi provinces were ceded to Turkey, Armenia gained control of Lori, and Azerbaijan obtained Zaqatala district. A portion of the Georgian marches along the Greater Caucasus Mountains was taken by Russia.

== Demographics ==
Forming principally on the territories of the Tiflis and Kutais governorates, as well as the Batum Oblast and Sukhumi Okrug, the Georgian Democratic Republic following the Treaty of Batum consisted of 1,607,000 Georgians, 535,000 Armenians, 200,000 Muslims, and 510,000 others, totalling 2,852,000 inhabitants.

By 1921, following the fall of the Armenian and Azerbaijani republics and Georgia&#x27;s reacquisition of the Lori and Zakatal districts, the population reached 2,677,000 according to a Soviet source, with an urban population of 475,000 (17.7%). This is supported by the results of the 1926 Soviet census in Georgia some 5 years later which indicated a population of 2,667,000, indicative of the loss of the aforementioned Lori and Zakatal districts to neighbouring Armenia and Azerbaijan respectively.

The People&#x27;s Guard was the privileged military force in the country. Founded on 5 September 1917, as the Worker&#x27;s Guard, it was later renamed the Red Guard, and finally the People&#x27;s Guard. It was a highly politicized military structure placed directly under the control of parliament rather than the Ministry of War. Throughout its existence (1917–1921), the Guard was under the command of the Menshevik activist Valiko Jugheli.

The DRG also formed its own regular army. The only part of it was armed in peacetime, the majority being on furlough and following their callings. If the republic had been in danger, they would have been called up by the General Staff, supplied with arms, and allotted to their places. General Giorgi Kvinitadze was commander-in-chief, two times.
From March 1919 to October 1920, the Georgian army was reorganized. It consisted of 3 infantry brigades (later coalesced into one division), 1 cavalry brigade, 2 fortress regiments, 3 artillery brigades, a sapper battalion, a telegraph platoon, a motor squadron with an armored car detachment, a cavalry regiment, and a military school. A People&#x27;s Guard consisted of 4 regular battalions. It could further mobilize 18 battalions, i.e., one division. Thus, in 1920, the Georgian army and People&#x27;s Guard together comprised 16 infantry battalions (1 army division and an NG regiment), 1 sapper battalion, 5 field artillery divisions, 2 cavalry legions, 2 motor squadrons with 2 armored car detachments, an air detachment and 4 armored trains. Beyond staff and fortress regiments, the army totaled 27,000. Mobilization could increase this number to 87,000. The Georgian navy possessed 1 destroyer, 4 fighter aircraft, 4 torpedo boats, 4 mine sweepers, and 10 steamboats.

Although the republic had access to almost 200,000 veterans of World War I with skilled generals and officers, the government failed to build up an effective defense system, a factor that greatly contributed to its collapse.

== Economy ==
When the DRG was proclaimed, the Georgian economy was not in a strong position. While economic issues were a Europe-wide issue in 1918 (owing to the First World War), as a new state Georgia faced considerably more difficulties. There were two main issues immediately facing Georgia: economic dependence on Russia, and the need to industrialise a largely agrarian society. Further causing issues was a lack of direction from the Georgian government, which also tried to implement a socialist-based policy into economic matters, despite lacking the financial backing to keep the economy stable.

As part of the Russian Empire Georgia had been partially industrialised, with natural resource extraction becoming a major feature of exports from the region. However, as historian Stephen F. Jones has noted, imperial Russian policies served the metropolitan needs and imperial integration and there was no regional &quot;strategy of economic development beyond state production of raw materials, the development of transport, military supplies and specialized crops such as tea, tobacco, and cotton.&quot; This was also seen on an ethnic scale: the overwhelming amount of traders and business-owners in Georgia were ethnic Armenian, while the administration was composed largely of ethnic Russians. Ethnic Georgians mainly remained in agriculture or took up unskilled labour positions in the cities. This division of labour between ethnic groups proved difficult to reconcile once the DRG was established, and in the aftermath of the Georgian–Armenian War in December 1918 anti-Armenian sentiment throughout Georgia made the Armenian-dominated business class reluctant to help implement needed changes to improve the economy.

Agriculture had been the dominant feature of the Georgian economy, and would remain as such throughout the existence of the DRG. Approximately 79% of the population worked on the land, though the methods used were outdated and far from efficient. This caused food shortages in the cities, and despite 81% of all arable land being used for grains, imports were also required, as was a ban on exporting food products like grain, fruits and vegetables.

The manganese industry at Chiatura was of great importance to European metallurgy, providing about 70% of the world supply of manganese in the early 20th century. Traditionally, Georgia served also as an international transportation corridor through the key Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti. However the First World War had a devastating effect on this industry as well. The Black Sea had been blockaded throughout the war, severely limiting the amount of exports. This led to a drastic reduction in economic activity in Georgia: the workforce at Chiatura dropped from 3,500 in 1913 to 250 in 1919, with the numbers only starting to rise in 1920. Emerging markets in Brazil and India also meant that the Chiatura mines were less important on a global scale, further weakening their output.

The lack of international recognition and the government&#x27;s only partially successful policy in the field hindered the economic development of the DRG and the country suffered an economic crisis. Some signs of improvement were observed towards 1920–1921.

== Education, science and culture ==

The most important event in the country&#x27;s cultural life during this turbulent period was indeed the foundation of a national university in Tbilisi (now known as the Tbilisi State University) (1918), a long-time dream of Georgians thwarted by the Imperial Russian authorities for several decades. Other educational centers included gymnasiums in Tbilisi, Batumi, Kutaisi, Ozurgeti, Poti and Gori, Tbilisi Military School, Gori Pedagogical Seminary, the Pedagogical Seminary for Women, etc. Georgia also had a number of schools for ethnic minorities.

The National Museum of Georgia, theaters in Tbilisi and Kutaisi, the Tbilisi National Opera House, and the National Academy of Art were in the vanguard of cultural life.

The newspapers &quot;Sakartvelos Respublika&quot; (&quot;Republic of Georgia&quot;), &quot;Sakartvelo&quot; (&quot;Georgia&quot;), &quot;Ertoba&quot; (&quot;Unity&quot;), &quot;Samshoblo&quot; (&quot;Motherland&quot;), &quot;Sakhalkho Sakme&quot; (&quot;Public Affair&quot;), &quot;The Georgian Messenger&quot; and &quot;The Georgian Mail&quot; (both published in English) led the national press.

== Legacy ==
The 1918–1921 independence of Georgia, though short-lived, was of particular importance for the development of national feeling among Georgians, a major factor that made the country one of the most active independent forces within the Soviet Union. Leaders of the national movement of the late 1980s frequently referred to the DRG as a victory in the struggle against the Russian Empire and drew parallels with the contemporary political situation, portraying a somewhat idealized image of the Georgian &quot;First Republic&quot;.

On 9 April 1991, the independence of Georgia was restored when the Act of the Restoration of State Independence of Georgia was adopted by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia. The national symbols used by the DRG were re-established as those of the newly independent nation and remained in use until 2004. 26 May, the day of the establishment of the DRG, is still celebrated as a national holiday – the Independence Day of Georgia.

<doc id="407651" wikidata="Q186129" url="?curid=407651" title="Flicker fusion threshold">
<text>The flicker fusion threshold, also known as critical flicker frequency or flicker fusion rate, is the frequency at which a flickering light appears steady to the average human observer. It is a concept studied in vision science, more specifically in the psychophysics of visual perception. A traditional term for &quot;flicker fusion&quot; is &quot;persistence of vision&quot;, but this has also been used to describe positive afterimages or motion blur. Although flicker can be detected for many waveforms representing time-variant fluctuations of intensity, it is conventionally, and most easily, studied in terms of sinusoidal modulation of intensity.

There are seven parameters that determine the ability to detect the flicker:
# the frequency of the modulation; 
# the amplitude or depth of the modulation (i.e., what is the maximum percent decrease in the illumination intensity from its peak value); 
# the average (or maximum—these can be inter-converted if modulation depth is known) illumination intensity; 
# the wavelength (or wavelength range) of the illumination (this parameter and the illumination intensity can be combined into a single parameter for humans or other animals for which the sensitivities of rods and cones are known as a function of wavelength using the luminous flux function); 
# the position on the retina at which the stimulation occurs (due to the different distribution of photoreceptor types at different positions); 
# the degree of light or dark adaptation, i.e., the duration and intensity of previous exposure to background light, which affects both the intensity sensitivity and the time resolution of vision;
# physiological factors such as age and fatigue.

==Explanation==
As long as the modulation frequency is kept above the fusion threshold, the perceived intensity can be changed by changing the relative periods of light and darkness. One can prolong the dark periods and thus darken the image; therefore the effective and average brightness are equal. This is known as the Talbot-Plateau law. Like all psychophysical thresholds, the flicker fusion threshold is a statistical rather than an absolute quantity. There is a range of frequencies within which flicker sometimes will be seen and sometimes will not be seen, and the threshold is the frequency at which flicker is detected on 50% of trials.

Different points in the visual system have very different critical flicker fusion rate (CFF) sensitivities; the overall threshold frequency for perception cannot exceed the slowest of these for a given modulation amplitude. Each cell type integrates signals differently. For example, rod photoreceptor cells, which are exquisitely sensitive and capable of single-photon detection, are very sluggish, with time constants in mammals of about 200 ms. Cones, in contrast, while having much lower intensity sensitivity, have much better time resolution than rods do. For both rod- and cone-mediated vision, the fusion frequency increases as a function of illumination intensity, until it reaches a plateau corresponding to the maximal time resolution for each type of vision. The maximal fusion frequency for rod-mediated vision reaches a plateau at about 15 hertz (Hz), whereas cones reach a plateau, observable only at very high illumination intensities, of about 60 Hz.

In addition to increasing with average illumination intensity, the fusion frequency also increases with the extent of modulation (the maximal relative decrease in light intensity presented); for each frequency and average illumination, there is a characteristic modulation threshold, below which the flicker cannot be detected, and for each modulation depth and average illumination, there is a characteristic frequency threshold. These values vary with the wavelength of illumination, because of the wavelength dependence of photoreceptor sensitivity, and they vary with the position of the illumination within the retina, because of the concentration of cones in central regions including the fovea and the macula, and the dominance of rods in the peripheral regions of the retina.

== Technological considerations ==

===Display frame rate===
Flicker fusion is important in all technologies for presenting moving images, nearly all of which depend on presenting a rapid succession of static images (e.g. the frames in a cinema film, TV show, or a digital video file). If the frame rate falls below the flicker fusion threshold for the given viewing conditions, flicker will be apparent to the observer, and movements of objects on the film will appear jerky. For the purposes of presenting moving images, the human flicker fusion threshold is usually taken between 60 and 90 Hz, though in certain cases it can be higher by an order of magnitude. In practice, movies since the silent era are recorded at 24 frames per second and displayed by interrupting each frame two or three times for a flicker of 48 or 72 Hz. Television typically originates at 50 or 60 frames or interlaced fields per second.

The flicker fusion threshold does not prevent indirect detection of a high frame rate, such as the phantom array effect or wagon-wheel effect, as human-visible side effects of a finite frame rate were still seen on an experimental 480 Hz display.

===Display refresh rate===

Cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays typically operated at a vertical scan rate of 60 Hz, the same as SDTV content they displayed, which resulted in noticeable flicker. The same was true of other impulsed technologies such as plasma displays. Some systems could increase refresh rate to higher values such as 72, 75, 100, or 120 Hz to ease this problem, though even if the faster refresh is an integer multiple of the source material framerate to eliminate judder, without higher framerate source material this causes the perception of duplicate images. Any flicker on sample and hold technologies such as LCD or OLED, is unrelated to refresh rate and far less conspicuous, instead coming from incidental design compromises such as fluorescent backlights, PWM dimming, or temporal dithering, all of which are eliminated on some devices that do not flicker at all. Because of the resulting display motion blur inherent to sample and hold screens, in applications where accurate motion perception is prioritized over user fatigue, the correct type of flicker can be reintroduced through techniques such as backlight strobing or black frame insertion.

===Lighting===
Flicker is also important in the field of domestic (alternating current) lighting, where noticeable flicker can be caused by varying electrical loads, and hence can be very disturbing to electric utility customers. Most electricity providers have maximum flicker limits that they try to meet for domestic customers.

Fluorescent lamps using conventional magnetic ballasts flicker at twice the supply frequency. Electronic ballasts do not produce light flicker since the phosphor persistence is longer than a half cycle of the higher operation frequency of 20 kHz. The 100–120 Hz flicker produced by magnetic ballasts is associated with headaches and eyestrain.
Individuals with high critical flicker fusion threshold are particularly affected by light from fluorescent fixtures that have magnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy. The problems are not observed with electronic ballasts. Ordinary people have better reading performance using high-frequency (20–60 kHz) electronic ballasts than magnetic ballasts, although the effect was small except at high contrast ratio.

The flicker of fluorescent lamps, even with magnetic ballasts, is so rapid that it is unlikely to present a hazard to individuals with epilepsy. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. However, these studies had interpretive problems and have not been replicated.

LED lamps generally do not benefit from flicker attenuation through phosphor persistence, the notable exception being white LEDs. Flicker at frequencies as high as 2000 Hz (2 kHz) can be perceived by humans during saccades, and frequencies above 3000 Hz (3 kHz) have been recommended to avoid human biological effects.

== Visual phenomena ==
In some cases, it is possible to see flicker at rates beyond 2000 Hz (2 kHz) in the case of high-speed eye movements (saccades) or object motion, via the &quot;phantom array&quot; effect. Fast-moving flickering objects zooming across view (either by object motion, or by eye motion such as rolling eyes), can cause a dotted or multicolored blur instead of a continuous blur, as if they were multiple objects. Stroboscopes are sometimes used to induce this effect intentionally. 
Some special effects, such as certain kinds of electronic glowsticks commonly seen at outdoor events, have the appearance of a solid color when motionless but produce a multicolored or dotted blur when waved about in motion. These are typically LED-based glow sticks. The variation of the duty cycle upon the LED(s), results in usage of less power while by the properties of flicker fusion having the direct effect of varying the brightness. When moved, if the frequency of duty cycle of the driven LED(s) is below the flicker fusion threshold timing differences between the on/off state of the LED(s) becomes evident, and the color(s) appear as evenly spaced points in the peripheral vision.

A related phenomenon is the rainbow effect, where different colors are displayed in different places on the screen for the same object due to fast motion.

===Flicker===
&quot;Flicker&quot; is the perception of visual fluctuations in intensity and unsteadiness in the presence of a light stimulus, that is seen by a static observer within a static environment. Flicker that is visible to the human eye will operate at a frequency of up to 80 Hz.

===Stroboscopic effect===
The &quot;stroboscopic effect&quot; is sometimes used to &quot;stop motion&quot; or to study small differences in repetitive motions. The stroboscopic effect refers to the phenomenon that occurs when there is a change in perception of motion, caused by a light stimulus that is seen by a static observer within a dynamic environment. The stroboscopic effect will typically occur within a frequency range between 80 and 2000 Hz, though can go well beyond to 10,000 Hz for a percentage of population.

===Phantom array===
Phantom array, also known as the ghosting effect, occurs when there is a change in perception of shapes and spatial positions of objects. The phenomenon is caused by a light stimulus in combination with rapid eye movements (saccades) of an observer in a static environment. Similar to the stroboscopic effect, the phantom effect will also occur at similar frequency ranges. The mouse arrow is a common example of the phantom array effect.

==Non-human species==
The flicker fusion threshold also varies between species. A 2014 survey of the critical fusion frequency in animals found the lowest value (6.7 Hz) in the cane toad (&quot;Bufo marinus&quot;) and the highest value (400 Hz) in the black fire beetle (&quot;Melanophila acuminate&quot;). Estimates for different species of bird vary from 40 Hz to 140 Hz, with higher values tending to be associated with faster-moving species. Many mammals have a higher proportion of rods in their retina than humans do, and it is likely that they would also have higher flicker fusion thresholds. This has been confirmed in dogs.

If artificial lighting is perceived as flickering by some animals, the aversive effect might be an issue for animal welfare and conservation. However, those animals most liable to perceive flicker tend to be diurnal species active in bright light, and thus least likely to be exposed to artificial lighting outside of captivity. Size and metabolic rate are two further factors associated with the variation in flicker fusion thresholds: small animals with a high metabolic rate tend to have high values.

<text>The &quot;Ethan Allen&quot; class of fleet ballistic missile submarine was an evolutionary development from the . The &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;, together with the &quot;George Washington&quot;, , , and classes comprised the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; that were the Navy&#x27;s main contribution to the nuclear deterrent force through the late 1980s.

==Design==
Rather than being designed as attack submarines with a missile compartment added, the &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;s were the first submarines designed &quot;from the keel up&quot; as Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarines carrying the Polaris A-2 missile. They were functionally similar to the &quot;George Washington&quot;s, but longer and more streamlined and with torpedo tubes reduced to four. In the early and mid-1970s, they were upgraded to Polaris A3s. Because their missile tubes could not be modified to carry the larger diameter Poseidon missile, they were not further upgraded.

==Conversions==
To comply with SALT II treaty limitations as the ballistic missile submarines entered service, in the early 1980s the &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;s were refitted and officially designated SSNs (fast attack submarines), but often referred to as a &quot;slow approach&quot;. Their missile fire control systems were removed and the missile tubes were filled with concrete. &quot;Sam Houston&quot; and &quot;John Marshall&quot; were further converted to carry SEALs or other Special Operations Forces, accommodating 67 troops each with dry deck shelters to accommodate SEAL Delivery Vehicles or other equipment. The &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;-class submarines were decommissioned between 1983 and 1992.
All were disposed of through the nuclear Ship-Submarine Recycling Program 1992–1999.

<text>Cheap Trick at Budokan (or simply At Budokan) is the first live album by American rock band Cheap Trick, and their best-selling recording. Recorded at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, the album was first released in Japan on October 8, 1978, and later released in the United States in February 1979, through Epic Records. After several years of constant touring but only middling exposure for the band, &quot;At Budokan&quot; steadily grew off radio play and word-of-mouth to become a high-selling success, kickstarting the band&#x27;s popularity and becoming acclaimed as one of the greatest live rock albums of all time and a classic of the power pop genre.

It was ranked number 426 in the 2003 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2019, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. An album featuring leftover tracks from the band&#x27;s 1978 Budokan set, plus additional material from their 1979 tour of Japan, was released in 1994 as &quot;Budokan II&quot;, and a two-disc reconstruction of the complete original Budokan performances, titled &quot;At Budokan: The Complete Concert&quot;, was released to commemorate its twentieth anniversary in 1998.

==Overview==
Cheap Trick found early success in Japan, and capitalized on this popularity by recording &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo on April 28 and 30, 1978, with an audience of 12,000 screaming Japanese fans nearly drowning out the band at times. The album was intended for release only in Japan but with strong airplay of the promotional album &quot;From Tokyo to You&quot;, an estimated 30,000 import copies were sold in the United States and the album was released domestically in February 1979. The album also introduced two previously unreleased original songs, &quot;Lookout&quot; and &quot;Need Your Love&quot;. As stated by producer Jack Douglas, the audio from &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; is actually not from the Budokan, but from Osaka, which was a smaller show. The recording of the Budokan show was deemed unsuitable for release. 

An unusual aspect of the album release in the UK was the use of coloured vinyl, then primarily restricted to singles and EP&#x27;s, and soon replaced as a marketing gimmick by so-called &quot;picture discs&quot;. A prominently displayed sticker on the sleeve of &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; announced that it had been released on &quot;kamikaze yellow vinyl&quot;, and, unlike most coloured discs, which were usually as opaque as the conventional black vinyl records, the disc in the album is translucent.

When &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; was first released on compact disc in the U.S., the first pressing contained a slightly different, possibly unpolished mix of the concert. Notably the guitar trade-offs of &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; were different from the vinyl release.

==Reception==
In the U.S., the album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became the group&#x27;s best selling album with over three million copies sold. It also ranked number 13 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Pop Albums of 1979 year-end chart. The single &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The second single, a cover of Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; also charted, reaching number 35. &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; was certified triple Platinum in 1986 by the RIAA.

In Canada, it went to number one, hitting the top of the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Albums chart on August 11 of the same year. By November 1979, it had achieved quintuple platinum status (500,000 units) in that country.

The album received mostly positive contemporary reviews. In the UK, Sandy Robertson from &quot;Sounds&quot;, while critical of Jack Douglas&#x27; production, concluded that &quot;Cheap Trick are melodic enough to please pop-obscurity fans, heavy enough to net the Aerosmith mob, wacky enough to be eye-catching and good enough to take on the world. Possibly the best hard rock band in the USA.&quot; Nick Kent in &quot;NME&quot; was more muted in his praise, writing that &quot;Though it doesn&#x27;t match up to &quot;In Colour&quot; as the best Cheap Trick initiation, &quot;Budokan&quot; is no disgrace. A live album of the old school – like &quot;The Kinks Live At Kelvin Hall&quot; or &quot;Got Live If You Want It&quot; – it&#x27;s nothing essential or ground-breaking; just a fair approximation of the band in a live context.&quot; In the US, &quot;Billboard&quot;, marking the album as a Top Album Pick, wrote that &quot;With the fans behind them, the members of Cheap Trick put out its best, playing good hard and steady rock. Unlike so many current live LPs, the audience is always there, giving it more of a sense of space. The slight echo doesn&#x27;t hurt the music.&quot;

==Impact and legacy==
In its official press release upon the album&#x27;s entry into the National Recording Registry, the Library of Congress stated that, along with its success in the Japanese market, &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; &quot;proved to be the making of the band in their home country, as well as a loud and welcomed alternative to disco and soft rock and a decisive comeback for rock and roll.&quot; Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has also stated that with this album, &quot;Cheap Trick unwittingly paved the way for much of the hard rock of the next decade, as well as a surprising amount of alternative rock of the 1990s.&quot; In Pitchfork, Stuart Berman wrote on the album&#x27;s success and influence, respectively, that &quot;&quot;At Budokan&quot;, is not just one of rock&#x27;s greatest live albums, but also one of its most triumphant underdog tales, an exemplar of pre-internet viral phenomena,&quot; and that &quot;for the Foo Fighters, Weezer, Smashing Pumpkins, Ted Leo, the Raconteurs—basically any band that&#x27;s ever tried to weld a Beatlesque melody to a power chord—all roads lead back to &quot;Budokan&quot;.&quot; Further invoking comparison to the Beatles, Nwaka Onwusa, director of curatorial affairs at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, spoke with 1A on the parallels between Beatlemania in the United States and Cheap Trick&#x27;s reception in Japan:

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Taraful Haiducilor (&quot;Taraf of Haiduks&quot;) are a Romanian-Romani &quot;taraf&quot; (a troupe of &quot;lăutari&quot;, traditional musicians) from Clejani, Romania, and one of the most prominent such groups in post-Communist era Romania. In the Western world they have become known by the name given to them in French-speaking areas, where they are known as Taraf de Haïdouks.

==History==
The lăutari originating in the village of Clejani have long been known for their musical skills. The first recordings by ethnomusicologists in the village were made in the interwar period. Speranța Rădulescu, a Romanian folklorist also made recordings in Clejani in 1983 for the archive of the Romanian Bucharest-based Institute for Ethnography and Folklore of the Romanian Academy. The recordings were made in various configurations. During the Communist era, many lăutari from Clejani were also employed in the national ensembles that played Romanian popular music.

Early contacts in the West included Swiss ethnomusicologist Laurent Aubert and Belgian musicians Stéphane Karo and Michel Winter, two fans who were so taken by the band&#x27;s music that they turned into managers, brought the newly named &quot;Taraf de Haïdouks&quot; to Western Europe and helped launch their international career.

Since the release of its first album in 1991, Taraf de Haïdouks has been considered the epitome of Romany music&#x27;s vitality. Their polyphonic sound incorporates instruments such as the violin, double drum, accordion, flute, cimbalom, double bass and some wind instruments. The group has toured worldwide, released acclaimed albums and a DVD (see below), and counts among its fans the late Yehudi Menuhin, the Kronos Quartet (with whom it has recorded and performed), actor Johnny Depp (alongside whom the group appeared in the film &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot;), fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto (who invited the band to be models-cum-musicians for his Paris and Tokyo shows), composer Danny Elfman (who hired them to play for his 50th birthday party), and many more. Meanwhile, the band members seem to have been relatively unaffected by all this, maintaining their way of life (they still reside in Clejani, in the Wallachian countryside).

In 2007, the band released their album &quot;Maskarada&quot;, in which they reinterpret and &quot;re-gypsify&quot; pieces by 20th-century classical composers (such as Bartók, Khachaturian and Kodály) who drew inspiration from national folklore and often borrowed from Roma styles.

<text>Paul John Hogan (born 30 November 1962) is an Australian film director and screenwriter. He is best known for directing the films &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994), &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2003) and &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Hogan was born in Brisbane, Queensland. As a teenager, he lived on the North Coast of New South Wales and attended Mt St Patrick&#x27;s College. He was said to have had a difficult time in high school as he was a victim of bullying. His film &quot;Mental&quot; is based upon his difficult adolescent years.

==Career==
Hogan&#x27;s directorial debut was the short film &quot;Getting Wet&quot;, made in 1984. This film won him an AACTA Award for Best Short Fiction Film. He then went on to direct minor films. In 1991, he was the assistant director of the Australian film &quot;Proof&quot;. In the early 1990s, he wrote for several television series, including &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot; in 1991 and for &quot;Lift Off&quot; in 1992.

Hogan&#x27;s first big hit was the 1994 Australian film &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which helped launch the careers of actors Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths. He both wrote and directed this film, and was nominated for Best Director at the AACTA Awards. The success of the film also led him to be chosen by Julia Roberts to direct his 1997 American debut &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which also starred Cameron Diaz and Dermot Mulroney.

Hogan followed this with the comedy &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; (which was filmed in 1999 but not released until 2002), and 2003&#x27;s big budget adaptation of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, starring Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook, Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy. Despite positive reviews, the 2003 Peter Pan film failed at the box office. The following year he directed a pilot for a remake of the cult soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which was not picked up for broadcast, and created the story for the 2008 musical film &quot;The American Mall&quot;. He then directed &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (starring Isla Fisher), an adaptation of the novel &quot;The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic&quot;. In 1999, both Hogan and Moorhouse through Hogan Moorhouse Pictures signed a first look deal with Sony.

In 2012, he reunited with &quot;Muriel&quot; star Collette for the comedy &quot;Mental&quot;. Hogan will direct an adaptation of Blue Balliett&#x27;s book &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hogan is married to film director Jocelyn Moorhouse. They have four children, two of whom are autistic.

In April 2019, Moorhouse spoke on the ABC Television program &quot;Australian Story&quot; about how their relationship had developed and how having the children had affected their personal and professional lives, including a move back to Australia from the US.

<text>USS &quot;Sam Houston&quot; (SSBN-609/SSN-609), an , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after Sam Houston (1793–1863), president of the Republic of Texas (1836–1838, 1841–1844). &quot;Sam Houston&quot; was the US Navy&#x27;s seventh ballistic missile submarine.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
Her keel was laid down on 28 December 1959 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 2 February 1961 sponsored by Texas First Lady Idanell Brill (Nellie ) Connally, wife of Governor John Connally and commissioned on 6 March 1962 with Captain W. P. Willis, Jr. commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Jack H. Hawkins commanding the Gold Crew.

Following sea trials, &quot;Sam Houston&quot;″s Blue Crew fired her first Polaris missile on 25 April 1962 off Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Gold Crew then took over, completed its first missile firing on 11 May 1962, and then departed from Cape Canaveral for its own shakedown training.

On her first patrol, &quot;Sam Houston&quot;, manned by the Blue Crew, operated continuously submerged for 48 days and two hours, then moored alongside the submarine tender in Holy Loch, Scotland. Following upkeep, the Gold Crew commenced its first patrol on 25 December 1962, returning to Holy Loch in February 1963. The crews were again alternated, and &quot;Sam Houston&quot; departed on her third patrol in March 1963. On this patrol, she was the first fleet ballistic missile submarine to enter the Mediterranean Sea, where she joined North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces. With the two crews alternating every 90 days, &quot;Sam Houston&quot; completed six successful deterrent patrols by the end of 1963.

By the end of 1964, &quot;Sam Houston&quot; had completed ten patrols. During 1965, she completed four additional deterrent patrols. During 1966, she completed three more patrols, including her longest, which lasted 71 days. On 10 August 1966, she returned to the United States for the first time since her deployment to Holy Loch in 1962 and commenced a major overhaul at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. On 30 October 1967, she got underway for sea trials, and, a month later, her Blue Crew began shakedown training. In January 1968, the Gold Crew conducted shakedown operations. Following further tests, she got under way for her 18th deterrent patrol, and put into Holy Loch on 25 May 1968. By the end of 1968, she was on her 21st patrol. During 1969, &quot;Sam Houston&quot; completed her 22nd through 24th patrols. In 1970, she continued to operate with Submarine Squadron 14 until shifting to the Mediterranean on 9 August 1970 to join Submarine Squadron 16.

She operated out of her advanced base at Rota, Spain, until October 1972. On 27 November, she entered Charleston Naval Shipyard and began an extended in-port period, which included regular overhaul and the updating of her weapons and propulsion systems. As of May 1974, &quot;Sam Houston&quot; was still in port at Charleston, South Carolina.

In February 1975 USS Sam Houston completed sea trials and overhaul at Charleston NSY. Change of Command ceremonies were held on the USS Hunley at Weapons Station Charleston SC and the blue crew assumed command of the ship. After both crews completed post overhaul inspections Sam Houston headed for her Pacific assignment in late July 1975. Gold crew under the command of J.P Wiekert transited the Panama Canal in August 1975 with stops in San Diego, Weapons Station Bremerton arriving at Pearl Harbor in early October 1975. Blue crew assumed command at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and performed Sam Houston&#x27;s first Pacific deterrent patrol No. 37 transiting the boat to Guam. Sam Houston performed 14 patrols, No. 37 – No. 50, between 1975 and 1979 operating out of Guam. During these patrols Sam Houston made mid-patrol stops in South Korea and Hawaii.

In 1981, in compliance with the SALT I treaty, &quot;Sam Houston&quot;″s ballistic missile section was deactivated. Concrete blocks were placed in the missile tubes and the missile fire-control system was removed, as was one of her inertial navigation systems. &quot;Sam Houston&quot; was reclassified as an attack submarine with hull number SSN-609 on 10 November 1980 and retained primarily for training, antisubmarine warfare exercises, and other secondary duties.

From September 1982 to September 1985, &quot;Sam Houston&quot;, along with her sister ship ,
was modified at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, as an amphibious transport to carry frogmen or commandos. This included the installation of additional troop berthing, the removal of some ballistic missile tube bases, and the conversion of other ballistic missile tubes into air locks and stowage for equipment. She was fitted with two dry deck shelters (DDSs) abaft her sail. These, which housed United States Navy SEAL team Swimmer Delivery Vehicles, allowed her to act as a SEAL mother ship.

On 29 April 1988, &quot;Sam Houston&quot; ran aground on Fox Island, Washington.

Deactivated on 1 March 1991 while still in commission, &quot;Sam Houston&quot; began the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard the same day. She was formally decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 September 1991 and finished the recycling program on 3 February 1992, when she was officially listed as scrapped.

<doc id="407672" wikidata="Q517468" url="?curid=407672" title="My Aim Is True">
<text>My Aim Is True is the debut studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, originally released in the United Kingdom on 22July 1977 through Stiff Records. Produced by Stiff artist and musician Nick Lowe, the album was recorded from late 1976 to early 1977 over six four-hour studio sessions at Pathway Studios in Islington, London. The backing band was the California-based country rock act Clover, who were uncredited on the original release due to contractual difficulties. At the time performing as D.P. Costello, Costello changed his name to Elvis after Elvis Presley at the suggestion of the label, and adjusted his image to match the rising punk rock movement.

Musically, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; is influenced by a wide variety of genres, from punk, new wave and British pub rock to elements of 1950s rock and roll, R&amp;B and rockabilly. The more downbeat lyrics are motivated by revenge and guilt, reflecting topics from relationship struggles to politically charged situations and misogynistic characters. The original monochrome cover art, showing Costello in a pigeon-toed stance, was later colourised for reissues.

The album was preceded by three singles, all of which failed to chart. By June 1977, Costello formed a new permanent backing band, the Attractions, to better match his new image and commenced live performances with them for the rest of the year. In August, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; reached number 14 in the UK. The American version, released in November 1977 through Columbia Records, added Costello&#x27;s newest single &quot;Watching the Detectives.&quot; By then the biggest-selling import album in U.S. history, it reached number 32.

On release, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was met with critical acclaim, with many praising Costello&#x27;s musicianship and songwriting; it appeared on several year-end lists. In later decades, commentators consider it one of Costello&#x27;s finest works, one of the best debut albums in music history and has appeared on numerous best-of lists. The album was reissued in 1993 and 2001, both of which featured extensive liner notes written by Costello, and in 2007 as a deluxe edition.

==Background==
Elvis Costello—under his actual name Declan MacManus—began performing in clubs and pubs in Liverpool and London in 1970. Over the years he created some demo tapes, but had little success in obtaining a recording contract. He later told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that he &quot;didn&#x27;t have enough money to do anything with a band&quot;. According to the author Graeme Thomson, British DJ Charlie Gillett played songs from one tape, containing future &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; songs &quot;Blame It On Cain&quot; and &quot;Mystery Dance&quot;, on his show throughout the summer of 1976. The exposure garnered interest from labels, although it was rejected by Island Records, Virgin Records and American-based CBS Records. He was eventually signed to London-based Stiff Records in August 1976 by label co-founders Jake Riviera and Dave Robinson. He was the first artist signed to Stiff, but was the label&#x27;s eleventh release.

==Writing and recording==

Stiff financed recording sessions for an album at Pathway Studios, an eight-track studio located in Islington, with members of the American country rock act Clover as the backing band. The band had moved to Britain after gaining a cult following there and signed to Phonogram Records. Clover&#x27;s most famous members, singers Huey Lewis and Alex Call, did not participate in the recording sessions in any capacity, while the members who played on &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; — John McFee (guitar), John Ciambotti (bass), Sean Hopper (keyboards) and Mickey Shine (drums) — were not credited on the final album at the time due to contractual difficulties. (Some early marketing for the album identified Costello&#x27;s backing band as &quot;The Shamrocks&quot;, without naming any individual members.) Costello said Clover arrived in London during the punk revolution and due to appearing as &quot;American hippies&quot;, they &quot;just didn&#x27;t fit in&quot;. The band resided at the country house Headley Grange during the period.

&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was recorded in a series of six four-hour sessions, from late 1976 to early 1977 for about £2,000. Costello kept his day job as a data entry clerk at Elizabeth Arden during the sessions; he would call in sick, travel to Headley Grange to rehearse the songs with Clover and head back to Pathway the next day to record. Costello recalled disliking the time at Headley Grange and that he and Clover had musical disagreements, but nevertheless praised their musicianship. According to Thomson, Clover were paid little for their contributions. Most of the tracks were recorded live and in first takes with little overdubbing. While Clover provided most of the instrumentation, Stan Shaw of the Hitmen played keyboards on &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; while Lowe produced and sang backing vocals. Regarding his guitar work, Costello stated in his memoir that at the time, he did not own his signature Jazzmaster guitar so he used a &quot;shrill&quot; Telecaster on the album. He also lacked substantial knowledge on guitars themselves, saying that he played his guitar unadjusted until halfway through the sessions.

The majority of the songs on &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; were written in about two weeks. Most of them came from Costello&#x27;s earlier demo tapes and live performances with his former band Flip City. Some tracks would appear on later albums, such as &quot;Hand In Hand&quot;, which was written specifically for Lowe, who rejected it. More adventurous numbers such as &quot;Hoover Factory&quot;, &quot;Dr. Luther&#x27;s Assistant&quot;, &quot;Ghost Train&quot; and &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; were also recorded during the sessions, but were omitted from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; and instead appeared on EPs and singles. According to the biographer Brian Hinton, these tracks would have contrasted with Costello&#x27;s aspiring image of a &quot;straight talking psychopath&quot;. In the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, Costello stated that the three main outtakes from the sessions were &quot;Radio Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; and &quot;Living in Paradise&quot;, the first two being left off the final track list due to differences in sound and the last being properly recorded for Costello&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; (1978).

Fellow Stiff artist and house producer Nick Lowe produced the album. Regarding his role as producer, Thomson states that Lowe&#x27;s priority was to keep the feel of the songs and create appropriate atmospheres for each. Lowe himself later stated that the musicians did all the work and all he contributed was &quot;switch[ing] everything on&quot;. He rough-mixed the tracks with engineer Barry &quot;Bazza&quot; Farmer, the final mix completed in a single five-hour session at Pathway on 27January 1977.

===Name change===
At the time, Costello was performing under the stage name &quot;D.P. Costello&quot; as a tribute to his father. With &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; being readied for release as a single in March 1977, Robinson and Riviera decided to adjust his image to better match the rising punk rock movement. Looking like, in Clayton-Lea&#x27;s words, an &quot;average ordinary-looking computer operator geek&quot;, he lacked &quot;neither aggression nor energy&quot; in his live performances, as musician Graham Parker told &quot;Mojo&quot;.

As a marketing tactic, Riviera suggested changing Costello&#x27;s name from Declan to Elvis after American singer Elvis Presley. Considered irrational but accepted by Costello himself, the change sparked controversy in both Britain and America, facing opposition from both Costello&#x27;s supporters and Presley&#x27;s fans. Costello later stated that the change was not meant to &quot;insult&quot; Presley; it &quot;meant people would pause just that little bit longer&quot;. Wardrobe-wise, Costello became more exaggerated, donning Buddy Holly-style glasses, tight jackets and &quot;turned-up&quot; jeans. He made his live solo debut under the new name and look on 27 May 1977.

==Music and lyrics==

According to the biographer Tony Clayton-Lea, Costello and Lowe aimed to create &quot;a collection of songs that were not only of their time, but which were also rooted in classic songwriting values&quot;. As such, commentators have written that the album combines various musical genres, including new wave, British pub rock, punk rock, and power pop. William Goodman of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine called it &quot;rough edged and bluesy&quot; in a style reminiscent of New Orleans, and recognised the presence of punk, rockabilly, UK pub rock, jazz and honky-tonk country. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Nick Freed wrote that the album combines elements of the British punk movement with 1950s and 1960s-style rock and roll. He found tracks like &quot;Miracle Man&quot;, &quot;No Dancing&quot; and &quot;Alison&quot; utilise that style to create doo-wop and R&amp;B melodies, thereby &quot;taking the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s ideas and adding the modern spin&quot;. The rockabilly sound is present on &quot;Less Than Zero&quot;, &quot;Mystery Dance&quot; and &quot;Sneaky Feelings&quot;. Clayton-Lea states that while it shared similarities with punk, it displayed musicianship and lyricism that were in control, showcasing a softer touch while underlined with a &quot;unique savagery&quot;.

While the music presents a wide range of styles, the lyrics are mostly downbeat, discussing topics such as &quot;deceit, sarcasm, bitterness, disdain, scorn [and] disgust&quot;. In an interview with Nick Kent of the &quot;NME&quot;, Costello stated that the songs are motivated solely by &quot;revenge and guilt&quot;. The biographer David Gouldstone writes that the album&#x27;s primary theme is &quot;the unaccommodating nature of the world&quot;, which is explored in two distinct ways: &quot;the personal songs as the microcosm, and the public as the macrocosm&quot;. The lyrics range from complex and surreal (&quot;Waiting for the End of the World&quot;) to unsympathetic (&quot;Less Than Zero&quot;) and misogynistic (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Angry&quot;). Dave Schulps of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described the album as &quot;12 songs of revenge, guilt, jealousy, humiliation and rage&quot;. Goodman found the lyrics and production matches a bedroom performance, a sentiment echoed by LeMay, who similarly stated that Lowe&#x27;s production has a &quot;latent energy&quot; that grants the album &quot;all the immediacy of a live show&quot;. The painter and art critic Julian Bell wrote that Costello&#x27;s work &quot;relies heavily on being &quot;between&quot; emotions, between sensations, ideas [and] informations.&quot; Regarding Costello&#x27;s vocal performance on the record, Gouldstone writes that his directness contributes to listeners&#x27; constant interest: &quot;he continually grabs us by the shirtfront and harangues us, and we are sucked into the vortex.&quot;

===Side one===
The opening track, &quot;Welcome to the Working Week&quot;, expresses frustration at the ruthlessness of business. The lyrics are directed at &quot;you&quot;, which Gouldstone analyses as the song&#x27;s female character, the listener or the world itself. With a runtime of only 82 seconds, the song contains a punk-style beat and handclaps and utilises elements of doo-wop and new wave. Compared to the previous track, &quot;Miracle Man&quot; deals with the relationship between a man and a woman rather than society. Like the next track &quot;No Dancing&quot;, &quot;Miracle Man&quot; concerns a man dominated by his female companion.

&quot;No Dancing&quot; contains a Phil Spector-type beat and various key changes, which was a rarity in Costello&#x27;s early work. Costello stated that he was attempting to merge a &quot;Merseybeat bridge&quot; into &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; by Gene Pitney. Unlike other tracks on the album, the song&#x27;s narrator is primarily observant, only directly appearing in the first verse. Commentators have analysed &quot;dancing&quot; on the record as a metaphor for sex, while Gouldstone goes further and writes that Costello is implying a lack of world order and harmony. Returning to the lyrical themes of the opening track is &quot;Blame It on Cain&quot;, although Costello is more specific in this track, targeting entities such as &quot;government burglars&quot; and the radio. According to Gouldstone, the &quot;it&quot; in the chorus is not explicitly stated, only that it must be blamed on Cain. Taking the name Cain from the first murderer in the Bible, he analyses the track as fundamental frustrations that cannot be pinned on anyone and thus cannot be fixed, concluding that nothing wrong will become right. This growing tension is reflected in the music, which has an increased number of bars in each verse. Musically, the song was described by one reviewer as upbeat blues with a &quot;Jersey Shore rock shine&quot;.

Described by Goodman as the album&#x27;s &quot;spiritual centrepiece&quot;, &quot;Alison&quot; is a ballad that combines jazzy guitars with soulful vocals. It was written about a checkout girl at a local supermarket. Unlike other tracks on the album, &quot;Alison&quot; is more upbeat in tone and contains more caring and tender lyrics rather than feelings of maliciousness and anger; these feelings are present, but are muted compared to the preceding tracks. In the track, the narrator longs for the title character, who has married an inferior man even though he knows she is making a mistake. The album takes its title from a line in the song. &quot;Sneaky Feelings&quot; marks a return to upbeat blues and standard pop. Much lighter in tone, the song concerns unfaithfulness. Gouldstone states that the &#x27;sneaky feelings&#x27; are our desires for the unfeasible: &quot;feelings which will only cause suffering and so must be suppressed.&quot;

===Side two===
Hinton calls &quot;(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes&quot; a &quot;harder take&quot; on &quot;Alison&quot;. Gouldstone describes the characters&#x27; relationship in the song as &quot;fractured&quot; and &quot;punctured&quot;. The woman is, like other tracks, portrayed as a heartless prosecutor of men but also a victim of them. He also identifies it as a rare example of Costello&#x27;s that is sympathetic towards women. The red shoes are an allegory for an individual&#x27;s freedoms and as such, metaphorical forces (referred to as &#x27;angels&#x27;) want to take away the narrator&#x27;s freedom. The song also deals with the passage of time, which several subsequent tracks revisit. The most overtly political song on the album, &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; is a steady rocker that concerns the 1920s British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley. Costello accuses him of various crimes, such as brutality and possibly rape and incest, after Mosley denied any wrongdoings on television in the mid-1970s. The song&#x27;s chorus suggests the media suppresses knowledge of government corruption, thereby invoking censorship. Oswald Mosley is an obscure figure outside the UK, and the song only refers to the character of &quot;Mr. Oswald&quot; (the name Mosley is never mentioned); listeners in the United States assumed that &quot;Mr. Oswald&quot; was Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of president John F. Kennedy. Consequently, Costello wrote an alternative lyric to refer to the assassin. This alternative lyric (called the &quot;Dallas Version&quot;) was performed when playing the song live in North America.

&quot;Mystery Dance&quot; is a 1950s-style rocker that uses dancing as a metaphor for sex, but unlike &quot;No Dancing&quot;, concerns a couple&#x27;s first experience with it; as such, the narrator is confused by it. Writing for AllMusic, Tom Maginnis considered the track reminiscent of the &quot;sock-hop rock&quot; of Buddy Holly. &quot;Pay It Back&quot; affirms the implication that the media lies to the public. In the song, the narrator finds out not everything in life is guaranteed and feels betrayed. Hinton describes it as &quot;deeply cynical&quot;. Meanwhile, misogyny is prevalent on &quot;I&#x27;m Not Angry&quot;, where sex is portrayed as demeaning rather than joyful. The ideal is acknowledged through the spite in Costello&#x27;s vocal performance, while the music has been likened to hard rock. &quot;Waiting for the End of the World&quot; depicts a surrealistic narrative that takes place on a train, which Gouldstone analyses as a symbol for life. Furthermore, Costello suggests God created the universe but allowed it to be manipulated through individuals that seize power.

==Packaging and artwork==
The album cover was designed by Barney Bubbles who, like Clover, was uncredited on the sleeve. It depicts a checkerboard pattern (surrounding the photo of Costello) on which the phrase &quot;Elvis Is King&quot; is written, which Hinton states was intended as a parody of Bridget Riley&#x27;s Swinging Sixties op art paintings. In the centre, Costello dons his new look and stands in a stiff, pigeon-toed pose clutching a Fender guitar with his large shadow behind him. The author Mick St. Michael commented: &quot;This fellow looked like he&#x27;d find it hard to aim a paper aeroplane.&quot; According to Costello, the final shot was one of the only usable images due to the comical nature during the photo session. He struck a similar pose in the photo on the back of the original sleeve, where he appeared in monochrome against a coloured background while his head appeared disproportionately large. Gouldstone compares his look to &quot;a demented version&quot; of Brains from the 1960s British science fiction series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, actor Woody Allen and Piggy from &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (1954).

Initially, the cover art was in black-and-white on the front and came in four different colours; later reissues added seven additional variants. The first pressings of the record included a flyer that read &quot;Help Us Hype Elvis&quot;, which asked buyers to send in a 25-word description of &quot;why they liked the &#x27;English&#x27; Elvis&quot;. According to Hinton, the first 1,000 purchasers earned them a free copy of the LP to be sent to a friend of their choice. The idea originated from Warner Bros. Records&#x27; attempts to gain American musician Van Dyke Parks a larger audience.

==Release and aftermath==
===Singles===
Stiff issued &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; as a single on 11March 1977, backed by the outtake &quot;Radio Sweetheart&quot;. Despite receiving critical praise, the single failed to reach the UK charts. &quot;Alison&quot; followed on 14May, backed by &quot;Welcome to the Working Week&quot;, which also did not chart. In early July, Stiff released &quot;(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes&quot; as a single, backed by &quot;Mystery Dance&quot;; it lacked a picture sleeve and failed to chart. Regarding the poor commercial performances, Costello recalled: &quot;I remember it being very demoralising, feeling that my only contact with the world was those singles, and those people who I didn&#x27;t know or I&#x27;d never met had to make or break of it…that was very depressing.&quot; Nevertheless, he continued to garner attention from music journalists, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot; Allan Jones and the &quot;NME&quot; Nick Kent, who gave positive assessments to live shows in May and June. Costello also refused to give biographical details in interviews, even telling &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s John Ingham he did not want to be photographed. Costello left his day job at Elizabeth Arden on 5 July.

Initially intended for release shortly after the first single, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was delayed to July while Stiff resolved a distribution dispute with Island Records. In the meantime, Costello wanted to form a permanent backing band that better fitted his aspiring image compared to the laid-back approach of Clover. The first person hired was drummer Pete Thomas, followed by bassist Bruce Thomas (no relation). Around this time, Costello&#x27;s new tracks &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; and &quot;No Action&quot;, were quickly recorded at Pathway with bassist Andrew Bodnar and drummer Steve Goulding, with organ and piano overdubs by Steve Nieve. &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;, influenced by the Clash&#x27;s debut album, was a departure from the sound of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, displaying reggae-style rhythms. Costello later called it his &quot;first real record&quot;. The song was issued as a single in the UK on 14October 1977, backed by live versions of &quot;Blame It on Cain&quot; and &quot;Miracle Man&quot;.

===Live performances===
Stiff issued &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; in the UK on 22July 1977, with the catalogue number SEEZ 3. By the time it came out Costello was performing with his new backing band, donned the Attractions. Shortly after its release, Costello and the Attractions performed an unauthorised show outside a Columbia Records convention that gathered executives from around the world. Partly due to the antics of Riviera, Costello was arrested and charged with obstruction, fined £5 and released from the police station in time for a gig later that evening. The stunt attracted the attention of executive Greg Geller, who was integral in Costello&#x27;s signing to Columbia in the United States months later.

To support &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, Costello and the Attractions conducted a short tour throughout August 1977. The gigs took place in major cities throughout Britain, alongside a residency at the Nashville Rooms in London. The setlist consisted mostly of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; tracks plus various new songs. In the middle of the tour, Elvis Presley died of a heart attack on 16August. Presley&#x27;s death had an immediate impact on Costello: British newspapers &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Observer&quot; cancelled their planned features on the artist while Stiff ran a new slogan for the label that read &quot;The King Is Dead, Long Live the King&quot;. According to Thomson, Presley&#x27;s death helped earn Costello more stature in the music press, with his name becoming &quot;the mood of the zeitgeist&quot;. Four days after his death, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; reached number 14 on the UK Albums Chart.

On 3October 1977, Costello and the Attractions embarked on another tour with other Stiff artists, including Lowe and Wreckless Eric, dubbed the Greatest Stiffs Live Tour. It was plagued with disorder and self-inflicted sabotage, partly due to Costello&#x27;s refusal to play songs from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, declaring &quot;If you wanna hear the old songs, buy the fucking record;&quot; he reversed this stance after audience backlash. Costello also fought with fellow artist Ian Dury throughout the tour. Riviera departed Stiff around this time due to disputes with Robinson. Per his management contract, Costello–and Lowe–followed Riviera and departed Stiff for Radar Records; his final release for Stiff was &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;, which became both the artist and label&#x27;s first single to reach the UK top 20. In the meantime, Costello had amassed a large amount of new material that would appear on his second album &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. In mid-November, he began his first tour of America.

===US release===

&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was released in revised form in the United States through Columbia Records on 1November 1977, adding &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; as the final track on side one. By then, it was the biggest-selling import album in US history. Marketing for the American release was spearheaded by Columbia&#x27;s product manager Dick Wingate, who commissioned a billboard for the LP on Los Angeles&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard, which was usually reserved for more major acts. Other merchandise created included a dartboard for Columbia&#x27;s staff. On 13October, Wingate sent a memo to key Columbia staff, which read: &quot;Despite his appearance, Costello is a deadly serious artist, singer and songwriter... in the R&amp;B revivalist/rock-and-roll school of Graham Parker, Southside Johnny, or even Springsteen. His music is not punk-rock, and should never be labeled so.&quot; Later the same month, Columbia&#x27;s VP of National Album Promotion Mike Pillot sent a memo to staff calling it &quot;One of the most unique and exciting new albums that has graced any turntable during the last few years&quot;.

According to Thomson, Costello&#x27;s fame in the US skyrocketed faster than in the UK. He was earning acclaim in publications such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; and was also approached to appear on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. His newfound popularity led &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; to selling 100,000 copies towards the middle of the tour, and shortly before Christmas 1977, it reached number 32 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. After leaving Stiff, Costello retained his deal with Columbia for distribution in America. Costello was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 20th Annual Grammy Awards in 1978, but lost to the group A Taste of Honey.

==Critical reception==

&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; received rave reviews from British and American music journalists on release. Writing for &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Dave Schulps hailed &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; as 1977&#x27;s &quot;most auspicious debut album&quot;, praising Costello&#x27;s musicianship and songwriting, concluding he has &quot;produced a classic in his first try&quot;. Chas de Whalley of &quot;Sounds&quot; called Costello &quot;a songwriter of rare sensitivity and talent&quot; but had trouble getting a grip with the songs, nevertheless concluding: &quot;Like a flower, Elvis&#x27; debut album is opening up into something of metallic beauty.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Allan Jones wrote that &quot;hell, you can dance to it, swoon and romance with it, smooch and romance to it&quot;. He further noted the record contained &quot;enough potential hit singles to stock a bloody juke-box&quot;, concluding &quot;I can think of only a few albums released this year that rival its general excellence.&quot; Roy Carr of the &quot;NME&quot; came across &quot;sexual psychoanalysis set to a dozen superb juke joint anthems... a Seventies interpretation of Sixties rhythm and roll,&quot; while the songs &quot;spill over with emotional torture and melodrama&quot;. He commented that &quot;Costello must have taken a lot of emotional knocks to come up with such a powerful album. To the extent that one is reticent to guess to what lengths he may have to go to enact a second instalment.&quot;

Several reviewers praised Costello as an artist. Greil Marcus of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;How far Costello can go... remains to be seen, but I have a feeling that once he is heard, he is going to shake up a lot of his erstwhile peers and make many musicians whom he would not consider his peers seem quite irrelevant.&quot; In &quot;Stage Life&quot;, Jeffrey Morgan wrote that at only 22 years old, Costello &quot;gashed a line in his soul using rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as the blade&quot;, creating an LP that, as &quot;flawed as it is, cannot be ignored&quot;. Sam Sutherland of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; hailed Costello as a &quot;new wave rock classicist&quot;, creating an album that &quot;rediscovers the raw vitality of rock&quot; in the midst of &#x27;70s pop. He also called Lowe&#x27;s production &quot;exciting&quot; and &quot;deliberately crude&quot;. Meanwhile, Robin Denselow of &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered the lyrics the best from a British artist in years. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; gave &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; three out of four stars, also praising the lyrical content and felt Costello would achieve a commercial breakthrough.

Writing for &quot;Creem&quot;, Mitchell Cohen hailed &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; as one of the year&#x27;s best albums and praised the songs for their &quot;memorable&quot; choruses and strong ideas. He criticised the misogynistic lyrics, which he compared to the mid-1960s material of Mick Jagger, concluding that Costello has &quot;some way to go before his emotional maturity matches his prodigious artistic skill&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;I like the nerdy way this guy comes on, I&#x27;m fascinated by his lyrics, and I approve of his rock and roll orientation.&quot; He negatively compared Costello to Jackson Browne in that &quot;he&#x27;s a little boring&quot;, which he states comes from an &quot;overconcentration on lyrics&quot; and can be solved by &quot;a healthy relationship with a band&quot;. Danny Baker in &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine, who also made comparisons to Browne in his review, simply called &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; a &quot;good, good album&quot;. 
In &quot;The Village Voice&quot; annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll of the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; finished at number two, behind the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;. It further placed in other year-end lists by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; (3) and &quot;Sounds&quot; (9).

===Retrospective reviews===

In later decades, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; has received critical acclaim, with some naming it one of the best debut albums in rock history. Terry Staunton of &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine summarised: &quot;As opening salvos go, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; has to be one of the most important, impressive and enduring debuts of all time.&quot; Senior AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Costello went on to more ambitious territory fairly quickly, but &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; is a phenomenal debut, capturing a songwriter and musician whose words were as rich and clever as his music.&quot; In &quot;Paste&quot; magazine, Mark Baker similarly wrote that although the record was not Costello&#x27;s greatest work, it still remains &quot;a landmark, highly influential first album&quot;. Goodman concurred, calling the album Costello&#x27;s most essential album. Writing in 2010, Nick Freed of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; called &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; one of the strongest debut albums, stating, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t find a stronger way to bring your style to the world&quot;, further recognising Costello&#x27;s influence on bands such as They Might Be Giants and the Hold Steady. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Armond White wrote that out of the British pub rock scene, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; stands out as a debut &quot;with lots to say&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ reviewers Jason Mendelsohn and Eric Klinger, while positive overall, commented on the lack of the Attractions and subdued production over Costello&#x27;s subsequent albums. Nevertheless, the two called it a &quot;solid&quot; debut whose faults would be resolved the next year on &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;.

Many have commented on the record&#x27;s influence on music. Reviewing in 2001, Adam Bresnick of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Balancing the rage of punk with the formalism of the century&#x27;s best songcraft, the album delivers passion and intelligence in equal measure.&quot; In 2007, LeMay highlighted &quot;Alison&quot;, &quot;Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; as tracks that represent a &quot;vital chapter&quot; in the development of punk and new wave. Furthermore, he found the album as a whole remains as relevant as it did when it was first reissued. Ten years later, a reviewer for &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot; stated that &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; &quot;introduced the world to a hybrid sound that drew near equal influence from 1950s old time rock n&#x27; roll and 1970s cutting edge new wave and punk.&quot; LeMay summarised the album as: &quot;Wordy, witty, and geeky as fuck, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; is without question one of the finest statements of brilliant nerddom ever to be released.&quot; Gouldstone appraises &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; as &quot;a magnificently measured cry of rage&quot; and remains a &quot;remarkable achievement&quot; for someone only 22 years old at the time. Thomson later told &quot;Record Collector&quot;:

===Rankings===
&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; has frequently appeared on lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2000, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was voted number 266 in the third edition of writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 29 on its list of the best albums of the past 20 years. The same magazine ranked the album number 168 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 430 on the 2020 list. The same magazine ranked it the 21st best debut album in 2013. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine also placed it at number 125 in their 2016 list of the 200 greatest albums of all time. In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; the 37th best album of the 1970s, while in 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; placed it at number 20 in a similar list. The staff of &quot;Paste&quot; later voted it the best new wave album of all time in 2020, arguing that it set both the &quot;musical and fashion stage&quot; for the genre. In 2004, Charles Shaar Murray voted it the 61st best British album in a list for &quot;The Observer&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The album was also included in the 2005 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Legacy==
In lists ranking Costello&#x27;s albums, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; has consistently ranked as one of Costello&#x27;s best. In 2021, writers for &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed it at number six, calling it &quot;one of rock music&#x27;s great opening salvos&quot;. A year later, writing for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, Al Shipley placed it at number two, behind &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, stating that had he not made another record after &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, he would &quot;still be a legend&quot;. The same year, Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; also placed it at number two, behind &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. He noted Clover&#x27;s lack of force compared to the Attractions, but nevertheless wrote that fewer have arrived with debuts as &quot;instantly significant&quot; as &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;.

On 8 November 2007, Costello reunited with the members of Clover from the original recording sessions to perform the songs from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;. This marked the first (and to date only) live public performances of these songs by the original ensemble that recorded them. The event took place at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, and was a benefit for the Richard de Lone Special Housing Fund, which assists those with Prader–Willi syndrome.

==Reissues==

&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in July 1986. Its first extended reissue came in October 1993 through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US, which featured nine bonus tracks and extensive liner notes written by Costello himself. In 2001, it was again reissued on CD by Rhino Entertainment, featuring the original album on disc one and a bonus disc of demos, live versions and outtakes, along with a new set of more elaborate Costello-written liner notes; all nine bonus tracks from the 1993 reissue were included with an added four. LeMay considers this reissue the most essential for the album itself.

Six years later, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was reissued again by Universal/Hip-O on 11 September 2007 in a single-disc &quot;Original Masters&quot; package and a two-disc deluxe edition comprising 48 tracks, 26 previously unreleased. This package features the original album, outtakes and solo demos on disc one and a complete live show (with soundcheck) recorded on 7 August 1977 at the Nashville Rooms in London on disc two. The tracks from the live show were mostly from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, with some that appeared on &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, while the demos are previously unreleased tracks including &quot;Blue Minute&quot;, &quot;Call on Me&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Go Home&quot; and &quot;I Hear a Melody&quot;. Hip-O hailed the deluxe edition as &quot;the most definitive version of &#x27;My Aim Is True&#x27; yet!&quot; Despite this, the deluxe edition received mixed reviews. LeMay felt it was inferior to the previous reissues, stating that it &quot;lacks the reverent and enthusiastically geeky perspective of the Rhino reissue&quot;. He further noted the absence of several tracks and in-depth liner notes present on the other reissues. Erlewine similarly questioned the release of the deluxe edition, as he felt it was superfluous following the Rhino reissue. He nevertheless stated that hardcore fans would appreciate the new material, albeit having to purchase an album likely already purchased before.

<text>Karl-Heinz Urban (born 7 June 1972) is a New Zealand actor. His career began with appearances in New Zealand films and television series such as &quot;&quot;. His first Hollywood role was in the 2002 horror film &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;. Since then, he has starred in many high-profile movies, including as Éomer in the second and third installments of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, Vaako in the second and third installments of the &quot;Riddick&quot; film series, Leonard McCoy in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot film series, Kirill in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), John &quot;Reaper&quot; Grimm in &quot;Doom&quot; (2005), Judge Dredd in &quot;Dredd&quot; (2012), Gavin Magary in &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (2016), and Skurge in Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;&quot; (2017). In 2013, he starred in the sci-fi series &quot;Almost Human&quot;. Since 2019, he has starred as Billy Butcher in Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s superhero streaming television series &quot;The Boys&quot;.

==Early life==
Urban was born in Wellington, New Zealand. His father, a German immigrant, owned a leather goods store, and his mother once worked for Film Facilities in Wellington. Through his mother, the young Urban was exposed to classic New Zealand cinema and developed an interest in the film industry. Urban attended St Mark&#x27;s Church School, where he showed an early love for public performance. His first acting role came at age eight, when he had a single line in one episode of the New Zealand television series &quot;Pioneer Woman&quot;. Though continuing to take part in school stage productions, he did not act professionally again until after high school.

He attended Wellington College in 1986–1990. He then enrolled at Victoria University of Wellington in the Bachelor of Arts programme but left after one year to pursue a career in acting. Over the next few years, he appeared in several local TV commercials in addition to theatre roles in the Wellington area. Eventually, he moved to Auckland where he was offered many guest roles in TV shows (one of which was playing a heroin addict in the police drama &quot;Shark in the Park&quot;). Urban then moved briefly to Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia in 1995 before returning to New Zealand the following year.

==Career==
Urban&#x27;s first Hollywood role was in the 2002 horror film &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;. Since then, he has worked on many high-profile movies, including the second and third installments of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (&quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;) as Éomer, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (as Russian Federal Security Service agent Kirill), &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; speculated that Urban was one of several actors being considered for the part of British secret service agent James Bond in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, directed by fellow New Zealander Martin Campbell.

Urban played John &quot;Reaper&quot; Grimm in Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;Doom&quot; (based on the first-person shooter video game &quot;Doom&quot;), which was released on 21 October 2005. In 2007, he starred in the Viking adventure &quot;Pathfinder&quot;. A longtime fan of Westerns, he starred as Woodrow Call in &quot;Comanche Moon&quot;, a television miniseries that aired in early 2008 as a prequel to the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; miniseries based on Larry McMurtry&#x27;s book series of the same name.
In the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, he played Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy, a role originated by DeForest Kelley in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series. A fan of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise since childhood, Urban actively pursued a role in the film. His performance was widely embraced by the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan community for its faithfulness to the spirit of Kelley&#x27;s McCoy. Urban reprised the role in the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; and the 2016 film &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;.

Urban next appeared as CIA agent William Cooper in &quot;Red&quot;, adapted from the graphic novel of the same name and co-starring Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren. He portrayed Black Hat, a villainous priest-turned-vampire, in the film adaptation of the Korean manhwa &quot;Priest&quot;, released in 3-D in 2011.

In 2012, Urban starred as law-enforcing comic book character Judge Dredd in the film &quot;Dredd&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Shave&quot; magazine, Urban described it as a &quot;high-octane, action-fueled film... about the day in the life of Dredd&quot;. The film was directed by Pete Travis, with a script by Alex Garland. Though it underperformed at the box office, &quot;Dredd&quot; was well received by critics.
In 2013, Urban starred as Detective John Kennex in &quot;Almost Human&quot;, a TV series created by J. H. Wyman. The series was set 35 years into the future when cops in the L.A.P.D. are paired up with lifelike androids. Urban played a detective who has a dislike for robots but ends up being teamed up with one with emotional feelings. Urban next appeared in the ensemble thriller &quot;The Loft&quot;, a remake of the Belgian film of the same name. It was filmed in New Orleans and Belgium by the director of the 2008 original, Erik Van Looy. In January 2015, Urban replaced Michael C. Hall as the main antagonist in the 2016 remake of &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;. In 2017, he played Skurge in &quot;&quot;. Also in 2017, Urban played a psychotic cop in the action thriller &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; opposite Antonio Banderas and Robert Forster. Urban had a cameo as a stormtrooper in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; in 2019. He voiced the lead role in &quot;The Sea Beast&quot; in 2022.

Since 2019, Urban has starred as William &quot;Billy&quot; Butcher in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;The Boys&quot;.

==Personal life==
In September 2004, Urban married his longtime partner, Natalie Wihongi, who was his makeup artist for the 2000 television film &quot;The Privateers&quot;. Together they have two sons, Hunter and Indiana. His second son was named for the eponymous hero of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise, which he has stated is one of his favourite movie series. They lived in the affluent Herne Bay section of Auckland, New Zealand. The couple announced their separation in June 2014.

From 2014 to 2018, he was in a relationship with actress Katee Sackhoff.

== Philanthropy ==
Urban serves as a celebrity ambassador for KidsCan, a charity that currently supports over 16,000 disadvantaged children in New Zealand by providing them with essentials such as food, clothing, and shoes.

In May 2022, UNICEF Aotearoa New Zealand welcomed Urban as an official Ambassador to support in raising awareness on children&#x27;s rights both in New Zealand and around the world.

On 1 June 2020, Urban, together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson, joined Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot; which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.

<text>USS &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; (SSBN-610), an nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the inventor Thomas Edison (1847–1931).

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot;″s keel was laid down on 15 March 1960 by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 15 June 1961, sponsored by Mrs. Madeleine Edison Sloane, daughter of Thomas Edison and Mina Miller and wife of John Eyre Sloane, and commissioned on 10 March 1962 with Captain Charles M. Young commanding the Blue Crew and Captain Walter Dedrick commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
On 9 April 1962, during shakedown training off the eastern coast of the United States, &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; collided with the destroyer .

&quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; loaded sixteen Polaris A2 missiles, which had a range of a range of 1500 nm (1725 miles) and carried a single nuclear warhead on each missile, at the naval base in Charleston, South Carolina, and embarked upon her first deterrent patrol on November 7, 1962. She was part of the eight United States nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines which participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis as part of the United States nuclear order of battle from October to November 1962. During Edison&#x27;s load out in Charleston at 1900 on October 22, 1962, DEFCON 3 was ordered for the Poliaris submarines on patrol. At DEFCON 3, “Polaris submarines moved to their launch points.” She concluded that patrol at the base at Holy Loch, Scotland, from which she operated for the next four years and conducted 17 deterrent patrols. In September 1966, her official home port was changed from New London, Connecticut, to Charleston, South Carolina, in preparation for her first major overhaul. She ended her 17th patrol at Charleston on 15 October 1966 and began her overhaul on 28 October 1966. She completed repairs on 9 May 1968; and, after post-overhaul sea trials and shakedown, she embarked upon her 18th deterrent patrol on 22 September 1968.

After a shortened 19th patrol, she conducted a &quot;Follow on Target&quot; (FOT) test launch. For this test, four missiles were selected at random, their warheads were removed, and telemetry packages were fitted in place of the warheads. &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; then proceeded to a location just off the Canary Islands and fired these missiles into the Caribbean. Due to the accuracy and timeliness of these successful launches, the members of that Blue Crew were awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation.

Through June 1973, &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; operated out of New London and Rota, Spain, from which ports she conducted another 19 deterrent patrols in the Mediterranean Sea.

In June 1973, she was transferred to the United States Pacific Fleet, arriving in San Diego, on 11 July 1973. After a short period of operations with Submarine Group 5, she moved to Vallejo, California, on 6 August 1973 to begin another overhaul, this time at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California. On 30 November 1974, she completed repairs and, following shakedown in January and February 1975, she transited the Panama Canal again in March 1975 to fire test missiles near Cape Canaveral, Florida. She concluded that mission in July and retransited the Canal on 8 August 1975. &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; carried out operations along the United States West Coast until December 1975, at which time she headed for her new home port, Apra, Guam.

On 6 October 1980, &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; completed her final deterrent patrol and was reclassified an attack submarine, given hull number SSN-610. &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot;″s missile section was deactivated. Concrete blocks were placed in the missile tubes, and the missile fire-control system and one of the ship&#x27;s inertial navigation systems were removed. 

Decommissioned on 1 December 1983, &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1986. She went through the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, beginning on 1 October 1996 and on 1 December 1997 ceased to exist as the recycling was completed.

==Elevator==

&quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; was the first and only submarine to have an elevator. In 1962, an elevator was added to &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot; so that President Kennedy could access the submarine. President Kennedy had a back injury which prevented him from using vertical ladders. The addition was known as the &quot;JFK Submarine Access Elevator&quot; and allowed the President to enter the submarine through one of its deck hatches while standing. On April 13, 1962, President Kennedy and his naval aide to the president, Captain Tazewell Shepard, Jr., toured the recently commissioned submarine while it was at the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. As of February 2022, the elevator is located at the Museum along the Thames River in Groton, Connecticut.

== Steinway piano ==

During the construction of &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot;, the commissioning captain, Charles M. &quot;Cy&quot; Young, purchased a Steinway piano that was placed aboard before the hull was sealed. This piano remained on board the submarine for 22 years (1961–1983) up until her decommissioning. The Steinway piano is the only example of a full-sized piano ever installed on a U.S. submarine conducting nuclear deterrent patrols.

<text>Whittier College is a private liberal arts college in Whittier, California. It is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and, as of spring 2024, had 815 undergraduate and graduate students. It was founded in 1887. Whittier offers one graduate degreea master&#x27;s degree in education.

==History==
Whittier College, founded in 1887, was named for the Quaker abolitionist and poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Since that time, the institution has grown into a distinctive, national liberal arts college. The college campus has about 800 students and more than 100 faculty. It emphasizes small, interactive classes led by full-time faculty members.

==Academics==
Whittier College is a four-year liberal arts institution. Nearly half of the student body is Latino, and students of color constitute about 70% of the college&#x27;s campus population. A majority of students hail from California. As of 2017, there are students from at least 27 states and 14 countries.

Whittier offers over 30 majors and 30 minors in 23 disciplines, emphasizing interdisciplinary learning. Students may also apply for entry into the Whittier Scholars Program, in which each student, under the guidance of a faculty member, designs their major and course of study based on individual interests and career goals. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were
*Business Administration and Management (62)
*Exercise Science and Kinesiology (52)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (40)
*Psychology (38)
*Social Sciences (29)
*English Language and Literature (24)

Whittier College hosts a Faculty House Program, which is modeled after similar programs at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. In this program, faculty are selected as faculty-in-residence for a multi-year term, live in houses located on-campus, and create and host in their homes educational and social programs around a specific theme, such as health and society, writers and writing, alumni connections, and Spanish culture.

Additionally, the college&#x27;s graduate program in education offers both credential and Master of Arts in education degree programs. Broadoaks Children&#x27;s School – a private, non-profit demonstration school on the Whittier campus – serves as a learning laboratory for Whittier faculty and undergraduate and graduate students.

===Whittier Law School===
Whittier Law School was located on a satellite campus in Costa Mesa, California. It started in the Hancock Park section of Los Angeles in 1966 as Beverly Law School. In 1975, Beverly College joined Whittier with the law school, moving to Costa Mesa in 1997. Whittier Law School has 4,500 alumni practicing in 48 states and 14 countries. The school was accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) beginning in 1978 and was a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) beginning 1987.

On April 19, 2017, the law school announced that it would stop admitting students and begin the process of shutting down. The school ceased operations in July 2020.

== Enrollment ==
Whittier College has traditionally enrolled 1000–1500 undergraduate students, allowing most classes to be seminars. Since 1984, Whittier College has averaged an undergraduate population of 1329 students, but the average student body size increased to over 1600 students during the 2010s. Enrollment dropped significantly during the tenure of former President Linda Oubre (2018–2023) from more than 1750 students in 2017 to 815 in spring 2024.

==Student life==

Whittier College has approximately 80 registered, student-run organizations. The college also has societies, which are similar to fraternities and sororities. Other campus groups include student publications, the &quot;Quaker Campus&quot; newspaper and television, the student-run radio station KPOET Radio, Video Productions Studios, and the Whittier College Sports Network. 

==Athletics==

The Whittier Poets compete in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) of NCAA Division III. The school has fielded sports teams for over 100 years. Its current teams include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, lacrosse and water polo, women&#x27;s softball and volleyball, and men&#x27;s baseball and golf. In November 2022, Whittier announced that it was discontinuing its football team, men&#x27;s lacrosse, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf.

The history of the Whittier football program began in 1907, and since the inception of the SCIAC in 1915, the Poets have won 26 conference titles. From 1957 to 1964, Whittier won eight straight SCIAC football titles under the direction of coaches George Allen (1951–1956), Don Coryell (1957–1959), and John Godfrey (1960–1979). Their most recent championships came back-to-back in 1997 and 1998. Twenty-three Poets have earned All-American honors, the most recent coming in 2007. The football program plays out of Newman Memorial Field, which seats 7,000. Whittier maintained a century-long football rivalry with Occidental Tigers. The two schools play for the shoes of 1939 All-American Myron Claxton. In November 2022, the school announced it would discontinue the football program.

The Whittier men&#x27;s lacrosse program was established in 1980. In 1980, the Poets became a member of the Western Collegiate Lacrosse League (WCLL). From 1980 to 1999, Whittier won ten championships. In 1990, they were recognized by the NCAA but continued to compete in the WCLL. The Poets were the team to beat throughout the 1990s, and it was not until 2000 that Whittier decided to make their mark on the national scene by leaving the WCLL and focusing on being selected for the NCAA tournament. On November 15, 2022, it was announced that Whittier College would discontinue its men&#x27;s lacrosse program after the conclusion of their season.

The Whittier men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving teams earned Academic All-American status—the women for the fourth straight year and the men for the first time after the College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) announced the programs who achieved this honor for the 2015 Fall Semester. Five hundred forty-seven swimming and diving teams representing 354 colleges and universities have been named College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) Scholar All-American Teams. The awards recognize teams with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher during the 2015 fall semester.

The termination of football, lacrosse, and golf in the fall of 2022 was greeted with controversy and protests.

==Notable alumni==
Notable alumni include former U.S. President Richard Nixon; actress Andrea Barber, known from the television comedy &quot;Full House&quot; and &quot;Fuller House;&quot; video blogger Cassey Ho; actors and brothers Geoff Stults, and George Stults; and author Jessamyn West.

<doc id="407686" wikidata="Q1248618" url="?curid=407686" title="The Newlywed Game">
<text>The Newlywed Game is an American television game show. Newly married couples compete against each other in a series of revealing question rounds to determine how well the spouses know or do not know each other. The program, originally created by Robert &quot;Nick&quot; Nicholson and E. Roger Muir (credited on-screen as Roger E. Muir) and produced by Chuck Barris, has appeared in many different versions since its 1966 debut. The show became famous for some of the arguments that couples had over incorrect answers in the form of mistaken predictions, and it even led to some divorces.

Many of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;″s questions dealt with &quot;making whoopee&quot;, the euphemism that producers used for sexual intercourse to circumvent network censorship. However, it became such a catchphrase of the show that its original host, Bob Eubanks, continued to use the phrase throughout the show&#x27;s many runs, even in the 1980s and 1990s episodes and beyond, when he could easily have said &quot;make love&quot; or &quot;have sex&quot; during these periods without censorship.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it No. 10 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; debuted on the ABC television network on July 11, 1966, scheduled at 2 p.m. (1 p.m. Central). On the day it debuted, CBS preempted its popular &quot;Password&quot; to cover a news conference held by then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, which was delayed a half-hour, with the network &quot;vamping&quot; until he spoke. ABC opted to wait until just as the press conference began, and as a result &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; was able to get a slight head start in the head-to-head ratings battle with the long-running &quot;Password.&quot; Over the next few months more viewers were tuning into &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and it became a hit, while &quot;Password&#x27;s&quot; ratings began to fall and eventually led to the series&#x27; cancellation fourteen months later.

However, NBC debuted &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in late 1965 at 2/1, a soap opera that initially struggled to climb in the ratings. But by the early 1970s, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; was winning the timeslot regularly (though not always) over &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; and CBS&#x27; &quot;Guiding Light.&quot; Eventually, ABC determined that &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; had run its course on daytime and on December 20, 1974, the show concluded its initial run after nearly eight and a half years on the network. It was the longest-running game show in ABC daytime history until 1985, when &quot;Family Feud&quot; surpassed it, having run nine years at the time of its cancellation that year. &quot;The Money Maze,&quot; a game hosted by Cincinnati TV personality Nick Clooney, father of famed actor George Clooney, replaced it on the ABC schedule, but lasted only six months.

A syndicated version of the show began airing in 1977, with the same rules and set as the ABC original, albeit with more double entendres than the original. Mostly successful, it nonetheless was canceled in 1980, not directly because of the show itself. In fall 1979, creator Chuck Barris had debuted something of a spin-off show, &quot;3&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, in which a man, his wife and his secretary would compete. The controversy, driven by the implications of adultery that came with such a concept, ruined Barris&#x27;s reputation and not only ended &quot;3&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, but all three of Barris&#x27;s other shows that were airing at the time: &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. This was because most local stations did not want anything to do with the controversy, fearing potential boycotts and loss of advertising that might result.

A special week-long series for Valentine&#x27;s Day aired on ABC in February 1984 and was the last time the show aired on a broadcast network. The set for the week of specials would later be used for Bob Eubanks&#x27; return to &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot; in syndication a year later.

Until the GSN series&#x27; premiere on October 12, 2009, all subsequent editions of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; were seen in syndication. A revival that aired from 1985 until 1989 was referred to as &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot; for the first three and a half years of its run. The last and most recent syndicated &quot;Newlywed Game&quot; aired new episodes from 1996 until 1999, continued in reruns for an additional season, and was sold to stations as part of an hour-long block with a revival of &quot;The Dating Game.&quot;

==Production==

===Hosts and announcers===
Founding host Bob Eubanks was the master of ceremonies, or &quot;emcee&quot;, who became most often associated with &quot;The Newlywed Game.&quot; Just 28 years old at the time the show debuted in 1966, he was the youngest emcee to host a game show. Eubanks hosted the ABC and first syndicated series, then returned to host &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot; in September 1985. Former Dating Game host Jim Lange hosted the aforementioned week of specials in 1984, as Eubanks was hosting &quot;Dream House&quot; on NBC at the time, making Lange the only person to host both &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Newlywed Game.&quot;

In December 1988, Eubanks stepped down as the host of the series and he was replaced with comedian Paul Rodriguez. The title of the series became &quot;The Newlywed Game Starring Paul Rodriguez&quot; and remained so for the remainder of the 1988–89 season, after which the series was cancelled after four seasons.

Former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; regular Gary Kroeger hosted the first season of the revival of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; in 1996, which was conducted under a much different format from the previous series. After a year of struggling ratings, Eubanks returned to host and the format was reinstated to the classic &quot;Newlywed Game&quot; format. He has also hosted several special episodes of the current &quot;Newlywed Game,&quot; which has made Eubanks the only host to preside over an episode of the same series in six different decades.

The GSN edition was hosted by Carnie Wilson and narrated by Randy West from its debut on April 6, 2009 until the end of its third season on July 16, 2010, when Wilson elected not to return. As noted above, Eubanks hosted two special episodes of this version – one featured Wilson and her husband as well as her sister Wendy, her mother Marilyn, and their husbands; the second featured game show hosts Monty Hall, Peter Marshall, Wink Martindale and their wives. On August 18, 2010, it was announced that &quot;The View&quot; co-host Sherri Shepherd would take over as host for the fourth season of the show which premiered November 1, 2010. The fifth season premiered on April 18, 2011, with a new logo design, and with Shepherd serving as a narrator in addition to hosting. Shepherd continued taking on the role of host and narrator for the sixth season which premiered on October 25, 2012.

Scott Beach, who was Barris&#x27;s first choice as host, was the announcer in the very early episodes of &quot;The Newlywed Game.&quot; After Beach resigned, Barris&#x27;s primary staff announcer, Johnny Jacobs, took over, continuing as the announcer for the series until the first syndicated version was canceled in 1980. Tony McClay, who was a frequent Jacobs substitute, took over from time to time on the syndicated &quot;Newlywed Game.&quot; Rod Roddy was the announcer for the ABC specials. When &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot; premiered in 1985, Bob Hilton was its announcer. He was replaced by Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, whom Barris had signed away from Barry &amp; Enright Productions, in early 1988. O&#x27;Donnell continued to announce through the end of the Paul Rodriguez-hosted season, then left Barris to return to his position at &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; which he held till his death.

Los Angeles radio DJ Ellen K provided the announcing for the first season of the 1996 revival, with John Cramer taking over upon Eubanks&#x27;s return. For the first season of the 2009 revival Brad Aldous served as the announcer. Randy West took over for the next two seasons, and former host Gary Kroeger took over for West for the fourth season. As of the fifth season, host Shepherd doubled as announcer for the couple introductions and the voice-overs for the prize descriptions.

===Theme songs===
The theme music originally started off as a vocal song called &quot;Summertime Guy&quot;. The song was written by Chuck Barris for singer Eddie Rambeau, who performed and released the song on a Swan label 45 rpm SP record. Minutes before the song was to be presented on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in 1962, ABC informed Rambeau that he couldn&#x27;t sing the song (because Chuck Barris was an ABC employee at the time), and he performed the B-side of the record instead.

Not wanting the song to go to waste, Barris commissioned Milton DeLugg a few years later to arrange an instrumental version of &quot;Summertime Guy&quot; for use as the first theme to &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;. The theme music was performed by the Trumpets Olé in a style similar to Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, and was released as the last track on the LP album &quot;The Trumpets Olé Play Instrumentals&quot;. To better fit the show&#x27;s spirit, DeLugg preceded the pop song&#x27;s melody with a sample of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Wedding March&quot;.

The theme was re-recorded around 1973 by Frank Jaffe and Michael Stewart. Featured as the third track on the LP album &quot;Chuck Barris Presents Themes from TV Game Shows&quot;, it was used on &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; beginning with the syndicated version in 1977. Then, Milton DeLugg, who was by this time Barris&#x27; house musical director, created a new, updated theme based on the existing melody for &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot; beginning with Jim Lange&#x27;s 1984 series of specials, and then for the first several years of the Bob Eubanks-hosted revival.

When Paul Rodriguez took over in 1988, the theme song was changed to the 1950s doo wop classic &quot;Book of Love&quot; by the Monotones, making this the only theme song of the show with lyrics. The Gary Kroeger version featured an entirely new theme; when Eubanks returned, a new recording of the classic theme was used for his first season (arranged by Steve Kaplan &amp; Jim Latham), but dropped in favor of a new theme for the third season by Barry Coffing and John Blaylock.

The GSN version uses an updated looping version of the classic theme composed by Lewis Flinn. For Shepherd&#x27;s second season, the show&#x27;s logo, intro, and set was changed, dropping the classic theme.

===Production companies===
Chuck Barris Productions produced all versions from 1966 to 1986, with the 1986–89 versions credited to Barris Productions. Columbia TriStar Television (CTT), who owns the Chuck Barris game show library, produced and distributed the 1996–1999 revivals. Embassy Row, a New York-based television production company, produces the Wilson and Shepherd-hosted version for CTT&#x27;s successor Sony Pictures Television (who owns the formatting rights and, as of January 14, 2009, Embassy Row) and GSN.

==Eligibility==
Couples that had not yet celebrated their second anniversary were eligible to be contestants. As such, the majority of contestants were young adults. However, due to the rule of &quot;couples being married two years or less&quot;, sometimes older couples were eligible, such as widowed senior citizens or divorced middle-aged people who had remarried.

==Gameplay==
For the first round, the wives were taken off the stage while the husbands were asked how they thought their wives would answer three questions. The wives were then brought back on stage and were asked for their answers for the same three questions. Once the wife gave her answer, the husband revealed the answer that he previously gave, which was written on a blue card. A match for that question was worth 5 points for the couple.

The roles were reversed in the second round, where the husbands were taken off the stage and the wives were asked four questions before the husbands were brought back on stage to give their answers. The first three questions in this round were worth 10 points each, and the final question was worth 25 points; Eubanks referred to this as the &quot;25-point bonus question&quot;. The maximum possible score for any couple was 70 points. The couple with the highest score at the end of the second round won a prize that was &quot;chosen just for you&quot;. (Actually, the couples had requested a certain prize and competed with other couples that had requested the same prize.) By 1987, this practice was eliminated.

The grand prize was never a car or cash, but it could include just about anything else: appliances, furniture, home entertainment systems, a trailer or motorcycles, trips (complete with luggage and camera), etc. In the 1997 remake, the grand prize was always a trip, this time referred to as &quot;a fabulous second honeymoon&quot; instead of &quot;a grand prize chosen just for you.&quot;

Prior to taping the show, each couple was asked to predict the total points they would earn. In the event of a tie for first place, the tied couples reveal a card showing this predicted score. The winner went to whichever couple that had the closest guess without going over their actual total. In the event that all couples overshot their prediction; the winner would be decided by which prediction was the most accurate. In the event a couple had made an exact score prediction, they were awarded a special prize for precision.

For the first half of the 1988–89 season, the series adopted a new scoring format where each correct answer paid cash. All four couples were given $25 to start. In the first half, three questions were played at $25 per right answer. The second half featured three questions and the first two paid off at $50 for a right answer. The third question saw the couples wager any or all of their money, with right answers adding the amount of the wager and wrong answers deducting it. The couple in the lead at the end of the game still won the grand prize, but any money that the other three couples won was theirs to keep. The maximum possible amount was $500.

This scoring format was dropped, and the old one reinstated, when Paul Rodriguez took over as host in December 1988, although the number of couples competing was then reduced to three.

===1996–97 version===
When Gary Kroeger took over in Fall 1996 the show was overhauled with a new format. Like with the 1988–89 season of &quot;The New Newlywed Game,&quot; three couples competed in a series of rounds.

====Round 1====
Each spouse was shown a videotape of their mates who gave a statement mostly about their spouse. The tape was paused near the end which gave the spouse in control a chance predict how his/her mate completed the statement. Then the tape played again, and a correct answer earned 10 points. First the husbands&#x27; tapes were shown and the wives took a guess, and then it went the opposite direction.

An alternate format had the wives asked a series of questions prior to the show. The wives buzzed in when they believe their husband could match and said, &quot;He better know this.&quot; Matches earn 5 points and not matching cost 5 points.

====Round 2====
Kroeger asked the couples a multiple-choice question in which one half of the couples had given answers in advance, and the other must guess what they chose. Each match again earns 10 points. First the wives predicted what their husbands said, then the process was reversed.

An alternate version had Kroger asked either the wives or husbands a series of questions by either &quot;Way or No Way&quot; while the husbands or wives are in isolation. After that, the wives/husbands return from the isolation trying to match what they said for 10 points.

====Round 3====
In this round before the show, either the wives or the husbands gave some very weird facts about themselves. Kroeger gave the facts to the other half of the couple, who were equipped with heart-shaped signs that say &quot;That&#x27;s My Wife/Man!&quot; If they recognized that fact, all they had to do was to raise the sign and yell out &quot;THAT&#x27;S MY WIFE/MAN!&quot; Correct recognitions won 10 points for their team, but wrong ones lost 10 points for the team. Only the first person to raise the sign could win or lose. Seven facts were played.

====Round 4====
In this final round of the game, Kroeger read a series of choices (ex: Candy or Potato Chips, Rocket Scientist or Space Cadet, Ketchup or Mustard, etc.) and the wives held cards with one of the choices on it. Then the husbands chose one of the two things that most applies to them. Each match earned points. There were seven questions, and each question was worth 10 points more than the previous question with the last question worth even more. So 310 points were possible for any couple who answer all seven questions correctly in this round.

*Question 1 – 10 points
*Question 2 – 20 points
*Question 3 – 30 points
*Question 4 – 40 points
*Question 5 – 50 points
*Question 6 – 60 points
*Question 7 – 100 points

The couple with the most points would win the game and the second honeymoon trip. If there was a tie, a tie-breaker question was played until only one couple correctly answered the question; that couple would then win. If two couples answered correctly or incorrectly, this tie-breaker was repeated with a new question. This also applied to all three couples who answered right or wrong, or two of the three couples in the tie-breaker who answered correctly.

This format was mostly disliked by fans of the original show, so for the second season of this version, it reverted to its original format and theme, with original host Eubanks back at the helm.

===2009–2013 version===
The first season of the GSN version retained the classic format, but again only used three couples and the addition of a new endgame featuring a couple from a previous version, referred to as &quot;Goldyweds&quot;.

In Round 1, three questions were asked of the wives, and the husbands try to match the wives&#x27; responses for 5 points apiece. The roles were reversed for Round 2, with the first two questions worth 10 points. The third and final question, worth 20 points, was called the &quot;eHarmony.com Dimension Question&quot; and was based on one of the &quot;29 dimensions&quot; used by the site to match up couples. (In some episodes which had couples who had first met on eHarmony.com, no mention of eHarmony or a specific &quot;dimension&quot; was mentioned for this last question.) The maximum possible score for any couple for the first season was 55 points. The couple with the highest score won a second honeymoon vacation.

The winners then played a Bonus Round against the Goldyweds, who were a couple that had appeared on a previous version of the show; usually, this was one of the versions Eubanks had hosted. In this round, the wives were taken off-stage and asked 5 questions during the commercial break. The husbands took positions in the front of the stage as their wives sit on chairs in the back. The questions were worth increasing values from 1–5 points (for a maximum possible score of 15 points for either couple). The couple with the most points won a bonus prize, usually a piece of Sony technology.

In the show&#x27;s second season, several changes were made in the gameplay. The game was still played with only three couples, but the husbands were first to give responses to three questions for the wives to guess at 5 points each. (Some episodes featured &quot;Maybelline Beauty Questions&quot;, quizzing the husbands on their wives&#x27;s beauty routines; or &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal &#x27;Can This Marriage Be Saved?&#x27; Questions&quot;, which focused on some of the tougher aspects of married life as based on the magazine&#x27;s trademark column.) Then the wives responded to four questions; the first three worth 10 points each (on occasion, the third was still a &quot;eHarmony.com Dimension Question&quot;), and the fourth being a two-response bonus question, with each part worth 15 points (couples received 15 points for getting one of the two responses right, or 30 points for both), making for a maximum score of 75 points per couple. As before, the highest-scoring couple won a second honeymoon trip, but no Goldywed Bonus Round was played. (The &quot;Goldywed&quot; concept lived on, however, in the form of occasional special shows featuring couples that appeared on one of the earlier versions). In the sixth season, the fourth question returns to its original 25 point bonus question.

In the event of a tie during either the main game (in either season) or the endgame (in the first season), standard &quot;Newlywed Game&quot; &quot;prediction&quot; tiebreaker rules apply.

====Same-sex couples====
In the 2009–10 season, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; had the first same-sex married couples appear on the show. In episode two of the season, the first such couple was &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor George Takei and his husband, Brad Altman, playing in a special Celebrity Edition of the game, against &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; couple Damien Gurganius and Nicole Brewer, and Christopher Knight and Adrienne Curry (&quot;My Fair Brady&quot;). Takei and Altman won the game and $10,000 for their charity, the Japanese American National Museum. The first non-celebrity same-sex couple, also winning their episode&#x27;s grand prize package, would appear the following season (2010–11), which coincided with the third season&#x27;s premiere episode, which aired on June 17, 2010.

==Specials==
===The Newlywed Game: A Silver Anniversary of Love and Laughter===
On April 18, 1998, a special titled &quot;The Newlywed Game: A Silver Anniversary of Love and Laughter&quot; aired on Game Show Network (GSN) hosted by Bob Eubanks and was announced by Gene Wood (though Wood was never credited) where it looks back at some of the couples who have appeared on the show during the 60&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s &amp; 80&#x27;s incarnations.

===Cover Story: The Newlywed Game - Most Outrageous Answers===
On October 28, 2018, an episode of the series &quot;Cover Story&quot; airing on Game Show Network (GSN) titled &quot;Cover Story: The Newlywed Game - Most Outrageous Answers&quot; hosted by Trish Suhr, features the most outrageous and hilarious moments from the show that spans over many seasons.

==Episode status==
Most episodes of the original ABC daytime version are lost, and many of those that do survive are said to have deteriorated. However, a handful have been shown on GSN, most notably the 1974 finale. The ABC nighttime version&#x27;s status is also unknown for similar reasons, although a few of the evening shows have been shown on GSN&#x27;s former block &quot;Game Show Saturday Night&quot;. Most of the syndicated version exists, and has been rerun on GSN in the past.

In 2009, GSN premiered a new version of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;. The first three seasons were hosted by Carnie Wilson, and since November 1, 2010 have been hosted by Sherri Shepherd. With these two hosts and a combined six seasons, this version has had 430 episodes, 260 with Shepherd and 170 with Wilson.

On March 21, 2012, GSN announced that a sixth season of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; with Sherri Shepherd would air in the 2012–13 television season. The sixth season of The Newlywed Game premiered on GSN on October 25, 2012 at 8:00 p.m., airing four new episodes every Thursday night.

In October 2021, it was announced that classic episodes hosted by Eubanks would air on Buzzr beginning on November 15, 2021, making the series the first Sony-owned property to air on the network. As of February 2022, the network has aired episodes from the 1997-98 season.

==Licensed merchandise==
Hasbro produced three home editions of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; during its 1960s/70s run on ABC from 1967 and 1969. Prior to this, a special rarely seen red box edition was released in 1979 similar to the Hasbro editions, It even uses the same questions as well. However, the copyright is from &quot;A Chuck Barris Production&quot; instead of Hasbro. Pressman released a version based on the 1985 version in 1986. Currently, classic board games creator Endless Games, which specializes in board games based on several widely popular, long-running television game shows, including &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, distributes home versions of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, including three standard editions (the third titled &quot;Classic&quot; to differentiate itself from the current GSN version), a DVD edition, a &quot;Quick Picks&quot; travel-size edition, and a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; which combines the first standard edition game with the DVD edition.

In 1971, Pocket Books published a beginners&#x27; cookbook entitled &quot;The Newlywed Game Cook Book&quot;. It was compiled by Jody Cameron Malis and featured Bob Eubanks&#x27; picture on the cover.

A video slot machine based on &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; was released by IGT in 2004. It had an animated Jim Lange (who had previously hosted the ABC special in 1984) appearing in the game instead of Bob Eubanks.

The show&#x27;s original theme music has been released several times on LP and CD, most notably as part of the GSN-approved &quot;Classic TV Game Show Themes&quot; CD from Varèse Sarabande.

<text>A Modest Destiny is a pixel art webcomic created by Sean Howard. The comic started in January 2003.

== History ==
===Creation===
&quot;A Modest Destiny&quot; was created by Sean Howard. In an interview, Howard said that his background was in programming. He said that he became interested in comics when a website he followed went down for a server upgrade and the admin posted a list of things people could do instead, one of which was a link to &quot;Sluggy Freelance&quot;. Some time later, he was seeking work and looking for a way to be creative and started drawing comics. Howard said that his use of pixel art was based on needing art for video games he was producing. Howard felt the term &quot;sprite comic&quot; was inappropriate for his work as his art was original rather than copied out of a video game, and said he could not agree with doing so and that &quot;it has led to some of the worst webcomics in existence.&quot;

=== Publication ===
In a January 2004 interview, Howard said that he wanted &quot;A Modest Destiny&quot; to run for only three years, so that it would never get tired and repeat itself.

In July 2005, with the final storyline halfway through, Howard announced that he was ceasing to make webcomics.

=== Dispute with Penny Arcade ===
In late 2003, Howard wrote to the creators of &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; over the use of his art by users of the Penny Arcade forum. Howard&#x27;s letter said that he had already &quot;shut down six web comics that were using his art&quot;. Mike Krahulik posted about the letter and dispute on the Penny Arcade website, including a link to &quot;A Modest Destiny&quot;; the traffic overload from this temporarily caused a shutdown of Howard&#x27;s site.

==Plot==
&quot;A Modest Destiny&quot; consists of four chapters, also called seasons or arcs – &quot;Maxim Saves the World&quot;, &quot;The Dreaded Vampire Lord Fluffy&quot;, &quot;The War of Fate&quot;, and &quot;Prophecies of the Demon King&quot; – and one short story entitled &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot;. The comic is set in a fantasy world.

The first arc, &quot;Maxim Saves The World&quot;, follows the adventures of the titular character, Maxim, and is narrated through a series of flashbacks. The second arc, &quot;The Dreaded Vampire Lord Fluffy&quot;, is roughly half the length of the first and focusses on a single story rather than several smaller ones. Set in the same universe as the first chapter, it follows a vampire necromancer named Fluffy who had been tamed by society. The story also features a number of lesser-used characters from the first storyline and depicts the events leading up to a war between the humans and the undead. The third arc, &quot;The War Of Fate&quot;, is set five years after the end of &quot;Lord Fluffy&quot; in a world all but destroyed by war against the undead. An undead army, led by the mysterious Black Knight, has taken over the majority of the country, with only a small group of humans left to oppose him. These humans, led by Maxim and his friends, defend a small city called Last Hope. The final arc of &quot;A Modest Destiny&quot; was titled &quot;Prophecies of the Demon King&quot;.

== Reception ==
In his 2004 book, &quot;How to Draw and Sell Digital Cartoons&quot;, Leo Hartas used &quot;A Modest Destiny&quot; as an illustration of how reusing artwork can be an effective way to save time when creating a comic.

<doc id="407699" wikidata="Q1130641" url="?curid=407699" title="Alor Island">
<text>Alor () is the largest island in the Alor Archipelago and is one of the 92 officially listed outlying islands of Indonesia. It is located at the eastern end of the Lesser Sunda Islands chain that runs through southeastern Indonesia, which from the west include such islands as Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, and Flores.

To the east of the island across the Ombai Strait lie the islands of Wetar (in Maluku Province) and Atauro, the latter belonging to East Timor. To the south, across the Strait of Alor, lies the western part of Timor. To the north lies the Banda Sea. To the west lies Pantar and the other islands of the Alor archipelago, and further yet the rest of the Sunda Islands.

Alor Island, as well as the rest of its archipelago, is part of East Nusa Tenggara province.

==Geography==
Alor has an area of about 2,125 km2, making it the largest island of the Alor archipelago. Kalabahi is the only town on the island of Alor, with an estimated population of 19,210 in mid 2023. The variety of goods obtainable in Kalabahi is surprising considering its size and location. The 2010 census recorded the population of the island as 145,299 out of 190,000 in the regency. The 2020 census produced a total of 163,377, and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 171,275.

Alor is of volcanic origin and has very rugged terrain. The main part of the island is mountainous, but there is a prominent peninsula along its north coast which includes the main town of Kalabahi; the peninsula encompasses the administrative districts of Alor Barat Laut and Kabola, plus the northern half of the Mutiara Bay District (&quot;kecamatan Teluk Mutiara&quot;). The region near Kalabahi is the only flat area. This may be why the Dutch chose the location as the capital and main harbor (Alor-Kecil) in 1911.

On 12 November 2004, an earthquake occurred, killing 34 people, and injuring 400. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;).

== Administration==
Alor Island comprises twelve of the eighteen districts of the Alor Regency, as follows, with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 158 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 17 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;), and its post code.
Notes: (a) including the &quot;kelurahan&quot; of Moru. &lt;br&gt;(b) the 2010 population of the new Abad Selatan District is included with the figure for Alor Barat Daya District, from which it was subsequently split off in 2020. &lt;br&gt;(c) including the &quot;kelurahan&quot; of Kelaisi Timur. (d) including the &quot;kelurahan&quot; of Kolana Utara. &lt;br&gt;(e) including the town of Kalabahi, and neighbouring rural &quot;desa&quot; on both sides of Mutiara Bay, plus uninhabited Pulau Kapas. &lt;br&gt;(f) comprises ten &quot;kelurahan&quot; (Kalabahi Barat, Kalabahi Kota, Kalabahi Tengah, Kalabahi Timur, Binongko, Nusa Kenari, Welai Barat, Welai Timur, Mutiara and Wetabua) and six &quot;desa&quot;. &lt;br&gt;(g) includes the uninhabited offshore islands of Sika and Nub. (h) includes the &quot;kelurahan&quot; of Kabola. (i) apart from villages of Alila Timur and Lawahing (which have a postcode of 85851). &lt;br&gt;(k) includes the offshore islands of Pulau Kepa, Pulau Buaya and uninhabited Pulau Ternate. (l) includes the &quot;kelurahan&quot; of Adang.
== Economy ==

The island&#x27;s infrastructure is only weakly built. The inhabitants practice mainly subsistence agriculture. In the villages, vanilla, tamarind, almonds (Canarium) and other nuts are cultivated. In the forests sandalwood is cut down for trade.

The latest geological explorations have discovered valuable resources such as gypsum, kaolin, petroleum, natural gas, tin, gold, and diamonds. Alor&#x27;s snorkelling and diving may promise an increase in tourism in the future. Alor hosts some of the most healthy and diverse corals in Indonesia and has areas of black volcanic sand for specialized scuba diving interests.

== Religion ==
211,872 people lived on Alor and Pantar in 2020, of whom 163,377 were on Alor itself; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 171,275. 68.46% were Protestants, 25.65% Muslims and 3.04% Roman Catholics (in a few villages). Animistic rites and traditions are still strongly practiced.

== Language ==

The majority of the more than fifteen indigenous languages spoken on Alor belong to the Papuan (non-Austronesian) family of Alor languages. These include Abui, Adang, Hamap, Kabola, Kafoa, Woisika, Kelon, and Kui. In addition, Alorese is a Malayo-Polynesian language which is spoken along the coast of the western and southern Bird&#x27;s Head of Alor Island and in places on surrounding islands.

Many of the Papuan languages of Alor are endangered and are no longer being actively acquired by children. Some languages have fewer than 1000 speakers remaining. Significant linguistic documentation efforts have been undertaken recently by Leiden University. The language of daily communication is Alor Malay, a unique Malay variety with some similarities to Kupang Malay. Indonesian is taught in schools and used widely in media.

==Transportation==
Alor is served by Alor Mali Airport (ARD). The airport is small, and all incoming and outgoing flights are thus via Kupang Airport (KOE). Alor is serviced 3–4 times daily by both Wings Air and NAM Air. Flights originating in Bali, Surabaya or Jakarta with the final destination of Alor stop in Kupang to change planes. There are no direct services from Labuan Bajo, Ende, Maumere or Makassar.

<text>Implementation is the realization of an application, execution of a plan, idea, model, design, specification, standard, algorithm, policy, or the administration or management of a process or objective. 

==Industry-specific definitions==

===Information technology===
In the information technology industry, implementation refers to the post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customizations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using project management methodologies. Software Implementations involve several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as business analysts, software implementation specialists, solutions architects, and project managers.

To implement a system successfully, many inter-related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an implementation project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results.

===Social and health sciences===
Implementation is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions. According to this definition, implementation processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the &quot;specific set of activities&quot; related to implementation. In addition, the activity or program being implemented is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength.

In computer science, implementation results in software, while in social and health sciences, implementation science studies how the software can be put into practice or routine use.

==Role of end users==
System implementation generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome. Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions.

The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems implementation efforts. Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities. This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap. These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies. Examples of these differences or concerns are below:

===Designer concerns===
* How much disk storage space will the master file consume?
* How many lines of program code will it take to perform this function?
* How can we cut down on CPU time when we run the system?
* What are the most efficient ways of storing this data?
* What database management system should we use?

==Critique of the Premise of Implementation==
Social scientific research on implementation also takes a step away from the project oriented at implementing a plan, and turns the project into an object of study. Lucy Suchman&#x27;s work has been key, in that respect, showing how the engineering model of plans and their implementation cannot account for the situated action and cognition involved in real-world practices of users relating to plans: that work shows that a plan cannot be specific enough for detailing everything that successful implementation requires. Instead, implementation draws upon implicit and tacit resources and characteristics of users and of the plan&#x27;s components.

<doc id="407705" wikidata="Q257073" url="?curid=407705" title="Ether Dome">
<text>The Ether Dome is a surgical operating amphitheater in the Bulfinch Building at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, United States. It served as the hospital&#x27;s operating room from its opening in 1821 until 1867. It was the site of the first public demonstration of the use of inhaled ether as a surgical anesthetic on October 16, 1846, otherwise known as Ether Day. Crawford Long, a surgeon in Georgia, had previously administered sulfuric ether in 1842, but this went unpublished until 1849. The Ether Dome event occurred when William Thomas Green Morton, a local dentist, used ether to anesthetize Edward Gilbert Abbott. John Collins Warren, the first dean of Harvard Medical School, then painlessly removed part of a tumor from Abbott&#x27;s neck. After Warren had finished, and Abbott regained consciousness, Warren asked the patient how he felt. Reportedly, Abbott said, &quot;Feels as if my neck&#x27;s been scratched&quot;. Warren then turned to his medical audience and uttered &quot;Gentlemen, this is no Humbug&quot;. This was presumably a reference to the unsuccessful demonstration of nitrous oxide anesthesia by Horace Wells in the same theater the previous year, which was ended by cries of &quot;Humbug!&quot; after the patient groaned with pain.

== History of anesthesia ==

=== Pain relief ===
The practice of pain relief has existed since the time of civilizations such as Ancient Egypt, China, and Greece, in a multitude of various forms. In Ancient Egypt, natural remedies were often used, while in China, acupuncture was developed as a way to restore an imbalance in the &quot;qi&quot;, or the life force. In Ancient Greece, medical maladies were often attributed to divine influences, and as such, treatments for these ailments would often include visits to temples dedicated to healing.

The use of vapors, which could be inhaled, became more popular in the 18th century as a potential source of pain relief, especially during surgeries, which up to then were generally gory and extremely painful. One of the earliest mentions of the use of an inhaled gas for pain relief comes from the British chemist Humphry Davys, who in his &quot;Researches&quot; in 1800 noted that, &quot;As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place.&quot;

=== History of ether&#x27;s application ===
Horace Wells was a practicing American dentist in Hartford, Connecticut who is considered a pioneer in the use of surgical anesthesia. In 1844, during a laughing-gas roadshow, Wells cited nitrous oxide—colloquially known as “laughing gas”—as having pain-killing properties. After this revelation, Wells used nitrous oxide as a means of performing painless dental work; specifically the extraction of teeth. In January 1845, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston allowed Wells to demonstrate the method of anesthesia. Unfortunately, the patient did not respond to the dose of nitrous oxide given, which resulted in Wells’ endless contempt. Wells continued with extensive self-experimentation, such as repeated inhalation, with various chemicals. There is evidence that suggests a strong correlation between his inhalation of chemicals to a drastic change in personality. In fact, he was imprisoned for throwing acid at individuals walking in New York City and later committed suicide while the Paris Medical Society named him the discoverer of anesthetic gases.

As a former partner in Wells’ practice, William T.G. Morton learned the technique and began experimenting on his own, and in October 1846 Morton successfully demonstrated ether anesthesia. However, Morton&#x27;s interest in surgical anesthesia was not solely influenced by Horace Wells, but also Charles T. Jackson and Nathan Cooley Keep.

Charles T. Jackson was a professor of chemistry at Harvard University after practicing as a medical doctor for four years before establishing his chemistry laboratory to teach analytical chemistry. It is speculated that Jackson suggested administering a higher dosage and grade of sulfuric ether to successfully anesthetize the patient.

For a short period of time, both Horace Wells and William T.G. Morton were taught and employed by dentist, anesthesiologist, and first Dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine Nathan Cooley Keep.

== Ether Day ==

=== The operation ===
With the help of MGH surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow, Morton persuaded Warren to allow him to try his technique on a surgical patient. The trial took place in the Ether Dome on October 16, 1846. The patient was a young printer named Gilbert Abbott, who had a vascular neck tumor. Previous anesthetic approaches had utilized alcohol or even a simple blow to the jaw that would render the patient unconscious. However, this was a more delicate surgery, and Abbott had to be tied to his chair so that he would not choke on his own blood.

Morton used a newly developed apparatus, later called the Morton Etherizer, to deliver the diethyl-ether vapors, holding the mouthpiece to Abbott&#x27;s lips and instructing him to breathe deeply and slowly. Abbott fell into an unconscious, sleeplike state within three to four minutes, and did not react when Morton made the first incision in his neck for the surgery. During the surgery, Warren noted that the blood of the patient was very dark, and thought that the anesthesia might be producing its effect through carbonization of the blood, a remark which was met with a burst of applause. Upon awakening after the surgery, he announced that he had felt a scratching sensation, but no pain. John Collins Warren turned to the observers and proclaimed, &quot;Gentlemen, this is no humbug.&quot; Bigelow immediately published an article describing the event and the news quickly traveled to Europe and other parts of America.

=== The patient ===
Among the revolving door of noted physicians and important figures supposedly present on the historic Ether Day, one figure remains constant: Edward Gilbert Abbott, the man upon whom the ether and surgery was administered. Abbott was born in Middlesex County, MA in September 1825. His parents, victims of tuberculosis, left him an orphan in 1832. After a career as a printer and editor, in September 1846, he went in to receive a medical evaluation for a tumor he had on the left side of his jaw, even though it had been present his whole life and did not cause him any pain.

Abbott was given enough ether to make him fall unconscious; he left the hospital with an unremarkable change in the size of the tumor. He was assured—as he probably knew, that it was a benign growth and that he had contributed greatly to the history of medicine. He died in 1855 at the age of 30, leaving behind a wife, a daughter, and a son. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; included a mere three sentence summary of his life and descendants in its December 1 issue.

=== The original Morton Etherizer ===
Commissioned by William Thomas Green Morton, the Original Morton Etherizer was used on Ether Day as a means of inhalation anesthesia. The Etherizer was made of blown glass with brass fittings at the two open ends, a middle chamber, and a mouthpiece. The middle chamber held a sponge that was soaked in ether, and the chamber would create gaseous conditions thereby making inhalants. The two brass fittings serve as ventilation so that the concentration of the gaseous ether the patient would inhale via the mouthpiece gives the appropriate dose to be safely anesthetized.

=== The improved ether inhaler ===
On April 9, 1898 Messrs, Mayer, and Meltzer unveiled the newly designed Clover&#x27;s smaller ether inhaler. The inhaler was modified from the previous inhaler used on Ether Day by adding two circular apertures on both sides of the apparatus located near two small viewing windows. The apertures and windows were used to view the interior of the chamber to facilitate the quantity of ether being administered. Further modifications included the same plated and polished surfaces on the interior as on the exterior. All fixtures on the apparatus are fitted to ensure there is no leakage of chemicals in the chamber or hot-water from the hot-water jacket. The hot-water jacket serves as an insulator to heat the water which then produces condensation. When the condensation is mixed with the ether and is inhaled, it develops the chemical properties of an anesthetic. The hot-water jacket has a detachable screw-stopper that allows the metal cap, chamber, and bag used to anaesthetize the patient to be cleaned of verdigris. All the above-mentioned features were combined with knowledge gained after practice using this inhaler—such as that the slot located near the bag needs to be opened for ventilation after the induction of the patient—combined to develop the new improved ether inhaler.

== Legacy ==

=== The ether controversy ===

Wells, Jackson, Morton and a Georgia doctor, Crawford W. Long, each claimed credit for the innovation of using ether as an anesthetic.

In either December 1841 or January 1842, Long had introduced the use of sulphuric ether as a substitution to nitrous oxide for the use of entertainment at parties. Long was possibly the first to use ether as a way to alleviate pain during surgery. Long had been using ether in surgery since 1842. On March 30, 1842, he removed a tumor from the neck of a young man named James Venable. Over the following years, Long would use ether in his obstetrical practice, however, he never published any of his findings until seeing the December 1846 issue of a &quot;Medical Examiner&quot; about Morton, who claimed to have used ether as an anesthetic. Long then began to record his findings and write his account of the discovery. He also collected notarized letters from former patients, but after presenting his findings to the Medical College of Georgia, he discovered two others also claimed to be discoverers: Horace Wells and Charles Jackson. When Long entered his claims, this controversy was already in process.

Prior to Morton&#x27;s public demonstration of ether, he had supposedly met with Jackson (who was known as attempting to steal others inventions) to discuss questions surrounding anesthesia. It is at this meeting where, supposedly, Jackson had suggested to use ether as a means of alleviating surgical pain. Morton had previously experimented with ether, but never on a patient. Jackson and Morton tangled in a bitter legal dispute and pamphleteering war, that lasted 20 years. In 1868 Morton read a newspaper item asserting that Jackson deserved the lion&#x27;s share of credit. Morton became feverish, threw himself into a pond in New York&#x27;s Central Park and died, probably from a stroke, soon thereafter. Jackson died insane at McLean Asylum in Belmont, Massachusetts.

In 1845 Wells had attempted to demonstrate the use of nitrous oxide as anesthesia at MGH but it was “dismissed as humbug” because the patient cried out during the procedure although later, the patient denied feeling any pain. His career then began to spiral down. Wells left the practice of dentistry and his family, and went to New York, where he was arrested for throwing acid on prostitutes. He killed himself in jail by slashing an artery after taking chloroform.

While Morton, Long and Jackson sought fame, Long wanted to be recognized, and to alleviate the pain of his patients. Though Long was the first to surgically use ether, he was not the first to introduce it to the world.

==== &quot;The First Operation with Ether&quot; ====
The Great Moment is a 1944 biographical film written and directed by Preston Sturges. It tells the story of Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, leading up to the dramatic demonstration in the Ether Dome.

==== &quot;Triumph Over Pain&quot; ====
&quot;Triumph Over Pain&quot; is a 1940 book by René Fülöp-Miller.

==== Robert Hinckley&#x27;s &quot;The First Operation with Ether&quot; ====
Painter Robert Cutler Hinckley meticulously researched the event, particularly who was present and participating, for his &quot;The First Operation with Ether&quot; (18821893). He interviewed various Boston physicians and reviewed records and newspaper reports.

Hinckley uses light and line to draw attention to the surgery; the side wall of the gallery draws a clear diagonal line which ends at the surgeon Warren&#x27;s head. Morton&#x27;s ether inhaler reflects light so as to make the sponge contained inside visible. Abbott&#x27;s shirt as well as the cloth and the bowl on the table are starkly white, directing the eye to the operation. However, the viewer is shielded from the point of incision and from any blood, lessening the impact of the image.

A controversy surrounding the painting revolves around those who are painted into it. Hinckley includes Charles Hosea Hildreth, surgeon Abel Lawrence Peirson, surgeon Jonathan Mason Warren, and physician William Williamson Wellington—all individuals who are highly unlikely to have been present during the operation. Furthermore, he did not include two surgeons who were very likely thereSamuel Parkman and George Hayward. Though it is unknown why Hinckley omitted two individuals, he likely added the others because of their role in the medical history of Boston.The painting is now in the Lamar Soutter library at UMass Chan Medical School.

== Features ==
=== Architecture ===
The Ether Dome is one of the oldest operating theatres in the United States. Over the years, there has been a concerted effort to restore the original architecture of the Ether Dome while also incorporating modern technology for educational uses today. Architects and designers tried to maintain the authenticity of the space by relying on historical documents and photos. Additionally, specialists analyzed paint chips from the early 19th century in order to help with renovations and to ensure the damages were repaired.

The dome&#x27;s architecture resembles that of a courtroom or a theatre where surgeries were performed at the center of the dome. An audience can witness the surgeries from amphitheater-style seating.

Also, the location of the dome and the large glass ceiling and windows that compose the dome let in light for operations to be performed. Modern day surgery theaters follow the same concept of the Ether Dome&#x27;s stylistic arrangement, however do not feature a dome due to modern lighting technology. However, for hygiene purposes the spectators&#x27; section is separated from the main gallery by glass. The Ether Dome and its original theatre style architecture has turned into a nationally recognized historical site for interested spectators, especially students of medicine.

=== The first operating room of MGH ===
The Ether Dome served as an operating theater from 1821 to 1867, when a new surgical building was constructed. Operating rooms built before electricity were typically located on the top floor of a building to take advantage of available light. Before surgical anesthesia the location was also helpful to muffle the screams of patients for those on the floors below. Because pain often induced shock, surgeons of the day prided themselves on the speed in which they could amputate an arm or a leg. Ninety seconds was considered a good time. Two 19th-century operating chairs famously known as Bigelow Operating chair was built in 1854, are located in the display area behind the seating tiers. Their red velvet upholstery was apparently intended to make bloodstains less visible. It was created in light of this discovery; it was the first of its kind without restraints and had ivory and wooden handles that could be used to position the unconscious, anesthetized patient. The chair quickly fell out of use over the next few decades, however, as it was made from leather rather than metal, which can be sterilized more easily.

The Ether Dome has not always served the purpose of an operating room. From 1821 to 1868, operations were performed, it was then a storage area from 1868 to 1873, a dormitory from 1873 to 1889, a dining room for the nurses employed at MGH from 1889 to 1892, and now it is a teaching space. The hospital commemorated the historical significance of the space in 1896 on the 50th anniversary of the first public demonstration of surgical anesthesia. The Ether Dome was designated a National Historic Site in 1965.

While the words &quot;Operating Room&quot; still appear inside the door to the closet on the right of the painting, today the room serves as a place for meetings and lectures. The steel tiers with individual chairs date from about 1930, when fire regulations required the replacement of the old wooden bench seating. The names of the chairs have no known significance—it is likely that hospital donors were given the opportunity to name a chair after a favorite figure from MGH history.

==== Warren and Lucia Prosperi&#x27;s &quot;Ether Day, 1846&quot; ====

As the 150th anniversary of the first public demonstration of the use of ether anesthesia on October 16, 1846, approached and preparations for the celebration at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) began, it was recognized that a proper commemorative painting was needed. The famous Hinckley image, reproduced many times, was painted 27 years after the event. It is the product of the artist&#x27;s imagination and portrays, among the actual participants, others who were not really in attendance but are nonetheless &quot;painted into history.&quot; Subsequent research has provided a more accurate list of the witnesses.

Accordingly, in 2000 the clinical staff of the MGH voted to commission Warren and Lucia Prosperi, well known for their historically accurate paintings, to &quot;do it right.&quot; Artists Warren and Lucia Prosperi created this mural between 2000 and 2001, painting on site in the Ether Dome. To represent the historic operation as realistically as possible, a group of doctors and their spouses, working with the Prosperis, searched out photographs, daguerreotypes, and portraits of the participants. They also consulted vintage photographs and artifacts from the MGH Archives and Special Collections. The theatre department of Emerson College was engaged to provide period costumes and makeup. Much of the original paraphernalia—the ether flask, the operating chair, and various furnishings of the amphitheater—was still in the hospital museum and available for the scene.

On one Sunday in January, 2001, a group convened to re-enact the historic event on site at the original location, MGH&#x27;s Ether Dome, with the Boston press corps in attendance. Two hours were spent debating the likely orientation of the operating chair and instrument table and who would have been standing where so that everyone, including the students in the gallery, could see the action. Many configurations were tested, and The Prosperis photographed hundred of photographs a cast of 20 men, mostly MGH physicians, who gathered in the Ether Dome in January 2000 dressed in period costumes. Finally the scene was set and recorded.

Over the course of 2001, Warren Prosperi created the painting with its life-size figures on site in the Ether Dome, allowing visitors to witness the emergence of the historic re-enactment. This painting now hangs on the front wall of the amphitheater.

One additional footnote: a special unveiling of &quot;Ether Day, 1846&quot; was planned for the meeting of the Halsted Society at the Massachusetts General Hospital on September 12, 2001. Because of the infamous events of the previous day, that meeting was canceled (but held two years later).

As the mural depicts, in the years before antiseptic and aseptic surgery, a surgeon typically operated in a frock coat as was appropriate for the dignity of his profession. The ivory or ebony handles of his surgical instruments signaled his status but made the instruments difficult to clean. Sterile surgery was not achieved at the MGH until the 1880s.

==== Mummy (the hospital&#x27;s oldest patient) ====
On May 4, 1823, Massachusetts General Hospital received an Egyptian mummy from the city of Boston, complete with painted wooden inner and outer coffins. The ensemble had been given to the city by Jacob Van Lennep, a Dutch merchant living in Symrna, Ottoman Empire (modern day İzmir, Turkey) in the early 19th century. It is thought that Mr. Van Lennep, who was also the Counsel General of the Netherlands, bought the mummy as a gift to Boston as a way to impress his native New England in-laws.

The mummy arrived in Boston on April 26, 1823, on the British ship the Sally Ann and was the first complete Egyptian burial ensemble in America. He was placed under the care of the ship&#x27;s captain, Robert B. Edes, along with Bryant P. Tilden, Esq., who ultimately made the decision to give the mummy to Massachusetts General Hospital, whose trustees accepted the gift as &quot;an appropriate ornament of the operating room,&quot; while also hoping to exhibit the mummy to raise funds for the hospital. The fledgling hospital, which had opened its doors just two years earlier, was still in need of operating funds that would help it better serve the sick and indigent individuals for whom it had been chartered to provide care. The mummy would help raise those needed funds.

Shortly after his arrival, the mummy was put on display at &quot;Mr. Doggett&#x27;s Repository of Arts&quot; in Boston, where hundreds of people paid $0.25 to see the first complete human Egyptian mummy in the U.S. That fall, the mummy went on a year-long (1823 to 1824) multi-city tour of the East Coast, raising even more money for the hospital. Upon his return, he was placed in the Ether Dome where he subsequently witnessed more than 6,000 surgeries, including the famous first successful demonstration of surgery under anesthesia on October 16, 1846.

In 1823, John Collins Warren partially unwrapped and examined the mummy. He then published the first American treatise about mummies and mummification. The mummy spent much of the late 19th century at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The mummy&#x27;s outer coffin has been at the George Walter Vincent Museum in Springfield, MA since 1932.

More than a century later the hospital learned just who the mummy was. In 1960, Dows Dunham, curator emeritus of the Department of Egyptian Art at Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts, examined and translated the hieroglyphics on the mummy&#x27;s coffin. Hailing from the 26th Dynasty (663–525 BC) or later, the mummy now had a name—Padihershef, meaning &quot;He whom the god Hershef has given.&quot; and a birthplace—Thebes; and an occupation—stonecutter. Newer medical information tells us that Padihershef, or &quot;Padi&quot;, was probably between 20 and 30 years of age and was not a stonecutter at all. Rather, he was &quot;tomb finder,&quot; or prospector, someone who looked for spaces in the Theban necropolis that could serve as burial spaces.

Padihershef&#x27;s remains have been studied by means of x-rays and CT scans. In 2013, a donor provided funds for the mummy&#x27;s restoration. During the procedure, Padihershef was given a full-body CT scan overseen by Massachusetts General Hospital&#x27;s radiologist Rajiv Gupta. This scan, which provided more than 20,000 scans that were then assembled into 3D renderings of his body. Many of these are replicated in the report prepared by forensic pathologist Jonathan Elias, PhD, of AMSC Research, a mummy research consortium.

One of the outcomes of the project includes a CT facial reconstruction of Padihershef. Using the scans, 3D facial recognition software and a thorough knowledge of mummy forensics, Elias&#x27; group undertook a thorough analysis based on all these factors and using a 3D skull model, developed a representation of what Padi may have looked like in life.

The mummy Padishershef has borne witness to many medical milestones during his 190 years in the Massachusetts General Hospital&#x27;s Ether Dome. Over the decades, visitors to the room have been greeted silently by this unusual host, standing nestled in his beautifully decorated coffin, and often wondered just who he was and how he came to reside at the hospital.

Until this most recent examination, little was known about his life before his death. John Collins Warren, MD, co-founder of MGH and its first surgeon, had performed a post-mortem on &quot;Padi&quot; when he first came to the MGH, which included uncovering the mummy&#x27;s head, as it remains today. In 1931, and again in 1977, X-rays were taken of Padi in his case, which provided a little more insight into his health. Growth lines show that Padi was so ill as a child that his growth stopped for some time before he was well again. Bone damage reveals that he suffered from arthritis. The extensive report included here provides many details of Padi&#x27;s life that were unknown to us until his March 2013 scanning examination.

Padi has been restored twice before: once in the 1980s and again in 2002. Salt deposits that build up from the embalming elixir have formed on the exposed portions of Padi&#x27;s face and head need to be removed periodically. The restoration also included replacing the old grass and wood case with the current climate-controlled enclosure.

==== The Apollo Belvedere Statue ====
The plaster statue of Apollo in the Ether Dome was given to the M by statesman and orator, Honorable Edward Everett in March 1845. In exchange, the hospital trustees presented to him &quot;their grateful acknowledgments for his beautiful gift, valuable as a memorial, that, amidst his arduous public duties in a foreign country, Mr. Everett feels an undiminished interest in the charitable institutions of his native land.&quot; Everett wanted to exude his appreciation of MGH being a charitable institution—a voluntary hospital with a mission of treating the often poor patients who were in dire need of assistance. In return for the gifted statue of Apollo, the trustees of MGH kept this statue in the Ether Dome as a memorial to his philanthropic acts.

The displayed work is a copy of the original Apollo Belvedere, a sculpture unearthed in Rome during the Renaissance. Napoleon looted Rome in the early 19th century and took the Apollo Belvedere from the Vatican to the Louvre in Paris. where the statue that is on display was crafted. The Louvre made and sold plaster casts of the statue, one of which Everett bought and shipped back to Boston. The English sea captain and novelist Frederick Marryat decried, while on a visit to Everett&#x27;s home, where the statue was draped to cover its near-nakedness, a few years before the donation, the covering as an example of the prudishness of otherwise educated and open-minded Americans.

The Apollo remains a part of the architecture of the Ether Dome as a testament to medicine due to its symbolism. Upon further observing the cast statue, one may notice the snake directly next to Apollo. Snakes are a symbol of renewal and are even displayed in the caduceus—a prominent emblem of healing. Furthermore, the statue is an indicator to visitors that this room represents innovation and the advancement of medicine.

The Hippocrates of Ancient Greek scholars worshipped Apollo, and this inevitably led to teachings that would act as a precedent to modern-day medical personnel. Apollo—the god of medicine and healing—was sacred in the original Hippocratic Oath: “I swear by Apollo the Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.”

==== Skeleton ====
The teaching skeleton hanging in the Ether Dome can be seen in the background of daguerreotypes showing the administration of ether anesthesia in 1847. Such skeletons were a common feature in hospitals and medical schools in the 19th century. While the identity of this skeleton is not known, it is possible that it was obtained through the practice of body snatching, a practice prevalent in the 19th century due to a shortage of available bodies for instruction in medical schools. As medical dissection was illegal in many parts of the United States, students often had to rely on the illicit activities of body snatchers, or resort to grave robbing themselves. In 1831, Massachusetts passed the Anatomy Act, allowing the state&#x27;s medical schools to obtain the bodies of the poor, the insane, and those who died in prison. The aim of this act was to decrease the illicit activities of the body snatchers, though it further contributed to the sense of separation between the well-to-do, who could be buried in respectable cemeteries, and the poor, who were at risk of having their bodies used against their wills after death.

=== Ether Dome sublevel exhibit ===
Located through small doors on either side of the Ether Dome theater or through a closed door at the bottom of a steep, downwards stairway behind the top row of the theater, there is an exhibit of various Ether Day artifacts and information, including quotes from the Ether Day event. In the round room under the seats of the Ether Dome theater, the exhibit is designated as the “G. H. Gay Ward, Memorial of George Henry Gay” by a shiny, gold plaque. On the walls there are drawings and paintings of notable figures, such as Dr. William T. G. Morton, and pictures of quotes, like “We have conquered pain.” Alongside the exhibited pictures and quotes, there are artifacts like an operating chair and the wedding clothes of William T. G. Morton, which represent an evidence of wealth and a veneration of ether. The hidden crescent-shaped corridor is a significant part of the Ether Dome exhibit that rarely gets the same attention. With a normal diabetes office inside of the small doors, it is easy to see how the Ether Dome&#x27;s second half can be mistaken for a locked room or closet behind the Ether Dome.

<doc id="407707" wikidata="Q1054789" url="?curid=407707" title="Agent X (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Agent X (Nijo Minamiyori, alias Alex Hayden) is a fictional mercenary appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Gail Simone and Alvin Lee, the character first appeared in &quot;Agent X&quot; #1 (Sept 2002), by Gail Simone and UDON.

==Publication history==
&quot;Agent X&quot; was born out of experiments with Marvel Comics&#x27; long-running &quot;Deadpool&quot; series, including the &quot;miniseries within a series,&quot; (&quot;Deadpool: Agent of Weapon X&quot; and &quot;Deadpool: Funeral for a Freak)&quot;, in which the main series&#x27; numbering was demoted to secondary status below the &quot;miniseries&quot; numbering. Marvel decided to run a &quot;final arc&quot; to close the series, then restart it from #1 with an X in the title to more closely identify it with their popular X-Men franchise. (As part of the same effort, &quot;Cable&quot; was changed to &quot;Soldier X&quot; and &quot;X-Force&quot; to &quot;X-Statix.&quot;) Rumors circulated among fans that the relaunches were due in part to a royalty dispute with Rob Liefeld, which Liefeld denied. Online humorist Gail Simone was chosen to write &quot;Deadpool&quot;&#x27;s final arc and the new series, with art by the UDON studio, which had recently revamped the Taskmaster in a well-received miniseries.

Agent X replaced Deadpool with a similar protagonist, while including ambiguous hints as to the nature of his relationship with the original character. Simone publicly clashed with Marvel&#x27;s editorial staff as the relaunched title struggled to find a foothold, then left the book after issue 7. The series continued the cynical, slapstick action that had characterized its parent series. A central feature of &quot;Agent X&quot; was the question of the title character&#x27;s identity, sometimes implied to be Deadpool himself. Deadpool refers to Agent X as his &quot;Earth-2 Counterpart,&quot; a comedic reference to DC Comics&#x27; designation of different Earths for different iterations of identical and similar characters.

Towards the end, two of these fill-ins were published to small fanfare: those by noted author Evan Dorkin and the acclaimed art team of Juan Bobillo and Marcelo Sosa. Soon after, Agent X was canceled with issue #12. However, shortly after this announcement, Marvel decided to launch a &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; book as a change in direction, which ended up being a much more successful consolidation of the two characters into one title. This allowed Simone and UDON to complete their initial vision as part of a three-issue arc tying up the loose ends and restoring Deadpool for use in the new book, which was published after a month&#x27;s hiatus as &quot;Agent X&quot; #13-15.

Agent X also appeared in &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; #11-12. He would make another appearance in #38-39, where he was captured on a mission against HYDRA, who gave him arthritis using new technology, then morbid obesity so he wouldn&#x27;t notice the arthritis. He was rescued by Deadpool, who was hired by Sandi and Outlaw. After being rescued, Agent X decided to allow Deadpool to run Agency X until he was cured of his disabilities.

In the &quot;Dear Deadpool&quot; section of #37, the writers jokingly hinted that Agent X may receive a new series sometime.

==Fictional character biography==
Nijo was an assassin, mercenary, and agent employed by the telepathic German assassin called the Black Swan. He blamed Deadpool for his brother&#x27;s death as he was among the targets of Deadpool&#x27;s apparently successful assassination of the Japanese crime lords named the Four Winds. After Black Swan downloaded a mental virus into Deadpool&#x27;s brain, the mercenary came for both Swan and Nijo at the Swan&#x27;s castle in Germany. However, Black Swan revealed he had in fact killed the Four Winds, including Nijo&#x27;s brother, and stabbed him out of boredom with his ranting and disobedience. His vendetta with Deadpool was that the hits had erroneously been credited to the wrong man. A bomb Deadpool had brought went off, and all three were presumed killed.

However, Alex Hayden soon emerged in New York with one goal in mind—to be the best mercenary alive. He was found by Sandi Brandenberg, Deadpool&#x27;s former secretary, who assumed he was Deadpool by his powers and demeanor. He subconsciously took the name as a combination of composers he liked: Alexander Grieg and Josef Haydn, which Sandi worked out through his fondness for classical music. Sandi&#x27;s friend and distant romantic interest Taskmaster was sought to help him get his bearings and train him, as was Outlaw, for her shooting skills. Taskmaster noticed Alex was ambidextrous and that he was somehow interfering with his reflex ability while training with him. Taskmaster then knew he couldn&#x27;t be Deadpool, despite his healing factor and recognition of him and Sandi, and Outlaw corroborated this as Alex proved to be a better gun talent than Deadpool. Sandi and Alex formed a mercenary group, Agency X. The headquarters is located in an amusement park Alex acquired as payment for his first mission.

Alex ran into Outlaw while assigned to try to take out the Punisher and steal his Colt .45 handguns. They failed and were locked up in a phone booth minus their weapons and clothes by Castle. The Punisher then killed the people who had sent them. Afterwards, Outlaw and Alex became romantically involved. However, Taskmaster, who was jealous of Sandi&#x27;s attachment to Alex, had set up Alex on that mission and he was kicked out of the agency. He then contacted Higashi, the new leader of part of the Four Winds organization and informed them that Alex was Deadpool, who still held the credit for killing the previous four crime heads. The organization, primarily directed by Higashi&#x27;s enforcer, Saguri, therefore held Alex, Sandi and Taskmaster responsible but with Outlaw&#x27;s help, the three made a last stand at the amusement park against an army of mercenaries and supervillains, while Sandi was given to Higashi for safekeeping, as his infatuation with her would keep her protected. Agency X were triumphant and Alex blackmailed the crime lords into submission, while killing Saguri after surreptitiously being hired by Higashi to do so. Higashi was also convinced by Sandi that Alex was not Wade Wilson and was now more fully in control of his group, so he agreed to prevent any further reprisals on the foursome. Alex was enthused at what appeared to be a fresh start for the Agency but was hurt when Outlaw announced her desire to return home to the South to care for her dying father instead, while Taskmaster declined a full-time position.

Alex performed his assignments solo from then on, but he found his personal life further muddied when he and Sandi spent a night together. He became disillusioned with his work and decided to shut down the agency, but found himself unable to tell Sandi, who by then had set up a job for him and Taskmaster to act as bodyguards to Higashi as a final act of ceasefire. While on their way to a meeting between the Four Winds families, Alex&#x27;s group was attacked by a pair of over-cheerful assassins, but after a frantic battle, they arrived safely to find one of the Four Winds families had ordered the hit on Higashi. Now that Higashi was indebted to them, Alex, Taskmaster and Sandi returned to Sandi&#x27;s apartment to find Black Swan and a tabula rasa Deadpool waiting. It turned out that all three had partially merged during the explosion when Black Swan used his powers in an act of desperation to save himself. Black Swan psionically acquired Deadpool&#x27;s healing factor but accidentally made contact with Nijo and personal traits had been mixed around. Swan had also given Nijo&#x27;s corpse Deadpool&#x27;s regenerative powers (restoring him to a form of life 5 minutes after his death), as well as part of his personality, while Nijo also gained Swan&#x27;s firearms talents, ambition, some of his refined tastes, preferences and biases, and also the bodily scarring and outrage he&#x27;d received from Deadpool throwing him face first into a white hot fireplace griddle at his home.

Black Swan proposed a three-way mind meld to restore each man to their correct personal states, but doublecrossed them. Outlaw returned in time to help fight the Black Swan, who had now absorbed both Alex and Deadpool&#x27;s powers to augment himself. Even though Alex called Higashi&#x27;s favor in and surrounded Swan with hitmen, this proved to be fruitless, so Alex devised a new plan. After Taskmaster and Outlaw distracted him, Deadpool pinned Swan to Taskmaster&#x27;s explosives-laden van and Alex ignited it. Alex then reversed Black Swan&#x27;s absorption, but also gave him the memories of being caught in the bomb explosion in Germany. The group then repeatedly shot the Black Swan to make sure he was dead. The body was taxidermied and carried around by each couple (Taskmaster and Sandi, Alex and Inez) as a prop while they went on vacation.

When they later found themselves on opposing sides over the fate of Cable, Alex had another confrontation with Deadpool, which he lost initially, giving Deadpool the opportunity to spell out &quot;Hi, Weasel&quot; with his entrails as a &quot;surprise&quot; for his best friend. Unable to do much damage to each other due to their healing factors, they relented after Wade agreed to hand Alex his pancreas back.

After a botched attempt to steal a device from Hydra, Sandi and Outlaw convinced Deadpool to rescue Alex. Alex had been affected by the device he was supposed to steal, giving him arthritis and &quot;the American gene&quot; (which resulted in making him incredibly fat). This made escape physically impossible - though he would not want to miss out on the many treats and monkey chow that were being given to him as a lab specimen. Deadpool managed to free Alex with the help of Bob, Agent of HYDRA. He then asked Deadpool to run Agency X whilst he got himself back in shape, reasoning with himself that his only other alternatives were to shoot himself or eat Sandi and his business.

In &quot;Deadpool: Suicide Kings&quot; #2, Outlaw tells Deadpool that Alex has lost 14 lbs thanks to Jenny Craig, though Deadpool implies that he is still overweight. By the events of &quot;Domino #1&quot; Alex has regained his former physique, attributing his weight loss to diet shakes.

==Powers and abilities==
Agent X possesses a superhuman healing factor, allowing him to regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. Agent X is able to heal injuries such as slashes, puncture wounds, bullet wounds, and severe burns within moments. His healing factor is developed to the point that he can regrow and reattach missing limbs and organs. His healing factor has allowed him to survive even brain punctures on numerous occasions. With this superior healing factor, he has shown a unique tolerance towards pain. His body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins. For example, it is extremely difficult, though not impossible, for him to become intoxicated. He can, however, be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers, if he is exposed to a massive enough dosage. Agent X&#x27;s healing factor also extends to his immune system, rendering him immune to the effects of all known diseases and infections. Agent X&#x27;s healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process to an unknown degree. The healing factor causes his brain cells to be in a constant state of flux and regeneration, rendering him immune to psychics such as Professor X and Emma Frost.

Because of his healing factor, Agent X can push his muscles to levels beyond the natural limits of an ordinary human being without sustaining injury, giving him superhuman strength. He is capable of lifting in more than 800 lbs and is shown to lift up to 3 tons. The exact limit of his strength is unknown. His musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human being, granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for at least 18 hours before fatigue begins to impair him. His agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete, on par with Deadpool. His reflexes are similarly enhanced, superior to those of even the finest human athlete.

Additionally, Agent X was trained by Taskmaster in weapons and combat and is also an expert marksman. The most common weapons Agent X uses are pistols, knives, and throwing stars.

<text>Nicholson Baker (born January 7, 1957) is an American novelist and essayist. His fiction generally de-emphasizes narrative in favor of careful description and characterization. His early novels such as &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; and &quot;Room Temperature&quot; were distinguished by their minute inspection of his characters&#x27; and narrators&#x27; stream of consciousness. Out of a total of ten novels, three are erotica: &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;The Fermata&quot; and &quot;House of Holes&quot;. 

Baker also writes non-fiction books. &quot;U and I: A True Story&quot;, about his relationship with John Updike, was published in 1991. He then wrote about the American library system in his 2001 book &quot;Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper&quot;, for which he received a National Book Critics Circle Award and the Calw Hermann Hesse Prize for the German translation. A pacifist, he wrote &quot;Human Smoke&quot; (2008) about the buildup to World War II. 

Baker has published articles in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, among other periodicals. Baker created the American Newspaper Repository in 1999. He has also written about and edited Wikipedia.

== Life ==
Nicholson Baker was born in 1957 in New York City.

He studied briefly at the Eastman School of Music and received a B.A. in English from Haverford College.

Baker describes himself as an atheist, although he occasionally visits Quaker meetings. Baker says he has &quot;always had pacifist leanings.&quot;

Baker met his wife, Margaret Brentano, in college; they live in Maine and have two grown children.

== Career ==
Baker established a name for himself with the novels &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; (1988) and &quot;Room Temperature&quot; (1990). Both novels have for the most part a very limited time span. &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; occurs over the course of an escalator journey and &quot;Room Temperature&quot; happens while a father feeds his baby daughter.

&quot;U and I: A True Story&quot; (1991) is a non-fiction study of how a reader engages with an author&#x27;s work. It is partly about Baker&#x27;s appreciation for the work of John Updike and partly a self-exploration. Rather than giving a traditional literary analysis, Baker begins the book by stating that he will read no more Updike than he already has up to that point. All of the Updike quotations used are presented as coming from memory alone, and many are inaccurate, with correct versions and Baker&#x27;s (later) commentary on the inaccuracies.

Critics group together &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;The Fermata&quot; and &quot;House of Holes&quot; since they are all erotic novels. &quot;Vox&quot; (1992) consists of an episode of phone sex between two young single people on a pay-per-minute chat line. The book was Baker&#x27;s first &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and Monica Lewinsky gave a copy to President Bill Clinton when they were having an affair. In &quot;Vox&quot;, Baker coined the word . &quot;The Fermata&quot; (1994) also addresses erotic life and fantasy. The protagonist Arno Strine likes to stop time and take off women&#x27;s clothes. The work proved controversial with critics. It was also a bestseller. &quot;House of Holes&quot; (2011) is about a fantastical place where all sexual perversions and fetishes are permitted. It is a collection of stories, more or less connected to each other. The novellas are erotic in the sense of Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. The titular House of Holes is a fantasy sex resort in which people can engage in absurd sexual practices, such as groin transference and sex with trees. Akin to &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, people enter the House of Holes through such techniques as tumbling through a clothes dryer or through a drinking straw.

Baker is a fervent critic of what he perceives as libraries&#x27; unnecessary destruction of paper-based media. He wrote several vehement articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; critical of the San Francisco Public Library for sending thousands of books to a landfill, eliminating card catalogs, and destroying old books and newspapers in favor of microfilm. In 1997, Baker received the San Francisco–based James Madison Freedom of Information Award in recognition of these efforts. In 1999, Baker established a non-profit corporation, the American Newspaper Repository, to rescue old newspapers from destruction by libraries. In 2001, he published &quot;Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper&quot; about preservation, newspapers, and the American library system. An excerpt first appeared in the July 24, 2000, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, under the title &quot;Deadline: The Author&#x27;s Desperate Bid to Save America&#x27;s Past.&quot; The exhaustively researched work (there are 63 pages of endnotes and 18 pages of references in the paperback edition) details Baker&#x27;s quest to uncover the fate of thousands of books and newspapers that were replaced and often destroyed during the microfilming boom of the 1980s and 1990s.

The 2004 novel &quot;Checkpoint&quot; is composed of dialogue between two old high school friends, Jay and Ben, who discuss Jay&#x27;s plans to assassinate President George W. Bush.

&quot;Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization&quot; (2008) is a history of World War II that questions the commonly held belief that the Allies wanted to avoid the war at all costs but were forced into action by Hitler&#x27;s unforgiving actions. It consists largely of official government transcripts and other documents from the time. He suggests that the pacifists were correct in their views.

In March 2008, Baker reviewed John Broughton&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. In the review, Baker described Wikipedia&#x27;s beginnings, its culture, and his own editing activities under the username &quot;Wageless&quot;. His article &quot;How I fell in love with Wikipedia&quot; was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in the UK on April 10, 2008.

&quot;The Anthologist&quot; (2009) is narrated by Paul Chowder, a poet, who is attempting to write an introduction to a poetry anthology. Distracted by problems in his life, he is unable to begin writing, and instead ruminates on poets and poetry throughout history. Also in 2009, Baker reviewed Ken Auletta&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in the New York Times. Auletta responded by sending a letter to the editor bemoaning what he perceived as the inaccuracy of Baker&#x27;s review. Here is Baker&#x27;s rebuttal:
Ken Auletta wrote a thought-provoking book, and I recorded several thoughts provoked. It’s a book review, not a bouillon cube. I don’t “imply” or “suggest” that the author agrees with the people he quotes. There is indeed an absence of warmth in this chronicle of Google as “dreaded disruptor,” but it’s an impartial chilliness, extending in all directions.

In 2014, Baker spent 28 days as a substitute teacher in some Maine public schools as research for his 2016 book &quot;Substitute: Going to School With a Thousand Kids&quot;. Baker tried to find out &quot;what life in the classroom is really like.&quot; He also wrote about the experience for &quot;The New York Times Magazine.&quot;

Baker wrote a cover story for &quot;New York Magazine&quot; in January 2021 investigating the COVID-19 lab leak theory and expressing his belief in the theory’s plausibility.

<doc id="407711" wikidata="Q3051180" url="?curid=407711" title="Eliza R. Snow">
<text>Eliza Roxey Snow (January 21, 1804 – December 5, 1887) was one of the most celebrated Latter-day Saint women of the nineteenth century. Greatly respected within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, she was a poet, chronicled history, celebrated nature and relationships, and expounded scripture and doctrine. Snow was married, first to Joseph Smith as a plural wife, then to Brigham Young after Smith&#x27;s death. Snow was the second Relief Society general president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which she reestablished in the Utah Territory in 1866. She was also the older sister of Lorenzo Snow, the LDS Church&#x27;s fifth president.

==Early years and education==
Eliza Roxey Snow was born in Becket, Massachusetts, the second of seven children (four daughters and three sons) to Oliver Snow III (1775-1845) and Rosetta Leonara Pettibone Snow (1778-1846). Her parents were of English descent and their ancestors were among the earliest settlers of New England. Although her middle name is a namesake from her paternal aunt Roxey Snow (1776-1817), her middle name is also frequently spelled as Roxcy. When she was two years old, her family left New England to settle on a new and fertile farm in the Western Reserve valley, in Mantua Township, Portage County, Ohio. The Snow family valued learning and saw that each child had educational opportunities.

Although a farmer by occupation, Oliver Snow performed much public business, officiating in several responsible positions. His daughter, Eliza, being ten years the senior of her eldest brother, was employed as secretary, as soon as she was competent, in her father&#x27;s office as justice of the peace. She was skilled in various kinds of needlework and home manufactures. Two years in succession she drew the prize awarded by the committee on manufactures, at the county fair, for the best manufactured leghorn bonnet.

==Early church involvement==

Snow&#x27;s Baptist parents welcomed a variety of religious believers into their home. In 1828, Snow and her parents joined Alexander Campbell&#x27;s Christian restorationist movement, the Disciples of Christ. In 1831, when Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, took up residence in Hiram, Ohio, four miles from the family&#x27;s farm, the Snow family took a strong interest in the new religious movement. Snow&#x27;s mother and sister joined the Church of the Latter Day Saints early on. Several years later, in 1835, Snow was baptized and moved to Kirtland, Ohio, the church&#x27;s headquarters. After arriving, Snow donated her inheritance, a large sum of money, toward building the church&#x27;s Kirtland Temple. In appreciation, the building committee provided her with the title to &quot;a very valuable [lot]-situated near the Temple, with a fruit tree-an excellent spring of water, and house that accommodated two families.&quot; Here, Snow taught school for Smith&#x27;s family and was influential in interesting her younger brother, Lorenzo, in Mormonism. He later became an apostle and the LDS Church&#x27;s fifth president.

Snow moved west with her family and the body of the church, first to Adam-ondi-Ahman, a short-lived settlement in Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois. In the 1930s, Alice Merrill Horne wrote in her autobiography that when she was a girl she overheard a conversation that in Missouri during the 1838 Mormon War, Eliza Snow was brutally gang-raped by eight Missourians, which left her unable to have children. Later, according to Horne, Joseph Smith offered her marriage as a plural wife &quot;as a way of promising her that she would still have eternal offspring and that she would be a mother in Zion.&quot;

In Nauvoo, Snow again made her living as a schoolteacher. After Smith&#x27;s death, Snow swore in an affidavit recorded by a notary public that she had secretly wed him on June 29, 1842, as a plural wife. However, Snow had organized a petition in that same summer of 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy and extolling his virtue. As secretary of the Ladies&#x27; Relief Society, she organized the publishing of a certificate in October 1842 denouncing polygamy and denying Smith as its creator or participant. Decades later Snow publicly described Smith as, &quot;my beloved husband, the choice of my heart and the crown of my life.&quot; Years later, when Snow was informed that Smith&#x27;s first wife, Emma, had stated on her deathbed that her husband had never been a polygamist, Snow was reported to have stated she doubted the story but &quot;If ... [this] was really [Sister Emma&#x27;s] testimony she died with a libel on her lips -- a libel against her husband -- against his wives -- against the truth, and against God...&quot;.

After Smith&#x27;s death, Snow married Brigham Young as a plural wife. She traveled west across the plains and arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on October 2, 1847. There, childless Eliza became a prominent member of Young&#x27;s family, moving into an upper bedroom of Young&#x27;s Salt Lake City residence, the Lion House.

== Relief Society service ==

The LDS Church&#x27;s first Relief Society was organized by Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois on March 17, 1842, as a philanthropic and women&#x27;s educational organization. Snow served as the organization&#x27;s first secretary, with Smith&#x27;s wife, Emma, as president. The organization was originally known as &quot;The Female Relief Society of Nauvoo.&quot; It later became known simply as &quot;The Relief Society.&quot; For the next three years, Snow kept copious notes of the organization&#x27;s meetings, including Joseph Smith&#x27;s teachings on how the organization should operate. Members of the original Relief Society stopped meeting shortly after Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, and the organization soon became defunct.

Brigham Young led a migration of LDS Church members to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, and for the next twenty years attempts were periodically made to reestablish the organization. In 1855, Young commissioned Snow with reestablishing the Relief Society. Until 1868, however, activity was limited, and no sustained, church-wide Relief Society existed. For the next several years, Snow traveled throughout the Utah Territory helping Latter-day Saint bishops again organize Relief Society in their local wards, using the notes she took as secretary in Nauvoo as the founding principles of the reestablished Relief Society. &quot;What is the object of the Female Relief Society?&quot; Snow wrote on one occasion. &quot;I would reply—to do good—to bring into requisition every capacity we possess for doing good, not only in relieving the poor but in saving souls.&quot; Local Relief Societies soon fell under the umbrella of a church-wide, general Relief Society of which Snow served as president until 1887.

Snow&#x27;s presidency emphasized spirituality and self-sufficiency. The Relief Society sent women to medical school, trained nurses, opened the Deseret Hospital, operated cooperative stores, promoted silk manufacture, saved wheat, and built granaries. In 1872, Snow provided assistance and advice to Louisa L. Greene in the creation of a woman&#x27;s publication loosely affiliated with the Relief Society—the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot;. Snow&#x27;s responsibilities also extended to young women and children within the church. She was a primary organizer for the Young Ladies&#x27; Mutual Improvement Association in 1870 and assisted Aurelia Spencer Rogers in establishing the Primary Association in 1878.

Snow served as the Relief Society president until her death in 1887. By 1888, the Relief Society had more than 22,000 members in 400 local congregations.

Snow died in Salt Lake City and was buried in Brigham Young&#x27;s family cemetery.

== Poetry ==
Snow wrote poetry from a young age, one time even writing school lessons in rhyme. Between 1826 and 1832, she published more than 20 poems in local newspapers, including the &quot;Western Courier&quot; of Ravenna, Ohio, and the &quot;Ohio Star&quot; under pen names such as Narcissa and Tullia. Her first published poem was a requiem she was requested to write for John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, in light of their simultaneous deaths July 4, 1826. A number of Snow&#x27;s poems were set to music and have become important Latter-day Saint hymns, some of which appear in the current edition of the Church&#x27;s hymnal. One of her hymns, &quot;Great is the Lord&quot;, was published in the first Latter Day Saint hymnal in 1835, the year of her baptism.

In Nauvoo, Snow gained minor distinction as a Mormon poet featured in local newspapers. She continued to write poems as she journeyed to the Salt Lake Valley, documenting the pioneer trail and life in Utah, and in 1850 she penned a humorous riposte regarding visiting United States officials who had not impressed the Saints. where she would rise to prominence, being called &quot;Zion&#x27;s Poetess.&quot; The first of her two volumes of &quot;Poems, Religious, Historical, and Political&quot; appeared in 1856, followed by the second in 1877. Some of her poems are:
* &quot;How Great the Wisdom and the Love&quot;
* &quot;Invocation, or the Eternal Father and Mother&quot; [retitled &quot;O My Father&quot;]
* &quot;Be Not Discouraged&quot;
* &quot;My First View of a Western Prairie&quot;
* &quot;Mental Gas&quot;
* &quot;Think not When You Gather to Zion Your Troubles and Trials are Through&quot;
* &quot;O Awake! My Slumbering Minstrel&quot;

One of her best-known poems, &quot;Invocation, or the Eternal Father and Mother,&quot; was written soon after the death of her father and just over a year after the death of Joseph Smith. The poem, renamed &quot;O My Father&quot; after the first line, is included in the LDS Church&#x27;s current hymnal, as are Snow&#x27;s hymns &quot;Great is the Lord&quot;; &quot;Again We Meet Around the Board&quot;; &quot;Awake, Ye Saints of God, Awake!&quot;; &quot;How Great the Wisdom and the Love&quot;; &quot;The Time Is Far Spent&quot;; &quot;In Our Lovely Deseret&quot;; &quot;Though Deepening Trials&quot;; &quot;Behold the Great Redeemer Die&quot;; and &quot;Truth Reflects Upon Our Senses&quot;. 

Eliza Snow and her brother, Lorenzo Snow, founded the Polysophical Society in December 1854 in Salt Lake City. Members shared poetry and musical and dramatic performances. Church leaders Jedediah M. Grant and Heber C. Kimball halted the society&#x27;s activities because of its &quot;adulterous spirit.&quot;

<doc id="407714" wikidata="Q475780" url="?curid=407714" title="Siege of Osaka">
<text>The was a series of battles undertaken by the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate against the Toyotomi clan, and ending in that clan&#x27;s destruction. Divided into two stages, the winter campaign and the summer campaign, it lasted from 1614 to 1615. The siege put an end to the last major armed opposition to the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The end of the conflict is sometimes called the , because the era name was changed from Keichō to Genna immediately following the siege.

==Background==
When Toyotomi Hideyoshi died in 1598, Japan came to be governed by the Council of Five Elders, among whom Tokugawa Ieyasu possessed the most authority. After defeating Ishida Mitsunari in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Ieyasu essentially seized control of Japan for himself and abolished the council. In 1603, the Tokugawa shogunate was established with its capital at Edo. Hideyoshi&#x27;s son Toyotomi Hideyori and his mother Yodo-dono were allowed to stay at Osaka Castle, a fortress that had served as Hideyoshi&#x27;s residence. Hideyori remained confined to the castle for several years. In addition, as a mechanism of control, it was agreed that in the year 1603 he would marry the daughter of Tokugawa Hidetada, Senhime, who was related to both clans. Ieyasu sought to establish a powerful and stable regime under the rule of his own clan. Only the Toyotomi clan, led by Hideyori under the influence of Yodo-dono, remained an obstacle to that goal.

In 1611, Hideyori finally left Osaka, meeting with Ieyasu for two hours at Nijō Castle. Ieyasu was surprised by Hideyori&#x27;s behavior, contrary to popular belief that the boy was just &quot;useless&quot;. This belief had been spread by Katagiri Katsumoto, Hideyori&#x27;s personal guardian assigned by Ieyasu since 1599, and who had the intention of dissuading any aggression against the heir. In 1614, the Toyotomi clan rebuilt Osaka Castle. At the same time, the head of the clan sponsored the rebuilding of Hōkō-ji (Great Buddha of Kyoto) in Kyoto. These temple renovations included the casting of a great bronze bell, with inscriptions that read , and . The shogunate interpreted &quot; () as shattering Ieyasu&#x27;s name () to curse him, and also interpreted &quot; () to mean &quot;Toyotomi&#x27;s force () will rise again,&quot; which meant treachery against the shogunate. Tensions began to grow between the Tokugawa and the Toyotomi clans and only increased when Toyotomi began to gather a force of rōnin and enemies of the shogunate in Osaka. Ieyasu, despite having passed the title of shōgun to his son in 1605, nevertheless maintained significant influence.

After the Hoko-ji Temple Bell Incident, Yodo-dono sent Lady Okurakyo, Lady Aeba and Katagiri Katsumoto to Sunpu to see Tokugawa Ieyasu. In this meeting, Ieyasu hatched a plot to induce a split among the people of the Toyotomi family. On one hand, Ieyasu proposed a generous demand towards Lady Okurakyo. On the other hand, Ieyasu made severe demands on Katagiri Katsumoto, who represented the moderates and had been separately asking Ieyasu to save the Toyotomi family.

Despite Katagiri Katsumoto&#x27;s attempts to mediate the situation, Ieyasu found the ideal pretext to take a belligerent attitude against Yodo-dono and Hideyori. The situation worsened in September of that year, when the news reached Edo that in Osaka they were grouping a large quantity of rōnin at the invitation of Hideyori. Katsumoto proposed that Yodo-dono be sent to Edo as a hostage with the desire to avoid hostilities, which she flatly refused. Suspecting him of trying to betray the Toyotomi clan, Yodo-dono banished Katsumoto and several other servants accused of treason from Osaka castle, sending them to the service of the Tokugawa clan. Consequently, any possibility of reaching an agreement with the shogunate was dissolved. This last incident led to the beginning of the siege of Osaka.

=== Preparations ===

As preparations, Hideyori sent many letters to most of the daimyo lords in Japan who he predicted would sympathize with the Toyotomi clan. However, his efforts were largely fruitless as his letters delivered by his couriers were rejected by many of the recipients. Hachisuka Iemasa at first was hesitant, until his son convinced him to not accept Hideyori’s invitation to rebel against the Shogunate. Meanwhile, Shimazu Tadatsune directly rejected his invitation as Tadatsune stated the Shimazu clan was still recovering from the Sekigahara war and had no intention to stand up against Ieyasu. Tadatsune also returned a sword gift from Hideyori. An envoy of the Toyotomi clan dispatched to convince Ikeda Tadakatsu, lord of Sumoto in Awaji Island and son of Ikeda Terumasa, also failed, as the Ikeda clan instead arrested the envoys. Furthermore, the Toyotomi clan also failed to convince the Mōri clan under the lead of Mōri Terumoto to join their side, Terumoto instead supported the Tokugawa shogunate, as on November 3, Terumoto ordered his vassals Mōri Motochikazu and Motoyuki Sugimori, who were in charge in Mori Hidemoto&#x27;s absence, to send half of the troops east if Hidemoto asked them to march out to aid the shogunate in fighting the Toyotomi, while the remaining half, including Sugimori, Motoyoshi Nishi, and Shichirobei Misawa, were to stay in Chofu as caretakers, and to retreat to Hagi if something happened that would make it impossible to maintain Chofu.

Meanwhile, the shogunate also prepared their war efforts by stockpiling their ammunition. In May, a company of British merchants tried to sell lead in Hirado, but failed to find a buyer. This incident was reported by William Adams to the shogunate, who purchased the entire quantity of lead on offer. Furthermore, in the same month a Dutch merchant company was also selling lead, which was also purchased by the shogunate. Later in June, Tokugawa Ieyasu purchased a large amount of cannons, gunpowder, and bullets from British merchants, with Adams acted as the middleman, the prices being 1 kan for cannons, 2.3 bun for gunpowder, and 1.6 bun for bullets.

==Winter campaign==

In November of 1614, Tokugawa Ieyasu decided not to let this force grow any larger, and led 164,000 men to Osaka. The count does not include the troops of Shimazu Tadatsune, an ally of the Toyotomi cause who nevertheless did not send troops to Osaka. The siege began on 19 November, when Ieyasu led 3,000 men across the Kizu River, destroying the fort there. A week later, he attacked the village of Imafuku with 1,500 men, against a defending force of 600. With the aid of a squad wielding arquebuses (a weapon widely used by Japanese forces at this time), the shogunate forces claimed another victory. Several more small forts and villages were attacked before the siege of Osaka Castle itself began on 4 December.

The Sanada-maru was an earthwork barbican defended by Sanada Yukimura and 7,000 men, on behalf of the Toyotomi. The Shōgun&#x27;s armies were repeatedly repelled, and Sanada and his men launched a number of attacks against the siege lines, breaking through three times. Ieyasu then resorted to artillery (including 17 imported European cannons and 300 domestic wrought iron cannons) and men digging under the walls.

During this siege, the Tokugawa forces also deployed irregular auxiliaries such as Ninja clans from Iga province under the lead of Ii Naotaka, the head of the Ii clan. Aside from Naotaka&#x27;s ninja troops, there were also other Iga ikki warriors under Hattori Hanzō, and Yamaoka Kagetsuge. Aside from the ninja forces, other irregular elements from Iga province such as Tōdō Takatora&#x27;s Musokunin&quot; (part time samurai) also fought in this battle.

=== Bombing of Osaka Castle ===
Ieyasu, realizing that the castle would not fall easily and after consulting with his top advisers, ordered a limited bombing which began on January 8, 1615. For three consecutive days, his forces bombarded the fortress at 10 o&#x27;clock at night and at dawn. Meanwhile, miners were making tunnels under the walls and arrows were thrown inwards with messages requesting the surrender of the occupants. By January 15, with no response from the besieged, Ieyasu began an incessant bombardment that had a mainly psychological effect to diminish the morale of the defenders. The stone bases of Japanese castles were invulnerable to the artillery of the era and the structure of the castle remained virtually undamaged.

Realizing that the defenses were extremely strong, Ieyasu tried to convince Sanada Yukimura to change sides. Yukimura, who felt a strong antipathy for Ieyasu, rejected the bribe and made the attempt public. Ieyasu then bribed another captain, a commander named Nanjo Tadashige, asking him to open the castle gates. The attempted treason was discovered and Nanjo beheaded, so Ieyasu changed his strategy. Ieyasu ordered his men to deliberately bomb Yodo-dono&#x27;s quarters, and when they had found the range, a cannon hit its target, killing two of her maids.

During the night of the 16th, Ban Naotsugu, in charge of the defenses of one of the west side doors, carried out a night attack on the troops of Hachisuka Yoshishige, killing several enemies before retreating. The bombing continued the next day, on the mournful anniversary of Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s death. Ieyasu thought that on that day Hideyori would be in the temple dedicated to his father, so he ordered that his forces fire towards the place. The projectile almost hit Hideyori&#x27;s head, hitting one of the pillars of Yodo-dono&#x27;s quarters. She became terrified and pressed to reach an arrangement with the shogunate.

== Peace negotiations ==
On January 17, Ieyasu sent Honda Masazumi, accompanied by Lady Acha, to meet with Kyōgoku Tadataka, son of Ohatsu, younger sister of Yodo-dono. During the meeting, Lady Acha assured Ohatsu that Ieyasu had no ill will to Hideyori and that he wished to forgive him, but Hidetada was stubborn about taking the castle, so he had thousands of miners working in tunnels under the pits. On the other hand Honda assured that Ieyasu would allow Hideyori to keep Osaka as his fief, but in case he wanted to leave he would give him another one with higher income, besides that all his captains and soldiers would be given free transit when leaving or they could stay inside if they wanted to, but he would need some hostages as a sign of goodwill.

Ohatsu conveyed the terms to Yodo-dono who, in terror, asked Ōno Harunaga, Oda Nobukatsu, and Hideyori&#x27;s top seven advisers to accept the terms of the surrender. Lady Acha and Honda met again with Ohatsu, Lady Aeba and Ōkurakyō no Tsubone (Yodo-dono&#x27;s former wet nurse and one of the most influential figures in Osaka castle), and they told him that the outer pit should be filled by Ieyasu&#x27;s men. On January 21, the Oda delivered their children as hostages and Hideyori sent Kimura to Chausayama to close the agreement. Ieyasu issued a document, sealed with blood from his finger and signed also by Hidetada, which said:(that) the rōnin in the castle are not found guilty; that Hideyori&#x27;s income remain the same as before; that Yodo-dono is not asked to live in Edo; that if Hideyori chooses to leave Ōsaka he may choose any other province as his fiefdom; that his person is inviolable.On January 22, Ieyasu received a solemn oath from Hideyori and Yodo-dono that Hideyori would not rebel against Ieyasu or Hidetada and that he would consult any matter directly with him. Both Honda Tadamasa and Honda Masayuri were entrusted to dismantle the castle&#x27;s exterior defenses, so the soldiers of the shogunate tore down the walls and filled the outer moat. Hideyori did complain indignantly to the workers that this had not been part of the arrangement, but the response he received was that they only followed Ieyasu&#x27;s orders. Honda Masazumi blamed the workers for having misunderstood their instructions because they were already filling the interior moat as well. Although the work stopped momentarily, soon the soldiers of the shogunate continued, so Yodo-dono sent one of her bridesmaids and Ōno to Kyoto. Several days later Ieyasu gave an elusive official response, where he assured that since he had signed an eternal peace, the walls were not necessary.

During the process of reconciliation, Oda Nagamasu, one of the attendants of Osaka castle since before the war, left the castle and sent his child to the Tokugawa shogunate as a hostage and worked hard to reconcile the Toyotomi side with the shogunate. It was argued that even from the start of war, Nagamasa was working for in Ieyasu&#x27;s favor to seek peace between the two factions. According to &quot;Sunpu-ki&quot; record, the Toyotomi clan during this time were divided in three factions:

# The first faction were led by Ōno Harunaga. This faction favored reconciliation with the shogunate.
# The second faction were led by Kimura Shigenari. This faction was largely indecisive in their attitude.
# The third faction were led by Chōsokabe Motochika. This faction consisted of political war hawks who favored continuing the war.

In the end, Nagamasu decided to leave the Osaka castle as he could not maintain the reconcilliatory faction&#x27;s voice within the Toyotomi clan.

=== End of the peace treaty ===
Ieyasu left Osaka for Kyoto on January 24, meeting with Emperor Go-Mizunoo at a formal hearing on the 28th, where he informed the emperor that the war had come to an end. Hidetada remained in place to supervise the work of destruction of the defenses, arriving in Edo on March 13. By then, news reached the capital that the Toyotomi camp was once again seeking to enlist rōnin into its service. This information led Ieyasu to order Hideyori to relinquish and abandon the Osaka fief.

Even from the moment when peace was being signed, the Toyotomi command proposed to launch a night attack on the Tokugawa camp, although it was finally decided not to do so. Shortly after Hideyori began to receive reports of the true intentions of Ieyasu, so they began the work of digging out the moats and recruiting troops. Hideyori and his main generals agreed that unlike the first campaign, this time it would be appropriate to take the offensive. Also, it was arranged to secure the areas surrounding Osaka and take Kyoto to control the emperor, so that he would declare Ieyasu to be a rebel against the Imperial throne. Following the rumors of what the Toyotomi army planned, the population of Kyoto began to flee from the city, and even a commander of the shogunate, Furuta Shigenari, was sentenced to death, suspected of being part of a plot to burn down Kyoto and apprehend the emperor.

Through his agent, Gotō Shōzaburō, who infiltrated Osaka to gather information on March 12, Ieyasu learned that the Toyotomi had stockpiled rice and kept employing the rōnin mercenaries in Osaka. In response to these reports, Ieyasu issued a ban on March 14 to prohibit ships loaded with annual rice from landing in Osaka and selling their provisions, which was implemented particularly to the daimyo governors from western regions of Japan such as Kyushu and Shikoku. Faced with these bans, the Toyotomi side began to show signs of internal division due to the problem of rōnin mercenaries roaming in Osaka. Hideyori was troubled that the ever-increasing number of rōnin, prompting a temporary solution by providing them with gold and silver to stop them from running wild, although at the expense of the Toyotomi clan financially. Meanwhile, Ono Harunaga voiced his disagreement with financing the Rōnin as they now had a peace treaty with the Shogunate. Nevertheless, Hideyori decided to allocate most of their trading profits from the Port of Osaka to finance these rōnin despite the crisis. Furthermore, Hideyori tried to solve this problem by requesting one of the neighboring provinces to be handed to him to increase the tax incomes during the meeting with Ieyasu on March 15. However, his request was rejected, causing unrest in Osaka as the provisions in the city became less day by day. Hideyori expressed his decision to move from Osaka to Koriyama in Yamato Province, as Ieyasu instructed which was agreed to by his vassals. However, the rōnin threatened that if he did that, they would keep fighting Ieyasu even without Hideyori and commit suicide, forcing Hideyori to gave up his decision and agree with their decision to fight the Shogunate once more.

Ieyasu left Shizuoka on May 3 to Nagoya, where his ninth son married on the 11th of the same month in the castle of that city. The next day he met a traitor from the Toyotomi camp, Oda Yuraku, who informed him that there were several factions within the castle, that the war councils rarely ended in anything conclusive and that Yodo-dono generally intervened in all matters. Later, he went to Nijō Castle, where he arrived on May 17 and met there on the 21 or 22 with Hidetada, who arrived with the troops ready to go to Osaka.

==Summer campaign==
In April 1615, Ieyasu received word that Toyotomi Hideyori was gathering even more troops than in the previous November, and that he was trying to stop the filling of the moat. Toyotomi forces began to attack contingents of the Tokugawa forces near Osaka. On 26 May (Keichō 20, 29th day of 4th month) at the Battle of Kashii, Toyotomi forces under the command of Ono Harufusa and Ban Danemon engaged with forces of Asano Nagaakira, an ally of the Shōgun. Tachibana Muneshige now served as military advisor of the second shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada, as his military strategist and in charge of guarding the area. Muneshige correctly predicted the movements of the general of Toyotomi, Ono Harufusa&#x27;s troops and guided Hidetada&#x27;s troops. Toyotomi forces sustained heavy losses and Ban Danemon was killed.

On 2 June (Keichō 20, 6th day of 5th month), the Battle of Dōmyōji took place. Toyotomi forces tried to stop the enemy approaching from Yamato Province along the Yamato-gawa river. Two Toyotomi generals, Gotō Matabei and Susukida Kanesuke, were killed in the fighting. Toyotomi commander Sanada Yukimura engaged in a battle with Date Masamune forces, but soon retreated towards Osaka Castle. Tokugawa forces did not pursue Sanada. 
The same day Chōsokabe Morichika and Tōdō Takatora battled at Yao. Another battle took place at Wakae around the same time, between Kimura Shigenari and Ii Naotaka. Chōsokabe&#x27;s forces achieved victory, but Kimura Shigenari was deflected by the left wing of Ii Naotaka&#x27;s army. The main Tokugawa forces moved to assist Todo Takatora after Shigenari&#x27;s death, and Chōsokabe withdrew for the time being.

=== Fall of Osaka Castle ===

After another series of Tokugawa victories on the outskirts of Osaka, the summer campaign came to a head at the battle of Tennōji. Hideyori planned a hammer-and-anvil operation in which 55,000 men would attack the center of the Tokugawa army while a second force, 16,500 men led by Kyōgoku Tadataka, Ishikawa Tadafusa, and Kyōgoku Takatomo, would attack them from the rear. Meanwhile, Ii Naotaka sent his Red Demon ninja unit under the lead of Miura Yo&#x27;emon, Shimotani Sanzo, Okuda Kasa&#x27;emon, and Saga Kita&#x27;emon to aid the Tokugawa&#x27;s regular soldiers in storming the southern gate of Osaka castle. Another contingent waited in reserve. Ieyasu&#x27;s army was led by his son, the Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada, and numbered around 155,000. They moved in four parallel lines, prepared to make flanking maneuvers of their own. Mistakes on both sides almost altered the outcome of the battle, as Hideyori&#x27;s rōnin split off from the main group, and Hidetada&#x27;s reserve force moved up without orders from the main force. In the end, Hideyori&#x27;s commander Sanada Yukimura was killed by Nishio Munetsugu, destroying the morale of the Toyotomi Army. The smaller force led directly by Hideyori sallied forth from Osaka Castle too late, and was chased right back into the castle by the advancing enemies; there was no time to set up a proper defense of the castle, and it was soon ablaze and pummeled by artillery fire.

The people who were in the castle began to escape. Hidetada knew that his daughter was in the castle, so he sent Ii Naotaka to save her. Senhime managed to escape with her son Toyotomi Kunimatsu (Hideyori&#x27;s son) accompanied by other women. Kaihime fled with Hideyori&#x27;s concubine, Oiwa no Kata, and Hideyori&#x27;s daughter Nāhime. While they retreated, Kaihime personally defended Nāhime from Tokugawa troops. Hideyori and Yodo-dono took refuge in a fireproof warehouse, as much of the castle was in flames. Ōno Harunaga sent Hideyori&#x27;s wife, Senhime, with his father Hidetada to be forgiven, and to plead for the life of her husband and mother-in-law. Without waiting for answers, Toyotomi Hideyori and Yodo-dono committed &quot;seppuku&quot; in the flames of Osaka castle, thus ending the Toyotomi dynasty. When the death of the clan leaders was announced, Lady Okurakyo, Lady Aeba, Ono Harunaga, Ono Harufusa and other loyal retainers committed suicide shortly thereafter.

The final major uprising against Tokugawa rule was put to an end, leaving the shogunate unchallenged for approximately 250 years.

==== Theory ====
According to an account by an employee of the Dutch East India Company in Hirado, several &quot;daimyō&quot; set the castle on fire and attempted to defect to Ieyasu. Hideyori executed them by throwing them off the castle wall but could not extinguish the fire, which then led to his suicide. The account also stated that about 10,000 people perished in the blaze.

==Aftermath==
Hideyori&#x27;s son Toyotomi Kunimatsu, aged eight, was captured by the Tokugawa forces and beheaded in Kyoto. According to legend, before his beheading, little Kunimatsu bravely blamed Ieyasu for his betrayal and brutality against the Toyotomi clan. Nāhime, daughter of Hideyori, was not sentenced to death. Ohatsu and Senhime were able to save Nāhime&#x27;s life and adopted her; she later became a nun at Kamakura&#x27;s Tōkei-ji. Hideyoshi&#x27;s grave, along with Kyoto&#x27;s Toyokuni Shrine, were destroyed subsequently during the Tokugawa shogunate. Chōsokabe Morichika was beheaded on May 11. There are also records of pillaging and mass rapes by Tokugawa forces at the closing of the siege.

The &quot;bakufu&quot; obtained 650,000 &quot;koku&quot; at Osaka and started rebuilding Osaka Castle. Osaka was then made a &quot;han&quot; (feudal domain), and given to Matsudaira Tadayoshi. In 1619, however, the shogunate replaced Osaka Domain with Osaka Jodai, placed under the command of a &quot;bugyō&quot; who served the shogunate directly; like many of Japan&#x27;s other major cities, Osaka was for the remainder of the Edo period not part of a &quot;han&quot; under the control of a &quot;daimyō&quot;. A few &quot;daimyō&quot; including Naitō Nobumasa (Takatsuki Castle, Settsu Province 20,000 koku) and Mizuno Katsushige (Yamato Koriyama, Yamato Province 60,000 koku) moved to Osaka.

The Toyotomi clan was then disbanded.

After the fall of the castle, the shogunate announced laws including (one province can contain only one castle) and &quot;Bukeshohatto&quot; (or called Law of Buke, which limits each &quot;daimyō&quot; to own only one castle and obey the castle restrictions). The shogunate&#x27;s permission had to be obtained prior to any castle construction or repair from then on. Many castles were also forced to be destroyed as a result of compliance with this law.

Despite finally uniting Japan, Ieyasu&#x27;s health was failing. During the one-year campaign against the Toyotomi clan and its allies, he received wounds that significantly shortened his life. Roughly one year later on June 1, 1616, Tokugawa Ieyasu, the third and last of the great unifiers, died at the age of 75, leaving the shogunate to his descendants.

==In popular culture==

The siege is the subject of Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Ōsaka-jō monogatari&quot; (&quot;engl. The Tale of Osaka Castle&quot;, UK; some other English titles: &quot;Daredevil in the Castle&quot;, &quot;Devil in the Castle&quot;, &quot;Osaka Castle Story&quot;) (1961) with Toshiro Mifune in the leading role. It is also the backdrop for Tai Kato&#x27;s musical film &quot;Brave Records of the Sanada Clan&quot; (1963).

The fall of Osaka is (for most of the characters) the final level in the &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; series, also serving as the climax of Hattori Hanzō&#x27;s, Ieyasu&#x27;s and Yukimura&#x27;s stories. Called the &quot;Osaka Campaign&quot;, it compiles all the battles of the Winter and Summer Campaigns. In the computer game &quot;Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun&quot;, the siege of Osaka castle is the setting of the first (and demo) mission.

The siege of Osaka also is the main setting for the tv show, &quot;Samurai Rabbit: The Usagi Chronicles&quot;.

The protagonist, Tsugumo Hanshirō, of the film &quot;Harakiri&quot;, mentions his status as a veteran of the siege of Osaka Castle.

The events of the siege and its fallout form the backstory for the 1974 Toei TV series &quot;Unmeitōge&quot;.

The siege campaign serves as the setting for the video game Nioh&#x27;s final two DLC. The game&#x27;s second DLC, &quot;Defiant Hope&quot;, is set during the Winter campaign whereas the third DLC, &quot;Bloodshed&#x27;s End&quot;, is set during the Summer campaign up through the fall of Osaka castle and the beginning of the Genna Era.

<doc id="407727" wikidata="Q7523209" url="?curid=407727" title="Singapore embassies attack plot">
<text>The Singapore embassies attack plot was a plan in 2001 by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) to bomb the diplomatic missions and attack personnel of the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Israel based in Singapore. There were also several other targets. The plot was uncovered in December 2001 and as many as 15 people were arrested in Singapore within a month. Further investigation and intelligence prompted the detention of another 26 persons from 2002 to 2005. As of 2006, 37 of them were still being detained without trial, under the Internal Security Act. Four had been released on restriction orders.

==JI branch in Singapore==
The Singapore JI branch was started as early as 1993, when Ibrahim Maidin underwent military training in Afghanistan and was subsequently appointed leader of JI in Singapore. By conducting religious classes, Maidin began recruiting other members into the JI organisation.

At least eight of the sleeper cell members had received training in Afghanistan. Riduan Isamuddin, the leader of JI who is better known as Hambali, had arranged their travels to Pakistan, using false documents and cover stories that they were accepted by a religious school for religious studies. They stayed in an al-Qaeda safe house in Pakistan before travelling to Afghanistan, where they received training in the use of AK-47s, mortars, and military tactics. Several members also attended a training camp in southern Philippines, known as Camp Hudaybiyya, set up by Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and run by Indonesian JI members.

The Singapore branch of JI was organised into at least three groups. The first cell, which was called &quot;&quot;Fiah Ayub&quot; (first cell) and the second cell was called &quot;Fiah Musa&quot;&quot;. The Singapore branch was headed by Ibrahim Maidin and Faiz bin Abi Bakar Bafana was the second in command. The Singapore branch was under the command of a Malaysia-based leadership structure called a regional &quot;shura&quot; (consultative council), within the larger network of JI organisation in Southeast Asia. Members of the cell did not attend local mosque or made little contact with other mainstream Islamic organisations in the country. The group operated in tight secrecy and were using code words in their communication.

==Surveillance activities==
According to investigations, the cell had conducted survey for other targets as early as 1997, when the cell was planning to target Yishun MRT station, where American troops and their families used to take shuttle rides to the US Navy site at Sembawang for recreation activities at a sports complex coincidentally known as the &quot;Terror Club&quot;, named after the Royal Navy shore accommodation establishment HMS &quot;Terror&quot;. In 1999, a member of the Singapore cell, Khalim Jaffar travelled to Afghanistan and presented the plan to Al Qaeda&#x27;s leaders. Mohammed Atef, a close aide of Osama bin Laden, gave JI the go-ahead for the attack.

In April 2001, a member of the cell, who was working at ST Aerospace, took photographs of American military aircraft and personnel at Paya Lebar Airbase, and distributed them to other cell members.

The cell had also surveyed other potential targets including water pipelines at the Johor-Singapore Causeway, Singapore Changi Airport, the Singapore Air Traffic Control Center at Biggin Hill Road, Sembawang Wharves and the Ministry of Defence at Bukit Gombak.

==Embassies attack plot==
In early October 2001, Fathur Rahman al-Ghozi, also known as Mike, and Mohammed Jabarah, also known as Sammy, flew to Singapore and directed the sleeper cell to conduct &quot;final reconnaissance&quot; and video recordings of potential targets. The two operatives gave instructions to the cell to prepare for attacks in Singapore. Among the targets were U.S. and Israeli Embassies, British and Australian High Commissions, the Singapore American School, and commercial buildings housing US firms. They planned to launch the attacks in December 2001/January 2002 or April/May 2002.

Philippine authorities said that al-Ghozi, a bombmaker, had three Philippine passports and an Indonesian passport. Investigators later revealed al-Ghozi&#x27;s ties with Abu Bakar Bashir, the alleged spiritual head of Jemaah Islamiyah. al-Ghozi had studied in Bashir&#x27;s religious school in Indonesia for six years. The other man, Sammy, was later identified as Mohd Mansour Jabarah, a Canadian national of Arab descent, who was in US custody (as of 2003) and sentenced to life in prison in 2008.

The cell members then set off to procure 17 tons of explosives, especially that of precursor ammonium nitrate, along with trucks and chemicals. JI has close ties with Kumpulan Militan Malaysia (KMM), a militant group in Malaysia. Yazid Sufaat, a KMM member, had purchased 4 tons of ammonium nitrate which were already made available to the Singapore cell for the bombings. In an interview on PBS, Lee Kuan Yew pointed out that each bomb would be twice the size of the one detonated by Timothy McVeigh at the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City.

==Failure of plot==

After the 11 September 2001 attacks, an informant told the Internal Security Department about Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, who is a Singaporean citizen of Pakistani descent and had made claims of having ties with Al-Qaeda. Khan was placed under surveillance, but he abruptly left Singapore for Pakistan on 4 October. He was later captured by United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan officials. His interrogation led investigators to the Singaporean cell.

Singapore authorities conducted the first raid on 8 December 2001, arresting six people. A total of 15 people were arrested within a month. During the raids, the police seized documents of the attack plots and bomb making information, as well as photographs and surveillance video of the intended targets including the embassies. Fake passports and forged immigration documents were also found.

Soon after, a JI-made surveillance video was recovered among the rubble of a house that was bombed by US coalition forces in Kabul, Afghanistan. It was the home of Mohammed Atef, a close aide of Osama bin Laden. The video showed a narrator in Singapore, Hashim bin Abas, describing how bombs could be hidden to attack United States interests. Besides the embassies, the plotters were also planning to target United States Air Force warplanes that were stationed at Paya Lebar Air Force Base, as well as several United States companies and businesses. There were also plans to attack U.S. Navy warships along Singapore&#x27;s coastlines, similar to the USS Cole bombing in Yemen in October 2000.

The JI group were also plotting to attack United States Navy personnel and their families who often traveled between the Yishun MRT station and Sembawang Wharf via shuttle buses. The video also detailed how bombs could be planted in the sewers and drains near the Yishun MRT Station in order to cause massive casualties when targeting United States personnel. The video also showed a man describing how explosives could be strapped on bicycles and be transported without raising suspicion. Investigators in Singapore had found similar tapes at the residence of Mohamed Khalim bin Jaffar, one of arrested JI members. The Singapore government presented these material as evidence of a direct link between the JI group and Al-Qaeda.

On 15 January 2002, Fathur Rahman al-Ghozi was arrested by authorities in the Philippines. He gave police information that led to a cache of rifles, explosive and bomb-making material in Southern Philippines. These were believed to be part of the embassies attack plot.

In August 2002, ISD conducted another major security operation and arrested 18 persons, most of them were members of JI, while two were members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a militant separatist group in the Philippines.

==Aftermath==
===Heightened security===
Following the arrests, the U.S., British, and Australian embassies in Singapore were placed on heightened alert. Members of the elite Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force were posted at the embassies to enhance their security.

<text>Operation Bramble Bush () was an Israeli plan to assassinate Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in 1992. It was described in full in December 2003 by the Israeli newspaper &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, but news reports had circulated about the plot since January 1999. The plan was conceived as retaliation for Iraqi Scud missile attacks during the Gulf War. Another motivation was the postwar revelation by UN inspectors that Iraq had been a few years away from potential nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons capability as well as the missile capability to hit Israel, and the fear that Hussein would continue trying to develop such capabilities. The plan was called off after five commandos were accidentally killed during the final rehearsal for the operation; the accident is known in Israel as the Tze&#x27;elim Bet disaster ().

== Plan ==
IDF Chief of Staff Ehud Barak persuaded Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and then his successor Yitzhak Rabin to approve an operation to assassinate Saddam Hussein. In January 1992, he formed a team headed by Amiram Levin to examine ways Saddam could be assassinated. Various schemes were considered, among them crashing an Israeli plane or satellite in Iraq and then blowing it up when Hussein came to inspect it, creating a European straw company to sell him a new modern television studio from which he could broadcast his speeches and blowing it up as he broadcast, and detonating a booby-trapped monument as he stood before it at a memorial ceremony.

When Saddam&#x27;s uncle, Khairallah Talfah, was discovered to be terminally ill, the Israelis decided to ambush the funeral party at the family&#x27;s plot at the cemetery in Tikrit, as it was the only place outside of well-guarded Baghdad where it would surely be Saddam himself and not a body double. The Israelis closely followed Talfah&#x27;s treatment in Jordan. When it was decided that he was taking too long to die, a plan was conceived for the Mossad to assassinate Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam&#x27;s half-brother who was then the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations, and ambush Saddam at his funeral instead. 

Under the plan, a commando team from the Israeli Army&#x27;s elite Sayeret Matkal unit was to be inserted into Iraq by helicopter some distance away, travel to the cemetery in jeeps disguised to look like Iraqi Army vehicles and fitted with missile launchers, and kill Saddam with TV-guided &quot;Midras&quot; missiles.

Sayeret Matkal commandos drilled for the operation with a replica of the Hussein family&#x27;s cemetery at the infantry training base near kibbutz Tze&#x27;elim in the Negev. When the commandos were declared ready, a rehearsal for the operation led by Doron Kempel was held for senior IDF commanders on November 5, 1992. Ehud Barak was among those in attendance. The operation&#x27;s execution was planned for just two days away. 

== Training accident ==
The members of the hit team drilled with live missiles, while members of the unit&#x27;s intelligence and administrative staff played the part of Saddam and his entourage. The commandos fired live rounds at a convoy simulating the target after mistaking a &quot;dry run&quot;, where a soldier posed as Saddam waving at crowds, for a &quot;wet run&quot;, where Saddam&#x27;s part was replaced by a mannequin due to weariness from the training as well as poor planning to the point where the same code word was used for both a &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;wet&quot; run. As a result, the commandos fired two missiles at their fellow soldiers simulating Saddam and his convoy, one of which hit the middle of the convoy while the other landed a few yards away. Five soldiers were killed and six wounded.

The plan was cancelled. Israeli press reports described the incident as a &quot;training accident.&quot; Israeli censors tried to prevent Israeli newspapers from publishing the fact that the head of military intelligence, Uri Sagi, had witnessed the accident, but the censors relented a few weeks later. On November 24, the American newspaper &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; reported that the soldiers involved in the accident had been rehearsing a plan to kill Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and the &quot;Independent&quot; also reported on the apparent attempt against Nasrallah, and the Israeli military censor complained the reporters from all newspapers involved had violated censorship laws.

== Aftermath ==
Seven years later, Operation Bramble Bush II once again targeted Saddam. Mossad agents had scouted locations in Iraq for the ambush of the Iraqi leader. However, as before, the plan was scrapped, this time because of both the British-American Operation Desert Fox and concerns that the operation could harm the Arab–Israeli peace process.

<text>The Chevrolet Bel Air is a full-size car produced by Chevrolet for the 1950–1981 model years. Initially, only the two-door hardtops in the Chevrolet model range were designated with the Bel Air name from 1950 to 1952. With the 1953 model year, the Bel Air name was changed from a designation for a unique body shape to a premium level of trim applied across a number of body styles. The Bel Air continued with various other trim level designations, and it had gone from a mid-level trim car to a budget fleet sedan when U.S. production ceased in 1975. Production continued in Canada, for its home market only, through the 1981 model year.

==History==

===First generation (1950–1954)===
From 1950 to 1952, the Bel Air Sport Coupe name was used only for the two-door hardtops in the Chevrolet model range, to distinguish the car from the Styleline and Fleetline models. It is named after the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood on the Westside of Los Angeles.

First-year production reached only 76,662 models built. The car cost $1,741 and weighed . Front suspension was independent, named &quot;knee-action&quot;. The standard, &quot;Thriftmaster&quot; six-cylinder engine produced .

The first Bel Airs of this era shared only their front sheet metal ahead of the A pillar with the rest of the range. The windshield, doors, glass, and trunk were common with the Styleline Deluxe Convertible Coupe, however, the roof, rear quarters and three-piece rear windows were unique. The chassis and mechanicals were common with the rest of the passenger car range, and the overall appearance was the same as the rest of the range, except that the roofline was lower and the unique three piece rear window gave it a longer and more balanced look. The first Bel Airs were available with only the &quot;Deluxe&quot; premium trim level and specification.

Apart from the usual annual grille and trim changes, the 1951–1952 Bel Air differed from the earlier 1950 model with the introduction of the higher and squarer rear guards that were across the whole range.

In 1953 Chevrolet renamed its series, and the Bel Air name was applied to the premium model range. Two lower series, the 150 and 210, also emerged (as successors to the Special and Deluxe series, respectively). The 1953 Chevrolet was advertised as &quot;Entirely new through and through&quot; due to the restyled body panels, front and rear ends. However, essentially these Chevrolets had similar frames and mechanicals to the 1949–1952 cars.

The Bel Air was given a facelift in 1953. The pre-war technology, such as torque tube drive, six-cylinder splash feed engines, knee-action suspension, and split windshields of the early models, was phased out, and the foundations for the first post-war modern Chevrolet passenger car were finalized. The Bel Air series featured a wide chrome strip of molding from the rear fender bulge to the rear bumper. The inside of this stripe was painted a coordinating color with the outside body color, and &quot;Bel Air&quot; scripts were added inside the strip. Lesser models had no model designation anywhere on the car, having only a Chevrolet crest on the hood and trunk. 1953 was the first year for a curved, one-piece windshield. The lower-cost Thriftmaster option installed on manual transmission cars was replaced by the larger &quot;Thrift-King&quot;, a lower compression version of the Blue Flame engine producing .

In the July 1953 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, a tested 1953 Bel Air went from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 19.6 seconds.

Bel Air interiors had an optional massive expanse of chrome across the lower part of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with a full chrome horn ring. Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six-cylinder engines had Babbitt bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod, and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were &quot;Blue Flame&quot; inline six-cylinder OHV engines, featuring hydraulic valve lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons. The 235 cubic inch displacement engine was made standard on stick shift models, with solid lifters and splash plus pressure lubrication, including Babbitt bearings. Powerglide cars got a newly upgraded version which had hydraulic lifters and full pressure lubrication.

In 1953 and 1954, Bel Airs could be ordered as a convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door variant sedan, and, for 1954, the Beauville station wagon, which featured woodgrain trim around the side windows. Many new options, once only seen in more expensive luxury cars, were offered, starting in 1953. This included power steering and the Guidematic headlight dimmer in 1953, as well as power brakes, power 2-way front seat and power front windows in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.
===Second generation (1955–1957)===


The Bel Air received new, revamped styling for the 1955 model year. The Bel Air was and long. It was called the &quot;Hot One&quot; in GM&#x27;s advertising campaign. Bel Airs came with features found on cars in the lower models ranges plus interior carpet, chrome headliner bands on hardtops, chrome spears on front fenders, stainless steel window moldings, full wheel covers, and a Ferrari-inspired front grille. Models were further distinguished by the Bel Air name script in gold lettering later in the year. For 1955 Chevrolets gained a V8 engine option and the option of the 2 speed Powerglide automatic, or a standard three speed Synchro-Mesh manual transmission with optional overdrive. The new V8 featured a modern, overhead valve high compression ratio, short stroke design that was so good that it remained in production in various displacements for many decades. The base V8 had a two-barrel carburetor and was rated at and the &quot;Power Pack&quot; option featured a four-barrel carburetor and other upgrades yielding . Later in the year, a &quot;Super Power Pack&quot; option added high-compression and a further . Warning lights replaced gauges for the generator and oil pressure. This was not the first Chevrolet with a V8 engine; the first Chevrolet with a V8 engine was introduced in 1917 and called the Series D, which was built for two years, and was manufactured before Chevrolet joined General Motors.

The 1955 Bel Air was very well received. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine gave the Bel Air top marks for handling. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; reported acceleration for a V8 Bel Air with Powerglide as being 0- in 12.9 seconds, plus a comfortable ride and good visibility. On the other hand, the horn ring blocked some of the speedometer, regular gasoline made the engine knock and the first V8 engines off the line burned too much oil. Front legroom was 43.1&quot;. Brakes were 11&quot; drums. A new option for V8-equipped 1955 models was air conditioning, with outlets on each side of the dashboard; a heavy-duty generator was included on cars equipped with this option; in 1955 and 1956, air conditioning could be installed on cars ordered with the standard three-speed manual transmission, overdrive or Powerglide, but from 1957 onward, an automatic transmission (or minus that, 4-speed manual transmission) was a pre-requisite option.

The 1956 Bel Air received a face-lift with a more conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who didn&#x27;t favor the Ferrari-inspired &#x27;55 front end. Two-tone bodyside treatments and front and rear wheel openings completed the &quot;speedline&quot; restyling. Single housings incorporated the taillight, stoplight, and backup light, and the left one held the gas filler – an idea popularized on Cadillacs. Among the seven Bel Air models was a new Sport Sedan, a pillarless four-door hardtop that looked handsome with all the windows rolled down and allowed easy entry into the back seat. Production exceeded 103,000, compared to 128,000 two-door hardtops. Shapely two-door Nomad wagons topped the price chart at US$2,608 ($ in dollars ), but now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheet metal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original&#x27;s unique trim. Only 7,886 were built. The least costly Bel Air, at US$2,025 ($ in dollars ), was the two-door sedan. Seatbelts, shoulder harnesses, and a padded dashboard were available, and full-size cars could even get the hot Corvette 225-horsepower engine. In 1956 sales material there was an optional rain-sensing automatic top, which was first seen on the 1951 LaSabre concept car. However, it is believed that it was never installed on a car. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; reported only 7.4% of owners in their survey ordered seat belts. A &#x27;56 Bel Air 4-door hardtop, prepared by Chevrolet engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov, set a new endurance/speed record for an automobile ascending Pikes Peak.

In 1957 engine displacement grew to  with the &quot;Super Turbo Fire V8&quot; option (shared with the Corvette), producing at 6200 rpm and at 4400 rpm of torque with the help of Rochester Ramjet continuous mechanical fuel injection (closed-loop). These so-called &quot;fuelie&quot; cars are quite rare, since most Bel Airs were fitted with carburetion.

The 1957 Bel Air is considered by many to be &quot;an icon of its age. . .right alongside Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, and Leave it to Beaver,&quot; and is among the most recognizable American cars of all time; well-maintained examples, especially sport coupes and convertibles are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. They are roomy, with tastefully restrained, period use tail fins and chrome. A second automatic transmission, Turboglide was optional. While the original two-speed Powerglide continued unchanged, Turboglide provided a continuously variable gear-ratio which made &quot;shifting&quot; imperceptible. The shift quadrant on Turboglide cars followed a &quot;P R N D Gr&quot; pattern.

From 1955 to 1957, production of the two-door Nomad station wagon was assigned to the Bel Air series, although its body and trim were unique to that model. Prior to becoming a regular production model, the Nomad first appeared as a Corvette-based concept vehicle in 1954. Chevrolet has since unveiled two concept cars bearing the Nomad name, most recently in 1999. The 1955–1957 Chevrolets are commonly referred to as Tri Fives.

The 1955–1957s were made in right-hand drive and shipped from Oshawa Car Assembly in Oshawa, Ontario, for local assembly in Australia (CKD), New Zealand (SKD) and South Africa. All three model years had a reversed version of the &#x27;55 LHD dashboard and did not get the LHD models&#x27; 1957 redesign.

A black 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air was featured in the 1973 movie &quot;American Graffiti.&quot; This &#x27;55 features a big hood scoop, and a signature cowboy hat in the rear window. In the movie, it races against a yellow 1932 Ford Deuce Coupe and crashes into a ditch. The Bel Air had a 454 cubic inch Chevrolet motor, with aluminum heads, tunnel ram intake and dual Holley carburetors. 
===Third generation (1958)===

For 1958, Chevrolet models were redesigned longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors, and the  was now an option. The Bel Air gained a halo vehicle in 1958, the Impala, available only as a hardtop coupe and convertible in its introductory year. Impala styling followed the basic lines of the other Chevrolet models but received special styling cues including a different roof line, a vent above the rear window, unique side trim, and triple tail lights housed in slightly broader alcoves. Two significantly cheaper models, the Biscayne (formerly the 210) and the Delray (formerly the 150) were also available during this model year.

Chevrolet&#x27;s design for the year fared better than its other GM offerings, and lacked the overabundance of chrome found on other sedans at the time. Complementing Chevrolet&#x27;s front design was a broad grille and quad headlights; the tail received a fan-shaped alcove on both side panels, which housed dual tail lights. Despite being a recession year, consumers made Chevrolet the No. 1 make of automobile, and the Bel Air was at the core of Chevrolet&#x27;s popularity. With its wide variety of body styles and models, Bel Airs could be optioned with almost every conceivable luxury within the Chevrolet line. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle bowed as the premium four-door Chevrolet station wagon, lacking the unique styling of the 1955-57 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights (one on each side of the body) housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the rear gate. A new dash was used.

====Safety====
The 1958 Bel Air featured Chevrolet&#x27;s new &quot;Safety-Girder&quot; cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine. These &quot;x-frames&quot; were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevrolet cars, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.

For the first time, Powerglide models featured the &quot;PRNDL&quot; transmission selector arrangement, replacing the oft-criticized &quot;PNDLR&quot; quadrant that many considered confusing at best, dangerous at worst.

===Fourth generation (1959–1960)===
The Bel Air received a major redesign for the 1959 model year. The most visual new change was the flat, wing shaped tailfins. The car was built on a wheelbase and was long-which was longer than the 1957 model. This made Chevrolet the longest car in the low-priced range, whereas two years before it had been the shortest. In addition, the car was wider outside and had more width inside than it did in 1958, through the reduction of door thickness. The &quot;X&quot; frame from 1958 was continued, but enlarged and strengthened to support the new body.

The Bel Air, which had been the top line series since 1953, was now the middle range. Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers matching the car series. Parkwood 6-passenger and Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air&#x27;s model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. Under the hood, little change took place. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. Bel Air production was 447,100. The new Impala &quot;line&quot; surpassed Bel Air production by 20,000 units. A parking brake warning light was optional.

Little change was made for 1960. The new models were refinements of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, the return of the double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling &quot;cat&#x27;s eyes&quot; of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800 rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three double-barrel carburetors, a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package. Body style offerings followed 1959, with hardtops and sedans available. The convertible was reserved for the Impala series. The Bel Air Sport Sedan continued to use a rear window overhang and a huge wraparound rear window. Bel Airs (and Biscaynes) had two tail lights per side; the Impalas had three tail lights per side—a situation that would persist for most years through 1975. Many of the same options and accessories that were available on the Impala were also available on the Bel Air. The Bel Airs had more interior and exterior brightwork than the Biscayne.


===Fifth generation (1961–1964)===
For 1961, the Bel Air received a new body. Its wheelbase remained , but its length was now reduced slightly to .
All engines options of the previous year remained in effect with the standard engines being the 235.5 CID Six of or the 283 CID V8 of . The V8 cost $110 more than the Six and weighed less.

The Bel Air 2-door sedan used squared-off roof styling and large wrap-around rear window as opposed to the hardtop&#x27;s swept-back design. The Bel Air 4-door Sport Hardtop still used a different roof line than did the 4-door sedan.

For 1962, all sheet metal except the door panels was changed. Overall length was stretched slightly to . The 4-door Sport Hardtop was no longer offered in the Bel Air series. Standard engines remained the same as the previous year. A new  V8 of 250 or was offered in addition to the giant (for the time)  V8 of or with the dual four-barrel carburetor setup. The Turboglide was also discontinued, leaving the Powerglide as the only automatic transmission available. All wagons this year were 4-door models and separate series names for wagons were dropped. Now all models were either Biscayne, Bel Air or Impala series. Full carpeting returned as standard equipment on all 1962 Bel Air models for the first time in several years. The Bel Air Sport Coupe was in its last year of U.S. production, and its roofline was a carryover from the 1961 hardtop coupe.

The Bel Air was given a facelift in 1963. Its overall length increased to . Replacing the older 235 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine as standard equipment was a new 230 cubic-inch six-cylinder of more modern design with a 140-horsepower rating that was based on the 194 cubic-inch six introduced on the compact Chevy II Nova the previous year. The base V8 remained the 283 CID, which was upgraded to produce . The 409 CID V8 was now offered in 340, 400 and versions, while the small block 327 V8 continued with options of 250 and 300 horsepower. The Bel Air continued to be Chevrolet&#x27;s middle range, but it now consisted of only two car models- the 2-door sedan and the 4-door sedan. 6 and 9-passenger Bel Air station wagons were again offered.

For 1964, very few changes were made except the expected sheet metal and trim renovations. Cars were in length while the wagons were long. In addition to the un-changed standard engines, there were two different 327 CID engines were offered, developing from to and three 409 CID engines ranging from to . Except for a chrome belt line and $100 difference in price there was little exterior difference between the Bel Air and Biscayne version.

RHD Bel Airs continued to be imported into Australia. Some of these cars featured a reversed 1961 Pontiac instrument panel, but others had a mirror image of the more attractive current North American panel. Even more curious was the fact that some of these Bel Airs featured Impala-style triple taillights; the center lens was amber in keeping with Australian legal standards.

===Sixth generation (1965–1970)===
For 1965, the full size Chevrolet was totally restyled, and the cars were stretched to overall, even though the wheelbase remained the same. The new stamped grille had a lower extension below the bumper which was slightly veed. Curved window glass and round taillights mounted high characterized the new styling. The interiors were also redesigned and a very attractive dash resulted. The standard V8 remained the 283 CID model of , but options included two new  CID engines of and and two 409 CID blocks of and .

The Bel Air used a stainless-steel belt and rocker molding, identifying signature on the rear fenders, a glove compartment light and power tailgate on 9-passenger wagons to distinguish itself from the lower-priced Biscayne series.

For 1966, Chevrolet was in its second season of a totally new body change, so mild facelifting sufficed including forward thrusting, blunted front fenders and a revised grille. At the rear, a break with the traditional round taillamps took place. Bel Air and Biscayne featured dual rectangular lamps with back-up lamps built in. Overall length was . The standard six-cylinder engine this year was the larger 250 CID version of . New for the speed set was a  V8 of or . Bel Air was readily distinguishable from Biscayne by its full length body side molding and rear fender Bel Air signatures. All-vinyl interiors were now standard on station wagons while cloth and vinyl trims continued on sedans.
For 1967, full-sized Chevrolets featured a new body with bulging rear fenders, one of this year&#x27;s styling trends, not necessarily appreciated by everyone. Bel Air 2 and 4-door Sedans continued in addition to 6 and 9-passenger wagons. This year Bel Air featured triple taillights unlike Biscayne&#x27;s dual units. Standard engines remained the same as the previous year. Optional engines were a 327 CID V8 of , the 396 CID V8 of ; or the 427 CID V8 of , plus various speed packages.
For 1968, the Full-sized Chevrolets received some changes but were quite similar to the 1967 models, though they had grown one inch to . Chevrolet&#x27;s new grille design bore a strong resemblance to Cadillac&#x27;s, but Bel Air&#x27;s dual round taillight design was strictly Chevrolet. In an unusual move, the taillights were mounted in the bumper. In 1968 the U.S. additional safety features were required in all motor vehicles, bringing about a new standard in car safety. These features included shoulder belts for outboard front-seat occupants and side marker lights. Chevrolets with optional V8s got the engine size, in cubic inches, displayed as part of the front side maker lights.

In addition to the 250 CID Six of , standard engines included the new  V8 of . The Bel Air with the standard 250 Six was capable of a top speed of and at cruising speeds. When powered by the new 307 CID V8, the Bel Air series cars had a top speed of and at cruising speeds.
For the 1969 model year, the Bel Air was redesigned, with a new length, new fender and body lines, and a new front and back end, but continued using the basic 1965 chassis, inner body structure and even the rooflines of pillared two- and four-door sedans. The cars also remained on the wheelbase, but grew to a new length of , while the wagons grew to a new length of 217.7 Engine offerings included a standard 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and 327 V-8, and optional V-8 engines included two 350s of and , a 396 rated at and three 427 V8s of , , and . This was the final year for the Bel Air 2-door sedan and the Bel Air-based station wagon was renamed Townsman, as part of a Chevrolet move to revert to the pre-1962 practice of using different nameplates on station wagons than other models. Three- and four-speed manual transmissions were again offered along with the two-speed Powerglide automatic with the six-cylinder, and 327 and 350 V-8s; and the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic, offered only with the big-block V-8s since its 1965 introduction, was now available with all engines.

For 1970, the Chevrolet line was very little changed and regulated primarily to a redesigned front end. The standard Six was still the 250 of . The standard V8 in full-size Chevrolets was now the  of . Optional V-8 engines included a 350 and 400, with the top offering a  of . The Bel Air series was now a one model 4-door sedan while the station wagon was again sold under the Townsman nameplate.

The 1965-70 GM B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T and the Lada Riva.

===Seventh generation (1971–1975)===

By the late 1960s (with the introduction of the Caprice), the Bel Air and its Biscayne stablemate were primarily marketed to automotive fleet customers. However, the Bel Air remained available to retail customers who sought a basic full-sized car that was better trimmed than the low-line Biscayne. When the Biscayne was discontinued after 1972, the Bel Air was demoted to the low-level model. Bel Airs again used two-segmented taillights as opposed to the triple-segmented lights of higher-level Impala and Caprice models, except in 1972 when all models shared the same triple-segmented lights mounted in the bumper.

A 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual transmission with column shift remained standard equipment through the 1973 model year on sedans with the 350 V8 and automatic standard on wagons—the Turbo Hydramatic automatic had been the sole transmission choice on V-8-powered Bel Airs since the spring of 1971 though the old two-speed Powerglide was still offered with the six-cylinder engine through the 1972 model year. Only about 1,400 cars were built with the inline six in 1973. The engine and manual transmission were shelved by the end of the model year—marking the last full-size body-on-frame American car to offer a manual gearbox. The Bel Air nameplate returned to the station wagon for &#x27;73, as once again Chevrolet dropped separate series names for wagons.

All Bel Air sedans built in 1974–1975 listed a 350 two-barrel V8 engine and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission as standard, with station wagons getting the  four-barrel V8, again with Turbo-Hydramatic standard. The 400 V8 was optional on sedans and the 454 was available on both models.

With the discontinuation of the Bel Air two-door sedan after the 1969 model year, all U.S.-market Bel Airs sold between 1970 and 1975 were four-door sedans or station wagons—the latter carrying the Townsman nameplate from 1969 to 1972 and Bel Air from 1973 to 1975. However, a Bel Air hardtop coupe—based on the Impala Sport Coupe body—was sold in Canada from 1970 to 1975. This body even had a roofline similar to the original &#x27;66-67 Caprice coupe style for 1974–1975.

Most other changes to the Bel Air during its final years were identical to the more expensive Caprice and Impala lines, some of which were mandated by government safety regulations in the U.S. that included front bumpers in 1973 and similar-designed rear bumpers in 1974. The 1975 models had a new roofline and (along with the Impala) grille that was a direct copy of the 1974 Caprice front end. Inside, there were new instrument cluster markings, radio and climate control graphics (the speedometer read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour). Customers could buy their 1975 Bel Air with two new options: an Econominder gauge package (which, in addition to a temperature gauge, included a gauge that monitored fuel economy, due in part to growing demands for fuel economy) and intermittent wipers.

In 1975, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; tested a Bel Air four-door sedan with the 350 V8 engine and Turbo Hydramatic against other U.S.-built full-sized cars of that period including the Pontiac Catalina, Ford LTD and Plymouth Gran Fury. Although the car performed well in its tests and placed second to the Pontiac, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; pointed out the Bel-Air had less noise insulation and a less-comfortable rear seat than its higher-priced siblings, and that a comparably equipped Chevrolet Impala (with additional sound insulation, and upgraded upholstery and seat padding, a $203 premium over the Bel-Air) &quot;would be even closer to the Pontiac in overall quality.&quot; Even so, the magazine stated that—for instance—the Bel-Air was &quot;only slightly noisier than the Pontiac&quot;. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; concluded in its report that prospective buyers should pay the extra $200 or so to upgrade to the costlier Impala, noting advantages such as greater resale value and interior-exterior appointments more comparable to the other tested full-sized vehicles.

The last Bel Airs for the U.S. were manufactured for 1975. For 1976, a lower-trimmed Impala &quot;S&quot; four-door sedan was a one-year offering which had less standard equipment than regular Impalas and functioned as a replacement for the Bel Air.
== Canada-only models ==
=== Bel Air-based Pontiacs ===
From 1954 through 1969, GM Canada produced a unique Bel Air-based Pontiac marketed as the Laurentian. While body panels resembled contemporary U.S. Pontiacs, the Canadian Pontiac Laurentian had the chassis, power train, wheelbase, even the interior (except for the instrument panel), of the Chevrolet Bel Air. These models were exported in SKD kit form in factory right hand drive to right hand drive markets, such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and locally assembled under the Pontiac marque. All RHD export ceased after 1968 at the behest of GM in the United States.

=== Early generations (1970–1976) ===
While the last Bel Air 2-door sedan was available in the United States in 1969, Chevrolet introduced a Canadian market-only two door hardtop, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, from 1970 to 1975. Based on the Impala Sport Coupe, this new model featured Bel Air trim at a lower price than the Impala. Each year through 1975, this model&#x27;s body followed the design of the contemporary Impala Sport Coupe. The 4-door sedan and station wagon continued in production, identical to the U.S. models. For 1976, the Canadian Bel Air Coupe featured the same body as the Impala Custom Coupe, with the large fixed rear quarter window and frameless front door glass.

Unlike the United States, all 1976 Canadian full size Chevys (including the Bel Air) came with steel belted radial tires and an electric rear window defroster as standard equipment.

Although the last Bel Air was produced in 1975 in the U.S., the Canadian big Chevy lineup continued to include the Bel Air for 1976 and beyond in two door, four door and station wagon body styles. The U.S. 1976 Impala line included an &quot;S&quot; model line, consisting of a 4-door sedan, to function as the Bel Air&#x27;s replacement.
===Eighth generation (1977–1981)===
In Canada, Chevrolet retained the Bel Air as its lowest-priced full-size car through the 1981 model year. For 1977, Canadian Bel Airs received the same downsizing as their Impala/Caprice counterparts in the U.S. Body styles offered during this period were a four-door sedan, two-door coupe and station wagon. Reflecting the smaller size of these downsized big cars was a lineup of generally smaller engines for improved fuel economy with Chevy&#x27;s 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder reinstated as standard power in sedans for the first time since 1973, with the 305 V8 available as an option in sedans and standard on wagons. The 350 V8, available in both models, was now the top option as the larger 400 small block and 454 big block V8s were no longer available. Standard equipment on Bel Airs during this period included small hubcaps, cloth-and-vinyl upholstery in sedans or all-vinyl in wagons, cigarette lighter, ashtray, automatic dome light for front doors, full carpeting, Astro Ventilation, Delco Freedom battery, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes and Turbo Hydramatic automatic transmission. Unlike most previous model years and body styles where only two taillights were used per side, the Bel Air shared the Impala&#x27;s rear end triple-taillight setup.

The 1980 Bel Air along with other full-size Chevrolets, was revised with all-new exterior sheet metal, which helped improve aerodynamics and thus fuel economy; the car was also fitted with a new grille, identical to that of the higher-priced Impala; the rear-end triple-taillight setup also continued to be shared with the Impala. Also that year, the engine lineup was revised with the inline six replaced by a new 3.8-liter or 229 cubic-inch V6 based on the small-block V8 as the base engine in sedans. The new base V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans) was a smaller 267 cubic-inch small-block with two-barrel carburetor, while the 305 small-block (optional on all models) got a increase to thanks to the change from a two-barrel to four-barrel carburetor. The 350 V8 was now restricted to police-option vehicles. Another new option for 1980-81 was the Oldsmobile-built 350 Diesel.

With a dramatic downturn in full-size car sales, the Bel Air was dropped after the 1981 model year, as were a number of other low-trim full size cars in the Canadian market including the Pontiac Laurentian, Mercury Marquis Meteor, and the Ford LTD Custom 500.
==2002 concept==

In 2002, a concept Bel Air convertible was shown at the North American International Auto Show. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955–57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy&#x27;s gas cap behind the chrome trim on the back of the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light. It also features the same body on frame hydroforming technology (used in the frame rails of the Corvette and GM&#x27;s midsize sport-utility vehicles) and a sheet metal body, on a wheelbase, and a track. Suspension is short long arm up front and Hotchkiss drive in the rear. It rides on five-spoke aluminum wheels with red line tires and anti lock discs all-round. The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the L52 (Vortec 3500), straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5 L (211 cu in) 20-valve DOHC engine, with a bore of , and a stroke of , that delivers up to and of torque, mated to a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic. A virtual &quot;turbo boost&quot; button on the steering wheel activates the powertrain control module to trigger a more aggressive spark and fueling calibration for maximum horsepower. It also led the 13th Annual Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car. In 2006, it was spotted stripped down in a GM parking lot.
==Australian Bel Airs==
During the 1960s, Bel Air sedans were available in export markets such as Australia, where they featured right-hand drive. Due to Australian regulations requiring amber rear turn signal lamps, these Bel Air sedans featured Impala-style triple taillights during the 1960s. The center lamp was the amber turn signal lamp and the innermost lights were backup lamps. Most of these RHD Bel Airs used a 1961 Pontiac instrument panel.

<text>A standing desk or stand-up desk is a desk conceived for writing, reading or drawing while standing up or while sitting on a high stool.

==History==

Several writers and statesmen wrote standing up: Thomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Vladimir Nabokov. Some of them had specially made desks or lecterns.

==Variations==
Standing desks have been made in many styles and variations. Standing desks may be specialized to suit particular tasks, such as certain variations of the telephone desk and desks for architectural drafting. Some standing desks may only be used while standing while others allow users to sit or stand by adjusting the desk height with an electric motor, hand crank, or counterbalance system. Some desks are also constructed like teacher&#x27;s lecterns, allowing them to be set on top of an existing desk for standing, or removed for sitting. 

While height of most seated desks is standardized, standing desks are made in many different heights ranging from . Ideally the height of a standing desk fits the height of its individual user. With seated desks, adjusting the height relative to the user can be accomplished by adjusting the height of the user&#x27;s chair. However, because users of a standing desk move around more than when seated, using a pedestal to adjust the user&#x27;s height is not practical.

To solve this issue, a standing desk may either be custom-made, to suit the height of the user, or made with adjustable parts. For writing or drafting, the angle or slant of the surface may be adjustable, with a typical drawing table or table à la tronchin. If the desk is made for computer use, the legs may be adjustable. Another option is a platform made to sit on top of a regular seated desk that raises the desk&#x27;s surface to a useful height for standing. Such platforms may be fixed height or adjustable.

A height-adjustable desk or sit-stand desk can be adjusted to both sitting and standing positions; this is purported to be healthier than the sit-only desk. Sit-stand desks may be effective at reducing sitting time during the work day between 30 minutes and two hours per working day but the evidence is low quality.

Some antique standing desks have an open frame with drawers, and a foot rail (similar to those seen at a bar) to reduce back pain. A hinged desktop could be lifted in order to access a small cabinet underneath it so that the user could store or retrieve papers and writing implements without needing to bend over or stand back from the desk.

== Effect on health ==

Low-quality evidence indicates that providing employees with a standing desk option may reduce the length of time some people sit in the first year. This reduction in sitting may decrease with time. It is not clear how standing desks compare to other work-place interventions to reduce the length of time employees are sitting during the work day.

Sit-stand workstations may reduce low back pain among people in the workplace. In a sedentary population, changing posture may reduce the chance of developing low back pain.

There is no international consensus on recommended levels of sitting and standing while at work, and suggested workplace practices vary in different countries.

<doc id="407732" wikidata="Q503335" url="?curid=407732" title="Andres Serrano">
<text>Andres Serrano (born August 15, 1950) is an American photographer and artist. His work, often considered transgressive art, includes photos of corpses and uses feces and bodily fluids. His &quot;Piss Christ&quot; (1987) is an amber-tinged photograph of a crucifix submerged in a glass container of what was purported to be the artist&#x27;s own urine. He also created the artwork for the heavy metal band Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; albums.

==Early life==
Serrano was born in New York City on August 15, 1950. He is from a half Honduran, half Afro-Cuban background, and was raised as a strict Roman Catholic. He studied from 1967 to 1969 at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, yet is considered to be a self-taught photographer. In December 1980, he married artist Julie Ault and they were divorced in 2005. In a 2012 interview, Serrano references Ault as his &quot;first wife&quot; and Irina Movmyga as his current wife. Serrano has said that he is a Christian.

==Career==

He worked as an assistant art director at an advertising firm, before creating his first work in 1983. Photographer Alex Harsley put Serrano&#x27;s work in his first New York City show at his Fourth Street Photo Gallery.

His work has been exhibited in diverse locations around the world including the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, &quot;World without End (2001)&quot;, and a retrospective at the Barbican Arts Centre in London, &quot;Body and soul (2001)&quot;.

His exhibitions have often inspired angry reactions. On October 5, 2007, his group of photographs called &quot;The History of Sex&quot; were on display and several were vandalized at an art gallery in Lund, Sweden by people who were believed to be part of a neo-Nazi group. On April 16, 2011, after two weeks of protests and a campaign of hate mail and abusive phone calls to an art gallery displaying his work, orchestrated by groups of French Catholic fundamentalists, approximately a thousand people marched through the streets of Avignon, to protest outside the gallery. On April 17, 2011, two of his works, &quot;Piss Christ&quot; and &quot;The Church&quot;, were vandalized. The gallery director plans to reopen the museum with the damaged works on show &quot;so people can see what barbarians can do&quot;.

Serrano usually makes large prints of about . He has shot an array of subject matter including portraits of Klansmen, morgue photos, and pictures of burn victims. He went into the New York City Subway with lights and photographic background paper to portray the bedraggled homeless, as well as producing some rather tender but sometimes decidedly kinky portraits of couples. One of these last shows what Adrian Searle of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;a young couple, she with a strap-on dildo, he with a mildly expectant expression.&quot;

Many of Serrano&#x27;s pictures involve bodily fluids in some way—depicting, for example, blood (sometimes menstrual blood), semen (for example, &quot;Blood and Semen II&quot; (1990)) or human breast milk. Within this series are a number of works in which objects are submerged in bodily fluids. Among these is &quot;Piss Christ&quot; (1987), a photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist&#x27;s own urine, which caused great controversy when first exhibited. The work was sold for $277,000 in 1999, which was far beyond the estimated $20,000 – $30,000. Serrano, alongside other artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Barbara Degenevieve, and Merry Alpern, became a figure whom Senator Jesse Helms, and Senator Alphonse D&#x27;Amato, as well as other cultural conservatives, attacked for producing offensive art while others, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, defended him in the name of artistic freedom. (See the American &quot;culture wars&quot; of the 1990s).

Serrano&#x27;s series &quot;Objects of Desire&quot;, from the early 1990s, features close-ups of firearms, photographed at the Slidell, Louisiana home of artist Blake Nelson Boyd. Included is a shot, against a glowing orange background, down the barrel of a loaded .45 revolver (belonging to Boyd&#x27;s grandfather) that was used by Jonas Mekas for the cover of the April–May–June 2007 Anthology Film Archives catalog.

Critical reception of Serrano&#x27;s work has been mixed. In a 1989 &quot;New York Times&quot; review, critic Michael Brenson responded to Serrano&#x27;s series of Cibachrome photographs of iconic objects submerged in bodily fluids: &quot;You cannot consider the content of Mr. Serrano&#x27;s work without considering his attitude toward photography. It is the photograph that breaks through convention, that makes the search possible and that enables the artist to sort out what he likes and does not like in religion and art. It is the photograph that becomes the vessel of transformation and revelation. The photograph then becomes an icon that, for Mr. Serrano, replaces the false icons in his work. The photograph is clean and purified, the reliquary or shrine in which he clearly believes that the word about the body can be stored and spread.&quot; Reviewing later work in 2001, &quot;Guardian&quot; art critic Adrian Searle was not impressed: he found that Serrano&#x27;s photos were &quot;far more about being lurid than anything else... In the end, the show is all surface, and looking for hidden depths does no good.&quot; Continuing his use of biological matter, more recent work of Serrano&#x27;s uses feces as a medium.

Serrano&#x27;s work &quot;Blood and Semen III&quot; is used as the cover of heavy metal band Metallica&#x27;s album &quot;Load&quot;, while &quot;Piss and Blood&quot; is used on &quot;Reload&quot;. Serrano also directed a video for industrial metal group Godflesh, &quot;Crush My Soul&quot;.

In 2008, Serrano&#x27;s piece &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams (White Nigger)&quot; was selected to participate in The Renaissance Society&#x27;s group exhibit, &quot;Black Is, Black Ain&#x27;t&quot;.

Serrano adopted the alter ego &quot;Brutus Faust&quot; to create the full-length album &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot; in July 2010. The album contains covers of classic songs from the 1960s, and original compositions including four songs written by Serrano&#x27;s wife, Irina Movmyga, as well as one song co-written by Serrano, Thad DeBrock, and album producer Steve Messina of New York City–based band Blow Up Hollywood. Coinciding with the release of the album are the videos &quot;Goo Goo Gaga&quot;, &quot;Love Letters&quot;, and &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. &quot;Goo Goo Gaga&quot; consists mostly of black-and-white footage from the 1940s, which makes parallels between the Depression and the present day, with the images of &quot;Brutus&quot; shot by Francesco Carrozzini. &quot;Love Letters&quot; is footage taken from cult director Joe Sarno&#x27;s &quot;Flesh and Lace&quot;. &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; consists entirely of footage Serrano compiled from several short films by John Santerineross. All of these short films were edited by Vincent V.

In 2013, Serrano made a work of art called &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; by collecting 200 signs from homeless people in New York City, usually paying $20 for each sign. He described the work as &quot;a testimony to the homeless men and women who roam the streets in search of food and shelter. It&#x27;s also a chronicle of the times we live in.&quot; Over the course of several months, Serrano engaged with over 85 homeless individuals in Manhattan and photographed them for a series called &quot;Residents of New York&quot;, a site-specific public art exhibition on display from May 19 to June 15, 2014, at the West Fourth Street – Washington Square subway station, on LaGuardia Place (between West 3rd and Bleecker Streets), at Judson Memorial Church, and in phone booths and posters around the city. The installation was produced and developed by More Art, a nonprofit organization based in New York that is dedicated to the development of socially engaged public art projects. Serrano initially photographed homeless individuals in the city in 1990 for a series of studio-style portraits titled &quot;Nomads&quot;. In &quot;Residents of New York&quot;, he removed his signature studio elements, focusing instead on personal connectivity and interaction directly on the streets of New York City, where the homeless live.

<doc id="407734" wikidata="Q143200" url="?curid=407734" title="Mercury(II) chloride">
<text>Mercury(II) chloride (or mercury bichloride, mercury dichloride), historically also known as sulema or corrosive sublimate, is the inorganic chemical compound of mercury and chlorine with the formula HgCl2, used as a laboratory reagent. It is a white crystalline solid and a molecular compound that is very toxic to humans. Once used as a treatment for syphilis, it is no longer used for medicinal purposes because of mercury toxicity and the availability of superior treatments.

==Synthesis==
Mercuric chloride is obtained by the action of chlorine on mercury or on mercury(I) chloride. It can also be produced by the addition of hydrochloric acid to a hot, concentrated solution of mercury(I) compounds such as the nitrate:

:Hg2(NO3)2 + 4 HCl → 2 HgCl2 + 2 H2O + 2 NO2

Heating a mixture of solid mercury(II) sulfate and sodium chloride also affords volatile HgCl2, which can be separated by sublimation.

== Properties ==
Mercuric chloride exists not as a salt composed of discrete ions, but rather is composed of linear triatomic molecules, hence its tendency to sublime. In the crystal, each mercury atom is bonded to two chloride ligands with Hg–Cl distance of 2.38 Å; six more chlorides are more distant at 3.38 Å.

Its solubility increases from 6% at to 36% at .

==Applications==
The main application of mercuric chloride is as a catalyst for the conversion of acetylene to vinyl chloride, the precursor to polyvinyl chloride:
:C2H2 + HCl → CH2=CHCl
For this application, the mercuric chloride is supported on carbon in concentrations of about 5 weight percent. This technology has been eclipsed by the thermal cracking of 1,2-dichloroethane. Other significant applications of mercuric chloride include its use as a depolarizer in batteries and as a reagent in organic synthesis and analytical chemistry (see below).
It is being used in plant tissue culture for surface sterilisation of explants such as leaf or stem nodes.

===As a chemical reagent===
Mercuric chloride is occasionally used to form an amalgam with metals, such as aluminium. Upon treatment with an aqueous solution of mercuric chloride, aluminium strips quickly become covered by a thin layer of the amalgam. Normally, aluminium is protected by a thin layer of oxide, thus making it inert. Amalgamated aluminium exhibits a variety of reactions not observed for aluminium itself. For example, amalgamated aluminum reacts with water generating Al(OH)3 and hydrogen gas. Halocarbons react with amalgamated aluminium in the Barbier reaction. These alkylaluminium compounds are nucleophilic and can be used in a similar fashion to the Grignard reagent. Amalgamated aluminium is also used as a reducing agent in organic synthesis. Zinc is also commonly amalgamated using mercuric chloride.

Mercuric chloride is used to remove dithiane groups attached to a carbonyl in an umpolung reaction. This reaction exploits the high affinity of Hg2+ for anionic sulfur ligands.

Mercuric chloride may be used as a stabilising agent for chemicals and analytical samples. Care must be taken to ensure that detected mercuric chloride does not eclipse the signals of other components in the sample, such as is possible in gas chromatography.

==History==
===Discovery of the mineral acids===
Around 900, the authors of the Arabic writings attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latin: Geber) and the Persian physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi (Latin: Rhazes) were experimenting with sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride), which when it was distilled together with vitriol (hydrated sulfates of various metals) produced hydrogen chloride. It is possible that in one of his experiments, al-Razi stumbled upon a primitive method to produce hydrochloric acid. However, it appears that in most of these early experiments with chloride salts, the gaseous products were discarded, and hydrogen chloride may have been produced many times before it was discovered that it can be put to chemical use.

One of the first such uses of hydrogen chloride was in the synthesis of mercury(II) chloride (corrosive sublimate), whose production from the heating of mercury either with alum and ammonium chloride or with vitriol and sodium chloride was first described in the (&quot;On Alums and Salts&quot;). This eleventh- or twelfth-century Arabic alchemical text is anonymous in most manuscripts, though some manuscripts attribute it to Hermes Trismegistus, and a few falsely attribute it to Abu Bakr al-Razi. It was translated into Hebrew and two times into Latin, with one Latin translation by .

In the process described in the , hydrochloric acid started to form, but it immediately reacted with the mercury to produce mercury(II) chloride. Thirteenth-century Latin alchemists, for whom the was one of the main reference works, were fascinated by the chlorinating properties of mercury(II) chloride, and they eventually discovered that when the metals are eliminated from the process of heating vitriols, alums, and salts, strong mineral acids can directly be distilled.

===Historical use in photography===
Mercury(II) chloride was used as a photographic intensifier to produce positive pictures in the collodion process of the 1800s. When applied to a negative, the mercury(II) chloride whitens and thickens the image, thereby increasing the opacity of the shadows and creating the illusion of a positive image.

===Historical use in preservation===
For the preservation of anthropological and biological specimens during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, objects were dipped in or were painted with a &quot;mercuric solution&quot;. This was done to prevent the specimens&#x27; destruction by moths, mites and mold. Objects in drawers were protected by scattering crystalline mercuric chloride over them. It finds minor use in tanning, and wood was preserved by kyanizing (soaking in mercuric chloride). Mercuric chloride was one of the three chemicals used for railroad tie wood treatment between 1830 and 1856 in Europe and the United States. Limited railroad ties were treated in the United States until there were concerns over lumber shortages in the 1890s. The process was generally abandoned because mercuric chloride was water-soluble and not effective for the long term, as well as being highly poisonous. Furthermore, alternative treatment processes, such as copper sulfate, zinc chloride, and ultimately creosote; were found to be less toxic. Limited kyanizing was used for some railroad ties in the 1890s and early 1900s.

===Historic use in medicine===
Mercuric chloride was a common over-the-counter disinfectant in the early twentieth century, recommended for everything from fighting measles germs to protecting fur coats and exterminating red ants.
A New York physician, Carlin Philips, wrote in 1913 that &quot;it is one of our most popular and effective household antiseptics&quot;, but so corrosive and poisonous that it should only be available by prescription. A group of physicians in Chicago made the same demand later the same month. The product frequently caused accidental poisonings and was used as a suicide method.

It was used to disinfect wounds by Arab physicians in the Middle Ages. It continued to be used by Arab physicians into the twentieth century, until modern medicine deemed it unsafe for use.

Syphilis was frequently treated with mercuric chloride before the advent of antibiotics. It was inhaled, ingested, injected, and applied topically. Both mercuric-chloride treatment for syphilis and poisoning during the course of treatment were so common that the latter&#x27;s symptoms were often confused with those of syphilis. This use of &quot;salts of white mercury&quot; is referred to in the English-language folk song &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot;.

Yaws was treated with mercuric chloride (labeled as Corrosive Sublimate) before the advent of antibiotics. It was applied topically to alleviate ulcerative symptoms. Evidence of this is found in Jack London&#x27;s book &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; in the chapter entitled &quot;The Amateur M.D.&quot;

Between 1901 and 1904 the US Marines Hospital Service quarantined and engaged in an extensive disinfection program of San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown in response to an epidemic of bubonic plague. This program forced the closure of over 14,000 rooms and the eviction of thousands of Chinese residents whose dwellings were rendered toxic and uninhabitable from the disinfection program. Long-term mercury pollution is still a concern for construction workers in Chinatown to this day.

===Historic use in crime and accidental poisonings===
*In 1613, whilst imprisoned in the Tower of London, Thomas Overbury was poisoned with an enema of mercury sublimate. The following trial saw the downfall of the murderers, Robert Carr and his wife, Frances.
*In Volume V of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;Celebrated Crimes&quot;, he recounts the history of Antoine François Desrues, who killed noblewoman Madame de Lamotte with &quot;corrosive sublimate.&quot;
*In 1906 in New York, Richard Tilghman died after mistaking bichloride of mercury tablets for lithium citrate.
*Actor Lon Chaney&#x27;s estranged wife Cleva attempted suicide by swallowing mercuric chloride in 1913. Although the attempt failed, the toxic effects ruined her singing career.
*In a highly publicized case in 1920, mercury bichloride was reported to have caused the death of 25-year-old American silent film star Olive Thomas. While vacationing in France, she accidentally (or perhaps intentionally) ingested the compound, which had been prescribed to her husband Jack Pickford in liquid topical form to treat his syphilis. Thomas died five days later.
*Mercuric chloride was used by Madge Oberholtzer to commit suicide after she was kidnapped, raped and tortured by Ku Klux Klan leader D.C. Stephenson. She died from a combination of mercury poisoning and the staph infection that she suffered when Stephenson bit her during the assault.
*Ana María Cires, a young wife of Uruguayan writer Horacio Quiroga, committed suicide by poison. After a violent fight with Quiroga, she ingested a fatal dose of &quot;sublimado&quot;, or mercury chloride. She endured great agony for eight days before dying on December 14, 1915.
*Ruth L. Truffant&#x27;s death was called a suicide after she died from bichloride of mercury poisoning on 26 April 1914.

==Toxicity==

Mercury dichloride is a highly toxic compound, both acutely and as a cumulative poison. Its toxicity is due not just to its mercury content but also to its corrosive properties, which can cause serious internal damage, including ulcers to the stomach, mouth, and throat, and corrosive damage to the intestines. Mercuric chloride also tends to accumulate in the kidneys, causing severe corrosive damage which can lead to acute kidney failure. However, mercuric chloride, like all inorganic mercury salts, does not cross the blood–brain barrier as readily as organic mercury, although it is known to be a cumulative poison.

Common side effects of acute mercuric chloride poisoning include burning sensations in the mouth and throat, stomach pain, abdominal discomfort, lethargy, vomiting of blood, corrosive bronchitis, severe irritation to the gastrointestinal tract, and kidney failure. Chronic exposure can lead to symptoms more common with mercury poisoning, such as insomnia, delayed reflexes, excessive salivation, bleeding gums, fatigue, tremors, and dental problems.

Acute exposure to large amounts of mercuric chloride can cause death in as little as 24 hours, usually due to acute kidney failure or damage to the gastrointestinal tract. In other cases, victims of acute exposure have taken up to two weeks to die.

<text>Violin Phase is a musical work written by minimalist composer Steve Reich in October 1967.

==Structure==
&quot;Violin Phase&quot; is an example of Reich&#x27;s phasing technique, previously used in &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot;, &quot;Come Out&quot;, &quot;Reed Phase&quot;, and &quot;Piano Phase&quot;, in which the music itself is created not by the instruments but by interactions of temporal variations on an original melody. Music of this kind is generally referred to as process music. It is the third in a series of instrumental compositions (together with &quot;Reed Phase&quot; and &quot;Piano Phase&quot;) in which Reich explored the possibility of phasing in music for a live player with tape accompaniment or, in the case of &quot;Piano Phase&quot;, for just two players .

In &quot;Violin Phase&quot;, two violins are recorded and played back, together at first. They are then made to go slowly out of sync by adding silence to one of the tapes. A new melody is formed by the interaction of the two out of sync instruments and is then accented by a third violin. This process is repeated with variations throughout the rest of the piece.

The most conspicuous difference between a &quot;live&quot; process piece like &quot;Violin Phase&quot; and Reich&#x27;s tape pieces is that the latter consist of &quot;pure phasing&quot;, with a slow and regular rate of change, whereas the live pieces are &quot;stepped&quot;, alternating sections of gradual dephasing with sections of temporary rhythmic stability .

Reich also arranged the piece for electric guitar and tape (or four electric guitars). In this form the work was recorded as &quot;Electric Guitar Phase&quot; by Pat Metheny (1987) and Dominic Frasca (2001).
