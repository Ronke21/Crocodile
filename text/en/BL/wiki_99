<text>Sir Seretse Goitsebeng Maphiri Khama, GCB, KBE (1 July 1921 – 13 July 1980) was a Motswana politician who served as the first President of Botswana, a post he held from 1966 to his death in 1980.

Born into an influential royal family of what was then the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, he was educated abroad in the neighbouring country of South Africa and then in the United Kingdom. While in Britain, he married an Englishwoman named Ruth Williams, a decision opposed by the white-minority government of South Africa and which led to a controversy resulting in the British government making him stay in England in exile so as to not sour U.K.-South African relations.

After the end of his exile, Khama led his country&#x27;s independence movement and the transition from British rule into an independent nation. He founded the Botswana Democratic Party in 1962 and became Prime Minister in 1965. In 1966, Botswana gained independence and Khama was elected as its first president. During his presidency, the country underwent rapid economic and social progress. Khama served as President until his death in 1980, and was succeeded in office by Quett Masire. His son, Ian Khama, served as Botswana&#x27;s fourth president from 2008 to 2018.

==Childhood and education==
Seretse Khama was born in 1921 in Serowe, in what was then the Bechuanaland Protectorate. He was the son of Queen Tebogo and Sekgoma Khama II, the paramount chief of the Bamangwato clan of the Tswana, and the grandson of Khama III, their king. The name Seretse means &quot;the clay that binds&quot;. He was named this to celebrate the recent reconciliation of his father and grandfather; this reconciliation assured Seretse&#x27;s own ascension to the throne with his aged father&#x27;s death in 1925. At the age of 4, Seretse became &quot;kgosi&quot; (king), with his uncle Tshekedi Khama as his regent and guardian.

After being educated in his youth at the Tiger Kloof Educational Institute in South Africa, Khama attended Fort Hare University College there, graduating with a general B.A. in 1944. He travelled to the United Kingdom and studied for a year at Balliol College, Oxford. He next joined the Inner Temple in London in 1946, to study to become a barrister.

==Marriage and exile==
In June 1947, Khama met Ruth Williams, an English clerk at Lloyd&#x27;s of London. After a year of courtship, they married. The interracial marriage sparked a furore, alarming both the Union of South Africa, which had established legal apartheid (racial segregation), and the tribal elders of the Bamangwato, who were angered he had not chosen one of their women.

On being informed of the marriage, Khama&#x27;s uncle Tshekedi Khama demanded his return to Bechuanaland and the annulment of the marriage. Khama did return to Serowe. After a series of &quot;kgotlas&quot; (public meetings), he was reaffirmed by the elders in his role as the &quot;kgosi&quot; in 1949. Ruth Williams Khama, travelling with her new husband, proved similarly popular. Admitting defeat, Tshekedi Khama left the Bamangwato reserve for voluntary exile in the Bakwena reserve while Khama returned to London to complete his studies.

=== Impact on UK-South African relations ===
However, the international ramifications of his marriage were not so easily resolved. Having banned interracial marriage in 1949 under the apartheid system, South Africa&#x27;s government opposed having an interracial couple ruling just across their northern border. The couple was banned from entering South Africa, including Mafeking, which then operated as the administrative capital of Bechuanaland. Since Bechuanaland was then a British protectorate (not a colony), the South African government immediately tried to exert pressure on the UK to have Khama removed from his chieftainship.

The Attlee ministry, Britain&#x27;s Labour-led government, then heavily in debt from World War II, could not afford to lose cheap South African gold and uranium supplies. They also feared that South Africa might take more direct action against Bechuanaland, either economic sanctions or a military incursion. London based Black civil rights leader Billy Strachan, who served as the Joint Secretary of the Seretse Khama Fighting Committee, wrote a letter defending Khama which was then published in the Manchester Guardian. On 28 March 1950, Fenner Brockway, a British Labour MP, forced a debate in the House of Commons on the decision by the Labour government to banish Seretse Khama from his homeland, while withholding recognition of him as the Chief of the Bamangwato people, because he had married Ruth Williams.

The British government conducted a judicial enquiry into Khama&#x27;s fitness for the chieftainship. The investigation did not disapprove of interracial marriage as such and reported that he was eminently fit to rule the Bamangwato, &quot;but for his unfortunate marriage&quot;, which prevented good relations with neighbouring apartheid regimes. The government ordered that the report be suppressed (it would remain so for thirty years) and exiled Khama and his wife from Bechuanaland in 1951.

==Return to politics==
The British government&#x27;s decision concerning Khama immediately proved controversial, both in Britain and Bechuanaland. Several British newspapers made calls for the resignation of Lord Salisbury, the minister responsible for the decision. A deputation of six Bamangwato travelled to London to see the exiled Khama and Lord Salisbury, in an echo of the 1895 deputation of three Batswana &quot;kgosis&quot; to Queen Victoria, but met with no success. However, when ordered by the British High Commission to find a suitable candidate to replace Khama, the Bamangwato rebuffed the order.

In 1956, both Khama and his wife were allowed to return to Bechuanaland as private citizens, after he had renounced the tribal throne. Khama began an unsuccessful stint as a cattle rancher. He became involved in local politics, being elected to the tribal council in 1957 as its secretary. In the 1961 Birthday Honours, he was recognised for his services as tribal secretary by his appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

In 1961, Khama returned to politics by founding the Bechuanaland Democratic Party. His exile gave him an increased credibility with an independence-minded electorate, and the BDP swept aside its Socialist and Pan-Africanist rivals to dominate the 1965 elections. As Prime Minister of Bechuanaland, Khama continued to push for Botswana&#x27;s independence while based in the newly established capital of Gaborone. A 1965 constitution delineated a new Botswana government, and on 30 September 1966, Botswana gained its independence. As prescribed by the new constitution, Khama became its first President. Ten days prior to this, Elizabeth II had promoted Khama within the Order of the British Empire, appointing him a Knight Commander (KBE).

==Presidency==
At the time of its independence in 1966, Botswana was the world&#x27;s third-poorest country, poorer than most other African countries. Its infrastructure was minimal, with only of paved roads; and few of its people had formal education, with only 22 university graduates and 100 secondary school graduates.

Khama set out on a vigorous economic programme intended to transform the nation into an export-based economy, built around beef, copper and diamonds. The 1967 discovery of Orapa&#x27;s diamond deposits aided this programme.

Khama instituted strong measures against corruption. His administration adopted free-market-friendly policies to foster economic development. Khama promised low and stable taxes to mining companies, liberalized trade, and increased personal freedoms. He maintained low marginal income tax rates to deter tax evasion and corruption. He upheld liberal democracy and non-racism in the midst of a region embroiled in civil war, racial enmity and corruption.

The small public service was transformed into an efficient and relatively corruption-free bureaucracy with workers hired based on merit. Calls to immediately &quot;indigenize&quot; the bureaucracy were resisted, and the government retained foreign expatriates working in the bureaucracy until suitably qualified locals could be found to replace them. Khama and his people also drew on international advisers and consultants. Mining companies were encouraged to search the country for more resources, leading to the discovery of additional copper, nickel, and coal deposits.

Between 1960 and 1980 Botswana had the fastest-growing economy in the world. This growth was primarily driven by mining, and the government acted to gain a greater percentage of its revenue. The customs union between Botswana and South Africa was renegotiated in 1969, with the government of Botswana securing for itself a greater share of the mining revenue. In 1975, after it had become clear how productive these mines were, the government again renegotiated the diamond mining agreement to guarantee itself 50% of the revenues. By the mid-1970s, Botswana had a budget surplus.

The government used these revenues to heavily invest in the expansion of infrastructure, health care, and the education system, resulting in further economic development. In particular, the government invested in other sources of economic growth. The cattle industry was heavily subsidised, with the government nationalising the country&#x27;s lone slaughterhouse and building two more, heavily subsidising veterinary services, vaccines, and cattle fence construction. It set up the Botswana Meat Commission as the sole seller of beef in the country, setting prices and selling beef to regional and international markets. With Khama&#x27;s direct intervention, it negotiated a lucrative trade deal with the European Economic Community, gaining prices far above world levels. Khama also spearheaded a national fundraising campaign to build Botswana&#x27;s first institute of higher education, which resulted in the establishment of the University of Botswana in 1982, after Khama&#x27;s death.

The Botswana Development Corporation was established in 1970 to attract foreign investment in crop agriculture, tourism, and the secondary sector. In 1976, the Botswana pula was introduced, replacing the South African rand as the national currency.

Due to Khama&#x27;s dedication to development, very little was spent on defence, and a small military police force was initially formed in place of an army. However, following repeated incursions by South African and Rhodesian forces, the Botswana Defence Force was formed in 1977 as a small professional military. On the foreign policy front, Khama was careful politically and did not allow militant groups to operate from within Botswana. According to Richard Dale,

 Shortly before his death, Khama played major roles in negotiating the end of the Rhodesian civil war and the resulting creation and independence of Zimbabwe, and the creation of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference.

Khama was reelected three times by virtue of the BDP easily winning the 1969, 1974 and 1979 elections. In Botswana, candidates for the National Assembly declare whom they endorse for president when they lodge their nomination papers, and the presidential candidate with a majority of endorsements is automatically elected. He governed with very large majorities for his entire tenure, never facing more than seven opposition MPs.

==Death==
For a number of years leading up to his death, Khama&#x27;s health deteriorated. He suffered from heart and kidney ailments. In 1960 he had been diagnosed with diabetes. In 1976, he underwent a heart operation in Johannesburg to install a pacemaker. From then on, he frequently flew to London for medical treatment. In June 1980, while receiving treatment in London, Khama was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. He returned home after it was determined that no cure was possible.

Khama died in his sleep on 13 July 1980 in the presence of his wife in Botswana. Following his death, Khama was succeeded by Vice President Quett Masire. Forty thousand people paid their respects to Khama as his body lay in state in Gaborone. He was buried in the Royal Cemetery on a hill in Serowe, Central District.

==Legacy==

Twenty-eight years after Khama&#x27;s death, his son Ian succeeded Festus Mogae as the fourth president of Botswana; in the 2009 general election he won a landslide victory. That year, his younger son, Tshekedi Khama II, was elected as a parliamentarian from Serowe North West. Ian Khama left office in 2018.

Sir Seretse Khama International Airport, Botswana&#x27;s main airport, was named after Khama and opened in 1984.

The 2016 film &quot;A United Kingdom&quot;, directed by Amma Asante and written by Guy Hibbert, told the story of the controversies that surrounded Khama&#x27;s marriage. It starred David Oyelowo as Khama and Rosamund Pike as Ruth Williams. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that Sir Seretse&#x27;s relationship with Lady Khama influenced the writers of the Oscar-winning film &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, which starred Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier.

Khama is frequently referenced in &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot; books by Alexander McCall Smith. Mma Ramotswe, the series&#x27; protagonist, greatly admires him, compares him with Nelson Mandela and very much regrets the fact of his not being so well known internationally.

<text>Mirza Muhammad Mu&#x27;azzam (14 October 1643 – 27 February 1712), commonly known as Bahadur Shah I and Shah Alam I, was the eighth Mughal Emperor from 1707 to 1712. He was the second son of the sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who he conspired to overthrow in his youth. He was also the governor of the imperial provinces of Agra, Kabul and Lahore and had to face revolts of Rajputs and Sikhs.

After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death, Muhammad Azam Shah, his third son by his chief consort declared himself successor, but was shortly defeated in one of the largest battles of India, the Battle of Jajau and overthrown by Bahadur Shah. During the reign of Bahadur Shah, the Rajput kingdoms of Jodhpur and Amber were annexed again after they had declared independence a few years prior.

Bahadur Shah also sparked an Islamic controversy in the &quot;khutba&quot; by inserting the declaration of Ali as &quot;wali&quot;. His reign was disturbed by several rebellions, the Sikhs under the leadership of Banda Singh Bahadur, Rajputs under Durgadas Rathore and a Mughal prince Kam Bakhsh but all of them were successfully quelled.

==Early life==

Bahadur Shah was born as Muhammad Mu&#x27;azzam on 14 October 1643 in Burhanpur. He was the eldest son of prince Muhi al-Din Muhammad, later Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, by his Pothwari wife Nawab Bai, who belonged to the Jarral tribe.

===Shah Jahan&#x27;s reign===
During his grandfather&#x27;s reign, Shah Jahan, Mu&#x27;azzam was appointed vizer of Lahore from 1653 to 1659. In 1663, he replaced Shaista Khan as the governor of Deccan in 1663. Shivaji raided the outskirts of Mughal Deccan&#x27;s capital Aurangabad while the indolent Mu&#x27;azzam did little to prevent it. Enraged at this, Aurangzeb sent his most able commander Raja Jai Singh to defeat Shivaji and here the historic Treaty of Purandar was signed.

===Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign===
After Raja Jai Singh I defeated Shivaji at Purandar, Mu&#x27;azzam was given charge of the Deccan in May 1667 and was assisted by Maharaja Jaswant Singh.

In 1670, Mu&#x27;azzam organised an insurgency to overthrow Aurangzeb and proclaim himself the Mughal emperor. This plan may have been hatched at the instigation of the Marathas, and Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s own inclinations and sincerity are difficult to gauge. Aurangzeb learned of the plot and sent Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s mother, Begum Nawab Bai, to dissuade him from rebellion. Mu&#x27;azzam returned to the Mughal court, where he spent the next several years under Aurangzeb&#x27;s supervision. However, Mu&#x27;azzam again nearly revolted in 1680 over Aurangzeb&#x27;s scorched earth policy during his suppression of Rajput rebellions. Once again, Aurangzeb dissuaded Mu&#x27;azzam with gentleness and watched him with greater vigilance.

For the next seven years, from 1681 to 1687, historian Munis Faruqui describes Mu&#x27;azzam as a &quot;grudgingly obedient son&quot;.

====Rebellion against Aurangzeb====
In 1681, Mu&#x27;azzam was sent back by Aurangzeb to the Deccan to cut off the retreat of his rebellious half-brother Sultan Muhammad Akbar. According to Faruqui, Mu&#x27;azzam deliberately failed in his mission. In 1683, after being ordered by Aurangzeb to march to the Konkan region to prevent the still rebellious Muhammad Akbar from fleeing the country, but again Mu&#x27;azzam failed to achieve the assigned goal. In 1687, Aurangzeb ordered Mu&#x27;azzam to march against the sultanate of Golconda. Within weeks, the emperor&#x27;s spies intercepted treasonous messages exchanged between Mu&#x27;azzam and Abul Hasan, the ruler of Golconda. This was something which could not be mistaken for incompetence; it was clearly treason. Aurangzeb imprisoned Mu&#x27;azzam and his sons, executed his closest followers, ordered his harem &quot;shipped off to faraway Delhi&quot;, and dispersed his staff. Aurangzeb forbade Mu&#x27;azzam to cut his nails or hair for six months, gave orders depriving him of &quot;good food, or cold water.&quot; He was not to meet anybody without his father&#x27;s prior consent.

==== Rehabilitation ====
Around 1694, Aurangzeb rehabilitated Mu&#x27;azzam and allowed him &quot;to rebuild his household&quot;, rehiring some of his officials. Aurangzeb continued to spy on his son, appointing his men to Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s household, sending informants to his harem and choosing his representatives at the imperial court. Mu&#x27;azzam and his sons were transferred from the Deccan to north India, and were forbidden to lead military expeditions in the Deccan for the rest of Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign. In 1695, Aurangzeb sent Mu&#x27;azzam to the Punjab to fight the chieftains and subdue a rebellion by the Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. Although the commander imposed &quot;heavy taxation&quot; on the &quot;rajas&quot;, he thought it necessary to leave the Sikhs undisturbed in their fortified city of Anandpur and refused to wage war against them out of &quot;genuine respect&quot; for their religion. That year Mu&#x27;azzam was appointed governor of Akbarabad, and in 1696 he was transferred to Lahore. After the death of Amin Khan, the governor of Kabul he assumed that position in 1699, holding it until his father&#x27;s death in 1707.

==Emperorship==
=== War of succession ===
Aurangzeb died in 1707, without appointing a crown prince or a designated successor. Mu&#x27;azzam was governor of Kabul and his younger half-brothers Muhammad Kam Bakhsh and Muhammad Azam Shah were the governors of the Deccan and Gujarat respectively. All three sons intended to win the crown, and Kam Bakhsh began minting coins in his name. Mu&#x27;azzam defeated Azam Shah at the Battle of Jajau in June 1707. Azam Shah and his son Ali Tabar would be killed in the battle. Mu&#x27;azzam ascended the Mughal throne at age 64 on 19 June 1707, with the title of Bahadur Shah I. He then marched to the Deccan and defeated and killed Kam Bakhsh in a battle near Hyderabad in January 1708.

=== Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s uprising ===
Muhammad Kam Bakhsh, marched with his soldiers to Bijapur in March 1707. On the news of Aurangzeb&#x27;s death spread through the city, the city&#x27;s governor, Sayyid Niyaz Khan surrendered the Bijapur Fort to him without a fight. Ascending the throne of Bijapur, Kam Bakhsh made Ahsan Khan, who served in the army as the &quot;bakshi&quot; (general of the armed forces), and made his advisor Taqarrub Khan as chief minister and gave himself the title of Padshah Kam Bakhsh-i-Dinpanah (Emperor Kam Bakhsh, Protector of Faith). He then conquered Kulbarga and Wakinkhera.A rivalry soon broke out between Taqarrub Khan and Ahsan Khan. Ahsan Khan had developed a marketplace in Bijapur where, without permission from Kam Bakhsh, he did not tax the shops. Taqarrub Khan reported it to Kam Bakhsh, who ordered the practise stopped. In May 1707, Kam Bakhsh sent Ahsan Khan to conquer the states of Golkonda and Hyderabad. Although the king of Golconda refused to surrender, Subahdar of Hyderabad, Rustam Dil Khan did so.

Taqarrub Khan made a conspiracy to eliminate Ahsan Khan, alleging that meetings of Ahsan Khan, Saif Khan (Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s archery teacher), Arsan Khan, Ahmad Khan, Nasir Khan and Rustam Dil Khan (all of them Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s former teachers and members of the then court) to discuss public business were a conspiracy to assassinate Kam Bakhsh &quot;while on his way to the Friday prayer at the great mosque&quot;. After informing Kam Bakhsh of the matter, he invited Rustam Dil Khan for dinner; arrested him en route. Rustam Dil Khan was killed by being crushed under the feet of an elephant. Saif Khan&#x27;s hands were amputated, and Arshad Khan&#x27;s tongue was cut off. Ahsan Khan ignored warnings by close friends that Kam Bakhsh would arrest him, and would be imprisoned and his properties seized. In April 1708, Bahadur Shah sent an envoy Maktabar Khan to Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s court. When Taqarrub Khan told Kam Bakhsh that Maktabar Khan intended to dethrone him, Kam Bakhsh invited the envoy and his entourage to a feast and executed them.

==== March to the Deccan ====
In May 1708, Bahadur Shah wrote a letter to Kam Bakhsh in which he warned his brother against proclaiming himself an independent sovereign and began a journey to the Tomb of Aurangzeb to pay his respects to his father. Kam Bakhsh thanked him in a letter, &quot;without either explaining or justifying [his actions]&quot;.

Bahadur Shah reached Hyderabad on 28 June 1708, where he learned that Kam Bakhsh had attacked Machhlibandar to seize over three million rupees&#x27; worth of treasure hidden in its fort. The &quot;subahdar&quot; of the province, Jan Sipar Khan, refused to hand over the money. Enraged, Kam Bakhsh confiscated his properties and ordered the recruitment of four thousand soldiers for the attack. In July, the garrison at the Gulbarga declared their independence and garrison leader Daler Khan Bijapuri &quot;reported his desertion from Kam Bakhsh&quot;. On 5 November 1708 Bahadur Shah&#x27;s camp reached Bidar, north of Hyderabad. Historian William Irvine wrote that as his &quot;camp drew nearer desertions from Kam Bakhsh became more and more frequent&quot;. On 1 November, Kam Bakhsh captured Pam Naik&#x27;s (&quot;zamindar&quot;, the landlord of Wakinkhera) holdings after Naik abandoned his army.

According to Irvine, more soldiers Kam Bakhsh deserted as the emperor&#x27;s group neared. When Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s general told him that his failure to pay his soldiers was the reason for their desertion, he replied: &quot;What need have I of enlisting them? My trust is in God, and whatever is best will happen.&quot;

Thinking that Kam Bakhsh might flee to Persia, Bahadur Shah ordered his prime minister Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung to negotiate with Thomas Pitt, the governor of the Madras Presidency, to pay him 200,000 rupees for Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s capture. On 20 December, Kam Bakhsh was reported to have a cavalry of 2,500 and an infantry of 5,000.

==== Defeat and death of Kam Bakhsh ====
On 20 December 1708, Bahadur Shah marched towards Talab-i-Mir Jumla, on the outskirts of Hyderabad, with &quot;three hundred camels, [and] twenty thousand rockets&quot; for war with Kam Baksh. His son Jahandar Shah, was made the commander of the advance guard, but later replaced Khan Zaman. Bahadur Shah reached Hyderabad on 12 January 1709, and prepared his troops. Although Kam Bakhsh had little money and few soldiers left, the royal astrologer had predicted that he would &quot;miraculously&quot; win the battle.

At sunrise the following day, the Mughal army charged towards Kam Bakhsh. His 15,000 troops were divided into two bodies: one led by Mumin Khan, assisted by Rafi-ush-Shan and Jahan Shah, and the second under Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung. Two hours later Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s camp was surrounded, and Zulfiqar Khan impatiently attacked him with his &quot;small force&quot;.

With his soldiers outnumbered and unable to resist the attack, Kam Bakhsh joined the battle and shot two quivers of arrows at his opponents. According to Irvine, when he was &quot;weakened by loss of blood&quot;, Bahadur Shah took him and his son Bariqullah prisoner. A dispute arose between Mumin Khan and Zulfikar Khan Nusrat Jung over who had captured them, with Rafi-us-Shan ruling in favour of the latter. Kam Bakhsh was brought by palanquin to the emperor&#x27;s camp, where he died the next morning.

=== Annexations ===
==== Amber ====

After ascending the throne, Bahadur Shah made plans to annex Rajput kingdoms who declared independence after Aurangzeb&#x27;s death. On 10 November, he began his march to Kingdom of Amber in Rajputana. He visited the Tomb of Salim Chishti in Fatehpur Sikri on 21 November. In the meantime, Bahadur Shah&#x27;s aide Mihrab Khan was ordered to take possession of Jodhpur. Bahadur Shah reached Amber on 20 January 1708. Though the monarch of the kingdom was Sawai Jai Singh, his brother Bijai Singh resented his rule. Bahadur Shah ruled that because of the dispute, the region would become part of the Mughal empire and the city was renamed as Islamabad. Jai Singh&#x27;s goods and properties were confiscated on the pretext that he supported Bahadur Shah&#x27;s brother Azam Shah during the succession war. Bijai Singh was made the governor of Amber on 30 April 1708. Bahadur Shah gave him the title of &quot;Mirza Rajah&quot;, and he received gifts valued at 100,000 rupees. Amber passed into Mughal hands without a war.

==== Jodhpur ====
Jaswant Singh, the leader of the Rathore dynasty, was the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Marwar during Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign. During the war of succession after Shah Jahan, he had backed Aurangzeb&#x27;s older brother Dara Shikoh. After Dara Shikoh&#x27;s defeat and execution by Aurangzeb, Jaswant Singh was pardoned and appointed the governor of Kabul. He died on 18 December 1678, with no male children but two pregnant wives.

After the birth of Ajit Singh to Rani Jadav Jaskumvar, Aurangzeb ordered he be brought to Delhi along with Jaswant Singh&#x27;s widows. Aurangzeb intended to directly annex Marwar into the Mughal empire. The Rajput general Durgadas Rathore, who had ambitions of retaking Jodhpur from the Mughals, fought a war to prevent Aurangzeb getting hold of Ajit Singh; he tore through Delhi with his men and successfully escorted the Prince and the widows to Jodhpur. After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death, during Azam Shah&#x27;s brief reign, Ajit Singh marched to Jodhpur and took it from Mughal rule.

In Amber, Bahadur Shah announced his intention to march to Jodhpur when Mihrab Khan defeated Ajit Singh at Mairtha, and he reached the town on 21 February 1708. His men were sent to bring Ajit Singh to the city for an interview, where Ajit Singh received &quot;special robes of honour&quot; and a jewelled scarf. Bahadur Shah then headed towards Ajmer and reached the city on 24 March, where he visited the Dargah Sharif.

==== Udaipur ====
The Kingdom of Mewar, under Maharana Amar Singh I, had submitted to Mughal rule in 1615, during Jahangir&#x27;s reign. However, the Sisodias declared their independence after Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707.

While in Jodhpur, Bahadur Shah got the news that the &quot;Maharana&quot; Amar Singh II had fled Udaipur to hide in the hills. His messengers gave him the message that Amar Singh got &quot;afraid&quot; by the happenings in Amber and Jodhpur and thought that his kingdom would also be annexed by the Mughals once again. According to the &quot;Bahadur Shah Nama&quot; chronicle, because of this incident the emperor called Amar Singh an &quot;unbeliever&quot;. Bahadur Shah waged war against the king until Muhammad Kam Bakhsh&#x27;s insurgency diverted him southward.

===Rajput Rebellion===

While the emperor was on his way to Deccan to punish Muhammad Kam Bakhsh, the three Rajput Raja&#x27;s of Amber, Udaipur and Jodhpur made a joint resistance to the Mughals. The Rajputs first expelled the Mughal commandants of Jodhpur and Hindaun-Bayana and recovered Amber by a night attack. They next killed Sayyid Hussain Khan Barha, the commandant of Mewat and many other officers (September, 1708). The emperor, then in the Deccan had to patch up a truce by restoring Ajit Singh and Jai Singh to the Mughal service.

===Sikh rebellion===
Guru Gobind Singh began negotiations with Aurangzeb in 1705 and left for the Deccan in 1706 to meet him in person when he agreed to concilation. However, Aurangzeb died before he could reach him and Gobind Singh decided to meet Bahadur Shah instead. The guru arrived at Agra in July 1707 and was honored by the emperor. Gobind Singh accompanied Bahadur Shah when he left for a campaign in Rajasthan in November 1707 and stayed with the imperial camp for ten months, before accompanying him to Deccan in hopes that he would soon attend to the matters of Punjab. Gobind Singh however died in October 1708 while the emperor was travelling to Hyderabad. He had left for Nanded a few months before his death, apparently having grown disillusioned with Bahadur Shah, and told Banda Bahadur to prepare the &quot;Khalsa&quot; for a revolt.

Bahadur Shah, upon hearing of the uprising led by Banda Bahadur in Punjab only a year after Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s death, left the Deccan for the north. The Sikhs started moving cautiously towards Delhi and entered the &quot;sarkar&quot; in Khanda where they started preparation for a military campaign. They stormed Sonipat and Samana in November 1709 and defeated the &quot;faujdar&quot; in the Battle of Sonipat and Battle of Samana whilst sacking the town. Before taking Sirhind in the Battle of Chappar Chiri, Banda Bahadur captured Shahabad, Sadhaura and Banur. Before Bahadur Shah&#x27;s arrival in December, Banda Bahadur had captured the &quot;sarkar&quot; of Sirhind, several &quot;parganas&quot; of the &quot;sarkar&quot; of Hissar, and had invaded the &quot;sarkar&quot; of Saharanpur.

After the victory at Sirhind, the Sikhs turned towards the Gangetic Doab. With trouble arising in a pargana of Deoband and Sikh converts complaining of imprisonment and persecution by the &quot;faujdar&quot; Jalal Khan, Banda Bahadur marched on Saharanpur on the way to Jalalabad. The &quot;faujdar&quot; of Saharanpur, Ali Hamid Khan, fled to Delhi while the Sikhs defeated the defenders and reduced the town. They next attacked Behat whose &quot;Pirzadas&quot; were notorious for anti-Hindu acts, especially slaughtering cows. The town was sacked and the Pirzadas killed. The Sikhs then marched to Jalalabad and Banda asked Jalal Khan Orakzai to surrender and release the Sikh prisoners, but the &quot;faujdar&quot; refused. They came to Nanauta on 21 July 1710 and defeated the local Sheikhzadas, who had put up a gallant defence but ultimately submitted to Banda Bahadur&#x27;s superior forces. The Sikhs then besieged Jalalabad but withdrew to Jalandhar Doab due to the flooding in the Krishna River.

The Sikhs tried to oust the Mughals from the regions of Jalandhar and Amritsar. They called on Shamas Khan, the &quot;Faujdar&quot; of Jalandhar, to effect reforms and hand over the treasury. Shamas Khan pretended submission and later started attacking them. He appealed to Muslims in name of religion and declared a &quot;jihad&quot; against the Sikhs. The Sikhs, being outnumbered, withdrew to Rahon and captured its fort after defeating the Mughals in the Battle of Rahon on 12 October 1710. At Amritsar, about 8,000 Sikhs assembled and captured Majha and Riarki of central Punjab. They also attacked Lahore, where the &quot;mullahs&quot; declared a jihad against them with the governor not confronting the Sikhs. The &quot;ghazis&quot; were defeated by the Sikhs.

Sikhs used their newly established power to remove Mughal officials and replace them with Sikhs. Banda made his capital at Lohgarh, where he established a mint. He abolished the mughal zamindari system and gave the cultivators proprietorship of their own land.

====Efforts at suppression====
Bahadur Shah signed peace treaties with Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, and Man Singh of Amber before turning to fight Banda Bahadur. He also ordered the Nawab of Awadh Asaf-ud-Daula, provincial governor Khan-i-Durrani, Moradabad &quot;faujdar&quot; Muhammad Amin Khan Chin, Delhi &quot;subahdar&quot; Asad Khan and Jammu &quot;faujdar&quot; Wazid Khan to accompany him into battle.

Bahadur Shah left Ajmer for the Punjab on 17 June 1710, mobilising groups opposed to Banda Bahadur on the way. When he learned about Bahadur Shah&#x27;s plans, Banda Bahadur unsuccessfully appealed to Ajit Singh and Man Singh for help. In the meantime, Bahadur Shah had reoccupied Sonipat, Kaithal and Panipat en route. In October, his commander &quot;Khanzada&quot; Nawab Feroz Khan wrote to him that he had &quot;chopped three hundred heads of rebels&quot;; Khan sent them to the emperor, who displayed them mounted on spears.

On 1 November 1710 the emperor reached the city of Karnal, where Mughal cartographer Rustam Dil Khan gave him a map of Thanesar and Sirhind. Six days later, a small group of Sikhs were defeated at Mewati and Banswal. The city of Sirhind fell to the Mughals on 7 December; its besieger, general Muhammad Amin Khan Turani, gave the emperor a golden key ring commemorating the victory. After failing to recapture Sadaura, Bahadur Shah marched towards Lohgarh, where Banda Bahadur was staying. On 30 November he attacked the Lohgarh fort, capturing three guns, matchlocks and three trenches from the rebels. With little ammunition left, Banda Bahadur and a &quot;few hundred of his followers fled&quot;. His follower, Gulab Singh (who was &quot;dressed like&quot; Bahadur), entered the fight and was killed. The emperor issued orders to the rulers of Kumaon and Srinagar that if Bahadur tried to enter their province, he should be &quot;sent to the Emperor&quot;.

Suspecting that Banda Bahadur was allied with Bhup Prakash, the king of Nahan, the emperor had Bhup Prakash imprisoned in January 1711; his mother begged in vain for his release. After she sent him captured followers of Bahadur, he ordered that &quot;ornaments worth 100,000 rupees should be manufactured&quot; for her, and Prakash was released a month later. Shukan Khan Bahadur and Himmet Diler Khan were sent to Lahore to end Banda Bahadur&#x27;s rebellion, and their unsuccessful attempt was reinforced by a garrison of five thousand soldiers. Bahadur Shah also pressed Rustam Dil Khan and Muhammad Amin Khan to join them.

Banda Bahadur was staying in Alhalab, from Lahore. When Mughal workers came to repair a bridge in the village, his followers disinformed them that he was preparing to attack Delhi via Ajmer. Banda Bahadur received soldiers from village ruler Ram Chand for his march against the Mughals, and besieged Fatehabad in April 1711. After learning from messenger Rustan Jung that he had crossed the Ravi River, the emperor attacked with artillery led by Isa Khan. In the July battle, Banda Bahadur was defeated and fled to the Jammu hills. Forces led by Isa Khan Main and Muhammad Amin Khan followed but failed to capture him. The emperor issued an edict to the &quot;zamindar&quot;s (landlord) of Jammu to take the Sikh captive if possible.

Banda Bahadur was attacked by Muhammad Amin Khan at the river Satluj, escaping to the Garhwal hills. Finding him &quot;invincible&quot;, the emperor went to Ajit Singh and Jai Singh for help. In October 1711, a joint Mughal-Rajput force marched towards Sadaura. Bahadur escaped the ensuing siege, this time taking refuge at Kulu in present-day Himachal Pradesh.

=== &quot;Khutba&quot; controversy ===
After ascending the throne, emperor Bahadur Shah converted to Shia Islam and altered the public prayer (or &quot;khutba&quot;) for the monarch said every Friday by giving the title &quot;wali&quot; to Ali, the fourth caliph and the first Shi&#x27;a Imam. Because of this, the citizens of Lahore resented reciting the &quot;khutba&quot;.

To solve the problem, Bahadur Shah went to Lahore in September 1711 and had discussions with Haji Yar Muhammad, Muhammad Murad and &quot;other well-known men&quot;. At their meeting, he read &quot;books of authority&quot; to justify using the word &quot;wasi&quot;. He had a heated argument with Yar Muhammad, saying that martyrdom by a king was the only thing he wanted. Yar Muhammad (supported by the emperor&#x27;s son, Azim-ush-Shan) recruited troops against Shah, but no war was fought. He held the &quot;khatib&quot; (chief reciter) at the Badshahi Mosque responsible for the matter, and had him arrested. On 2 October, although the army was deployed at the mosque the old &quot;khutba&quot; (which did not call Ali &quot;wasi&quot;) was read.

==Death==

According to historian William Irvine, the emperor was in Lahore in January 1712 when his &quot;health failed&quot;. On 24 February he made his final public appearance, and died during the night of 27–28 February; according to Mughal noble Kamwar Khan, of &quot;enlargement of the spleen&quot;. On 11 April, his body was sent to Delhi under the supervision of his widow Mihr-Parwar and Chin Qilich Khan. He was buried on 15 May in the courtyard of the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in Mehrauli, which he built near the &quot;dargah&quot; of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki.

He was succeeded by his son Jahandar Shah who ruled until 1713.

==Coins==
Emperor Bahadur Shah issued gold, silver and copper coins, although his predecessors&#x27; coins were also used to pay government officials and in commerce. Copper coins from Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign were re-minted with his name. Unlike the other Mughal emperors, his coins did not use his name in a couplet; poet Danishmand Khan composed two lines for the coins, but they were not approved.

== Personal life ==

=== Name, title and lineage ===

His full name, including his titles, was &quot;Abul-nasr Sayyid Qutb-ud-din Muhammad Shah Alam Bahadur Shah Badshah&quot;. After his death, contemporary historians began calling him &quot;Khuld-Manzil&quot; (Departed to Paradise). He was the only Mughal emperor to have the title Sayyid, used by descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. According to William Irvine, his maternal grandfather was Raja Tajuddin Khan Jarral (whose daughter, Nawab Bai, married Aurangzeb).

<doc id="410401" wikidata="Q2006818" url="?curid=410401" title="Cramp">
<text>A cramp is a sudden, involuntary, painful skeletal muscle contraction or overshortening associated with electrical activity; while generally temporary and non-damaging, they can cause significant pain and a paralysis-like immobility of the affected muscle. A cramp usually goes away on its own over several seconds or (sometimes) minutes. Cramps are common and tend to occur at rest, usually at night (nocturnal leg cramps). They are also often associated with pregnancy, physical exercise or overexertion, and age (common in older adults); in such cases, cramps are called idiopathic because there is no underlying pathology. In addition to those benign conditions cramps are also associated with many pathological conditions.

Cramp definition is narrower than the definition of muscle spasm: spasms include any involuntary abnormal muscle contractions, while cramps are sustained and painful. True cramps can be distinguished from other cramp-like conditions. Cramps are different from muscle contracture, which is also painful and involuntary, but which is electrically silent. The main distinguishing features of cramps from dystonia are suddenness with acute onset of pain, involvement of only one muscle, and spontaneous resolution of cramps or their resolution after stretching the affected muscle. Restless leg syndrome is not considered the same as muscle cramps and should not be confused with rest cramps.

==Causes==
Skeletal muscle cramps may be caused by muscle fatigue or a lack of electrolytes such as sodium (a condition called hyponatremia), potassium (called hypokalemia), or magnesium (called hypomagnesemia). Some skeletal muscle cramps do not have a known cause. Motor neuron disorders (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), metabolic disorders (e.g., liver failure), some medications (e.g., diuretics and inhaled beta‐agonists), and haemodialysis may also cause muscle cramps.

Causes of cramping include hyperflexion, hypoxia, exposure to large changes in temperature, dehydration, or low blood salt. Muscle cramps can also be a symptom or complication of pregnancy; kidney disease; thyroid disease; hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcaemia (as conditions); restless legs syndrome; varicose veins; and multiple sclerosis.

As early as 1965, researchers observed that leg cramps and restless legs syndrome can result from excess insulin, sometimes called hyperinsulinemia.

===Skeletal muscle cramps===
Under normal circumstances, skeletal muscles can be voluntarily controlled. Skeletal muscles that cramp the most often are the calves, thighs, and arches of the foot, and in North America are sometimes called a &quot;Charley horse&quot; or a &quot;corky&quot;. Such cramping is associated with strenuous physical activity and can be intensely painful; however, it can occur while inactive and relaxed. Around 40% of people who experience skeletal cramps are likely to endure extreme muscle pain and may be unable to use the entire limb that contains the &quot;locked-up&quot; muscle group. It may take up to a week for the muscle to return to a pain-free state, depending on the person&#x27;s fitness level, age, and several other factors.

====Nocturnal leg cramps====

Nocturnal leg cramps are involuntary muscle contractions that occur in the calves, soles of the feet, or other muscles in the body during the night or (less commonly) while resting. The duration of nocturnal leg cramps is variable, with cramps lasting anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Muscle soreness may remain after the cramp itself ends. These cramps are more common in older people. They happen quite frequently in teenagers and some people while exercising at night. Besides being painful, a nocturnal leg cramp can cause much distress and anxiety. The precise cause of these cramps is unclear. Potential contributing factors include dehydration, low levels of certain minerals (magnesium, potassium, calcium, and sodium, although the evidence has been mixed), and reduced blood flow through muscles attendant in prolonged sitting or lying down. Nocturnal leg cramps (almost exclusively calf cramps) are considered &quot;normal&quot; during the late stages of pregnancy. They can, however, vary in intensity from mild to extremely painful.

A lactic acid buildup around muscles can trigger cramps; however, they happen during anaerobic respiration when a person is exercising or engaging in an activity where the heartbeat rises. Medical conditions associated with leg cramps are cardiovascular disease, hemodialysis, cirrhosis, pregnancy, and lumbar canal stenosis. Differential diagnoses include restless legs syndrome, claudication, myositis, and peripheral neuropathy. All of them can be differentiated through careful history and physical examination.

Gentle stretching and massage, putting some pressure on the affected leg by walking or standing, or taking a warm bath or shower may help to end the cramp. If the cramp is in the calf muscle, dorsiflexing the foot (lifting the toes back toward the shins) will stretch the muscle and provide almost immediate relief. There is limited evidence supporting the use of magnesium, calcium channel blockers, carisoprodol, and vitamin B12.

Quinine is no longer recommended for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps due to potential fatal hypersensitivity reactions and thrombocytopenia. Arrhythmias, cinchonism, and hemolytic uremic syndrome can also occur at higher dosages.

===Cramps caused by treatments===
Various medications may cause nocturnal leg cramps:
* Diuretics, especially potassium-sparing
* Intravenous (IV) iron sucrose
* Conjugated estrogens
* Teriparatide
* Naproxen
* Raloxifene
* Long-acting adrenergic beta-agonists (LABAs)
* Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA inhibitors or statins)

Statins may sometimes cause myalgia and cramps among other possible side effects. Raloxifene (Evista) is a medication associated with a high incidence of leg cramps. Additional factors, that increase the probability of these side effects, are physical exercise, age, history of cramps, and hypothyroidism. Up to 80% of athletes using statins experience significant adverse muscular effects, including cramps; the rate appears to be approximately 10–25% in a typical statin-using population. In some cases, adverse effects disappear after switching to a different statin; however, they should not be ignored if they persist, as they can, in rare cases, develop into more serious problems. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation can help avoid some statin-related adverse effects, but currently, there is not enough evidence to prove its effectiveness in avoiding myopathy or myalgia.

==Treatment==
Stretching, massage, and drinking plenty of liquids may help treat simple muscle cramps.

===Medication===
The antimalarial drug quinine is a traditional treatment that may be slightly effective for reducing the number of cramps, the intensity of cramps, and the number of days a person experiences cramps. Quinine has not been shown to reduce the duration (length) of a muscle cramp. Quinine treatment may lead to hematologic and cardiac toxicity. Due to its low effectiveness and negative side effects, its use as a medication for treating muscle cramps is not recommended by the FDA.

Magnesium is commonly used to treat muscle cramps. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that magnesium is not effective for treating or preventing cramps in older adults. It is not known if magnesium helps with cramps due to pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, other medical conditions, or exercise. Oral magnesium treatment does not appear to have significant major side effects, however, it may be associated with diarrhea and nausea in 11–37% of people who use this medicine.

With exertional heat cramps due to electrolyte abnormalities (primarily potassium loss and not calcium, magnesium, and sodium), appropriate fluids and sufficient potassium improve symptoms. Vitamin B complex, naftidrofuryl, lidocaine, and calcium channel blockers may be effective for muscle cramps.

==Prevention==
Adequate conditioning, stretching, mental preparation, hydration, and electrolyte balance are likely helpful in preventing muscle cramps.

From 1993 to 2020, CounterPunch published a newsletter, and a magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpunch/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&quot;CounterPunch&quot; began as a newsletter, established in 1994 by the Washington, D.C.–based investigative reporter Ken Silverstein. 

Silverstein was soon joined by Alexander Cockburn (b. 1941 – d. 2012) and then Jeffrey St. Clair, who became the publication&#x27;s editors in 1996 when Silverstein left. 

In 2007, Cockburn and St. Clair wrote that in founding &quot;CounterPunch&quot; they had &quot;wanted it to be the best muckraking newsletter in the country&quot;, and cited as inspiration such pamphleteers as Edward Abbey, Peter Maurin, and Ammon Hennacy, as well as the socialist/populist newspaper &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; (1895–1922). When Alexander Cockburn died in 2012 at the age of 71, environmental journalist Joshua Frank became managing editor and Jeffrey St. Clair became editor-in-chief of &quot;CounterPunch&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; described the &quot;CounterPunch&quot; website as &quot;one of the most popular political sources in America, with a keen following in Washington&quot;. Other sources have variously described &quot;CounterPunch&quot; as &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;far-left&quot;, &quot;extreme&quot;, a &quot;political newsletter&quot;, and a &quot;muckraking newsletter&quot;.

==Controversies==
===The “Alice Donovan affair”===

During the 2016 presidential election, &quot;CounterPunch&quot; published a piece attributed to Alice Donovan, who purported to be a freelance writer but US intelligence officials alleged to be a pseudonymous employee of the Russian government. Donovan was tracked by the FBI for nine months, as a suspected fictitious persona created by the GRU. In late November 2017, after &quot;CounterPunch&quot; had published several more pieces by Donovan, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; contacted Jeffrey St. Clair about her. The co-editor said that Donovan&#x27;s pitches did not stand out among the pitches that &quot;CounterPunch&quot; received daily and began making inquiries. St. Clair asked Donovan to substantiate her identity by sending a photo of her driver’s license but she did not. 

On the same day &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article about Donovan was published, St. Clair and Frank published a piece stating that &quot;CounterPunch&quot; only ran one article by Alice Donovan during the 2016 election, which was on cyber-breaches of medical databases. Donovan was also exposed by the newsletter as a serial plagiarizer. &quot;CounterPunch&quot; removed all of the articles from their site. 

In a January 2018 follow-up article, St. Clair and Frank exposed a network of alleged trolls that operated a site called Inside Syria Media Center, promoting a pro-Bashar al-Assad and pro-Russian view of the Syrian Civil War. St. Clair and Frank speculated that the website was connected to the same network of trolls as Alice Donovan, which was later confirmed by the Atlantic Council and other researchers.

On 8 June 2016, &quot;Alice Donovan&quot;, and other Russian-controlled fake American personas began promoting the DCLeaks website on Facebook.

===&quot;PropOrNot&quot; accusations===
In 2016, &quot;CounterPunch&quot; appeared in a PropOrNot list of websites in which it was described as a Russian propaganda outlet. Writing in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, Adrian Chen described the list as a mess and &quot;CounterPunch&quot; as a &quot;respected left-leaning&quot; publication.

<text>Baron Carl Otto Mörner (22 May 1781 – 17 August 1868) was a Swedish courtier, and member of the Diet. He is chiefly remembered for his role in advocating for Frenchman Jean Baptiste Bernadotte&#x27;s succession to the Swedish crown in 1810.

==Role in the succession to Charles XIII of Sweden==
In 1810 King Charles XIII of Sweden was childless and the crown prince Charles August had died of a stroke. Baron Mörner was then a lieutenant in the Uppland Regiment. Entirely on his own initiative, Mörner offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte. Although the Swedish government, amazed at Mörner&#x27;s effrontery, placed him under arrest, the candidature of Bernadotte gradually gained favor. On 21 August 1810 in Örebro, Bernadotte was elected by the Riksdag of the Estates to be the new Crown Prince, and was subsequently made Generalissimus of the Swedish Armed Forces by the King, Charles XIII. Bernadotte was crowned Charles XIV of Sweden on 5 February 1818.

==Later life==
Shortly after the succession to the throne, Mörner married Sofia Emerentia af Wetterstedt. In 1811, Mörner became a captain, and the same year he became adjutant to the newly adopted Crown Prince. After that, Mörner advanced in the army until he was promoted to colonel in 1818. He resigned the following year.

He was deputy governor of Jämtland from 1824, until he was appointed customs inspector at Blockhusudden in 1829, remaining in that office until he retired in 1841.

He is buried in Linköping&#x27;s old cemetery.

==In film==
Baron Mörner is a character in Désirée, a 1954 historical film biography. The film tells a fictionalized story of Désirée Clary, spouse of Charles XIV of Sweden, and her relationship with Napoleon.

<doc id="410410" wikidata="Q458416" url="?curid=410410" title="Carolyn McCarthy">
<text>Carolyn McCarthy ( Cook; born January 5, 1944) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2015. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

On January 8, 2014, she announced that she would not run for re-election that November, citing health; she retired in January 2015 and was replaced by fellow Democrat Kathleen Rice.

==Early life==
McCarthy was born Carolyn Cook in Brooklyn, New York, and was raised in Mineola, a suburban area on Long Island about twenty miles outside Manhattan. Her father was a boilermaker and her mother worked at Woolworth. In her youth, she was an athlete and wanted to become a physical education teacher but found reading challenging and later was diagnosed with dyslexia. After caring for a boyfriend who was injured in a car accident, McCarthy decided to work as a Licensed Practical Nurse. Later she married and she and her family lived in Mineola.

On December 7, 1993, her husband, Dennis, was killed, and her son, Kevin, was severely injured on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train at the Merillon Avenue station in the village of Garden City, when 35-year-old Colin Ferguson opened fire on passengers. Ferguson killed six and wounded 19 others. McCarthy responded to the crime by launching a campaign for more stringent gun control that eventually propelled her to Congress in 1996 on the Democratic ticket. She defeated freshman Republican Dan Frisa by a large margin. In the biographical 1998 television movie &quot;The Long Island Incident&quot;, which portrayed these events, she was played by actress Laurie Metcalf.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
During her time in Congress, McCarthy was described as &quot;the doyenne of anti-gun advocates in the House&quot; and &quot;the fiercest gun-control advocate in Congress&quot;. She made attempts to broaden her policy portfolio, but was never able to entirely shed the label of being a one-issue congresswoman. She acknowledged this, saying in 2009 that although she is also known for her education and district work, she is still the &quot;gun lady&quot;.
McCarthy was a registered Republican before her first run for Congress, although she ran for office as a Democrat and &quot;evolved&quot; over the years into a reliable Democratic vote. She voted with her party 98.1 percent of the time during the 111th Congress.

==Political positions==

===Gun control===
McCarthy&#x27;s husband Dennis was murdered in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting, which first prompted her to run for Congress.

McCarthy was one of the nation&#x27;s most vocal gun control advocates. In 1997, she sponsored a bill requiring trigger locks on guns. After the 1997 Empire State Building shooting, she introduced legislation to ban the sale of guns to tourists visiting the United States; afterwards, she received &quot;threats serious enough to require police protection during most public appearances&quot;. Later that year, McCarthy unsuccessfully opposed a Treasury bill provision that allowed the importation of weapons that had been modified in order to be compliant with the federal assault weapons ban. In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, McCarthy proposed a bill that would require firearms to be child-resistant, would make it more difficult for young adults to purchase guns, and would regulate gun shows.

After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban expired in September 2004, McCarthy introduced the Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2007 to reauthorize it in February 2007.

On April 16, 2007, after the Virginia Tech shootings, McCarthy issued a press release calling for &quot;legislation to prevent further acts of gun violence&quot;. Shooter Seung-Hui Cho had passed a background check despite his mental health issues owing to an inconsistent sharing of records between the federal and state governments. McCarthy introduced (H.R. 2640, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) to remedy this problem. The bill, with the support of the National Rifle Association, was passed by the House and signed by President Bush. McCarthy said her next priority was closing the gun show loophole.

In January 2012, McCarthy along with Senator Dianne Feinstein from California proposed a bill which would &quot;ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing of importation of 150 specific firearms including semiautomatic rifles or pistols that can be used with a detachable or fixed ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and have specific military-style features, including pistol grips, grenade launchers or rocket launchers.&quot; McCarthy spoke on the bill saying, &quot;The American people are on our side this time, and we do outnumber some of the people who are fighting against us this time.&quot;

On a 2007 episode of MSNBC&#x27;s program Tucker, Tucker Carlson interviewed McCarthy about the Virginia Tech massacre and her proposed reauthorization of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. She said that the legislation would ban large capacity &quot;clips&quot; and &quot;shoulder things that go up.&quot;

===War in Iraq===
McCarthy voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002. In 2006, she voted in support of a Republican resolution in support of the war.

===Death penalty===
In her 1996 race, McCarthy said she was against the death penalty but added that she wouldn&#x27;t support repeal because her district supported it.

===Hearing loss===
McCarthy is one of the strongest advocates of hearing loss detection, prevention, and treatment. A former nurse, she has repeatedly championed the Hearing Aid Tax Credit Act, which is designed to help those with hearing loss to afford hearing aids.

===Abortion===
McCarthy consistently supported a pro-choice abortion platform. In 1997, McCarthy voted against a ban on late-term abortions. In 2003 she was rated 100% by NARAL, and in 2006 she was rated 0% by the NRLC; both scores indicate a strongly pro-choice stance.

===Age discrimination ===
In 2003, McCarthy introduced legislation prohibiting companies from compelling the retirement of older employees and denying them pension and benefits.

===Special education===
McCarthy, who has dyslexia, testified in support of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and co-sponsored an act to fund early detection of dyslexia.

===Children&#x27;s health insurance program===
In September 2007, McCarthy supported an increase of $35 billion for the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the national program to provide health care for children from families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance. She said, &quot;No child in the 4th Congressional District, Long Island, or anywhere throughout our nation should ever go without medical care.&quot; The increase passed but was later vetoed by President Bush.

===Stem cell research===
McCarthy was a supporter of federally funded stem cell research but restricted to the use of embryos that would be discarded. In 2007, she supported the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which did just that. It passed both the House and Senate but was later vetoed by President Bush.

===Financial reform===
On November 4, 1999, McCarthy voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.

===Tea party===
In a 2011 press release, McCarthy expressed her sentiments on the Tea Party, saying &quot;It&#x27;s time to stop letting the Tea Party hold the House of Representatives hostage.&quot;
==Political campaigns==
The Fourth District and its predecessors had been in Republican hands since 1953, even though Nassau County as a whole has supported Democrats for President since 1992. In 1996, the district&#x27;s first-term Republican incumbent Dan Frisa was running for re-election at the time that McCarthy testified at a congressional hearing against an ultimately unsuccessful Republican attempt to repeal the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in a congressional hearing.

After Frisa voted for the repeal, McCarthy, a lifelong Republican, announced she would run against him in the primary. However, local Republican officials showed no support for her candidacy. So, with the support of the local and national Democratic parties, and the endorsement of &quot;Newsday&quot;, the local daily newspaper, McCarthy ran as a Democrat and defeated Frisa by seventeen points. Afterwards, some Republicans tried unsuccessfully to persuade her to run as a Republican in 1998.

She faced a close fight for reelection in 1998 against state assemblyman Gregory Becker. In 2004, she faced Hempstead mayor James Garner. The race was expected to be competitive, but McCarthy won easily, taking 63% of the vote.

Although McCarthy has always served as a Democrat, she did not change her voter registration from Republican until 2003.

===2010===

Before the election, it was reported that Democrats were concerned that McCarthy was in danger of losing her seat. In the end, however, McCarthy defeated Republican challenger Francis X. Becker, Jr, by a margin of 54% to 46%.

Earlier in 2010, it was widely reported that McCarthy was considering entering the 2010 special senatorial election to challenge Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, owing to the latter&#x27;s support for gun rights. Gillibrand had been appointed to the seat on January 23, 2009, by Governor David Paterson to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had left the Senate to become Secretary of State in the new Obama administration. McCarthy commented, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve spent 15 years trying to prevent gun violence in this country, and if he [Paterson] does pick her [Gillibrand] and if no one goes and primaries her, I will primary her.&quot; She said she would not let New York be represented by someone with a 100% rating of the NRA. On Hardball, McCarthy said that she thought Gillibrand was working for the NRA. On June 4, 2009, however, McCarthy announced that she would not mount a primary challenge to Gillibrand.

===2012===

In early 2012 there was a question as to whether redistricting might eliminate McCarthy&#x27;s district. In the end, her district was left essentially intact.

== Electoral history ==
Third-party candidates omitted, so percentages may not add up to 100%.

==Personal life==
McCarthy announced on June 3, 2013, that she has a treatable form of lung cancer. On November 8, 2013, it was reported that McCarthy, who had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, was suing more than 70 companies claiming that she had developed lung cancer from asbestos. Her father and brother, whose clothes she washed, worked with asbestos. This was challenged by &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Joe Nocera, who claimed McCarthy was part of a growing trend of cigarette smokers suing companies that once used asbestos, citing her nearly lifelong &quot;pack-a-day&quot; habit as evidence that she was knowingly bringing a bogus case and partaking in a widespread &quot;asbestos scam&quot;.

==Recognition==

In January 2025, President Joe Biden named McCarthy as a recipient of the Presidential Citizens Medal, along with nineteen others.

<doc id="410411" wikidata="Q5434097" url="?curid=410411" title="Fanshawe College">
<text>Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology, commonly shortened to Fanshawe College, is a public college in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is partnered with private ILAC International College. One of the largest colleges in Canada, it has campuses in London, Simcoe, St. Thomas and Woodstock with additional locations in Southwestern Ontario. Fanshawe had 13,479 full-time equivalent students in 2020. In 2023 Fanshawe had 11,706 international student visas, the third highest total in Canada. In the 2022-23 budget year, Fanshawe&#x27;s revenues increased by $64 million.

==History==
The Ontario Vocational Centre London, in London, Ontario, held its first classes on September 28, 1964. In 1967, it became Fanshawe College, part of a provincial system of applied arts and technology colleges. Fanshawe subsequently established campuses in Woodstock, St. Thomas, and Simcoe. The London campus originally consisted of three buildings but has since been subject to a series of extensions. The college&#x27;s name has Old English origins, combining words &quot;fane&quot; (meaning temple or building, compare Proto-Germanic *&quot;fanô&quot;, meaning woven material), and &quot;shaw&quot; or &quot;shawe&quot; (meaning woods, from Old English &quot;sċeaga) to mean &quot;temple in the woods&quot;.

James A. Colvin was named Fanshawe College&#x27;s first president in 1967 and held the position until 1979, when he was succeeded by Harry Rawson, who served as president until his retirement in 1987. Barry Moore was the third president from 1987 to 1996. Howard Rundle, Fanshawe&#x27;s longest-serving president, subsequently led the college for 18 years until his retirement on August 31, 2013. Peter Devlin became president of the college on September 3, 2013 and had served as a lieutenant general in the Canadian Army.

The Fanshawe College Arboretum was established in 1995.

In May 2011, the college opened its Centre for Applied Transportation Technologies, with a capacity of 1,500 students. The college established the Norton Wolf School of Aviation Technology after purchasing Jazz Aviation facilities at London International Airport in August 2013.

In 2014, Fanshawe announced that it would purchase the building of the recently closed Kingsmill&#x27;s Department Store for expansion of its downtown London campus with a request for an additional grant of $10 million from City Council. The request proved politically contentious in a municipal election year with it being initially refused by Council following a tie vote on July 29. However, after the local organization, Downtown London, put up $1 million in support of this initiative, London City Council narrowly voted to approve the remainder of the funding after minor additional contract changes in its favor.

In September 2014, Fanshawe College established its School of Public Safety, to provide public safety programs. In June 2016, Fanshawe opened its Canadian Centre for Product Validation (CCPV), a testing facility. 

On April 27, 2015, the family of Don Smith, co-founder of EllisDon, announced the School of Building Technology would be renamed the Donald J. Smith School of Building Technology in his honor. Don was the first recipient of a Fanshawe College honorary diploma in 1992. In 2008, Fanshawe presented his wife, Joan, with an honorary diploma.

Corruption in Canadian higher-education that saw Canadian institutions abandoning academic ethics and standards to enroll foreign students was noted in 2016. Fanshawe reported 852 academic offences in 2016-17.

In 2018, Fanshawe established its fifth school, the School of Digital and Performing Arts, offering creative programs previously offered by the School of Contemporary Media and School of Design. 130 Dundas Street opened in September 2018. The new building is home to 1,600 students from the School of Information Technology and the School of Tourism, Hospitality and Culinary Arts.

In 2019, following an increase in international student enrollment, Fanshawe was forced to create a new academic integrity position to address cheating and implement new anti-cheating measures. Despite these efforts Fanshawe reported cheating continuing to increase in 2023. Fanshawe opened their renovated London South campus later in 2019, with nearly 100% international students.

In 2021 several international students learned their acceptance letters from Fanshawe were fake. These students face deportation from Canada. The college announced they were seeking to grow international student enrolment a further 50% by 2025. 

In 2022 ILAC International College announced they would begin offering Fanshawe programs.

In September 2024 Fanshawe faced a proposed $10 million dollar class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges failures of their paralegal program to meet accreditation standards and &quot;widespread negligence&quot; among Fanshawe staff. In November international students began publicly expressing concern about the future of Fanshawe.

==Programs==
Fanshawe offers more than 200 degree, diploma, certificate and apprenticeship programs to 43,000 students each year.

The College has 15 academic schools: Donald J. Smith School of Building Technology; Lawrence Kinlin School of Business; Norton Wolf School of Aviation and Aerospace Technology; School of Applied Science and Technology; School of Community Studies; School of Contemporary Media; School of Design; School of Digital and Performing Arts; School of Health Sciences; School of Information Technology; School of Language and Liberal Studies; School of Nursing; School of Public Safety; School of Tourism, Hospitality and Culinary Arts; and School of Transportation Technology and Apprenticeship.

Many of Fanshawe&#x27;s varsity programs participate not only in the OCAA but also the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association (CCAA). As of the 2021/22 season, the Falcons have a total of 22 national championships, 152 provincial championships and a total of 432 medals. 

Fanshawe Athletics set a Fanshawe record totals for most medals in a season in 2018/19 with 28 overall medals. The Falcons led the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association (OCAA), winning 11 OCAA Championships this season to go along with 21 OCAA medals. The 11 championships shattered Fanshawe&#x27;s own record of six from 2017/18. Fanshawe Athletics also set a new school record for most national medals in a single season (7). The 2018–19 season saw Fanshawe win two Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) National Championships, 5 national bronze, 11 provincial gold, 6 provincial silver and 4 provincial bronze medals.

<doc id="410417" wikidata="Q267881" url="?curid=410417" title="The Road Goes Ever On">
<text>The Road Goes Ever On is a song cycle first published in 1967 as a book of sheet music and as an audio recording. The music was written by Donald Swann, and the words are taken from poems in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings, especially &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. 
The title of the song cycle is taken from &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;, the first song in the collection. The songs are designed to fit together when played in sequence. The ninth song &quot;Lúthien Tinúviel&quot; was added in an appendix rather than in the main sequence.
Swann performed the cycle for Tolkien, who approved of the music except for the Quenya song &quot;Namárië&quot;; he suggested it should be in the style of a Gregorian chant, which he hummed; Swann used that melody for the song.

== Background ==

J. R. R. Tolkien was a scholar of English literature, a philologist and medievalist interested in language and poetry from the Middle Ages, especially that of Anglo-Saxon England and Northern Europe. His professional knowledge of works such as &quot;Beowulf&quot; shaped his fictional world of Middle-earth, including his fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

With Tolkien&#x27;s approval, Donald Swann wrote the music for this song cycle, consisting of settings of some of Tolkien&#x27;s poetry in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Much of it resembles English traditional music or folk music. The sole exception is the Quenya song &quot;Namárië&quot;, which was based on a tune by Tolkien himself; it has some affinities to Gregorian chant. In his foreword to the second edition, Swann explains that he performed the song cycle to Tolkien in Priscilla Tolkien&#x27;s garden. Tolkien approved of the music except for &quot;Namárië&quot;, and hummed its melody; Swann used that for the song.

The sheet music for the songs occupies most of the book, pages 1–62 and 78–84 in the 2002 edition. 

=== List of songs ===

The 1967 song-cycle (as released on LP and CD) is as follows. Keys are given, but Swann notes in the foreword to the third edition that transposition is acceptable. 

The following songs were added to the CD (but not the LP) after the first edition. &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot; forms a continuation of song 6, &quot;I Sit Beside the Fire&quot;, in the text, but is a separate track on the CD. &quot;Lúthien Tinúviel&quot; has an ambiguous status: it is shown as song 9 of the cycle in the table of contents, but it is placed in an appendix, not the main cycle, with a note that it could be incorporated into the main sequence by singing it in D major, described by Swann as &quot;a more baritonal key&quot;.

=== Non-musical materials ===

The text provides Tolkien&#x27;s notes and translations of the two Elvish poems in the song cycle, on pages 63–76 of the 2002 edition. The book contains one of the longest samples of the constructed language Quenya, in the shape of the song &quot;Namárië&quot;, as well as the Sindarin prayer &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot;, with grammatical explanations. Tolkien&#x27;s notes in the book provided information about the First Age of Middle-earth that was not otherwise publicly available until 1977, when &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; appeared.

In addition, Tolkien contributed decorations in the form of elvish script for the top and bottom of every page of sheet music, and tailpieces for the spaces at the ends of the poems.

== Publication history ==

The first edition of &quot;The Road Goes Ever On: a Song Cycle&quot; was published on 31 October 1967, in the United States.

An LP record that included the song cycle was recorded on 12 June 1967 as &quot;Poems and Songs of Middle Earth&quot;, with Donald Swann on piano and William Elvin singing. Side one of this record consisted of Tolkien himself reading six poems from &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;. The first track on side two was Tolkien reading part of the Elvish prayer &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot; from book 2, chapter 1 of The Lord of the Rings. The remainder of side two contained the song cycle performed by Swann and Elvin. The LP record was released by Caedmon Records (TC 1231).

The second edition of &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;, published in 1978, added music for &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song.&quot; This song was also published separately.

The third edition, published in 1993, added music for &quot;Lúthien Tinúviel&quot; from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, which had earlier appeared in &quot;The Songs of Donald Swann: Volume I&quot;. The third edition of &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot; was packaged with a CD that duplicated the song cycle (but not Tolkien&#x27;s readings) from the 1967 LP record. The CD also included two new recordings. The third edition was reprinted in hardcover in 2002 by Harper Collins (); this had the same text and CD as the 1993 edition.

On 10 June 1995, the song cycle was performed in Rotterdam under the auspices of the Dutch Tolkien Society, by the baritone Jan Krediet together with the chamber choir EnSuite and Alexandra Swemer on the piano. A CD of this concert was published in a limited edition.

== Analysis ==

The scholar Richard Leonberger states that Swann composed the nine settings over a period of 12 years. He began by setting seven poems from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to music in Ramallah, near Jerusalem, in 1965. These included &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot; and &quot;O Orofarnë, Lassemista, Carnimírië&quot;; he replaced the latter with &quot;Namárië&quot; for the first edition as he felt it was too similar to Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot;.

The scholar of music Emily Sulka notes that the song cycle was created because Swann and his wife liked Tolkien&#x27;s writings, and set six of the poems to music. Tolkien liked five of the settings, but proposed a melody similar to a Gregorian chant in place of the sixth, for &quot;Namárië&quot;. She notes too that Swann wanted them to be performed as a group without applause between the songs. In her view, the cycle has the theme of travel: the walking songs launch into an adventure to unknown lands, but returning home; &quot;In the Willow-Meads of Tasarinan&quot; speaks of Treebeard&#x27;s travels in many lands, from spring to winter; &quot;In Western Lands&quot; in contrast begins with Sam in despondent mood, but ends with a feeling of hope. &quot;I Sit Beside the Fire&quot; portrays a traveller, Bilbo, reflecting on his journeys; it ends with a quotation of the melody of &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;, a poem that recurs (adapted to each context) in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Sulka thus sees Tolkien and Swann using the poems and music to link the story of the novel with &quot;the road always continuing, even when one&#x27;s individual travel is finished&quot;. She finds Swann&#x27;s account of Tolkien&#x27;s poems &quot;highly effective&quot;.

The educationist Estelle Jorgensen states that she was &quot;struck by Swann&#x27;s simple, folklike, and tonal strophic settings, harking back to an earlier time before atonal music, which seems appropriate to the rustic character of the hobbits and others he portrays.&quot; She notes that the chosen texts reflect the journey and its metaphor of the road of life, ending with the longest of the poems, &quot;Errantry&quot;, in which the wanderer ends one journey and begins the next. In her view, the setting of &quot;In the willow-meads of Tasarinan&quot; captures Treebeard&#x27;s strength and resilience, but not the quality of chanting that Tolkien mentions, nor the fact that the Ents had been influenced by elvish music.

For music education, Jorgensen writes that the familiarity of Peter Jackson&#x27;s films of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; means that Tolkien&#x27;s mythology can be explored via Tolkien&#x27;s prose, his poetry, film, and music. She suggests that the poetry can be compared with Swann&#x27;s settings; and that &quot;students can improvise, compose, perform, and record&quot; their own melodies for the texts, or write and perform their own stories in which the songs might feature. She notes that in Middle-earth, singing was natural and a pleasure, as it was in times before amplified popular music changed the style of the human voice.

<text>An overpass, called an overbridge or flyover (for a road only) in the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, is a bridge, road, railway or similar structure that is over another road or railway. An &quot;overpass&quot; and &quot;underpass&quot; together form a grade separation. Stack interchanges are made up of several overpasses.

==History==
The world&#x27;s first railroad flyover was constructed in 1843 by the London and Croydon Railway at Norwood Junction railway station to carry its atmospheric railway vehicles over the Brighton Main Line.

==Highway and road==
In North American usage, a &quot;flyover&quot; is a high-level overpass, built above main overpass lanes, or a bridge built over what had been an at-grade intersection. Traffic engineers usually refer to the latter as a &quot;grade separation&quot;. A flyover may also be an extra ramp added to an existing interchange, either replacing an existing cloverleaf loop (or being built in place of one) with a higher, faster ramp that eventually bears left, but may be built as a right or left exit.

A cloverleaf or partial cloverleaf contains some 270 degree loops, which can slow traffic and can be difficult to construct with multiple lanes. Where all such turns are replaced with flyovers (perhaps with some underpasses) only 90 degree turns are needed, and there may be four or more distinct levels of traffic. Depending upon design, traffic may flow in all directions at or near open road speeds (when not congested). For more examples, see Freeway interchange.

==Pedestrian==
A pedestrian overpass allows traffic to pass without affecting pedestrian safety.

==Railway==
Railway overpasses are used to replace level crossings (at-grade crossings) as a safer alternative. Using overpasses allows for unobstructed rail traffic to flow without conflicting with vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Rapid transit systems use complete grade separation of their rights of way to avoid traffic interference with frequent and reliable service.

Railroads also use balloon loops and flying junctions instead of flat junctions, as a way to reverse direction and to avoid trains conflicting with those on other tracks.

<text>USS &quot;Henry L. Stimson&quot; (SSBN-655), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Henry L. Stimson (1867–1950), who served as U.S. Secretary of State (1929–1933) and U.S. Secretary of War (1911–1913, 1940–1945).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for the construction of &quot;Henry L. Stimson&quot; was awarded on 29 July 1963, and her keel was laid down on 4 April 1964 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 13 November 1965, sponsored by Grace Murphy Dodd, wife of Connecticut Senator Thomas J. Dodd, and was commissioned on 20 August 1966 with Captain Richard E. Jortberg commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Robert H. Weeks commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
Following shakedown, &quot;Henry L. Stimson&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 10 at New London, Connecticut. On 23 February 1967 she put to sea from Charleston with the Blue crew on her first strategic deterrent patrol, armed with Polaris A3 ballistic missiles. By August 1967, her Blue and Gold crews had each completed one deterrent patrol. Ballistic Missile Submarines were manned by two separate crews, designated Blue and Gold. While one crew was physically aboard the ship, the other crew had one month of R&amp;R and then almost 2 months of training. At the end of a patrol, usually lasting approximately 75 days and usually spent entirely submerged, the ship returned to port and was met by the opposite crew. A week was spent in turnover and then the crews would trade places. After another 3 weeks of refitting and repairs, the ship would go on patrol and the cycle would continue.

From 1973 until the Trident Missile conversion in 1980, she continued to operate out of Rota, Spain with one visit back to Charleston in 1976(?) to replace the battery bank.

After 1980 until decommissioning, she operated out of Kings Bay Georgia, with the crew based in Charleston, SC.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Henry L. Stimson&quot; was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 May 1993. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy″s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 12 August 1994.

<text>The House of Wisdom ( ), also known as the Grand Library of Baghdad, was believed to be a major Abbasid-era public academy and intellectual center in Baghdad. In popular reference, it acted as one of the world&#x27;s largest public libraries during the Islamic Golden Age, and was founded either as a library for the collections of the fifth Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid () in the late 8th century or as a private collection of the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur () to house rare books and collections in the Arabic language. During the reign of the seventh Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (), it was turned into a public academy and a library.

It was destroyed in 1258 during the Mongol siege of Baghdad. The primary sources behind the House of Wisdom narrative date between the late eight centuries and thirteenth centuries, and most importantly include the references in Ibn al-Nadim&#x27;s (d. 995) &quot;al-Fihrist&quot;.

More recently, the narrative of the Abbasid House of Wisdom acting as a major intellectual center, university, and playing a sizable role during the translation movement has been understood by some historians to be a myth, constructed originally over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by Orientalists and, through their works, propagated its way into scholarship and nationally-oriented works until more recent re-investigations of the evidence.

==Background==

=== Greco-Arabic translation movement ===
The House of Wisdom existed as a part of the major Translation Movement taking place during the Abbasid Era, translating works from Greek and Syriac to Arabic, but it is unlikely that the House of Wisdom existed as the sole center of such work, as major translation efforts arose in Cairo and Damascus even earlier than the proposed establishment of the House of Wisdom. This translation movement lent momentum to a great deal of original research occurring in the Muslim world, which had access to texts from Greek, Persian, and Indian sources. The rise of advanced research into mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and medicine was the beginning of Arabic science, and drove demand for more and updated translations.

=== Influx of scholars ===
The House of Wisdom was made possible by the consistent flow of Arab, Persian, and other scholars of the Islamic world to Baghdad, owing to the city&#x27;s position as capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. This is evidenced by the large number of scholars known to have studied in Baghdad between the 8th and 13th centuries, such as al-Jahiz, al-Kindi, and al-Ghazali among others, all of whom would have contributed to a vibrant academic community in Baghdad, producing a great number of notable works, regardless of the existence of a formal academy. The fields to which scholars associated with the House of Wisdom contributed include, but are not limited to, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and optics. The early name of the library, &quot;Khizanat al-Hikma&quot; (literally, &quot;Storehouse of Wisdom&quot;), derives from its function as a place for the preservation of rare books and poetry, a primary function of the House of Wisdom until its destruction. Inside the House of Wisdom, writers, translators, authors, scientists, scribes, and others would meet daily for translation, writing, conversation, reading, and dialogue. Numerous books and documents covering several scientific concepts and philosophical subjects in different languages were translated in this house.

==History==
===Origins and establishment===
Throughout the 4th to 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Arabic languages was either newly initiated or carried on from the Hellenistic period. Centers of learning and of transmission of classical wisdom included colleges such as the School of Nisibis and later the School of Edessa, and the renowned hospital and medical Academy of Gondishapur; libraries included the Library of Alexandria and the Imperial Library of Constantinople; and other centers of translation and learning functioned at Merv, Salonika, Nishapur and Ctesiphon, situated just south of what was later to become Baghdad.

During the Umayyad era, Muawiyah I started to gather a collection of books in Damascus. He then formed a library that was referred to as &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot;. Books written in Greek, Latin, and Persian in the fields of medicine, alchemy, physics, mathematics, astrology and other disciplines were also collected and translated by Muslim scholars at that time. The Umayyads also appropriated paper-making techniques from the Chinese and joined many ancient intellectual centers under their rule, and employed Christian and Persian scholars to both translate works into Arabic and to develop new knowledge. These were fundamental elements that contributed directly to the flourishing of scholarship in the Arab world.

In 750, the Abbasid dynasty replaced the Umayyad as the ruling dynasty of the Islamic Empire, and, in 762, the Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775) built Baghdad and made it his capital instead of Damascus. Baghdad&#x27;s location and cosmopolitan population made the perfect location for a stable commercial and intellectual center. The Abbasid dynasty had a strong Persian bent, and adopted many practices from the Sasanian Empire—among those, that of translating foreign works, except that now texts were translated into Arabic. For this purpose, al-Mansur founded a palace library modeled after the Sasanian Imperial Library, and provided economic and political support to the intellectuals working there. He also invited delegations of scholars from India and other places to share their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy with the new Abbasid court.

In the Abbasid Empire, many foreign works were translated into Arabic from Greek, Chinese, Sanskrit, Persian and Syriac. The Translation Movement gained great momentum during the reign of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, who, like his predecessor, was personally interested in scholarship and poetry. Originally the texts concerned mainly medicine, mathematics and astronomy; but other disciplines, especially philosophy, soon followed. Al-Rashid&#x27;s library, the direct predecessor to the House of Wisdom, was also known as Bayt al-Hikma or, as the historian al-Qifti called it, Khizanat Kutub al-Hikma (Arabic for &quot;Storehouse of the Books of Wisdom&quot;).
===Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign===
Under the sponsorship of Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (r. 813–833), economic support of the House of Wisdom and scholarship in general was greatly increased. Al-Ma&#x27;mun, under the tutelage of his father, Caliph Harun al-Rashid, memorized the Quran word for word under the eyes of leading religious scholar of the court. Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s mistakes were instantly corrected. It was a common trait amongst Muslim poets, scientists, and authors to memorize their original texts for public lectures, which were typically done inside a mosque. This practice appeared to be ingrained inside al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s intellectual capabilities.

His love for science was so great that it was said that he preferred scientific texts as the spoils of war. Furthermore, Abbasid society itself came to understand and appreciate the value of knowledge, and support also came from merchants and the military. It was easy for scholars and translators to make a living, and an academic life was indicative of high status in society; scientific knowledge was considered so valuable that books and ancient texts were sometimes preferred as war booty rather than riches. Indeed, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; was claimed as a condition for peace by al-Ma&#x27;mun after a war between the Abbasids and the Eastern Roman Empire.

The House of Wisdom was much more than an academic center removed from the broader society. Its experts served several functions in Baghdad. Scholars from the Bayt al-Hikma usually doubled as engineers and architects in major construction projects, kept accurate official calendars, and were public servants. They were also frequently medics and consultants.

Al-Ma&#x27;mun was personally involved in the daily life of the House of Wisdom, regularly visiting its scholars and inquiring about their activities. He would also participate in and arbitrate academic debates. One of the reasons that al-Ma&#x27;mun loved the pursuit of knowledge was said to be from a dream that he once had. In the dream, he was said to have been visited by Aristotle, where they had a discussion on what was good. Inspired by Aristotle, al-Ma&#x27;mun regularly initiated discussion sessions and seminars among experts in &quot;Kalām&quot;; &quot;Kalām&quot; being an art of philosophical debate, which al-Ma&#x27;mun carried on from his Persian tutor, Ja’far. During such debates, scholars would discuss their fundamental Islamic beliefs and doctrines in an open, intellectual atmosphere. He would often organize groups of sages, from the Bayt al-Hikma, into major research projects to satisfy his own intellectual curiosities. For example, he commissioned the mapping of the world, the confirmation of data from the &quot;Almagest&quot; and the deduction of the real size of the Earth (see section on the main activities of the House). He also promoted Egyptology and personally participated in excavations at the pyramids of Giza. Al-Ma’mun built the first astronomical observatories in Baghdad, and he was also the first ruler to fund and monitor the progress of major research projects involving teams of scholars and scientists. In this way he was the first ruler to fund &quot;big science&quot;.

Following his predecessors, al-Ma&#x27;mun would send expeditions of scholars from the House of Wisdom to collect texts from foreign lands. In fact, one of the directors of the House was sent to Constantinople with this purpose. During this time, Sahl ibn Harun, a Persian poet and astrologer, was the chief librarian of the Bayt al-Hikma. Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809–873), an Arab Nestorian Christian physician and scientist, was the most productive translator, producing 116 works for the Arabs. As &quot;Sheikh of the translators,&quot; he was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. Hunayn ibn Ishaq translated the entire collection of Greek medical books, including famous pieces by Galen and Hippocrates. The Sabian Thābit ibn Qurra (826–901) also translated great works by Apollonius, Archimedes, Euclid and Ptolemy. Translations of this era were superior to earlier ones, since the new Abbasid scientific tradition required better and better translations, and the emphasis was many times put on incorporating new ideas to the ancient works being translated. By the second half of the ninth century, al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s Bayt al-Hikma was the greatest repository of books in the world and had become one of the greatest hubs of intellectual activity during the Medieval era, attracting the most brilliant Arab and Persian minds. The House of Wisdom eventually acquired a reputation as a center of learning, although universities as they are modernly known did not yet exist at this time—knowledge was transmitted directly from teacher to student without any institutional surrounding. Maktabs soon began to develop in the city from the 9th century on and, in the 11th century, Nizam al-Mulk founded the Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad, one of the first institutions of higher education in Iraq.

===Al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s reign===
The House of Wisdom flourished under al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s successors al-Mu&#x27;tasim (r. 833–842) and his son al-Wathiq (r. 842–847), but considerably declined under the reign of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861). Although al-Ma&#x27;mun, al-Mu&#x27;tasim, and al-Wathiq followed the sect of Mu&#x27;tazili, which supported broad-mindedness and scientific inquiry, al-Mutawakkil endorsed a more literal interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith. The caliph was not interested in science and moved away from rationalism, seeing the spread of Greek philosophy as anti-Islamic.

===Destruction by the Mongol army===
On February 13, 1258, the Mongols entered the city of the caliphs, starting a full week of pillage and destruction.

Along with all other libraries in Baghdad, the House of Wisdom was destroyed by Hulagu&#x27;s army during the Siege of Baghdad. The books from Baghdad&#x27;s libraries were thrown into the Tigris River in such quantities that the river was said to have run black with the ink from their pages. According to a 16th century chronicle about the siege from Quṭb al-Dīn al-Nahrawālī, &quot;So many books were thrown into the Eufrates River that they formed a bridge that would support a man on horseback.&quot; According to historian Michal Biran, this quote was a literary trope associated with the siege of Baghdad and magnifying Mongol barbarity. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi rescued about 400,000 manuscripts, which he took to Maragheh before the siege.

Many of the books were also torn apart by pillagers so that the leather covers could be made into sandals.

== Main activities ==

The House of Wisdom included a society of scientists and academics, a translation department, and a library that preserved the knowledge acquired by the Abbasids over the centuries. Research and study of alchemy, which was later used to form the structure of modern chemistry, was also conducted there. Further, it was also linked to astronomical observations and other major experimental endeavors.

Institutionalized by al-Ma&#x27;mun, the academy encouraged the transcription of Greek philosophical and scientific efforts. Additionally, he imported manuscripts of important texts that were not accessible to the Islamic countries from Byzantium to the library.

The House of Wisdom was much more than a library, and a vast amount of original scientific and philosophical work was produced by scholars and intellectuals in relation to it (although many were lost due to the destruction of the library). This allowed Muslim scholars to verify astronomical information that was handed down from past scholars.
=== Translations from Greece, India, and Persia ===
The Translation Movement lasted for two centuries and was a large contributing factor to the growth of scientific knowledge during the golden age of Arabic science. Ideas and wisdom from other cultures around the world, Greece, India, and Persia, were translated into Arabic contributing to further advances in the Islamic Empire. An important goal during this time was to create a comprehensive library that contained all of the knowledge gained throughout this movement. Advances were made in areas like mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, philosophy, and engineering. The influential achievement of translation revealed to scholars in the empire to the limitless body of early knowledge in the Ancient Near East and Greek traditions, developing the birth of primary scholarship beyond philosophy and scholarship. The engagement across arts and sciences assorts and stretches intelligence realms and brings growth to new methods of understanding. This was accomplished through academic knowledge and creative rehearsal. The House of Wisdom was known for being a space for scholarly growth and contribution which during the time greatly contributed to the Translation Movement.

The Translation Movement started in this House of Wisdom and lasted for over two centuries. Over a century and a half, primarily Middle Eastern Oriental Syriac Christian scholars translated all scientific and philosophic Greek texts into Arabic language in the House of Wisdom. The translation movement at the House of Wisdom was inaugurated with the translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Topics&quot;. By the time of al-Ma&#x27;mun, translators had moved beyond Greek astrological texts, and Greek works were already in their third translations. Authors translated include: Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Euclid, Plotinus, Galen, Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. Many important texts were translated during this movement including a book about the composition of medicinal drugs, a book on this mixing and the properties of simple drugs, and a book on medical matters by Pedanius Dioscorides. These, and many more translations, helped with the advancements in medicine, agriculture, finance, and engineering.

Furthermore, new discoveries motivated revised translations and commentary correcting or adding to the work of ancient authors. In most cases names and terminology were changed; a prime example of this is the title of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, which is an Arabic modification of the original name of the work: &quot;Megale Syntaxis&quot;.

=== Original contributions ===


Besides their translations of earlier works and their commentaries on them, scholars at the Bayt al-Ḥikma produced important original research. For example, the noted mathematician al-Khwarizmi worked in al-Maʾmun’s House of Wisdom and is famous for his contributions to the development of algebra.

Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥaq al-Kindī was also another historical figure that worked at the House of Wisdom. He studied cryptanalysis but he was also a great mathematician. Al-Kindī is the most famous for being the first person to introduce Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy to the Arabic people. He fused Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy with Islamic theology, which created an intellectual platform for philosophers and theologians to debate over 400 years. A fellow expert on Aristotle was Abū ʿUthmān al-Jāḥiẓ, who was born in Basra around 776 but he spent most of his life in Baghdad. Al-Ma’mun employed al-Jāḥiẓ as a personal tutor for his children, but he had to dismiss him because al-Jāḥiẓ was &quot;goggled-eyed&quot;, i.e., he had wide, staring eyes which made him frightening to look at. Al-Jāḥiẓ was one of the few Muslim scholars who was deeply concerned with biology. He wrote &quot;Book of Animals,&quot; which discusses the way animals adapt to their surroundings, similarly to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;History of Animals&quot;. In his book, al-Jāḥiẓ argued that animals like dogs, foxes, and wolves must have descended from a common ancestor because they shared similar characteristics and features such as four legs, fur, tail, and so on.

Mūsā ibn Shākir was an astrologer and a friend of Caliph Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s son, al-Ma&#x27;mun. His sons, collectively known as the Banū Mūsā (Sons of Moses), also contributed with their extensive knowledge of mathematics and astrology. When their father died, al-Ma&#x27;mun became their guardian. Between 813 and 833, the three brothers were successful in their works in science, engineering, and patronage. Abū Jaʿfar, Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (before 803 – February 873), Abū al‐Qāsim, Aḥmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (d. 9th century) and al-Ḥasan ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir (d. 9th century) are widely known for their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;, which describes about one hundred devices and how to use them. Among these was &quot;The Instrument that Plays by Itself&quot;, the earliest example of a programmable machine, as well as the &quot;Book on Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures&quot;. Mohammad Musa and his brothers Ahmad and Hasan contributed to Baghdad&#x27;s astronomical observatories under the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun, in addition to House of Wisdom research. Having shown much potential, the brothers were enrolled in the library and translation center of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. They began translating ancient Greek into Arabic after quickly mastering the language, as well as paying large sums to obtain manuscripts from the Byzantine Empire for translation. They also made many original contributions to astronomy and physics. Mohammad Musa might have been the first person in history to point to the universality of the laws of physics. In the 10th century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) performed several physical experiments, mainly in optics, achievements still celebrated today.

In medicine, Hunayn wrote an important treatise on ophthalmology. Other scholars also wrote on smallpox, infections and surgery. Note that these works would later become standard textbooks of medicine during the European Renaissance.

Under al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s leadership science saw for the first time wide-ranging research projects involving large groups of scholars. In order to check Ptolemy&#x27;s observations, the caliph ordered the construction of the first astronomical observatory in Baghdad (see Observatories section below). The data provided by Ptolemy was meticulously checked and revised by a highly capable group of geographers, mathematicians and astronomers. Al-Ma&#x27;mun also organized research on the circumference of the Earth and commissioned a geographic project that would result in one of the most detailed world-maps of the time. Some consider these efforts the first examples of large state-funded research projects.

=== Astronomical observatories ===
The creation of the first astronomical observatory in the Islamic world was ordered by Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun in 828 in Baghdad. The construction was directed by scholars from the House of Wisdom: senior astronomer Yahya ibn abi Mansur and the younger Sanad ibn Ali al-Alyahudi. It was located in al-Shammasiyya and was called Maumtahan Observatory. After the first round of observations of Sun, Moon and the planets, a second observatory on Mount Qasioun, near Damascus, was constructed. The results of this endeavor were compiled in a work known as al-Zij al-Mumtahan, which translates as &quot;The Verified Tables&quot;.

=== Dispute theory of Dimitri Gutas ===
Yale University Arabist Dimitri Gutas disputes the existence of the House of Wisdom as well as its form and function. He posits in his 1998 book that &quot;House of Wisdom&quot; is a translation error from &quot;Khizanat al-Hikma&quot;, which he asserts simply means a storehouse, and that there are few sources from the era during the Abbasid Era that mention the House of Wisdom by the name &quot;Bayt al-Hikma.&quot; Gutas asserts that, without consistent naming conventions, a physical ruin, or corroborating texts, the phrase &quot;House of Wisdom&quot; may just as well have been a metaphor for the larger Academic community in Baghdad rather than a physical academy specializing in translation work. Gutas mentions that in all of the Graeco-Arabic translations none of them mention the House of Wisdom, including the notable Hunayn ibn Ishaq. There is also no proof that the Sultan ever held open debates among scholars in the library since that would not have been socially acceptable. This theory is debatable, owing to the destruction of the Round city of Baghdad and conflicting sources in both academic texts and poetry. It is likely, given the Abbasid caliphs&#x27; patronage of the arts and sciences, that an extensive library existed in Baghdad, and that scholars could have access to such texts, judging by the volume of work produced by scholars centered in Baghdad. There is a strong chance that the library was only used to preserve history from the Sassanian Dynasty and the translations that were done there were only done to achieve that goal. Once the Abbasids took over they most likely continued this tradition with the added goal of pursuing both astrology and astronomy.

== Other &quot;Houses of Wisdom&quot; ==

A major contribution from the House of Wisdom in Baghdad is the influence it had on other libraries in the Islamic world. It has been recognised as a factor that connected many different people and empires because of its educational and research components. The House of Wisdom has been accredited and respected throughout Islamic history and was the model for many libraries during and following its time of function. A large number of libraries emerged during and after this time and it was evident that these libraries were based on the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. These libraries had the intention of reproducing the advantageous and beneficial characteristics that are known throughout the world because of the House of Wisdom.

Some other places have also been called &quot;House of Wisdom&quot;, which should not be confused with Baghdad&#x27;s Bayt al-Hikma:

* In Cairo, &quot;Dar al-Hikmah&quot;, the &quot;House of Wisdom&quot;, was another name of the House of Knowledge, founded by the Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1004. Included in this House of Knowledge was a library that had a collection so vast, it was known as a &quot;Wonder of the World&quot;. The beginning of the foundation of Cairo&#x27;s House of Wisdom was by Fatimid al-Aziz billah who was a lover of books and collected a vast amount of them. He was determined to collect every book that was authored or translated in the Baghdad House of Wisdom. The actual founder al-Hākim bi-Amr Allah, assembled a group of scholars to work in the library by authoring books and contributing to the scientific knowledge acquired in this place. He provided a large amount of supplies like ink, paper, and anything else that the scholars may have needed in order to make their contributions.
*The Aghlabids House of Wisdom founded in Raqqada by Amir Ibrahim Ibn Mohammad al-Aghlabī. Ibrahim was enticed by the acquisition of knowledge and knew the positive qualities that education, scholarship, and innovative ideas brought to societies around the world. A multitude of scholarly manuscripts, scientific journals, and books were found here with the intent to create a library with an equivalent reputation to the Baghdad House of Wisdom. A group of scholars would journey to Baghdad annually to retrieve important literary works and other writings and bring them back to the library which helped contribute to the unique and rare material found in the Aghlabids House of Wisdom.
*The Andalusian House of Wisdom founded in Andalusia by an Umayyad caliph, al-Hakam al-Mustansir, who was known as a master of scholar for his knowledge in many different scientific categories. He started one of the largest collections of manuscripts, writings, and books that consisted of a multitude of genres and scientific categories. The Andalusian House of Wisdom was constructed based on the Baghdad House of Wisdom and was used to store the vast amount of knowledge acquired by al-Mustansir. During this period scientific development, art, architecture, and much more grew and prospered. 
* There is a research institute in Baghdad called &quot;Bayt Al-Hikma&quot; after the Abbasid-era research center. While the complex includes a 13th-century madrasa (), it is not the same building as the medieval &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot;. It was damaged during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
* &quot;Beït al-Hikma&quot; (House of Wisdom), Tunis, Tunisia, established in 1983.
* The main library at Hamdard University in Karachi, Pakistan, is called &#x27;Bait al Hikmat&#x27;.
* &quot;La Maison de Sagesse&quot; (House of Wisdom), an international NGO based in France.
* The House of Wisdom دارالحکمة س, Tehran, Iran, established in 2017 by Alireza Mohammadi.
* The House of Wisdom, Fez, Morocco, established in 2018 by Cardinal Barbarin and Khal Torabully.

<text>Hells Gate State Park is a public recreation area located on the southern edge of Lewiston, Idaho, at the Snake River&#x27;s downstream entrance to Hells Canyon, the deepest canyon in North America. The state park was created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to mitigate the construction of the Lower Granite Dam; the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation began leasing the site in 1973. The park&#x27;s offer trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding as well as opportunities for camping, picnicking, fishing, boating, swimming, and taking jet boat trips into the canyon. The park sits at the lowest elevation of any Idaho state park, at above sea level.

<text>Mary Violet Leontyne Price ( ; born February 10, 1927) is an American spinto soprano who was the first African-American soprano to receive international acclaim. From 1961 she began a long association with the Metropolitan Opera. She regularly appeared at the world&#x27;s major opera houses, including the Royal Opera House, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, and La Scala; at La Scala, she was also the first African American to sing a leading role. She was particularly renowned for her performances of the title role in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;.

Born in Laurel, Mississippi, Price attended Central State University and then the Juilliard School (graduating &quot;cum laude&quot;), where she had her operatic debut as Mistress Ford in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. Having heard the performance, Virgil Thomson engaged her in &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;, prior to embarking on her debut tour; she also starred (alongside her husband William Warfield) in a successful revival of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. Numerous concert performances followed, including a recital at the Library of Congress with composer Samuel Barber at the piano. Her 1955 televised performance of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, plus appearances at the San Francisco Opera as Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot;, brought her to international attention. She went on to sing at many of the world&#x27;s major opera houses with &quot;Aida&quot;, before her successful debut at the Metropolitan Opera (Met) in 1961, as Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. Continuing her career there, she starred in a multitude of operas for 20 years, securing her place among the leading performers of the century. One of these works was Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, which she starred in for its world premiere. She made her farewell opera performance at the Met in 1985 in &quot;Aida&quot;.

A lirico spinto (Italian for &quot;pushed lyric&quot;) soprano, her musical interpretations were subtle but often overshadowed her acting. She was noted for her roles in operas by Mozart and Puccini, as well as playing Cleopatra in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and Poppea in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;. However, the &quot;middle period&quot; operas of Verdi remain her greatest triumph; &quot;Aida&quot;, the Leonoras of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, as well as Amelia in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. Her performances in these works, as well as Mozart and Puccini&#x27;s operas, survive in her many recordings.

After her retirement from opera, Price continued to appear in recitals and orchestral concerts until 1997. After that, she would come out of retirement to sing at special events, including a memorial concert at Carnegie Hall, in 2001 for victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Among her many honors and awards are the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964, in addition to her 13 Grammy Awards.

==Life and career==
===Youth and schooling===
Mary Violet Leontyne Price was born in Laurel, Mississippi, on February 10, 1927. Her father, James Anthony, worked as a carpenter and her mother, Katherine Baker Price, was a midwife. A deeply religious family, both of her parents were children of Methodist ministers; her mother sang as a soloist in the church choir and her father played a tuba in the church band. Her brother and only sibling, George, was born two years later. She showed a natural affinity for music at an early age and began piano lessons at the age of three and a half with the local pianist Hattie McInnis. Initially, she played on a toy piano, but by the time she was five, her parents traded in the family phonograph as the down payment on an upright piano. Meanwhile, at the age of eight, she had begun visiting the home of Alexander and Elizabeth Chisholm, a wealthy white family for whom Leontyne&#x27;s aunt worked as a laundress. Leontyne and George became good friends with the Chisholms&#x27; older daughters, Jean and Peggy, and Mrs. Chisholm encouraged Leontyne&#x27;s piano-playing and singing, often inviting her to sing at house parties. Aged nine, she was taken on a school trip to hear Marian Anderson sing a recital in Jackson. The experience was her first significant exposure to classical music, and she later recalled: &quot;The whole aura of the occasion had a tremendous effect on me, particularly the singer&#x27;s dignity and, of course, her voice.&quot; Multiple commentators asserted that this event galvanized Price&#x27;s interest in a musical career. In her teen years, Price attended Oak Park Vocational High School, where she was a cheerleader and salutatorian. She earned extra money by singing for funerals and civic functions.
Mississippi was highly segregated at the time, and subject to Jim Crow laws. As such, as a Black woman, the only evident musical career path was as a teacher. She began her study in music education at Central State University, a historically Black school in Wilberforce, Ohio. However, on the advice of the university president and after frequent singing in a glee club she changed her major to voice in her third year. She also participated in master classes, including one in 1948 with the renowned bass Paul Robeson at Antioch College. Robeson was impressed by Price&#x27;s voice, and—knowing she was aiming to enroll at Juilliard—worked with the Central State administrators to host a benefit concert to help raise money for her tuition. The Chisholms also remained supportive of Price, and gifted the bulk of the money needed for Juilliard.

Price entered the studio of Florence Page Kimball in the fall of 1948. While studying at Juilliard that year, she lived in the Harlem YWCA, which was safe and affordable accommodation open to Black women. In her second year, she heard Ljuba Welitsch sing &quot;Salome&quot; from the standing-room section at the Met and became fascinated by opera. In fall 1950, Price joined Juilliard&#x27;s Opera Workshop and sang small roles in workshop performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot; (First Lady) and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; (Aunt Nella). In the summer of 1951, she enrolled in the opera program at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood and sang Ariadne in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (second cast).

===Early career===
In early 1952, Price performed as Mistress Ford in a Juilliard production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. Virgil Thomson heard a performance and cast her in a revival of his all-black opera, &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;. After two weeks on Broadway, the production of &quot;Saints&quot; went to Paris, France. Meanwhile, Price had been signed to sing Bess in a new production of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; at the Ziegfeld Theatre, directed by Robert Breen.
Fresh off the plane from Paris, she sang the opening performance of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; at the State Fair of Texas on June 9, 1952, receiving rave reviews. The production played in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Washington, D.C., and then toured Vienna, Berlin, London, and Paris, under the auspices of the U.S. State Department.

On the eve of the European tour, Price married William Warfield, her Porgy and a noted bass-baritone concert singer. The ceremony took place at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, with many in the cast in attendance.

Although many Black newspapers criticized the export of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; as presenting a false and demeaning picture of Black life, the Breen production showed off a new generation of highly trained Black singers, and affirmed that Americans could revive a musical masterpiece, while recognizing its outdated stereotypes. Many East Berliners crossed to West Berlin to see the show, to the degree that the State Department ordered that East German currency be accepted at face value instead of the current exchange rate.

When &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; returned to the States in 1953, Warfield was unable to adjust a busy recital and concert schedule and was dropped from the cast, while Price sang Bess for another year, on Broadway and a second US tour. Warfield said the episode put a strain on their young marriage. The couple was legally separated in 1967, and divorced in 1973. They had no children.

Price and Warfield both dreamt of careers in opera, but racism limited opportunities for Black singers. The New York City Center Opera under Laszlo Halasz had hired the first Black singers in leading roles in the mid-1940s, starting with Camilla Williams and Todd Duncan. In 1949, the new general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, Rudolf Bing, had said publicly he would cast Negro singers &quot;for the right part&quot;.

The Metropolitan Opera recognized Price&#x27;s potential by inviting her to sing &quot;Summertime&quot; at a &quot;Met Jamboree&quot; fund-raiser on April 6, 1953, at the Ritz Theater on Broadway. Price was thus the first African American to sing &quot;with&quot; and &quot;for&quot; the Met, if not &quot;at&quot; the Met as a member of the company. That distinction went to Marian Anderson, who sang Ulrica in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; on January 7, 1955. Price and Warfield were in the audience.

While awaiting a chance to sing in opera, Price sang duo concerts with Warfield, and, after leaving &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, began a concert career for Columbia Artists. In 1953, she sang a recital at the Library of Congress, with composer Samuel Barber at the piano. The program included the world premiere of Barber&#x27;s &quot;Hermit Songs&quot;. In November 1954, Price made her formal recital debut at New York&#x27;s Town Hall.

===Emergence===

The door to opera opened through the young medium of television and the NBC Opera Theatre, with music director Peter Herman Adler. In January 1955, Price sang the title role in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, the first appearance by an African American in a leading role in televised opera. (Another Black soprano, Veronica Tyler, had sung in the NBC Opera chorus for several seasons.) Price went on to star in three other NBC Opera broadcasts, as Pamina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in 1956, as Madame Lidoine in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; the following years, and as Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1960. &quot;Tosca&quot; was not controversial. Price&#x27;s appearance had not been widely advertised by NBC, which had a policy of &quot;integration without identification&quot;, and the Jackson, Mississippi, NBC affiliate carried the broadcast signal to her home town of Laurel. However, &quot;Jet&quot; magazine noted that her appearance with tenor David Poleri, the Cavaradossi, marked a first TV broadcast with a mixed-racial couple, and her later NBC Opera broadcasts were boycotted by several NBC affiliates, most of them in the South, because of her race.

In March 1955, Price was taken by her agent to audition at Carnegie Hall for the Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan, who was touring with the Berlin Philharmonic. Impressed with her singing of &quot;Pace, pace, mio Dio&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, Karajan reportedly leapt to the stage to accompany Price himself. Declaring her &quot;an artist of the future&quot;, he asked to direct her future European operatic career.

After a successful Town Hall recital debut in November 1954, Price began touring the U.S. and Canada in recitals on the Columbia Artists roster, at first with the composer John La Montaine as her accompanist and then with David Garvey, who remained her pianistic partner until his death. In 1956, she and Garvey toured India and then, the next year, Australia, giving concerts and recitals for the U.S. State Department. On May 3, 1957, she performed Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; in a concert performance with the Philadelphia Orchestra at the May Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan, her first public performance of what became her signature role.

Her first performance at a major opera house was at the San Francisco Opera on September 20, 1957, as Madame Lidoine in the U.S. premiere of &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;. A few weeks later, she appeared as Aida on stage, substituting at the last minute for Antonietta Stella, who had suffered an appendicitis. Price&#x27;s European opera debut came in May 1958, again as Aida, at the Vienna State Opera with Karajan conducting. This was followed by performances of the role at the Royal Opera House in London (replacing Anita Cerquetti), and at the Arena di Verona.

The next fall, Price appeared as Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in San Francisco, with the Swedish tenor Jussi Björling. Then, returning to Vienna, she sang Aida and her first onstage Pamina. She gave a BBC television recital of American songs with Gerald Moore, and a concert of operatic scenes by Richard Strauss for BBC Radio, conducted by Adler. In Vienna, she made her first full opera recording for RCA, singing Donna Elvira in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf.

That summer, Price made her debut at the Salzburg Festival in Beethoven&#x27;s Missa solemnis, conducted by Karajan; recorded a second full opera, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, for RCA in Rome; then returned to Verona to sing &quot;Il trovatore&quot; with tenor Franco Corelli. Rudolf Bing was at one of the performances, and went backstage to invite Price and Corelli to make their Met debuts in the 1960–61 season.

That fall, Price made her Chicago Lyric Opera debut as Liu in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; with Birgit Nilsson in the title role, and sang Massenet&#x27;s Thaïs. Her Liu was well received while her Thaïs was considered stiff and mannered. On May 21, 1960, she sang for the first time at La Scala in Milan, again as Aida. The reception was tumultuous, and a Milanese critic wrote that &quot;our great Verdi would have found her the ideal Aida&quot;. She was the first African American to sing a &quot;prima donna&quot; role in Italy&#x27;s greatest opera house. (The African-American soprano Mattiwilda Dobbs had sung there two years earlier, in the &quot;seconda&quot; role of Elvira in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;.) In Salzburg that summer, Price sang her first Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, again with Karajan. She then returned to Vienna to appear first as Cio-Cio-San in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

===Metropolitan Opera===

Bing had made overtures to Price before, and in 1958 had invited her to sing two Aidas. She turned him down on the advice of Adler and others, who argued that she should wait until she had more repertoire under her belt and could arrive as a true prima donna. Adler also warned against arriving in the racially stereotypical role of Aida, an Ethiopian slave. In his autobiography, Warfield quotes Adler as saying: &quot;Leontyne is to be a great artist. When she makes her debut at the Met, she must do it as a lady, not a slave.&quot; Eventually, her first Met contract booked her for five roles in 1961, Leonora in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, Aida, Donna Anna, Liu, and Butterfly.

On January 27, 1961, Price and Franco Corelli made a triumphant joint debut in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. The performance ended with an ovation that was certainly one of the longest in Met history. A Met official said it lasted at least 35 minutes. Price said friends had timed it at 42 minutes, and that was the figure she used in her publicity.

In his review, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote that Price&#x27;s &quot;voice, warm and luscious, has enough volume to fill the house with ease, and she has a good technique to back up the voice itself. She even took the trills as written, and nothing in the part as Verdi wrote it gave her the least bit of trouble. She moves well and is a competent actress. But no soprano makes a career of acting. Voice is what counts, and voice is what Miss Price has.&quot;

Reviewers were less enthusiastic about Corelli, who was infuriated and told Bing the next day he would never sing with Price again. The outburst was soon forgotten, and Price and Corelli sang together often, at the Met, in Vienna, in Salzburg, and once, for Karajan&#x27;s version of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, in the recording studio. In recognition of her extraordinary first season at the Met, &quot;Time&quot; magazine put her on its cover, and ran a profile under the headline, &quot;A voice like a banner flying&quot;.

After Anderson, three black artists had preceded Price in leading roles at the Met: baritone Robert McFerrin (1955), soprano Gloria Davy (1956), and soprano Mattiwilda Dobbs (1958). However, none of them lasted as long or achieved such eminence. Price was a box-office hit (her performances in her first two seasons were almost all sold out), and the first to be asked to sing a season opening night, a true sign of prima donna status.

The opening in September 1961, in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, almost didn&#x27;t happen. That summer, a musicians&#x27; strike threatened and Bing, frustrated with the negotiations, canceled the season. Under pressure from the government, Bing and the musicians agreed to allow Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg to mediate a settlement.

For her first night, Price received enthusiastic reviews but during the second she confronted her first vocal crisis. In the middle of the second act, she slowly lost her voice and by the end of the scene she was shouting the words. The standby, soprano Dorothy Kirsten, was called and finished the performance. The newspapers said that Price was suffering a viral infection, but stress and the unsuitable weight of the role of Minnie played their parts.

After several weeks off, Price repeated Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; and then, after a &quot;Butterfly&quot; in December, which ended with the singer in tears, cleared her schedule and took a respite in Rome. The official word was that she had never fully recovered from the earlier virus. However, Price later said she was suffering from nervous exhaustion, having performed a schedule of history making intensity, without a vacation for several years. In April, now rested and in fine voice, she returned to the Met for her first Toscas and then joined the company&#x27;s spring tour for the first time in &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;Fanciulla&quot;. Recognizing that Price would have to be included on the tour, which would create problems for presenters in the segregated South, Bing declared that the Met would no longer perform to segregated houses, starting in 1962. Price gave the first performance by an African American to sing a leading role with the company in the South, singing &quot;Fanciulla&quot; in Dallas. Two years later, she sang Donna Anna in Atlanta, a first in the Deep South. Both performances occurred without incident.

Price was soon earning the Met&#x27;s top fee. By 1964, she was paid was $2,750 per performance, on a par with Joan Sutherland, Maria Callas, and Renata Tebaldi, according to the Met archives. Birgit Nilsson, who was older and unique in singing both Italian and Wagnerian roles, earned a little more, at $3,000 a performance.

Price remained active in Vienna, Milan, and Salzburg. She performed a famous &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in Salzburg in 1962, and Tosca, Donna Anna and Aida, in Vienna, most often with Karajan. She was also the soprano soloist in many of Karajan&#x27;s performances of Verdi&#x27;s Requiem.

After the first Met season, Price added seven roles to her repertoire over the next five years: Elvira in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;, Pamina, Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, Tatyana in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Amelia in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, Cleopatra in Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, and Leonora in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;.

====&quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;====

The most significant and certainly most troubled milestone in her career was the opening night of the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center on September 16, 1966, in Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, a new opera commissioned for the occasion. The composer had written the role of Cleopatra especially for Price, often visiting her at home to run through new pages of the score.

In reviews of the premiere, Price&#x27;s singing was highly praised. However, the opera was considered a failure by many, who found the sequence of scenes confusing, the Shakespearean text unintelligible, and director Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s production suffocatingly elaborate. Zeffirelli buried an essentially intimate score under giant scenery, a movable pyramid and sphinx, innumerable supernumeraries, and two camels. Bing had overreached, too, by scheduling three other new productions in the first week in the new house, placing a burden on tech crews who were still learning how to run the new equipment and lighting. The chaotic final rehearsals, along with scenes of Price&#x27;s beautiful singing, were captured by &quot;cinema verite&quot; director Robert Drew in a documentary on &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, &quot;The New Met: Countdown to Curtain&quot;.

&quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; was never revived at the house. Barber prepared a concert suite of Cleopatra&#x27;s arias, which was premiered by Price in Washington, D.C., in 1968, and recorded for RCA.

Price later said the experience soured her feelings toward the Met. She began to appear there less often.

===Late opera career===
In the late 1960s, Price cut back her operatic performances and devoted more of her schedule to recitals and concerts. She said she was tired, stressed by racial tensions in the U.S., and frustrated with the number and quality of the new productions she&#x27;d been given at the Met. Her recitals and concerts (generally programs of arias with orchestra) were highly successful, and, for the next two decades, she was a mainstay in the major orchestral and concert series in the major American cities and universities.

She realized she needed to maintain some visibility in opera as well, and she returned to the Met and the San Francisco Opera, her favorite house, for short runs of three to five performances, sometimes a year or more apart.

In October 1973, she returned to the Met to sing a triumphant &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; for the first time in a decade. In 1976, she was at the heart of a long-promised new production of &quot;Aida&quot; at the Met, with James McCracken as Radames and Marilyn Horne as Amneris, directed by John Dexter.

At the same time, she was cautious – some said too cautious – in choosing new roles, conscious of her need to keep her reputation as a leading prima donna intact. After 1970, she performed only three new roles: Giorgetta in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Il tabarro&quot; in San Francisco; Puccini&#x27;s Manon Lescaut, in San Francisco and New York; and the title role in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, also in San Francisco and New York. Of these, only &quot;Ariadne&quot; was considered by critics as superlative.

She appeared even more rarely in opera in Europe. In the early 1970s, she sang Aida and a single &quot;Forza&quot; in Hamburg, and returned to London&#x27;s Covent Garden in &quot;Trovatore&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot;. However, she gave well received recitals in Hamburg, Vienna, Paris, and at the Salzburg Festival. At the latter she became a special favorite, appearing there in 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, and 1984.

In 1976, after almost a decade, she renewed her partnership with Karajan in a performance of Brahms&#x27; &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall. This was followed by a nostalgic revival of their famous 1962 &quot;Il trovatore&quot; production in Vienna and Salzburg, followed by a recording for EMI, all led by Karajan.

That fall, Price sang her her first Strauss heroine: Ariadne in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; The premiere in San Francisco was considered a great success. When she sang the role at the Met in 1979, she was suffering from a viral infection and canceled all but the first and last of eight scheduled performances. Reviewing the first performance, the &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John Rockwell was not complimentary.
In the U.S., her beautiful voice, personal dignity, and well known patriotism made her an iconic American, who was called to sing on important national or ceremonial occasions. In January 1973, she sang &quot;Precious Lord, Take My Hand&quot; and &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; at the state funeral of President Lyndon B. Johnson. (She had sung at his inauguration in 1965.) In 1980, President Jimmy Carter invited her to sing at the White House for the visit of Pope John Paul II and at the state dinner after the signing of the Camp David Peace Accords.

In 1978, Carter had invited her to sing a recital from the East Room of the White House that was nationally televised and won an Emmy.

In 1982, she sang &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; before a Joint Meeting of Congress on the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

On July 4, 1983, she sang with the National Philharmonic on the Capitol Mall, and in fall 1986, Price sang the national anthem backed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic on Orange County Performing Arts Center&#x27;s opening.

Price also sang for Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton.

Her voice proved resilient as she entered her 50s. In the fall of 1981, she had a late triumph in San Francisco when she stepped in for an ailing Margaret Price as Aida, a role she had not sung since 1976. The Radames was Luciano Pavarotti, in his first assumption of the role. Herbert Caen of the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Price had insisted on being paid $1 more than the tenor. That would have made her, for the moment, the highest-paid opera singer in the world. The opera house denied the arrangement.

In 1982, Price returned to the Met as Leonora in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, a role she hadn&#x27;t sung in the house since 1969. She also sang a televised concert of duets and arias with Marilyn Horne and conductor James Levine, later released on record by RCA. In 1983, she hosted two televised performances of &quot;In Performance at the White House&quot;. with President Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and sang the &quot;Ballo&quot; duet with Pavarotti in the 100th anniversary concert of the Metropolitan Opera.

She had considered her 1982 Met appearances her unannounced final opera performances, but the Met&#x27;s James Levine persuaded her to return for several &quot;Forza&quot;s in 1984 and a series of &quot;Aida&quot;s in 1984–1985. Performances of both operas were broadcast in the &quot;Live from the Met&quot; TV series on PBS. These were her first and only appearances in the series and important documents of two of her greatest roles.

Shortly before her final &quot;Aida&quot;, on January 3, 1985, word leaked that it was to be her operatic farewell. The performance ended with 25 minutes of applause and the singer&#x27;s photograph on the front page of the local edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The paper&#x27;s critic Donal Henahan wrote that the &quot;57-year-old soprano took an act or two to warm to her work, but what she delivered in the Nile Scene turned out to be well worth the wait.&quot; In 2007, PBS viewers voted her singing of the act 3 aria, &quot;O patria mia&quot;, as the no. 1 &quot;Great Moment&quot; in 30 years of &quot;Live from the Met&quot; telecasts. One critic described Price&#x27;s voice as &quot;vibrant&quot;, &quot;soaring&quot; and &quot;a Price beyond pearls&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called her voice &quot;Rich, supple and shining, it was in its prime capable of effortless soaring from a smoky mezzo to the pure soprano gold of a perfectly spun high C.&quot;

In 21 seasons with the Met, Price gave 201 performances, in 16 roles, in the house and on tour. After her 1961 debut season, she was absent for three seasons—1970–71, 1977–78, and 1980–81; and sang only in galas in 1972–73, 1979–80, and 1982–83.

===Post-operatic career===

For the next dozen years, Price continued to perform concerts and recitals in the U.S. Her recital programs, arranged by her longtime accompanist David Garvey, usually combined Handel arias or &quot;arie antiche&quot;, &quot;Lieder&quot; by Schumann and Joseph Marx, an operatic aria or two, followed by French &quot;mélodies&quot;, a group of American art songs by Barber, Ned Rorem, and Lee Hoiby, and spirituals. She liked to end her encores with &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot;, which she said was her mother&#x27;s favorite spiritual.

Over time, Price&#x27;s voice became darker and heavier, but the upper register held up extraordinarily well and her conviction and sheer delight in singing always spilled over the footlights. On November 19, 1997, she sang a recital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that was her unannounced last.

In her later years, Price gave master classes at Juilliard and other schools. In 1997, at the suggestion of RCA Victor, she wrote a children&#x27;s book version of &quot;Aida&quot;, which became the basis for the hit Broadway musical by Elton John and Tim Rice in 2000.

Price avoided the term African American, preferring to call herself an American, even a &quot;chauvinistic American&quot;. She summed up her philosophy thus: &quot;If you are going to think black, think positive about it. Don&#x27;t think down on it, or think it is something in your way. And this way, when you really do want to stretch out, and express how beautiful black is, everybody will hear you.&quot;

On September 30, 2001, at the age of 74, Price came out of retirement to sing in a memorial concert at Avery Fisher Hall for the victims of the September 11 attacks. She sang &quot;a cappella&quot; the spiritual &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; and then &quot;God Bless America&quot;, ending this with a bright, easy high B-flat.

In 2017, the age of 90, Price appeared in Susan Froemke&#x27;s &quot;The Opera House&quot;, a documentary about the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center in 1966.

==Awards==
Among her many honors and awards are the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1964), the Spingarn Medal (1965), the Kennedy Center Honors (1980), the National Medal of Arts (1985), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1986), numerous honorary degrees, and 13 Grammy Awards for operatic and song recitals and full operas, and a Lifetime Achievement Award, more than any other classical singer. In October 2008, she was among the first recipients of the Opera Honors by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2019, Leontyne Price was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Boston Conservatory at Berklee.

==Recordings==

Most of Price&#x27;s many commercial recordings were made by RCA Victor Red Seal and include three complete recordings of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (the final one for EMI), two of &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, two of &quot;Aida&quot;, two of Verdi&#x27;s Requiem, two of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, and one each of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot; and &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Il tabarro&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Cosí fan tutte&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (as Donna Elvira), and R. Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, her final complete opera recording. She also recorded a disc of highlights from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, with William Warfield as Porgy, conducted by Skitch Henderson, with Price singing the music all three female leads.

Her most popular aria collection is her first, titled &quot;Leontyne Price&quot;, a selection of Verdi and Puccini arias released by RCA Victor in 1961 and often referred to as the &quot;Blue Album&quot; for its light blue cover. It has been continuously in print, and is available on CD and SACD. Equally enduring is an album of Christmas music she recorded in 1961 with Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic.

Her five &quot;Prima Donna&quot; albums, recorded from 1965 to 1979, are an exceptional survey of operatic arias for soprano, mostly from roles Price never performed on stage. They are available in a boxed set of her complete RCA recital albums. She also recorded two albums of Richard Strauss arias, an album of French and German art songs, a Schumann song album, two albums of spirituals, a single crossover disc, &quot;Right as the Rain&quot;, with André Previn, and an album of patriotic songs, &quot;God Bless America&quot;. Her recordings of Barber&#x27;s &quot;Hermit Songs&quot;, scenes from &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, were brought together on a CD, &quot;Leontyne Price Sings Barber&quot;.

Late in her career, she recorded an album of Schubert and Strauss lieder for EMI, and, for Decca/London, an album of Verdi arias with the Israel Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta.

In 1996, RCA issued a limited-edition 11-CD boxed collection of Price&#x27;s recordings, with an accompanying book, titled &quot;The Essential Leontyne Price&quot;.

Meanwhile, archival recordings of several important live performances have been released on CD. Deutsche Grammophon has issued Salzburg performances of &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; (1959) and &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (1962), both conducted by Karajan. In 2002, RCA released a long-shelved tape of her 1965 Carnegie Hall recital debut in its &quot;Rediscoveries&quot; series. It includes a rare performance of Brahms&#x27; &quot;Zigeunerlieder&quot;. In 2005, the complete Library of Congress recital with Samuel Barber was released, on Bridge, and includes her only recorded performance of Henri Sauguet&#x27;s &quot;La Voyante&quot;, as well as songs by Poulenc and the world premiere of Barber&#x27;s &quot;Hermit Songs&quot;. A 1952 broadcast of a Berlin performance of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; with Price and Warfield was discovered in the German radio archives and released on CD.

In 2011, Sony launched its series of historic live broadcasts from the Met with &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (1961) and &quot;Tosca&quot; (1962), both with Price and Corelli, and, the next year, added an &quot;Ernani&quot; (1962) with Price and Carlo Bergonzi. In 2017, a broadcast &quot;Aida&quot; (1967), with Bergonzi and Bumbry, was released separately and in a boxed set of live performances from the company&#x27;s first season at Lincoln Center. The set includes the opening night performance of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

The major roles in Price&#x27;s repertoire that were never recorded in complete sets are Liu in Puccini&#x27;s&quot;Turandot&quot; and Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. For these, live performances are available. Price&#x27;s Salzburg performances of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1960 and 1961, and a 1963 Vienna performance (with Fritz Wunderlich), all three under Karajan, are available on CD. Her Liu can be heard in a live &quot;Turandot&quot; from Vienna from 1961, on CD.

During the 1970s, RCA cut back on recording operas and recitals and much of Price&#x27;s recital repertoire went unrecorded, including songs by Rachmaninoff, Poulenc, Respighi, Barber, Lee Hoiby, and Ned Rorem. A broadcast tape of the 1956 premiere of John La Montaine&#x27;s cycle of songs, &quot;Songs of the Rose of Sharon&quot;, written for soprano and orchestra, has been found and posted on YouTube.

Among recent discoveries are a 1952 Juilliard performance of &quot;Falstaff&quot;, a Juilliard recital from 1951, and another recital given at Juilliard in 1955, Price&#x27;s first year on the concert circuit. (The 1951 recital includes her only recording of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Scheherezade&quot;, with piano accompaniment.) All three were available on YouTube. Kinescopes of NBC Opera Theatre performances are locked in NBC vaults and have never been released on disc or videotape.

==Reception==
In &quot;The Grand Tradition&quot;, a 1974 history of operatic recording, the British critic J. B. Steane writes that &quot;one might conclude from recordings that [Price] is the best interpreter of Verdi of the century&quot;. The Russian soprano Galina Vishnevskaya remembered a 1963 Price performance of Tosca at the Vienna State Opera &quot;left me with the strongest impression I have ever gotten from opera&quot;. In his 1983 autobiography, Plácido Domingo writes: &quot;The power and sensuousness of Leontyne&#x27;s voice were phenomenal—the most beautiful Verdi soprano I have ever heard.&quot;
The sopranos Renée Fleming, Kiri Te Kanawa, Jessye Norman, Leona Mitchell, Barbara Bonney, Sondra Radvanovsky, the mezzo-sopranos Janet Baker and Denyce Graves, bass-baritone José van Dam, and the countertenor David Daniels, spoke of Price as an inspiration.

Jazz musicians were impressed too. Miles Davis, in &quot;Miles: The Autobiography&quot;, writes: &quot;Man, I love her as an artist. I love the way she sings &quot;Tosca&quot;. I wore out her recording of that, wore out two sets. Now, I might not do &quot;Tosca&quot;, but I loved the way Leontyne did it. I used to wonder how she would have sounded if she had sung jazz. She should be an inspiration for every musician, Black or White. I know she is to me.&quot;

She has also had her critics. In his book &quot;The American Opera Singer&quot;, Peter G. Davis writes that Price had &quot;a fabulous vocal gift that went largely unfulfilled&quot;, criticizing her reluctance to try new roles, her Tosca for its lack of a &quot;working chest register&quot;, and her late Aidas for a &quot;swooping&quot; vocal line. Others criticized her lack of flexibility in coloratura, and her occasional mannerisms, including scooping or swooping up to high notes, gospel-style. Karajan took her to task for these during rehearsals for the 1977 &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, as Price herself related in an interview in &quot;Diva&quot;, by Helena Matheopoulos. In later recordings and appearances, she sang with a cleaner line.

Her acting, too, drew different responses over a long career. As Bess, she was praised for her dramatic fire and sensuality, and tapes of the early NBC Opera appearances demonstrate an appealing presence on camera. In her early years at the Met, she was often praised for her stage presence as well as her vocal skill.

In March 2007, on &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;″s list of the &quot;20 All-time Best Sopranos&quot; based on a poll of 21 British music critics and BBC presenters, Leontyne Price was ranked fourth, after Maria Callas, Joan Sutherland, and Victoria de los Ángeles.

<text>Edward Philip George Seaga ( ; 28 May 1930 – 28 May 2019) was a Jamaican politician and record producer. He was the fifth Prime Minister of Jamaica, from 1980 to 1989, and the leader of the Jamaica Labour Party from 1974 to 2005. He served as leader of the opposition from 1974 to 1980, and again from 1989 until January 2005.

His retirement from political life marked the end of Jamaica&#x27;s founding generation in active politics. He was the last serving politician to have entered public life before independence in 1962, as he was appointed to the Legislative Council (now the Senate) in 1959. Seaga is credited with having built the financial and planning infrastructure of the country after independence, as well as having developed its arts and crafts, and awareness of national heritage.

As a record producer and record company owner of West Indies Records Limited, Seaga also played a major role in the development of the Jamaican music industry. Seaga died on 28 May 2019, on his eighty-ninth birthday.

==Early life==
Edward Philip George Seaga was born on 28 May 1930, in Boston, Massachusetts, United States to Philip George Seaga, who was of Lebanese Jamaican descent, and Erna (née Maxwell), who was Jamaican of African, Scottish and Indian descent. Erna was the daughter of Elizabeth Campbell (maiden name), daughter of John Zungaroo Campbell. Phillip Seaga had moved to the US seeking to take advantage of the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, but the Wall Street crash of 1929 scotched those dreams. Three months after Edward&#x27;s birth in Boston, the Seagas returned to Jamaica. He was baptised in Kingston&#x27;s Anglican Parish Church on 5 December 1930.

The young Seaga was educated at Wolmer&#x27;s Boys&#x27;, one of the Wolmer&#x27;s Schools in Jamaica. He went to the United States for higher education, graduating from Harvard University in 1952 with a Bachelor of Arts (Harvard AB) degree in the Social Sciences. Before embarking on his political career, Seaga was a music producer and promoter. He subsequently took a research post at the University of the West Indies.

==Music industry career==
Seaga&#x27;s research led to an interest in popular Jamaican music. In 1955, he supervised the recording of an album of ethnic Jamaican music. He continued to produce recordings by other artists and in the late 1950s set up West Indies Records Limited, releasing early recordings by artists such as Higgs and Wilson and Byron Lee &amp; the Dragonaires. Beginning in 1961, Seaga lived in West Kingston. He became deeply involved in its music scene and recorded some of its artists.

West Indies Records Limited became the most successful record company in the West Indies. After being elected in 1962 as a Member of Parliament, representing the Jamaica Labour Party, he sold the company to Byron Lee. It was renamed Dynamic Sounds.

Over 16 years, Seaga worked on compiling a collection of Jamaican music covering the period from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s. This anthology, &quot;Reggae Golden Jubilee Origins of Jamaican Music&quot;, was released on 6 November 2012 in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Jamaican independence.

==Early political career==
Seaga&#x27;s political career began in 1959 when Alexander Bustamante, founder of the JLP, nominated him to serve in the Upper House of the Jamaican Parliament, the Legislative Council (later the Senate). His appointment at the age of 29 made him the youngest member ever appointed to the Legislative Council. While he was in the Senate, Seaga made his well-reported speech about the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;.

As one of the founding fathers in the framing of the Jamaican Constitution in 1961, Seaga spearheaded far-reaching constitutional reforms. He initiated a re-write of the human rights section of the Constitution, to provide for a Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms; creation of the post of Public Defender; and curtailment of some of the powers of the Prime Minister to provide a better balance of power between the executive and the parliament in the Jamaican system of governance.

In April 1962, Seaga was elected Member of Parliament for West Kingston, the waterfront area in the capital city. Historically, it has been the oldest settlement in Kingston for poor, working-class residents, many of whom are unemployed. Employment is largely petty trading with some semi-skilled craftsmen. He held that seat for 43 consecutive years, until he retired, making him the longest-serving Member of Parliament in the history of Jamaica and the Caribbean region. He is the only person to have been elected as Member of Parliament for West Kingston for more than one term, and won 10 consecutive terms.

Immediately after winning his seat in 1962, Seaga was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Development and Welfare, with responsibility for all areas of planning, social development and culture. He initiated the redevelopment of Back O&#x27;Wall, a notorious large slum in West Kingston, and its replacement by housing, schools and community amenities, which was named Tivoli Gardens.

Seaga also used his position to continue to promote Jamaican music.

Following the 1967 Jamaican general election, Seaga was appointed Minister of Finance and Planning. In 1964, Seaga championed the cause calling for the return of the remains of Marcus Garvey to Jamaica. However, four years later, Seaga was a part of the Cabinet of prime minister Hugh Shearer that banned Walter Rodney from Jamaica for allegedly stirring up racial hatred.

In the 1972 Jamaican general election, the PNP led by Michael Manley won 37 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 16, and Shearer and Seaga were swept out of power. In 1974 he became Leader of the JLP, a post he held for 30 years; he was also Leader of the Parliamentary Opposition in various periods. In the 1976 Jamaican general election, the PNP won another landslide, winning 47 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 13. The turnout was a very high 85 percent.

There was a lot of political violence in the 1970s. This allegedly started in 1975, after Henry Kissinger failed in his attempts to get Manley to stop his support for Cuba and Angola, and their fight against the armies of apartheid South Africa. According to former CIA agent turned Marxist Philip Agee, the CIA supplied arms to supporters of the JLP, and there was a significant upturn in political violence; Seaga repeatedly denied the accusation. The 1980 Jamaican general election featured considerable violence including running gun-battles, and would be won by the JLP in a landslide.

==Prime minister==

Edward P.G. Seaga became Prime Minister of Jamaica following 30 October 1980 general election, when the JLP won a landslide victory over the incumbent PNP, with the largest mandate until 1993, when the PNP surpassed that total. Out of 60 seats contested in 1980, the JLP won 51 seats to the PNP&#x27;s nine.

The mandate of Seaga and the JLP was renewed in the uncontested 1983 General Elections. He continued as prime minister until February 1989.

Widely regarded as the most influential Jamaican Prime Minister, Seaga was a controversial figure. His supporters claim that he &#x27;saved&#x27; Jamaica from communism, while others assert that he &#x27;mash up&#x27; Jamaica. Columnist and attorney-at-law Daniel Thwaites said that while these diametrically opposed sentiments run to the extremes, both are surprisingly prevalent. &quot;It is a barometer of the lasting contentiousness and potential divisiveness of any appraisal of Papa Eddie&quot;, Thwaites said, arguing that the only other figure in Jamaican political history who could possibly be as controversial as Seaga would be his nemesis, the late former Prime Minister Michael Manley. Thwaites said, &quot;because of their titanic decades-long confrontation, they will be forever – and, perhaps ironically – inextricably linked&quot;.

In terms of foreign policy, the Caribbean has long been seen as an unofficial &quot;backyard&quot; of the United States of America. In a region with such a complicated, intertwined history meshed with various world superpowers, the act of making decisions that can irrevocably effect the country is handled with care. Understanding the threat associated with communism, Seaga reversed the hands of friendship extended by Manley to Cuba and Grenada, two countries that had adopted strong anti-American stances during the Russo-American political standoff of the 70s and 80s. In an attempt to steer his country into the clear, he was forced into adopting an alliance with world leaders such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Seaga cut ties with Cuba shortly after winning the 1980 election, and he, as the representative of the strongest Caribbean nation, indirectly acknowledged the Caribbean&#x27;s support for the US invasion of Grenada in 1983. In doing so, Seaga is credited with preventing the eradication of Jamaica economically and saving the country from a path leading to shackling sanctions like Cuba or a foreign invasion to eliminate communism as seen in Grenada.

In the 1980s, the Seaga administration became embroiled in accusations of a dark circle of narco-banking involving the contras of Nicaragua, the CIA and the Israeli money-launderer Eli Tisona. Seaga&#x27;s Agro 21 programme was accused of involvement in cocaine trafficking from Colombia, and its Spring Plains project employed Shower Posse&#x27;s Lester Coke, a.k.a. Jim Brown, as Head of Security. However, these allegations went unproven, with all investigations coming up blank.

==Leader of the Opposition==

Seaga served as Leader of Opposition from 1974 to 1980. The JLP was defeated in a landslide by Manley&#x27;s PNP in the 1989 Jamaican general election, by a margin of 45 seats to 15, and Seaga returned to a long spell as Leader of Opposition.

Seaga went on to lead the JLP to defeat in a number of subsequent elections against a PNP led by P.J. Patterson. In the 1993 Jamaican general election, the PNP won 52 seats to the JLP&#x27;s eight seats, while in the 1997 Jamaican general election, the PNP won 50 of the 60 seats available. Patterson&#x27;s third consecutive victory came in the 2002 Jamaican general election, when the PNP retained power, but with a reduced seat majority of 34 seats to 26. Patterson stepped down on 26 February 2006, and was replaced by Portia Simpson-Miller, Jamaica&#x27;s first female prime minister.

During this period of time, he suffered leadership challenges from a number of his colleagues, such as the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; of Errol Anderson, Edmund Bartlett, Karl Samuda, Douglas Vaz, and Pearnel Charles. In 1995, Bruce Golding left the JLP to form a new party, the National Democratic Movement (NDM).

In 2002, Golding rejoined the JLP and in November 2003 was again elected chairman of the party. He was elected leader of the JLP, and also the leader of the opposition, on 20 February 2005, succeeding Seaga.

<text>ANSEL, the American National Standard for Extended Latin Alphabet Coded Character Set for Bibliographic Use, was a character set used in text encoding. It provided a table of coded values for the representation of characters of the extended Latin alphabet in machine-readable form for thirty-five languages written in the Latin alphabet and for fifty-one romanized languages. ANSEL adds 63 graphic characters to ASCII, including 29 combining diacritic characters.

The initial revision of ANSEL was released in 1985, and before 1993 it was registered as Registration #231 in the ISO International Register of Coded Character Sets to be Used with Escape Sequences. The standard was reaffirmed in 2003 although it has been administratively withdrawn by ANSI effective 14 February 2013.

The requirement of hardware capable of overprinting accents doomed this from ever becoming a popular extended ASCII.

==Code page layout==

The following table shows ANSI/NISO Z39.47-1993 (R2003). Non-ASCII characters are shown with their Unicode code point. A combining diacritic &quot;precedes&quot; the spacing character on which it should be superimposed (in Unicode the combining diacritic is &quot;after&quot; the base character).

==Use==

===GEDCOM===
The GEDCOM specification for exchanging genealogical data refers to ANSEL (ANSI/NISO Z39.47-1985) as a valid text encoding for GEDCOM files and extends it with additional characters which are shown in the following table.

===MARC21===
The Extended Latin character set from MARC 21 is synchronized with ANSEL but additionally supports the eszett (ß) character at C7 and the euro sign (€) at C8.

<text>The Royal Corps of Signals (often simply known as the Royal Signals – abbreviated to R SIGNALS) is one of the combat support arms of the British Army. Signals units are among the first into action, providing the battlefield communications and information systems essential to all operations. Royal Signals units provide the full telecommunications infrastructure for the Army wherever they operate in the world. The Corps has its own engineers, logistics experts and systems operators to run radio and area networks in the field. It is responsible for installing, maintaining and operating all types of telecommunications equipment and information systems, providing command support to commanders and their headquarters, and conducting electronic warfare against enemy communications.

==History==

===Origins===
In 1870, &#x27;C&#x27; Telegraph Troop, Royal Engineers, was founded under Captain Montague Lambert. The Troop was the first formal professional body of signallers in the British Army and its duty was to provide communications for a field army by means of visual signalling, mounted orderlies and telegraph. By 1871, &#x27;C&#x27; Troop had expanded in size from 2 officers and 133 other ranks to 5 officers and 245 other ranks. In 1879, &#x27;C&#x27; Troop first saw action during the Anglo-Zulu War. On 1 May 1884, &#x27;C&#x27; Troop was amalgamated with the 22nd and 34th Companies, Royal Engineers, to form the Telegraph Battalion Royal Engineers; &#x27;C&#x27; Troop formed the 1st Division (Field Force, based at Aldershot) while the two Royal Engineers companies formed the 2nd Division (Postal and Telegraph, based in London). Signalling was the responsibility of the Telegraph Battalion until 1908, when the Royal Engineers Signal Service was formed. As such, it provided communications during the First World War. It was about this time that motorcycle despatch riders and wireless sets were introduced into service.

===Royal Warrant===
A Royal Warrant for the creation of a Corps of Signals was signed by the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill, on 28 June 1920. Six weeks later, King George V conferred the title Royal Corps of Signals.

===Subsequent history===
Before the Second World War, Royal Signals recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 2 inches tall. They initially enlisted for eight years with the colours and a further four years with the reserve. They trained at the Signal Training Centre at Catterick Camp and all personnel were taught to ride.

During the Second World War (1939–45), members of the Royal Corps of Signals served in every theatre of war. In one notable action, Corporal Thomas Waters of the 5th Parachute Brigade Signal Section was awarded the Military Medal for laying and maintaining the field telephone line under heavy enemy fire across the Caen Canal Bridge during the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944.
In the immediate post-war period, the Corps played a full and active part in numerous campaigns including Palestine, the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, Malaya and the Korean War. Until the end of the Cold War, the main body of the Corps was deployed with the British Army of the Rhine confronting Soviet Bloc forces, providing the British Forces&#x27; contribution to NATO with its communications infrastructure. Soldiers from the Royal Signals delivered communications in the Falklands War in 1982 and the first Gulf War in 1991.

In 1994, The Royal Corps of Signals moved its training regiments, 11th Signal Regiment (the Recruit Training Regiment) and 8th Signal Regiment (the Trade Training School), from Catterick Garrison to Blandford Camp.

In late 2012, 2nd (National Communications) Signal Brigade was disbanded. Soldiers from the Royal Corps of Signals saw extensive service during the eight years of the Iraq War before withdrawal of troops in 2011, and the 13 years of the War in Afghanistan before it ended in 2014.

Under Army 2020 Refine a number of changes planned for the Corps were made public in 2013-14. A presentation by the Master of Signals indicated that 16 Signal Regiment would shift from 11 Signal Brigade to 1 Signal Brigade and focus on supporting communications for logistic headquarters. Similarly, 32 and 39 Signal Regiments were planned to shift to 1 Signal Brigade. 15 Signal Regiment would no longer be focused on Information Systems but would support 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade, while 21 and 2 Signal Regiments were planned to support the 1st and second Strike Brigades respectively. Furthermore, a new regiment, 13th Signal Regiment, was planned to form up under 1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade and work with 14th Signal Regiment on cyber and electromagnetic activity.

In 2017 the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team, then in its 90th year, was disbanded; senior officers had complained that it &quot;failed to reflect the modern-day cyber communication skills in which the Royal Signals are trained&quot;.

On 28 June 2020, the Royal Corps of Signals marked the 100th anniversary of its foundation. Constrained by COVID-19 rules, many Royal Signals 100 celebrations were organised online, including the #100for100 challenge that involved hundreds of members of the Corps running 100 km for the Royal Signals Charity. The Princess Royal, the Colonel-In-Chief of the Corps, delivered a video message of congratulations, and the Foreman of Signals Course students successfully took a photograph of the Royal Signals 100 badge in space, completing a challenge that was set for them.

==Personnel==

===Training and trades===
Royal Signals officers receive general military training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, followed by specialist communications training at the Royal School of Signals, Blandford Camp, Dorset. Other ranks are trained both as field soldiers and tradesmen. Their basic military training is delivered at the Army Training Regiment at Winchester or Army Training Centre Pirbright before undergoing trade training at 11th (Royal School of Signals) Signal Regiment. There are currently six different trades available to other ranks, each of which is open to both men and women:

* Cyber Information Services Engineer: trained in programming, database, web and app development, data communications and computer networks
* Cyber Networks Engineer: trained in data communications, computer networks, military radio and trunk communications systems
* Cyber Infrastructure Engineer: trained in installing and repairing fibre optic and copper voice and data networks in both internal and external environments 
* Power Engineer: trained to prepare, engineer and maintain complex Power Distribution Systems worldwide
* Supply Chain Operative: trained in all aspects of logistics, including driving, warehouse management and accounting
* Electronic Warfare &amp; Signals Intelligence Operative: trained to intercept voice and data communications, to provide tactical electro-magnetic, cyber and signals intelligence on the battlefield and close tactical support to and advice to bomb disposal units

On selection for promotion to Sergeant, soldiers may choose to volunteer for selection to a Supervisory roster. Currently there are 4 Supervisor roles:
*Yeoman of Signals – trained in the planning and deployment and management of military tactical/strategic communications networks;
*Yeoman of Signals (Electronic Warfare) – trained in the planning, deployment and management of military tactical/strategic electronic warfare assets;
*Foreman of Signals – trained in the installation, maintenance, repair and interoperability of military tactical/strategic communications assets;
*Foreman of Signals (Information Systems) – trained in the installation, maintenance, repair and interoperability of military tactical/strategic Information Systems

If a soldier chooses not to follow the Supervisor route, they will remain employed &#x27;in trade&#x27; until promoted to Warrant Officer, where they will then be classed as on the Regimental Duty (RD) roster and will oversee the daily routine, and administration of a unit&#x27;s personnel and equipment.

==Museum==
The Royal Signals Museum is based at Blandford Camp in Dorset.

==Dress and ceremonial==

===Tactical Recognition flash===
The Corps wears a blue and white tactical recognition flash. This is worn horizontally on the right arm with the blue half charging forward.

===Cap badge===
The flag and cap badge feature Mercury (Latin: &quot;Mercurius&quot;), the winged messenger of the gods, who is referred to by members of the corps as &quot;Jimmy&quot;. The origins of this nickname are unclear. According to one explanation, the badge is referred to as &quot;Jimmy&quot; because the image of Mercury was based on the late mediaeval bronze statue by the Italian sculptor Giambologna, and shortening his name over time reduced it to &quot;Jimmy&quot;. The most widely accepted origin is a Royal Signals boxer, Jimmy Emblen, who was the British Army Champion in 1924 and represented the Royal Corps of Signals from 1921 to 1924.

===Lanyard===
On No 2, No 4 and No 14 Dress, the Corps wears a dark blue lanyard on the right side signifying its early links with the Royal Engineers. The Airborne Signals Unit wears a drab green lanyard made from parachute cord.

===Motto===
The Corps motto is &quot;certa cito&quot;, often translated from Latin as &quot;Swift and Sure&quot; .

===Appointments===
The Colonel-in-Chief is currently The Princess Royal.

==Equipment==

The Corps deploys and operates a broad range of specialist military and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) communications systems. The main categories are as follows:
*Satellite ground terminals
*Terrestrial trunk radio systems
*Combat net radio systems
*Computer networks
*Specialist military applications (computer programmes)

==Units==

===Brigades===

There are now two signal brigades:

* 1st Signal Brigade: The Brigade Headquarters is co-located at Imjin Barracks, Innsworth, outside Gloucester, with HQ ARRC (NATO&#x27;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps).

<doc id="410450" wikidata="Q206979" url="?curid=410450" title="Civil Constitution of the Clergy">
<text>The Civil Constitution of the Clergy () was a law passed on 12 July 1790 during the French Revolution, that sought the complete control over the Catholic Church in France by the French government. As a result, a schism was created, resulting in an illegal and underground French Catholic Church loyal to the Papacy, and a &quot;constitutional church&quot; that was subservient to the State. The schism was not fully resolved until 1801. King Louis XVI ultimately granted Royal Assent to the measure after originally opposing it, but later expressed regret for having done so.

Earlier legislation had already arranged the confiscation of the Catholic Church&#x27;s land holdings and banned monastic vows. This new law completed the destruction of the monastic orders, outlawing &quot;all regular and secular chapters for either sex, abbacies and priorships, both regular and &quot;in commendam&quot;, for either sex&quot;. It also sought to settle the chaos caused by the earlier confiscation of Church lands and the abolition of tithes. Additionally, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy regulated the current dioceses so that they could become more uniform and aligned with the administrative districts that had recently been created. It emphasised that officials of the Church could not give their loyalty to anyone outside the First French Republic, specifically meaning the Papacy. Lastly, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy made bishops and priests elected. By having members of the clergy elected, those clergy within who accepted the State&#x27;s terms lost their independence and were now subject to the State, since their parishioners would vote on the priest and bishops as opposed to these individuals being appointed by the Church hierarchy.

The Civil Constitution of the Clergy was passed and some of the support for this came from figures that were within the Church, such as the priest and parliamentarian Pierre Claude François Daunou, and, above all, the revolutionary priest Henri Grégoire, who was the first French Catholic priest to take the Obligatory Oath. However, almost all bishops opposed the law and refused to take the loyalty oath it required. Over half of lower clergy also refused.

The law was extremely divisive and proved to be a turning point in the French Revolution. Historian Hilaire Belloc described it as a failure that &quot;lit the civil war&quot; that would occur in the following years.

==Document outline ==

The Civil Constitution of the Clergy has four titles with different articles.
* The document begins with an introduction on why the document was written.
* Title I focuses on the dioceses and how they were to be administered.
* Title II focuses on the administration of the dioceses and how elections were to take place.
* Title III focuses on payment because the Clergy was a salaried employee of the State.
* Title IV focuses on the living requirements for bishops, parish priests, and the curates.

==Status of the Church in France before the Civil Constitution==
Even before the Revolution and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the Catholic Church in France (the Gallican Church) had a status that tended to subordinate the Church to the State. Under the Declaration of the Clergy of France (1682) privileges of the French monarch included the right to assemble church councils in their dominions and to make laws and regulations touching ecclesiastical matters of the Church or to have recourse to the &quot;appeal as from an abuse&quot; (&quot;appel comme d&#x27;abus&quot;) against acts of the ecclesiastical power.
Even prior to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:
* On 11 August 1789 tithes were abolished.
* On 2 November 1789, Catholic Church property that was held for purposes of church revenue was nationalized, and was used as the backing for the &quot;assignats&quot;.
* On 13 February 1790, monastic vows were forbidden and all ecclesiastical orders and congregations were dissolved, excepting those devoted to teaching children and nursing the sick.
* On 19 April 1790, administration of all remaining church property was transferred to the State.

==Motivation of the Civil Constitution==
The following interlinked factors appear to have been the causes of agitation for the confiscation of church lands and for the adoption of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:
# The French government in 1790 was nearly bankrupt; this fiscal crisis had been the original reason for the king&#x27;s calling the Estates General in 1789.
# The Church owned about six percent of the land in France. In addition the Church collected tithes.
#* The Church used the six percent of the land they owned for a multitude of purposes which included churches, monasteries, convents, schools, hospitals, and other establishments which served the people of France.
# Owing, in part, to abuses of this system (especially for patronage), there was enormous resentment of the Church, taking the various forms of atheism, anticlericalism, and anti-Catholicism.
# Many of the revolutionaries viewed the Catholic Church as a retrograde force.
# At the same time, there was enough support for a basically Catholic form of Christianity that some means had to be found to fund the Church in France.

==Debate over the Civil Constitution==
On 6 February 1790, one week before banning monastic vows, the National Constituent Assembly asked its ecclesiastical committee to prepare the reorganization of the clergy. No doubt, those who hoped to reach a solution amenable to the papacy were discouraged by the address of March 22 in which Pius VI spoke out against measures already passed by the Assembly; also, the election of the Protestant Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne to the presidency of the Assembly brought about &quot;commotions&quot; at Toulouse and Nîmes, suggesting that at least some Catholics would accept nothing less than a return to the &quot;ancien régime&quot; practice under which only Catholics could hold office.

The Civil Constitution of the Clergy came before the Assembly on 29 May 1790. François de Bonal, Bishop of Clermont, and some members of the Right requested that the project should be submitted to a national council or to the Pope, but did not carry the day. Joining them in their opposition to the legislation was Abbé Sieyès, one of the chief political theorists of the French Revolution and author of the 1789 pamphlet &quot;What Is the Third Estate?&quot;

Conversely, the Jansenist theologian Armand-Gaston Camus argued that the plan was in perfect harmony with the New Testament and the councils of the fourth century.

The Assembly passed the Civil Constitution on 12 July 1790, two days before the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. On that anniversary, the Fête de la Fédération, Talleyrand and three hundred priests officiated at the &quot;altar of the nation&quot; erected on the Champ de Mars, wearing tricolor waistbands over their priestly vestments and calling down God&#x27;s blessing upon the Revolution.

In 1793, the War in the Vendée was influenced by the Constitution passing due to the devout population toward the Church among other social factors.

==Legal status of the Church in France under the Civil Constitution==

As noted above, even prior to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, church property was nationalized and monastic vows were forbidden. Under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:
* There were 83 bishops, one per department, rather than the previous 135 bishops.
* Bishops (known as constitutional bishops) and priests were elected locally; electors had to sign a loyalty oath to the constitution. There was no requirement that the electors be Catholics, creating the ironic situation that Protestants and even Jews could help elect the Catholic priests and bishops. Their proportion in the French population was however very small.
* Authority of the Pope over the appointment of clergy was reduced to the right to be informed of election results.

The tone of the Civil Constitution can be gleaned from Title II, Article XXI:

:Before the ceremony of consecration begins, the bishop elect shall take a solemn oath, in the presence of the municipal officers, of the people, and of the clergy, to guard with care the faithful of his diocese who are confided to him, to be loyal to the nation, the law, and the king, and to support with all his power the constitution decreed by the National Assembly and accepted by the king.

In short, new bishops were required to swear loyalty to the State in far stronger terms than to any religious doctrine. Even in this revolutionary legislation, there are strong remnants of Gallican royalism.

The law also included some reforms supported even by many within the Church. For example, Title IV, Article I states, &quot;The law requiring the residence of ecclesiastics in the districts under their charge shall be strictly observed. All vested with an ecclesiastical office or function shall be subject to this, without distinction or exception.&quot; In effect, this banned the practice by which younger sons of noble families would be appointed to a bishopric or other high church position and live off its revenues without ever moving to the region in question and taking up the duties of the office. The abuse of bishoprics by the nobility was further reduced in Title II, Article XI: &quot;Bishoprics and cures shall be looked upon as vacant until those elected to fill them shall have taken
the oath above mentioned.&quot; This unified state control over both the nobility and the Church through the use of elected bishops and the oath of loyalty.

==Delay in implementation==

For some time, Louis XVI delayed signing the Civil Constitution, saying that he needed &quot;official word from Rome&quot; before doing so. Pope Pius VI broke the logjam on 9 July 1790, writing a letter to Louis rejecting the arrangement. On 28 July, 6 September, and 16 December 1790, Louis XVI wrote letters to Pius VI, complaining that the National Assembly was forcing him to publicly accept the Civil Constitution, and suggesting that Pius VI compromise with them by accepting a few selected articles. On 10 July, Pius VI wrote to Louis XVI, indicating to the king that the Church could not accept any of the provisions of the Constitution; insofar as the church could not tolerate a national legislature, much less one of such secularist and revolutionary inclinations, dictating the internal organization of the church. On 17 August, Pius VI wrote to Louis XVI of his intent to consult with the cardinals about this, but on 10 October Cardinal Rochefoucauld, the Archbishop of Aix, and 30 of France&#x27;s 131 bishops sent their negative evaluation of the main points of the Civil Constitution to the Pope. Only four sitting bishops actively supported the Constitution. On 30 October, the same 30 bishops restated their view to the public, signing a document known as the Exposition of Principles (&quot;Exposition des principes sur la constitution civile du clergé&quot;), written by Jean de Dieu-Raymond de Cucé de Boisgelin

On 27 November 1790, still lacking the king&#x27;s signature on the law of the Civil Constitution, the National Assembly voted to require the clergy to sign an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. During the debate on that matter, on 25 November, Cardinal de Lomenie wrote a letter claiming that the clergy could be excused from taking the Oath if they lacked mental assent; that stance was to be rejected by the Pope on 23 February 1791. On 26 December 1790, Louis XVI finally granted his public assent to the Civil Constitution, allowing the process of administering the oaths to proceed in January and February 1791.

Pope Pius VI&#x27;s 23 February rejection of Cardinal de Lomenie&#x27;s position of withholding &quot;mental assent&quot; guaranteed that this would become a schism. The Pope&#x27;s subsequent condemnation of the revolutionary regime and repudiation of all clergy who had complied with the oath completed the schism.

== Oath controversy ==

Within the Civil Constitution of the Clergy there was a clause that required the Clergy to take an oath stating the individual&#x27;s allegiance to France. The oath was basically an oath of fidelity and it required every priest in France to publicly declare whether or not they believed the French state or the Pope had supreme authority in ecclesiastical matters. This oath was very controversial because many priests believed that they could not put their loyalty towards France before their loyalty towards God. Conversely, refusal to make the oath signaled a rejection of the Constitution and, implicitly, the legitimacy of the French government (at the time, still including the King).

On 16 January 1791 approximately half of those the law required to take the oath did so, with the remainder awaiting the decision of Pope Pius VI on what exactly swearing it signified and the appropriate response. Among the higher ranks of the church the response was much more negative; only 7 of the 135 sitting bishops took the oath.

In March 1791 Pope Pius VI announced that the oath was against the beliefs of the Church. In doing so, he divided the church into “juring” and “nonjuring” clergy, with jurors being those who took the oath and nonjurors those who refused. The Pope condemned those who took the oath and went as far as saying that they were absolutely separated from the church. Additionally, the Pope expressed disapproval of the Constitution of the Clergy in general and chastised King Louis XVI for assenting to it. The law’s domestic opponents protested that the Revolution was destroying their &quot;true&quot; faith and this was also seen in the two groups of individuals that were formed because of the oath. Those who believed that the Revolution was causing their &quot;true&quot; faith to be destroyed sided with the &quot;non-jurors&quot; and those who believed that the French government should have a say in religion sided with the &quot;jurors&quot;.

American researcher Timothy Tackett believes that the oath determined which individuals would let the revolution cause change and allow revolutionary reform; those who remained steadfast in their opposition would remain true to their beliefs for many years to come. The oath controversy marked a turning point in the revolutionary process since it was the first piece of the Assembly’s agenda that provoked widespread opposition.

==Jurors and non-jurors==

As noted above, the government required all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Only seven bishops and about half of the clergy agreed while the rest refused; the latter became known as &quot;non-jurors&quot; or &quot;refractory priests&quot;. In areas where a majority had taken the oath, such as Paris, the refractory minority could be victimized by society at large: nuns from the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, for example, were subjected to humiliating public spankings.

While there was a higher rate of rejection in urban areas, most of these refractory priests (like most of the population) lived in the countryside, and the Civil Constitution generated considerable resentment among religious peasants. Meanwhile, the Pope repudiated the &quot;jurors&quot; who had signed the oath, especially bishops who had ordained new, elected clergy, and above all Bishop Louis-Alexandre Expilly de la Poipe. In May 1791, France and the Vatican severed diplomatic relations. On June 9, the Assembly forbade the publication of papal decrees without its prior assent.

The Constituent Assembly vacillated on the appropriate measures against non-juring clergy. On 5 February 1791, non-juring priests were banned from preaching in public in the hope that this would silence the opposition to the Constitution from religious quarters. Marriages, baptisms, and other ceremonies presided over by a non-juring priest were forbidden. However, non-juring clergy were permitted to celebrate the Mass and attract crowds because the Assembly feared that stripping them of all of their powers would create chaos and arouse sympathy for its clerical opponents. The Assembly permitted non-juring priests to carry on with ceremonies of a private nature until a cooperative (juring) priest could be found for the relevant parish. A large percentage of the refractory priests were not replaced until 10 August 1792, a year and a half after the first round of oath-taking; by the time they began to be replaced the Assembly had revised the legislation and it was not as significant that they were practicing Mass.

At the beginning of the process, when the Assembly was stripping the clergy of their titles, they ignored the violent conduct of the most radical anticlerical elements. However, the hostile reception that some juror priests received in their home parishes forced the Assembly to moderate its position. On 7 May 1791, the Assembly relaxed the law, providing that the non-juring priests, referred to as &quot;prêtres habitués&quot; (&quot;habitual priests&quot;) could continue to perform ceremonies as long as they did not agitate against the Constitution. The Assembly was forced to moderate because the &quot;Constitutional Clergy&quot; (those who had taken the oath) were rejected by many of their parishioners; lifting some of the restrictions on non-jurors was seen as necessary to arrest the growing schism in the French church. The constitutional clergy often required the assistance of the National Guard to suppress incidents of disorder at their churches.

Even within households, differences emerged between Papal loyalists and Constitutionalists. In many cases, women preferred to hear Mass from a non-juror while men adhered to the Constitutional Church. On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly, which had by then replaced the Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists. In November, new legislation deprived nonjuring priests of their ability to claim rights assigned to the clergy by the Civil Constitution; moreover, nonjuring priests were declared suspect and liable to arrest. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy&#x27;s fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later.

The Holy September Martyrs, or Blessed Martyrs of Carmes (&quot;Bienheureux Martyrs des Carmes&quot;) were 191 Roman Catholics killed at the Carmes Prison in the September Massacres of 1792, consisting of three bishops, 127 secular priests, 56 monks and nuns, and five lay people, the vast majority non-jurors. They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in October 1926.

Persecution of Roman Catholics (that is, non-juring clergy and their followers) by the authorities intensified in the following year from schism within the church to full-throated de-Christianisation, paving the way for the introduction of two short-lived attempts to establish a new state religion, the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1793–1794. During this time, numerous nonjuring priests were arrested and held on prison hulks where many died due to poor conditions aboard.

Although the Constitutional Church remained tolerated, it did not escape the most violent phase of the Revolution unscathed; the National Convention considered Catholicism in any form suspicious. Eight Constitutional bishops were executed on the guillotine, three had been important political figures in the first years of the Revolution: Fauchet, Lamourette, and Gobel. In 1793 Fauchet, disgusted by the Jacobin excesses, joined the moderate bloc in the legislature. He voted in the Convention with the Girondins, exerted himself against the King’s condemnation, prohibited clerical marriage in his jurisdiction and expressed deep sorrow for the errors and scandals both of his political and ecclesiastical career. After the insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793, Fauchet was arrested and held at the Conciergerie. Along with his Girondin allies, he was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal on 30 October, and was guillotined on the following day, after having administered the absolution to his friend Sillery.

Adrian Lamourette, Constitutional Bishop of Lyon, had likewise opposed the extremity of the Montagnards. He protested against the September Massacres, and supported the revolt of Lyon against the National Convention. After the Revolutionary government retook the city, Joseph Fouché arrested Lamourette, personally stripped him of his vestments and rode him through town on a donkey with a mitre on its head and a Bible and crucifix tied to its tail, so the mob could spit at and kick him. At the end of this procession the crucifix and Bible were publicly burned, and the donkey was allowed to drink out of the sacred chalice. Lamourette was then sent to Paris for trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal, which found him guilty and sentenced death. Thereafter, he humbly made the sign of the cross, renounced his oath, and declared that he had been the author of all the speeches upon ecclesiastical affairs which Mirabeau had delivered in his own name in the Constituent Assembly. He was guillotined on January 10, 1794.

On 7 November 1793, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel, Constitutional Bishop of Paris, was forced to abjure in front of a large audience at the National Convention. Three days later, on 10 November, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame was seized and rededicated to the Cult of Reason. Despite his revolutionary principles, Gobel was executed together with Chaumette, Grammont, and many others as a &quot;conspirator against the Republic&quot;, on 13 April 1794.

A similar fate befell Louis-Alexandre Expilly, Constitutional Bishop of Finistère, who had distinguished himself in the early stages of the Revolution. Having joined the Federalist uprising, he was condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Brest, and executed on 21 June 1794 only one month before the fall of Robespierre. He was the last person executed that day as he had been giving absolution to his fellows waiting at the scaffold. His diocese remained vacant until 1798.

Another prominent victim was the former Constitutional Bishop of Yonne, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne. On 15 November 1793, he had resigned from the priesthood, but his past as a cardinal and bishop made the government suspicious of him. He was arrested at Sens on 18 February 1794, and that same night died in prison, whether from a stroke or by poison; some said by suicide.

==Repeal of the Civil Constitution==
After the Thermidorian Reaction, the Convention repealed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; however, the schism between the civilly constituted French Church and the Papacy was only resolved when the Concordat of 1801 was agreed on. The Concordat was reached on July 15, 1801, and it was made widely known the following Easter. The negotiators were Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul, and representatives of the Papacy and, such as it remained, the nonjuring clergy. The Concordat was the organic act of the Roman Catholic Church in France for a century; moreover, it legitimised and terminated the confiscations and church reforms that had been implemented over the course of the revolution. The agreement also gave the French government the right to nominate bishops, reorganize parishes and bishoprics, and allowed for seminaries to be established or re-established. In an effort to please Pope Pius VII, Napoleon agreed to subsidize the salaries of clerics in exchange for the legitimization of the state seizure of church property.

<text>In broadcasting, the watershed is the time of day after which programming with content deemed suitable only for mature or adult audiences is permitted. In the same way that a geological watershed divides two drainage basins, a broadcasting watershed serves as a dividing line in a schedule between family-friendly content, and content deemed suitable only for a more mature audience, such as programs containing objectionable content; this can include graphic violence, strong language, and sexual content, or strong references to those themes, even if they are not shown explicitly. The transition to more adult material must not be unduly abrupt and the strongest material should appear later in the evening.

In some countries, watersheds are enforced by broadcasting laws. Cultural differences around the world allow those watershed times to vary. For instance, in Australia, the watershed time is 19:30 (7:30 p.m.), and in Italy it is 22:30 (10:30 p.m.). In some countries, the schedule is divided into periods with progressively fewer restrictions. In addition, some countries are more lenient towards subscription television and radio or pay-per-view channels than towards free-to-air channels.

==By country==
===Argentina===
In Argentina, any programmes broadcast between 06:00 or 07:00 and 22:00 or 22:30 must be suitable for all ages. There are also three other ratings, SAM 13, SAM 16, and SAM 18, which may be broadcast only during the broadcast time that is not covered by any programme suitable for family viewing.

Starting in September 2010, it is compulsory for broadcasters to show the notices &quot;Comienza el horario apto para todo público&quot; () and &quot;Finaliza el horario apto para todo público&quot; () at 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. respectively. In addition, the notice &quot;Atención: Contenido no apto para niños, niñas y adolescentes&quot; () are shown before news broadcasts.

===Australia===
On Australian television, programmes are restricted to certain times based on their rating. Since December 2015, PG-rated programmes can be shown at any time of day, M-rated programmes from 19:30, and MA15+ programmes from 20:30. M-rated programmes can also be shown from 12:00 to 15:00 on school days.

Complications with Australian time zones allow that to vary slightly in some areas. For example, when daylight saving time is in effect in New South Wales, NSW-based stations broadcasting to the Gold Coast, Queensland, would effectively push the broadcast watersheds an hour earlier, as Queensland does not observe DST; however, complaints by Gold Coast residents have forced those stations to delay prime-time programming by one hour to compensate.

With the exception of subscription narrowcast channels, anything rated R18+ must not be shown on Australian television at any time, and must be edited to fit within MA15+ guidelines. Even on subscription narrowcast channels, the owner of the channel must ensure that its content is restricted to access by those with appropriate disabling devices.

===Austria===
There is no legally binding watershed in Austria. However, according to its regulations, the public service broadcaster&#x27;s channels do not air content that might harm the physical, mental or moral development of minors before 8:15 p.m. and when fictional programmes &quot;not suitable for children&quot; or &quot;only for adults&quot; are aired, an X or O, respectively, is added to the digital on-screen graphic.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the concept of watershed was officially abolished on August 31, 2016, after a controversial decision made by the Supreme Federal Court (&quot;Supremo Tribunal Federal&quot;). Despite the online activism organized by some opposing parents and critics, such as Helena Martins, a journalist and representative of the National Program of Human Rights (&quot;Programa Nacional de Direitos Humanos&quot;), who created a petition on the Internet trying to prevent the decision, the Court ruled in favor of a lawsuit made by the Brazilian Labor Party (&quot;Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro&quot;), a nationally known political party who received the support (during the lawsuit) of the Brazilian Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (&quot;Associação Brasileira de Emissoras de Rádio e Televisão&quot;), composed of a group of several radio and television broadcasters spread throughout the country. Both organizations advocated for the national abolition of the watershed, claiming that the watershed was a kind of restriction that caused problems related to the &quot;lack of programming freedom&quot; on the Brazilian television.

Starting in 1990, when the Advisory Rating Coordination (&quot;Coordenação de Classificação Indicativa&quot;) of the Department of Justice Politics (&quot;Departamento de Políticas de Justiça&quot;) was established, until the August 31, 2016 Supreme Court ruling, the Brazilian advisory rating system determined not only the content rating of a program, but also imposed a watershed system, who was created in line with the Child and Adolescent Statute (&quot;Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente&quot;), a series of regulations who determine what are the children&#x27;s rights in Brazil. The watershed was composed by the following rules:

* Programs rated (Free for All Audiences - &quot;Livre para Todos os Públicos&quot;) and (Not recommended for minors under 10 - &quot;Não recomendado para menores de 10 anos&quot;) could be broadcast at anytime;
* Programs rated (Not recommended for minors under 12 - &quot;Não recomendado para menores de 12 anos&quot;) could be broadcast only between 8:00 PM (20:00) and 6:00 AM;
* Programs rated (Not recommended for minors under 14 - &quot;Não recomendado para menores de 14 anos&quot;) could be broadcast only between 9:00 PM (21:00) and 6:00 AM;
* Programs rated (Not recommended for minors under 16 - &quot;Não recomendado para menores de 16 anos&quot;) could be broadcast only between 10:00 PM (22:00) and 6:00 AM;
* Programs rated (Not recommended for minors under 18 - &quot;Não recomendado para menores de 18 anos&quot;) could be broadcast only between 11:00 PM (23:00) and 6:00 AM.

The watershed was enforced only for free-to-air television channels (both VHF and UHF); pay television channels were not required to follow the watershed, and indeed, could broadcast any program anytime.

Before 1990, during the military dictatorship and in the early New Republic, the regulator entity for the watershed was the Public Diversions Censorship Division (&quot;Divisão de Censura de Diversões Públicas&quot;) of the Federal Police of Brazil (&quot;Polícia Federal do Brasil&quot;). More known simply as the &quot;Federal Censorship&quot; (&quot;Censura Federal&quot;), it was this division who determined if a pre-recorded television program was eligible to be transmitted on a determined time (the Censorship Division also decided what was the content rating of these programs, and had the power to impede the broadcast of unauthorized programs, meaning that all television programs that were not broadcast live had to be previously sent to the &quot;Federal Censorship&quot; through videotapes to receive the authorization of transmission before they could be aired).

===Canada===
The Code of Ethics and the Violence Code of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (which does not include the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and provincial public broadcasters such as TVOntario and Tele-Quebec, which are directly overseen by the CRTC) specify that broadcasters may not air programming that contains sexually explicit material or coarse or offensive language intended for adult audiences outside of the &quot;late viewing period,&quot; which is defined as programming beginning at 9:00 p.m., and ending at 5:30 a.m. Programs that begin before 9:00 p.m. are considered pre-watershed even if they run into this time period. In regards to time zones, the watershed is based on the time zone from which the signal originates. 11:00 p.m. is the watershed for radio broadcasting; before then and after 4:00 a.m., radio stations are forbidden from broadcasting content that glorifies violence, undue coarse language, or undue sexually explicit material.

The Violence Code does provide some leniency for scheduling programs pre-watershed in order to exercise a terrestrial broadcaster&#x27;s simsub rights (acknowledging that content advisories are also mandated by the code). However, in any case, no broadcaster may air material that contains &quot;gratuitous violence in any form or which sanctions, promotes or glamourizes violence.&quot;

=== Chile ===
In Chile, prior to the establishment of content rating systems in 1993, watershed was the only way that television networks used to separate adult programs from the rest of the schedule. Back then, adult programming could only air after 21:30 (which, on most networks, coincided with the end of prime-time newscasts). It was later moved to 22:00. The Consejo Nacional de Televisión requires all networks (even pay TV channels based in Chile) to broadcast a warning shortly before the watershed (either as a standalone ident or as a lower-third); if they skip the warning, they risk facing a fine. Broadcasting the warning late also results in a fine, with TV+ receiving one in December 2020. The adult-programming period ends at 6:00 (though most networks ended it right after sign-off, as 24/7 stations weren&#x27;t common prior to 2022).

In April 2024, the CNTV&#x27;s president, Mauricio Muñoz, revealed in an interview that the Asociación Nacional de Televisión, the Defensoría de la Niñez and other institutions solicited the regulator to move the watershed from 22:00 to 21:00. Reasons for the change included sleep-related health issues on children with the old watershed, and prime-time newscasts becoming more violent and crime-focused. The proposal was approved on 10 October 2024, though it was said it would only be moved once it was published on the Diario Oficial. The watershed was officially moved on 5 November 2024.

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, only programmes that &quot;can be watched by children&quot; can be aired until 22:00. After 22:00, adult-oriented programmes may be aired. They have to be marked with star on either corner of image. Notably Jednicka (CT1) and Dvojka (CT2) are among to include this logo until 2007.

===Finland===
In Finland, all the major television companies (Yle, MTV Media, Nelonen Media, SBS Finland and Fox International) have agreed not to show 16-rated content before 21:00 and 18-rated content before 23:00. Television channels use their own discretion to decide the ratings. Before airing a programme, the channel must provide the related rating information to the governmental bureau Finnish Centre for Media Education and Audiovisual Media, which replaced the now-defunct Finnish Board of Film Classification in that capacity in early 2012.

===France===
In France, -12 rated programmes/films are not allowed before 22:00, and -16/-18 rated programmes/films are not allowed before 22:30 and 00:00
respectively. -18 rated programmes/films may air only via satellite and cable. The period in which programmes with any ratings are permitted finishes at 06:00 except for -18 programmes, which may not be issued after 05:00.

There is also one additional rating that is not used in films: -10. -10 rated programmes signifies content less intense than -12 rated programmes. All programmes and films must display the respective icon on-screen for the duration of the programme. Before December 2012, -10 rated programmes had to display the respective icon on-screen at the start and in regular intervals.

===Germany===
In Germany, content suitable for ages 16 and older is permitted between 22:00 and 06:00 and content suitable for adults (18 and older)
is permitted between 23:00 and 06:00. Programmes marked &quot;Keine Jugendfreigabe&quot; (not approved for minors) by the ratings organization FSK may thus be shown only after 23:00. Blacklisted movies may not be aired at any time. Some content rated 12 and older is permitted between 20:00 and 06:00, but there is no general watershed for such content.

If a commercial broadcaster wants to air a programme not rated by the FSK, the programme&#x27;s watershed is rated by the FSF (Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen: Voluntary Self Regulation for TV) instead. A programme with neither rating is not usually aired by commercial broadcasters since the KJM (Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz: Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media) may charge a fine if it finds the content inappropriate. To avoid the original watershed for a programme or to air a blacklisted movie, commercial broadcasters may ask the FSF to tell them how to cut the movie for another rating.

===Greece===
Greece uses a triple-tier watershed, along with a five-tier dual-tone decal scheme, displayed at the beginning and at regular intervals during all broadcasts except for news bulletins.
* A black square containing a white circle and the letter &quot;K&quot; (Κατάλληλο, &quot;Suitable&quot;) in black, indicates unrestricted programming.
* A black square containing a white circle and the number &quot;8&quot;, indicates programming that is suitable for persons aged 8 and older. TV programming using this symbol is precluded from being broadcast during special children TV programming, as well as at least thirty minutes before or after that special programming. 
* A black square containing a white circle and the number &quot;12&quot;, indicates programming that is suitable for persons aged 12 and older. and is only allowed only between 21:00 and 06:00, Monday through Thursday, and 22:00 and 06:00, Friday through Sunday as well as during school holidays. 
* A black square containing a white circle and the number &quot;16&quot;, indicates programming that is suitable for persons aged 16 and older and is allowed only between 22:00 and 06:00.
* A black square containing a white circle and the number &quot;18&quot;, indicates programming that is suitable for adults (persons aged 18 and older), and is allowed only between 00:00 and 06:00. Programmes with foul language and commercials with sexual oriented nudity typically fall into this category. Broadcasting content with this rating before midnight is punishable by fine except when used in the context of a suitably labelled film, theatrical play or other media.
Furthermore, for media rated &quot;12&quot; and above, a special identification regarding the content of the media, is required to be broadcast at the beginning of the programme. These verbal descriptors are:

* Βία (Violence) - This programme contains depictions of violence.
* Σεξ (Sex) - This programme contains depictions of sexual or sexualised acts.
* Χρήση Ουσιών (Use of Substances) - This programme contains depictions of drug use, or of other addicting substances.
* Ακατάλληλη Φρασεολογία (Improper Speech) - This programme contains use of improper or vulgar speech.

These ratings are mandatorily displayed and verbally announced at the beginning of each broadcast. The provisions are enforced by the National Council for Radio and Television (ESR), an independent authority, whose executive members are appointed by the leaders of all parliamentary parties, preferably by unanimous consent and in extremis by an 80% supermajority.

===Hungary===
Hungary uses a two-tier watershed.
* Programmes rated for over 16-year-olds are allowed only between 21:00 and 05:00.
* Programmes rated for over 18-year-olds are allowed only between 22:00 and 05:00.

Hungarian television prime time ends about 23:30.

&quot;For more information about the two ratings&#x27; meaning, see &quot;.

===India===
India does not have a watershed. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is responsible for regulating television programming. Officially, broadcast laws permit only material rated with a U (Universal) certificate and U/A to be broadcast on television, but the law is regularly disobeyed. As many Indian households have only one television, nearly the entire broadcast day is positioned by broadcasters as being suitable for family viewing. Self-censorship of foreign series (particularly from the U.S., and including series originally aired on broadcast television) is common in order to meet more conservative content standards, 

11 p.m. is typically treated as a &quot;de facto&quot; watershed, with adult content offered until 5 a.m. (and some channels, such as Zee Café, openly promoting programming blocks within the hours featuring &quot;uncut&quot; programming with fewer edits). The government has, at times, ordered individual programmes and films to be broadcast between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. There have been several proposals in the past to introduce an 11 p.m. watershed, permitting programming rated &#x27;A&#x27; (Adults Only) from then until 5 a.m., but all have been rejected by the government.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, there is no statutory requirement for a watershed. The &quot;Code of Programme Standards&quot; of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) requires television and radio broadcasters to use at least one of three methods to advise viewers of content, namely: an explicit watershed for adult-oriented programmes; prior warnings before potentially offensive programming; and/or a descriptive classification system. A 2005 survey for the drafters of the &quot;Code&quot; found that 83% of viewers thought a watershed was a good idea, and only 39% knew the pre-existing watershed was 21:00; 52% felt it should be 22:00 or 23:00. The 2007 &quot;Code&quot; specifies that broadcasters using a watershed must regularly promote it, and its start and end times, for viewers&#x27; awareness.

RTÉ Television implements a watershed of 21:00, as well as an onscreen classification system. Programmes with the &quot;MA&quot; (&quot;mature audience&quot;) classification are shown only after the watershed. Programmes running through the watershed are treated as pre-watershed. RTÉ&#x27;s guidelines state, &quot;A cornerstone of our contract with television viewers is the watershed and the understanding that prior to 21.00 material broadcast should be suitable for a family audience. ... The immediately post 21.00 broadcast period should be regarded as a graduation period towards more adult material and due allowance must be made for the potential presence of children in the audience&quot;. More nuanced limits may also be applied; for example, RTÉ cleared a trailer for horror film &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; for broadcast after 19:00, except during the Saturday evening film which many children watch. Virgin Media One operates what it calls &quot;the internationally accepted watershed&quot; of 21:00. Radio broadcasting does not apply a watershed.

In 2005, all television broadcasters operated a main watershed starting at 21:00. In the case of RTÉ, it ended at 06:30, while for Virgin Media One and TG4, which then had shorter broadcast hours, it ended at nighttime closedown. RTÉ Radio did not use a watershed. TG4 claimed it had &quot;a number of different watersheds coming into effect throughout the day&quot;, while all stations had a second, less formal watershed at 22:00 for &quot;material which is decidedly over 18&quot;. Quinn notes that the period from 18:00 to 21:00 attracts most viewer complaints, as &quot;audience expectations of what should be shown often differ greatly&quot;.

The BAI&#x27;s code regarding advertising and children states, &quot;In general terms, programmes broadcast after 9 p.m. are not regarded as children&#x27;s programmes. After this time, the primary responsibility for what a child is watching is seen to lie with the parents/guardians. The Code recognises, however, that children&#x27;s viewing does not end abruptly at 9 p.m. and so the Code will offer some protection in the hour between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.&quot;

===Italy===

According to &quot;Codice TV e minori&quot; (Code for Children and Television, 2002), all the channels must broadcast &quot;general audience&quot; programmes from 07:00 to 22:30. After 22:30, +14 programmes can be aired, while +18 programmes are prohibited from television altogether except for satellite, cable, and OTT premium adult channels, along with Cielo.

===Mexico===
Department of Radio, Television and Film (Mexico) regulates television programming in Mexico. Any programs shown on Mexican television must be classified A (suitable for all ages) for broadcast between 05:00 to 20:00. Broadcast for programs classified as B, B-15, C and/or D can be broadcast at certain times only.

* Programs rated B may be broadcast only from 16:00 to 05:59.
* Programs rated B-15 may be broadcast only from 19:00 to 05:59.
* Programs rated C may be broadcast only from 21:00 to 05:59.
* Programs rated D can be broadcast only from 00:00 to 05:00.

===The Netherlands===
* Programmes that are rated &quot;All ages&quot;, &quot;6&quot; or &quot;9&quot; can be broadcast all day.
* Programmes that are rated &quot;12&quot; can be broadcast from 20.00 to 06.00
* Programmes that are rated &quot;16&quot; can be broadcast from 22.00 to 06.00

The number in the age rating indicates the lowest age for which it is suitable.

===New Zealand===

On 1 May 2020, the new classification rating system for television (both free-to-air and subscription) was implemented, bringing it more in line with film classifications as per the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993.

* G and PG rated programmes can be shown at any time on both free-to-air and subscription television.
*M rated programmes can be shown any time only on subscription television. On free-to-air television, M rated programmes can be shown between the hours of 9.00am and 3.00pm on weekdays (school term time only) and from 7.30pm until 5.00am on a daily basis (including weekends, school holidays and public holidays).
*16 rated programmes can be shown any time only on subscription television, but must be blocked if viewers under 16 are present. On free-to-air television, 16 rated programmes can only be shown from 8.30pm to 5.00am. 16 rated programmes may contain stronger content that may be considered unsuitable for children under the age of 16.
*18 rated programmes can be shown on subscription television between 9.00am and 3.00pm on weekdays (school term time only) and from 8.00pm until 6.00am on a daily basis (including weekends, school holidays and public holidays). On free-to-air television, 18 rated programmes can only be shown between 9.30pm and 5.00am. 18 rated programmes may contain more explicit but challenging content such as very frequent coarse language, very strong or graphic violence, very strong or explicit sex scenes, nudity or material that may be considered either too distressing or offensive to some adult viewers.

News and current affairs programmes and sporting events are exempt from the system altogether but still carry warnings before certain stories with graphic content or objectionable material.

====Previous system====

The previous system for free-to-air television, introduced in 1989, used the following system based on the one formerly used in Australia:
*G (General), which could air at any time,
*PGR (Parental Guidance Recommended), which could not air between 6am and 9am or between 4pm and 7pm, and
*AO (Adults Only), which could only air between noon and 3pm on school days, and between 8:30pm and 5am

Subscription television has always used the current system.

===Peru===
Peru has adult time from 22:00 to 6:00. During the rest of the time, nevertheless, some +14 programming signs may be posted on the screen. As of 2015, there have been complaints that adult time is not enforced (either from the TV channels or the authorities) since some programs such as &quot;Combate&quot;, &quot;Esto es Guerra&quot;, &quot;Amor Amor Amor&quot; and &quot;Al fondo hay sitio&quot; have broadcast violence, or sexually suggestive material, during &quot;unrestricted&quot; time.

===Poland===
In Poland, the &quot;Czas chroniony&quot; (&quot;Protected time&quot;) rules specify that programmes with a &quot;12&quot; rating or higher are not allowed to be aired during scheduling blocks intended for children, programmes with a &quot;16&quot; rating are not allowed to be aired before 20:00 on mainstream channels, and programmes with an &quot;18&quot; rating may not be aired before 23:00 on mainstream channels.

===Portugal===
Open channel terrestrial television stations (RTP, SIC and TVI) can broadcast programmes and films rated 16 only between 22:30 and 06:00 with permanent visual identification and usual red circle in right top on the TV screen. There are no legal restrictions on pay television, but those channels usually follow the same rules as open television, for example, the Red Circle may be displayed on the top right (or top left ); however, some channels use Spanish Ratings instead. Pornography may be aired only on encrypted channels.

===Serbia===
In 2015, the Serbian broadcasting regulator, the REM (Regulatory body for Electronic Media) introduced a two-tier watershed. The watershed is based on the new TV rating system.

Programmes marked &quot;16&quot; are allowed to be shown only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and may contain coarse language and mild references to gambling, drugs and sex.

Programmes marked &quot;18&quot; are allowed to be shown only between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. and may contain extensive scenes of drugs and sex.

===Singapore===
Under Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) regulations, the watershed applies for programs rated PG13 (free-to-air television channels) or M18 (pay television channels), which could only be shown between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.; NC16 and M18 content must also be subjected to edits and correct scheduling before being permitted for broadcast.

===Slovakia===
Slovak law defines a two-tier watershed and TV stations are obliged to show JSO&#x27;s rating symbols through the entire program and also in promos.

Programmes given an 15 rating are permitted to broadcast only from 8pm to 6am. Programmes given an 18 rating are permitted to be shown only from 10pm to 6am.

===Slovenia===
The national public broadcaster RTV Slovenija uses three watersheds. Between 8 PM and 5 AM content rated 12+ can be shown, programmes rated 15+ are allowed between 10 PM and 5 AM programmes and 18+ rated content can be screened between midnight and 5 AM. Cartoons and children&#x27;s programmes have to be screened until 7 PM, when the main evening newscast begins. Many broadcasters (for example local or regional channels) also take this approach in a similar way.

A warning, which has to be shown for at least 10 seconds, has to be broadcast before airing a programme with an age restriction. It consists of showing an enlarged age rating symbol accompanied by a voiceover. The warning says: &quot;Opozorilo! Predvajana programska vsebina vključuje prizore, ki so lahko neprimerni za mlajše otroke, zato je zanje priporočljiv ogled z vodstvom staršev ali skrbnikov&quot; (The following programme contains scenes potentially inappropriate for younger children. Parental guidance is advised.) for programmes, rated VS (Vodstvo staršev - Parental guidance). Programmes, rated 12+, 15+ and 18+ are equipped with a similar kind of warning (Predvajana programska vsebina vključuje prizore, ki niso primerni za otroke do 12./15. leta starosti/otroke in mladoletnike do 18. leta starosti (The following programme contains scenes potentially inappropriate for children, younger than 12/15 / children and minors, younger than 18). Unrated programmes or programmes, meant for all audiences are exempt from the system. Examples of programmes, equipped with rating symbols include pornographic and violent content, some documentaries, newscasts, if they are shown in the timeslot, meant for children&#x27;s programming and satirical shows.

The used age ratings and their respective symbols are:
* VS (vodstvo staršev): Parental guidance recommended for viewers under the age of 12. A white rhombus, containing parent and child stick figures is shown.
* 12+: Not allowed under the age of 12. A white rhombus, containing the number 12 is shown.
* 15+: Not allowed under the age of 15. A white rhombus, containing the number 15 is shown.
* 18+: Not allowed under the age of 18. A white rhombus, containing the number 18 is shown.
* Explicit sexual content: White rhombus, containing the number 18 and one plus sign
* Pornographic content/programme with severe violence scenes: White rhombus with number 18 and two plus signs

Programmes with 18+ or 18++ icons must not be broadcast free-to-air and are allowed on scrambled pay-TV channels only.

The original content rating icons (used before 2014) were a red triangle with a stylised eye for content where parental guidance is advised for viewers under the age of 15, while content unsuitable/not allowed under the age of 15 used a red circle with a stylised eye. Such symbols were in use since 2003 and were replaced in 2007 with red inverted triangle-shaped symbols with VS (parental guidance), +12 and +15 inscriptions. For 18+ rated content a red circle-shaped symbol with the letters AD was used.

Additional content type rating symbols (not shown on-screen):
* Nasilje (Violence): White rhombus, containing two stick figures; one is laying on the floor while being beaten up by the other, which is holding a baseball bat
* Strašljive vsebine (Scary content): White rhombus, containing a stylised grey ghost figure
* Spolnost (Sexuality): White rhombus, containing conjoined male and female sex symbols (circle with a cross, pointing downwards and a circle with an arrow, pointing upwards)
* Nevarno vedenje (Dangerous behaviour): White rhombus, containing a crouching stick figure, trying to jump over a fence and an open fire.
* Diskriminacija (Discrimination): White rhombus, containing three stick figures, of which the middle one is white, while the other two are black.
* Zloraba drog in/ali alkohola (Drug and/or alcohol abuse): White rhombus, containing a bottle, defaced with a stylised face.
* Neprimeren jezik (Inappropriate language use): White rhombus, containing a speech bubble with a hash sign, ampersand (&quot;and&quot; sign) and an exclamation mark.

The respective rating symbol has to be shown for the duration of the programme.

===South Africa===
South Africa takes a very hands-on approach when it comes to what children are allowed to see on television, and the parents or guardians of the child may be fined if they are caught not following the rules. The ratings used are:
* All: Suitable for all ages. The respective icon is required to be displayed on-screen for 30 seconds at the start of the programme.
* PG: Suitable for all ages, but very young children must be accompanied at all times. The respective icon is required to be displayed on-screen for one minute at the start of the programme.
* 13: Prohibited to children under the age of 13. The respective icon is required to be displayed on-screen for two minutes at the start of the programme and after every commercial break.
* 16: Prohibited to children under the age of 16. Programmes with this rating are not allowed before 21:00. The respective icon is required to be displayed on-screen for five minutes at the start of the programme and after every commercial break.
* 18: Prohibited to children and young people under the age of 18. Programmes with this rating are not allowed before 23:00. The respective icon is required to be displayed on-screen for the duration of the programme. The content in programmes that have an &quot;18&quot; rating is not restricted as long as it does not have pornography, which is prohibited altogether.

===Spain===
In Spain, the watershed is simpler than in a lot of other countries since there is only one watershed time, but there is a quadruple-tier age rating system that is used alongside it. The ratings used in Spain are &quot;All&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;16&quot; and &quot;18&quot;. However, only 18-rated programmes are restricted. 18-rated programmes are allowed only between 22:00 and 06:00 and must broadcast a warning sound before it is shown.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has no watershed. However, broadcasters are required by law to avoid any confrontation of minors with unsuitable programming through the choice of transmission time.

===United Kingdom===
According to Ofcom, the watershed for free-to-air television in the UK is at 21:00 (9:00 p.m.), and &quot;material unsuitable for children&quot; should not, in general be shown before 21:00 or after 05:30 (5:30 a.m.). For premium or pay-per-view services, the watershed is at 20:00 (8:00 p.m.). Until 1 October 2011, the period ended at 05:30 for premium channels as it still does for the free-to-air channels. On 1 October 2011, the rules for the premium channels were relaxed, with the adult-content period now ending at 06:00. Programmes that are rated 15 cannot be shown outside that period. However, some 12-rated shows can be shown before 21:00, such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;. There is no watershed on PIN-protected channels (such as Sky Cinema). On that type of channel, trying to view adult material before 20:00 requires a PIN.

In November the yearly Children in Need charity event, which is usually shown on a Friday night, has the watershed delayed until 23:30, to encourage parents to be comfortable with their children staying up after 21:00. This causes more shows to have to be censored, especially if they are part of the event. Comic Relief and Sport Relief, on the other hand, will only delay it until 22:00.

There should be a gentle transition to adult material, and 18-rated content must not air until 22:00 (10:00pm) on most channels that are without PIN protection. However, channels that are dedicated to airing adult content such as Horror Channel may be allowed to start 18-rated content at 21:00 without PIN protection.

Advertisements also have to comply with the same set of rules, and can be restricted when shown before the watershed (such as those for junk food, bingo, alcohol and condoms). Advertisements that may have an adult-related context, such as bingo, are less likely to be allowed on child-oriented channels. Some advertisements, often those for 18-rated films and video games, are not allowed before the watershed at all.

Although ratings do not have to be displayed on-screen, the channel is legally required to broadcast a verbal advisory before shows that may be unsuitable for children. Failure to do so may result in the broadcaster being given a fine. However, this rule generally does not apply to pay TV channels, so as a result, some pay TV channels, such as Comedy Central, have no verbal advisory at all. Some channels, such as That&#x27;s TV Gold, have no verbal advisory but instead displays them on-screen, which may be problematic for blind and partially sighted viewers if audio description does not read them out or is unavailable.

===United States===
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has the right to regulate the broadcast of &quot;indecent&quot; material on free-to-air terrestrial television and radio, because it is broadcast on publicly-owned airwaves that are licensed to broadcasters. It presently enforces a 10:00 p.m. watershed, permitting adult content between then and 6:00 a.m. The FCC&#x27;s jurisdiction in regards to content applies only to terrestrial television and radio. Cable channels may be more permissive in their content, depending on their target audience and the standards of their advertisers, while premium channels and over-the-top streaming services are often the most permissive because they are funded primarily by their subscribers.

In the 1975–76 television season, the FCC attempted to enforce a &quot;Family Viewing Hour&quot; policy, in which the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) agreed to devote the first hour of primetime to family-friendly programming. In 1976, the rule was overturned as unconstitutional following a lawsuit by the Writers Guild of America.

In 1978, the Supreme Court case &quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot; (dealing with a broadcast of the George Carlin routine &quot;Filthy Words&quot; by WBAI radio) upheld the ability for the FCC to regulate the broadcast of &quot;indecent&quot; material on free-to-air radio and television, citing the &quot;uniquely pervasive presence&quot; of broadcasting in society, and the likelihood that children could be exposed to such content by chance. From then on, the FCC enforced a safe harbor on the broadcast of indecent material between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

In 1987, the FCC introduced a stricter definition of indecency, defined as &quot;language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs&quot;. The FCC also removed the previous 10:00 p.m. watershed and stated that the prohibition would apply during any time that there &quot;is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience&quot;. In 1988, as directed by the United States Congress, the FCC announced that it would ban the broadcast of indecent material entirely, with no safe harbor. In 1991, the FCC&#x27;s proposed 24-hour ban was struck down by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals as unconstitutional. The Telecommunications Act of 1992 re-established a safe harbor period for indecent content between midnight and 6:00 a.m. The period was lengthened back to 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. following further D.C. Circuit rulings.

Some American television scenes famous for &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; (such as limited nudity on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;) were aired in the 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. hour; however, the broadcasts were before the safe harbor in the Central and Mountain time zones, where programming scheduled for 10:00 p.m. Eastern would typically be broadcast starting at 9:00 p.m. (using a one-hour delay in Mountain Time broadcast areas). Because each U.S. time zone enters safe harbor separately (at 10:00 p.m. local time), it is possible for not all network affiliates that air an &quot;indecent&quot; program at the same moment to face the same penalties. Such was the case with CBS, whose affiliates faced a proposed fine of US$3.63 million for a repeat of the &quot;Without a Trace&quot; episode &quot;Our Sons and Daughters&quot; in December 2004. The program was flagged for depicting an orgy involving teenagers. It was televised at 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (within the safe harbor), but at 9:00 p.m. in Central and Mountain times (outside the safe harbor). The FCC split its fine among the 111 CBS affiliates covering those time zones. After a court settlement, the network agreed to pay US$300,000 in fines.

Even though the watershed occurs at the prime time hour of 10:00 p.m., broadcast networks have since avoided indecent content to avoid reprimands from their affiliates and advertisers, and because of the constant fluctuation of indecency standards to account for changes in acceptance and FCC enforcement. In 2011 and 2012, courts overturned fines regarding a brief scene of nudity in a 2003 &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; episode, as well as fines over fleeting expletives in a live awards show broadcast in 2002 by Fox, ruling that the FCC&#x27;s basis for the fines was too vague.

===Venezuela===
In Venezuela, the watershed is at 23:00. The period between the watershed and 05:00 is called &quot;Adult time&quot; according to Article 7 of the &quot;Law on Social Responsibility on Radio, Television and Electronic Media&quot;. During that block, adult-oriented programs may be transmitted as long as they do not contain hardcore pornography, political or religious intolerance, racism or xenophobia.

<text>USS &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; (SSBN-641), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), the Venezuelan hero of the independence movements of the former Spanish colonies in South America.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Simon Bolivar&quot;″s keel was laid down on 17 April 1963 by Newport News Shipbuilding of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 22 August 1964, sponsored by Nancy Milling (Aynesworth) Mann, wife of Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas C. Mann, and commissioned on 29 October 1965 with Commander Charles H. Griffiths commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Charles A. Orem commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
During late December 1965 and most of January 1966, &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; underwent demonstration and shakedown operations. The Gold Crew successfully fired a Polaris A-3 ballistic missile off the coast of Cape Kennedy, Florida, on 17 January 1966, and the Blue Crew completed a successful Polaris missile firing on 31 January. In February 1966, the Gold Crew continued shakedown operations in the Caribbean Sea. In March 1966, &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot;″s home port was changed to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 18, and minor deficiencies were corrected during a shipyard availability period. Beginning in April 1966, the Blue Crew prepared for and conducted the first deterrent patrol, while the Gold Crew entered a training period. The Gold Crew conducted the second deterrent patrol, then went into a training period that lasted into early 1967 while the Blue Crew conducted the third deterrent patrol. &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; completed her third deterrent patrol in January 1967.

&quot;Simon Bolivar&quot;″s routine of deterrent patrols out of Charleston by her two crews continued until 7 February 1971, when she returned to Newport News for and conversion of her ballistic missile system to support Poseidon missiles.

&quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; departed Newport News on 12 May 1972 for post-overhaul shakedown operations and refresher training for her two crews, which lasted until 16 September 1972. By the end of 1972, she had resumed deterrent patrols.

In October 1974 &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; returned to Charleston and Submarine Squadron 18. She was awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;) for Fiscal Year 1974 and the Providence Plantation Award for most outstanding fleet ballistic missile submarine in the United States Atlantic Fleet. She also was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for in Fiscal Years 1975 and 1976.

In February 1979, following her 40th deterrent patrol, &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, for overhaul and conversion of her ballistic missile system to support Trident C-4 ballistic missiles. Upon completion of overhaul she returned to her home port of Charleston in January 1981.

&quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; continued to make deterrent patrols, undergoing occasional refits at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay Georgia, and was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for Fiscal Year 1982. She successfully launched a Trident test missile in the summer of 1983. She entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard again in 1985 for another refit including an asbestos rip out and resumed patrols in 1987.

==Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal==
Deactivated while still in commission in September 1994, &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot; was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 February 1995. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy″s Nuclear-Powered Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington began on 1 October 1994 and was completed on 1 December 1995.

<text>The blue-headed vireo (Vireo solitarius) is a migrating song bird found in North and Central America. There are currently two recognized subspecies that belong to the blue-headed vireo. It has a range that extends across Canada and the eastern coast of the United-States, Mexico and some of Central America. It prefers large temperate forests with a mix of evergreen trees and deciduous under growth.

As the name suggests, the blue-headed vireo is characterized by its blue-grey head and bold yellow wing bars. Both sexes are very similar in plumage and size. Juveniles also have a similar plumage.

Populations of the blue-headed vireo have been steadily increasing since the 1970s. Therefore, in 2004, the species was classified as a &quot;Least Concern&quot; species.

== Description ==
The blue-headed vireo has similar plumage year round and does not drastically change its appearance during the breeding season. It can be characterized by its olive green upper body, two bold yellow wing bars down the edge of its wing, and a deep blue-grey crown from which it gets its name. The juvenile plumage of immature blue-headed vireos is not distinct but very similar to the adult plumage. While this bird&#x27;s appearance is similar to the closely related Cassin&#x27;s vireo (&quot;Vireo cassinii&quot;), the Cassin&#x27;s vireo can be differentiated by its lighter yellow patches, a smaller, thinner bill, and a brownish-grey crown. There is little to no sexual dimorphism between males and females as both are similar in plumage colouration and size.

Like most Vireos, the blue-headed vireo is a relatively small bird with a length of . The wingspan is usually found to be around and their weight is typically . There are some subtle differences between the &quot;V.s. solitarius&quot; and &quot;V.s. alticola&quot; subspecies. &quot;V.s. alticola&quot;, the larger of the two subspecies, has a darker back with a larger wing length of and a bill length of . Conversely, &quot;V.s. solitarius&quot; is slightly smaller with a wing length of , and a bill length of .

The average lifespan of the blue-headed vireo in the wild has been measured to be approximately 7 years and 5 months.

== Taxonomy ==
The blue-headed vireo is placed in the genus &quot;Vireo&quot;, a group of small migrating passerine birds that are characterized by their usually dull greenish colouring, and a simple, monotonous song. Members of this group are usually characterized by the presence or absence of eye-rings, eye-strips, and wing bars. There is no sexual dimorphism between sexes in this group.

Though it had been previously classified as a separate species, the blue-headed vireo along with the plumbeous vireo (&quot;Vireo plumbeus&quot;) and the Cassin&#x27;s Vireo (&quot;V. cassinii&quot;) were lumped in the 1950s into a single species, based on morphological data. This group of vireos was collectively known as the &quot;Solitary Vireo&quot; (&quot;Vireo solitarius&quot;). This taxonomy prevailed until 1997 when new molecular data showed that there were in fact three distinct species. The taxonomy reverted to that prior to the 1950s, and the blue-headed vireo was once again its own species.

There are two recognized subspecies of blue-headed vireo:

* &quot;Vireo solitarius solitarius&quot; – – is the nominate species. It is slightly smaller and breeds across Canada to south Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It overwinters in north-central and southern Mexico.
* &quot;Vireo solitarius alticola&quot; – – is slightly larger than the nominate species. It breeds mainly in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia. It overwinters in the Gulf States after a short migration.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Native to North America, the blue-headed vireo enjoys a large breeding range that extends over an immense area of Canada and northern United States. The breeding range of &quot;V.s. solitarius&quot; extends from northeastern British Columbia across Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec and down to southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. &quot;V.s. alticola&quot; has a distinct breeding range that includes western Maryland and south, mainly in the Appalachian Mountains, to northern Georgia. At the end of the breeding season, the blue-headed vireo migrates south to its overwintering area. &quot;V.s. solitarius&quot; has the longest migration of the two subspecies and inhabits an overwintering area that includes eastern and southern Mexico to northern Central America. &quot;V.s. alticola&quot; migrates across a shorter distance to an area that extends from southeastern Virginia to Texas.

Blue-headed vireos prefer to breed in cool temperate forests, which in the southern part of its breeding range are found at higher elevations. Evergreen forests with spruce, fir, hemlock, and pine mixed with deciduous growth such as alder shrubs, willow shrubs, poplar, birch or maple trees are the habitat of choice. During the winter, blue-headed vireos inhabit mixed woods of pines and hardwoods. They are also found in coastal and flood plain swamps and low shrubby thickets.

Year round, even during the breeding season, population density is somewhat low and spread out. Overwintering population densities are usually found to be lower than in the breeding season. The density of the population ultimately depends on the type of forest being inhabited.

During migration, blue-headed vireos are often found to flock with groups of different sparrow species but rarely with members of its own species.

=== Habitat loss ===
When blue-headed vireos arrive on their breeding grounds, typically in mid-April, many deciduous trees have yet to leaf out, leading them to nest in evergreen trees including hemlocks (&quot;Tsuga&quot;). Recently, however, many hemlocks in eastern USA have been killed by an invasive Asian insect, the Hemlock woolly adelgid (&quot;Adelges tsugae&quot;), leaving the vireos with fewer nesting options until spring leaf opening begins for deciduous trees.

== Behaviour ==
=== Vocalizations ===
The primary song of the blue-headed vireo is a simple, slow, monotonous tune that is often confused with the faster red-eyed vireo (&quot;Vireo olivaceus&quot;) song. The primary song is sung only by the males and usually only during the breeding season. The males become quite vocal during the breeding season, with the song frequency reaching its height prior to mating and then decreasing after copulation. Both sexes share a series of calls that are used in both defence of nests, interspecies competition, and communication between breeding pairs while foraging.

When foraging during the breeding season, mated pairs constantly communicate with each other using a series of high pitched chirping calls.

=== Diet ===
Blue-headed vireos are mainly insectivorous birds but are also known to eat fleshy berries and fruit. They are equipped with short, strong bills used for processing insect prey with a tough carapace such as beetles. Foraging usually occurs in the mid level of trees. A foraging blue-headed vireo will hop from branch to branch on the same or to an adjacent tree and will then fly towards its prey to capture it. Typical prey consist mostly of caterpillars, butterflies and moths but may also include tree bugs, stink bugs, beetles, bees, ants, flies, dragonflies, grasshoppers, crickets, spiders and, on some occasions, snails. Fruit feeding occurs primarily during migration and overwintering, especially when overwintering in more tropical regions where fruit is more abundant or if the insect populations are low. This large and varied diet is an example of an opportunistic feeding strategy, allowing the blue-headed vireo to be plastic in its ability to adapt to resource availability.

=== Reproduction ===
When arriving to the breeding ground in mid-April, male vireos will hold large, individual territories that can range from . Females will choose a male to mate with depending on the male&#x27;s ability to defend and control a large territory. While defending their territory from other males, the male vireos will sing a primary song to attract females. Undecided females can usually be seen flying along the edges of competing male territories; usually this will force the two males into direct conflict for the right to copulate with the female.

Once a female has approached a suitable mate, the male will perform a series of mating rituals. Typically, these rituals involve the male building a courtship nest for the female. The courtship nest is not a full nest but is most likely an attempt by the male to display his ability to gather resources. Once the pair is established, the courtship nest is abandoned. Mating does not occur for approximately 2 weeks after pair has been established. During this time, the male and the female will cooperatively build a breeding nest which is typically formed between forking mid-level branches of evergreen and deciduous trees and are composed of twigs and foliage. Breeding nests are not reused in following breeding seasons.

In one breeding season, a female will lay 3–5 eggs at a rate of 1 egg per day. Eggs are creamy white with brown or black spots and are 17–23.1 x 13.3–15.8 mm (0.055–0.075 in x 0.04–0.05 in). Eggs are incubated for approximately 14 days after being laid. Once hatched, infants are highly altricial, often having little to no downy feathers. Infants open their eyes during day 5 or 6 and will begin to fledge after 14 days for a total chick-rearing period of 28 days. Once the young are able to leave the nest, the parents will split the juveniles and separate. Juveniles are usually dependent on the parent to provide food for approximately 1 month after leaving the nest. If the nest is destroyed or a mating pair produces a failed brood, an attempt to re-nest may occur but this ultimately depends on when the brood fails. If the brood fails early on in the season, there is a higher chance that the pair will re-nest, if later, the pair will often separate and not attempt a second brood.

Blue-headed vireo&#x27;s have an atypical breeding strategy when compared to other closely related species. Blue-headed vireo males will assist their mates with daytime incubation of eggs, nest construction, and feeding of the chicks. Also, unlike most bird species, female blue-headed vireos do not attempt any extra-pair copulations with other males. Likewise, males make no attempt to guard females from other males, making blue-headed vireos both socially and genetically monogamous birds.

==== Hormonal effects on parental care ====
The increase in male blue-headed vireo parental care is thought to be attributed to the levels of testosterone and prolactin found in the plasma of these birds during the mating season. Testosterone, a steroid hormone that is secreted by the testes, has been found to increase aggressive behaviour in male birds during the breeding season and that these males display less parental care if their testosterone levels are maintained. Conversely, prolactin is a peptide hormone that is regulated by the hypothalamus that has been found at higher levels in birds that do the majority of incubation. It was found that in the early breeding season, male blue-headed vireos have a low testosterone level and will maintain this low level at all stages of the season. This low level does not affect the Vireo&#x27;s ability to compete with other males for territory however, as a high testosterone level has been found to not be necessary for territory establishment. Prolactin levels of the males were found to be high very early on in the breeding season and are maintained for the duration of the season. This high level of prolactin along with a low testosterone level, explains why male blue-headed vireos are so involved in the construction of the nest, daytime incubation, and feeding of the nestlings.

=== Predation ===
Blue-headed vireos have a low nesting success rate, with about 10–30% of hatchlings surviving. Common predators of the blue-headed vireo eggs and chicks include blue jays, crows, and squirrels.

Often, when a nest is attacked by a blue jay, the male and female will execute coordinated attacks on the approaching predator. This usually involves one partner swooping towards the blue jay while calling the mate who will then execute a second attack. Blue-headed vireos have also been known to nest close to nesting raptorial birds that do not prey on them. It is thought that they use the raptors as protection from squirrels that are, in turn, hunted by these bird of prey.

The largest contributor to the low nesting success rate of the blue-headed vireo is most likely the parasitic brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;). These birds will often lay their large eggs overtop the existing brood, causing the parents to feed the cowbird which will ultimately starve the infant Vireos.

<text>BAPTA (1,2-bis(&quot;o&quot;-aminophenoxy)ethane-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N′&quot;,&quot;N′&quot;-tetraacetic acid) is a calcium-specific aminopolycarboxylic acid. The presence of four carboxylic acid functional groups makes possible the binding of two calcium ions. The extensive flexibility of the carboxylate ligands is critical to the coordination of calcium and other metal ions. Due to its properties, it is used in research to chelate Ca2+, similarly to EGTA and EDTA. 

There is a range of reported values for the dissociation constant of BAPTA, though 0.2 μM appears consistently. The rate constant for calcium binding is 500 μM−1 s−1. The complexation process of calcium ion to BAPTA can be deconvoluted into three main processes: conformational changes of the glicol linker, nitrogen conjugation and electronic effects changes of the benzene rings.

BAPTA is a component of some fluorescent calcium ion indicators such as Calcium Green and Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 and -2 (OGB-1, OGB2). These indicators change their fluorescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime depending on the calcium ion concentration.

<text>The Prevention of Terrorism Acts were a series of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1974 to 1989 that conferred emergency powers upon police forces where they suspected terrorism.

The direct ancestor of the bill was the Prevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Act 1939 which was brought into law in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the S-Plan. The Prevention of Violence Act was allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be reintroduced under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974.

In 2000, the acts were replaced with the more permanent Terrorism Act 2000, which contained many of their powers, and then the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. See also Terrorism (Northern Ireland) Act 2006.

== Powers contained in the acts ==

Section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 provided for temporary powers to examine of persons travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, both within the UK and the Common Travel Area. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides for similar powers that remains in force.

== Censorship ==
In 1980, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; filmed the IRA on patrol in Carrickmore. The footage was seized by police under the Prevention of Terrorism Acts following an outcry in parliament and the press. They were also used to convict Channel 4 and an independent production company over a &quot;Dispatches&quot; report in 1991 under new powers in the 1989 revision.

== History of the acts ==
The first act was enacted in 1974 following the IRA bombing campaigns of the early 1970s. The Act was introduced by Roy Jenkins, then Home Secretary, as a severe and emergency reaction to the Birmingham pub bombs. The apparent chronology was that there were pub bombings by the IRA in Birmingham on 21 November 1974. 21 people died and 184 were injured. There was a strong desire to respond to what was perceived as &quot;the greatest threat [to the country] since the end of the Second World War.&quot; The conception of the Bill was announced on 25 November, when the Home Secretary warned that: &quot;The powers... are Draconian. In combination they are unprecedented in peacetime.&quot;. Parliament was supportive and had passed the Bill by 29 November, virtually without amendment or dissent. The Bill passed through the Commons on 28 and 29 November and passed through Lords on 29 November. In fact, much of the Bill had been drafted in secrecy during the previous year, as shown in the only full-length television commentary on the legislation by Clive Walker.

The Philips commission on Criminal Procedure, published 1981, had a significant impact on the subsequent 1984 legislation.

It was rewritten in 1976, 1984 and again in 1989, but continued to stay as emergency &#x27;temporary&#x27; powers, that had to be renewed each year. The first three Acts all contained final date clauses beyond the annual renewal, this provision was not included in the 1989 Act.

<text>The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) is the body responsible for the operation of His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO) and of other public information services of the United Kingdom. The OPSI is part of the National Archives of the United Kingdom and is responsible for Crown copyright.

The OPSI announced on 21 June 2006 that it was merging with the National Archives. The merger took place in October 2006. The OPSI continues to discharge its roles and responsibilities from within the structure of the National Archives.

== Controller of HMSO and Director of OPSI ==

The Controller of HMSO is also the Director of OPSI. HMSO continues to operate from within the expanded remit of OPSI. The Controller of HMSO also holds the offices of Kings&#x27;s Printer of Acts of Parliament, King&#x27;s Printer for Scotland and Government Printer for Northern Ireland.

By virtue of holding these offices OPSI publishes, through HMSO, the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, &quot;Edinburgh Gazette&quot;, &quot;Belfast Gazette&quot; and all legislation in the United Kingdom, including Acts of Parliament, Acts of the Scottish Parliament and statutory instruments.

The Controller of HMSO is appointed by Letters Patent to the office of King&#x27;s Printer of Acts of Parliament. This office is separate from the functions of OPSI. Historically the role of King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Printer extended to other official publishing responsibilities, e.g. the rights to print, publish and import the King James Bible and Book of Common Prayer within England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The current holder of this office is Cambridge University Press.

==History==

HMSO was established as a new department of HM Treasury on 5 April 1786, when John Mayor was appointed as its first superintendent. The creation of the office was a result of the advocacy of Edmund Burke for reforms of the corrupt, expensive and inefficient Royal Household and the Civil Service. Before the establishment of HMSO, the Crown would grant patents (exclusive rights) for the supply of stationery; the patentee could buy these supplies cheaply and then charge highly inflated prices.

At first, HMSO was the agent for various government departments but, from 1822, all government departments were required to buy stationery through the open competitions and tenders operated by HMSO.

HMSO also took over as official publisher for both houses of Parliament from &quot;Hansard&quot; in 1882.

In 1889, HMSO was granted letters patent under which it was appointed as Queen&#x27;s Printer of Acts of Parliament (&quot;printer to Her Majesty of all Acts of Parliament&quot;). These letters patent also appointed the Controller of HMSO as administrator of the rights of Crown copyright. HMSO also took over publication of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; in the same year.

In 1986 HMSO celebrated its bicentenary.

Since 1947, it has printed 86 million copies of &quot;The Highway Code&quot;. It is one of the biggest publishers in the world, having published 9,300 titles last year and holding 49,000 titles in stock. It produces nearly 600 pages of Hansard and other parliamentary papers overnight, as well as Bills, Acts, white papers, 2.3 million passports a year, 28.2 million pension and allowance books a year, and all sorts of other publications from the &quot;British Pharmacopoeia&quot; to guides to long-distance footpaths. In the 1980s, the Stationery Office also supplied 1,500 million envelopes a year (at a cost of £11 million) as well as 18 million ball-point pens and 188 million paper-clips.

Most of its publishing functions were privatised in 1996 as a separate company known as The Stationery Office (TSO), but HMSO continued as a separate part of the Cabinet Office. Prior to 1996, it was the publisher of virtually all government material, such as command papers, legislation and official histories. After 1996, the Controller of HMSO remained Queen&#x27;s Printer of Acts of Parliament and retained the role of administering Crown copyright.

The privatisation was not the final stage in HMSO&#x27;s changing role. As part of the implementation of the European Union directive on the re-use of public sector information, it was decided that there was a need for a dedicated body to be the principal focal point for advising on and regulating the operation of public sector information re-use. That new body, created in 2005, is the OPSI.

<doc id="410476" wikidata="Q533886" url="?curid=410476" title="Angelic Layer">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by Clamp. The manga was published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten, and in English originally by Tokyopop, but has since been re-licensed by Dark Horse Comics. It was the group&#x27;s first work using a significantly pared-down style, which lowered emphasis on detail and accentuated posing and gestures. It would later be repeated in series like &quot;Chobits&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The manga was adapted into a 26-episode anime series produced by Bones titled which aired on TV Tokyo from April 1, 2001 – September 23, 2001. Seven volumes of videos were released by ADV Films on VHS and DVD in 2003. It was re-released in 2005 as a five-volume box set. North American publisher Dark Horse Comics re-released &quot;Angelic Layer&quot; in omnibus format in 2011. Sentai Filmworks re-released the series under their Sentai Selects label on November 24, 2015. Anime Limited re-released the series in the United Kingdom in 2018.

&quot;Angelic Layer&quot; takes place in the same universe as Clamp&#x27;s later work &quot;Chobits&quot;, which similarly deals with the relationship between humans, human-created devices, toys, and godlike power. Several characters also appear in Clamp&#x27;s &quot;&quot; including most of the main characters, as well as the angel Blanche.

==Plot==

The primary protagonist is Misaki Suzuhara. Despite her short appearance, she is a seventh grader who just moved to Tokyo to live with her aunt, Shouko Asami. After arriving in the city outside of Tokyo Station, Misaki watches a battle between two dolls on a big live-screen called Angelic Layer, a highly popular game in which players (called Deus) buy and custom-design dolls known as Angels that are moved by mental control when on a field called the &quot;layer&quot;.

Interested in learning about Angelic Layer, an eccentric man wearing a white lab coat and glasses, calling himself &quot;Icchan&quot; (いっちゃん), encourages Misaki to purchase and create her own angel. She wants the angel to be &quot;a short girl, but strong and happy&quot;, and names it Hikaru, based on Hikaru Shidō from Clamp&#x27;s &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; (a manga in &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;&#x27;s world). Even though she&#x27;s clueless about the game, Misaki soon competes in tournaments and is assisted and watched carefully by Icchan. Later, Icchan&#x27;s identity is revealed as Ichiro Mihara, the co-creator of Angelic Layer.

Misaki begins studying at the Eriol Academy, an educational institution that includes grades from kindergarten through high school. There she becomes friends with Hatoko Kobayashi, a very intelligent and mature kindergarten girl who is a famous Deus and an Angelic Layer expert. Her incredibly fast angel Suzuka is a favorite contender in tournaments. Misaki also befriends Hatoko&#x27;s older brother Kōtarō and his friend Tamayo Kizaki, a girl fascinated by martial arts. Both turn out to be Misaki&#x27;s classmates.

While adjusting to her new surroundings, Misaki is also gripped by her past. Her thoughts often dwell on her mother, whom she has not seen since pre-school. Eventually, Misaki learns that her mother was key in the development of Angelic Layer, which she worked on in an attempt to develop a perfect prosthesis for her multiple sclerosis, which has confined her to a wheelchair. Her mother is also the Deus of Athena and the champion of Angelic Layer.

Differences between the manga and the anime adaptation: Misaki names her angel after her favorite doll from childhood. The ending to the manga also has different couplings. In the manga, Misaki&#x27;s mother does not have multiple sclerosis. Icchan plays an important role in the &quot;Chobits&quot; storyline, but this connection was reduced to a single scene in the anime; the &quot;Chobits&quot; anime was also made by Madhouse instead of Bones. Kaede&#x27;s younger brother Minoru is also a &quot;Chobits&quot; character.

==Reception==
&quot;Angelic Layer&quot; won the Animation Kobe Award for TV Feature in 2001. Jason Bustard of THEM Anime Reviews gave &quot;Angelic Layer&quot; a five-star rating, noting that the character designs were well-presented and the animation was colourful. He also claimed that &quot;Angelic Layer&quot; portrayed the concepts of friendship and how &quot;through common interests, even very different people can be friends&quot;. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network however, published a less favorable review, comparing it to &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Digimon&quot;, and calling it a glorified tie-in to &quot;a toy you can&#x27;t purchase&quot;.

<doc id="410479" wikidata="Q596518" url="?curid=410479" title="Yellow-throated vireo">
<text>The yellow-throated vireo (Vireo flavifrons) is a small American songbird.

==Etymology==
&quot;Vireo&quot; is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific &quot;flavifrons&quot; is from the Latin words &quot;flavus&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, and &quot;frons&quot;, &quot;forehead&quot;.

==Description==

Adults are mainly olive on the head and upperparts with a yellow throat and white belly; they have dark eyes with yellow &quot;spectacles&quot;. The tail and wings are dark with white wing bars. They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.1–5.9 in (13–15 cm)
* Weight: 0.5–0.7 oz (15–21 g)
* Wingspan: 9.1 in (23 cm)

==Habitat and distribution==
Their breeding habitat is open deciduous woods in southern Canada and the eastern United States.

These birds migrate to the deep southern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America. They are very rare vagrants to western Europe; there is a September 1990 record from Kenidjack Valley in Cornwall, Great Britain, and September 1998 record from Heligoland, a small German archipelago in the German Bight.

==Diet and behaviour==
They forage for insects high in trees. They also eat berries, especially before migration and in winter when they are occasionally seen feeding on gumbo-limbo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;) fruit. They make a thick cup nest attached to a fork in a tree branch.

<text>Oxbow is an unincorporated community in Baker County, Oregon, United States. Oxbow is along Oregon Route 86 next to the Snake River near the Oxbow Dam on the Oregon-Idaho border, about northeast of Halfway. Oxbow is just south of the site of the former mining town of Copperfield. Oxbow has a post office with a ZIP code 97840.

There was once a station named Oxbow on a portion of the Oregon Short Line Railroad now inundated by Oxbow Reservoir. It was named for The Oxbow, a U-shaped bend in the Snake River named for the agricultural implement. The present-day community of Oxbow was established in the early 1960s near the former site of Copperfield during the building of the Oxbow Dam by the Idaho Power Company. Oxbow post office was established on May 1, 1965, after moving the office from Homestead six miles to the north. At one time, Oxbow had a school.

==Climate==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F (22 °C). According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Oxbow has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

From 2016 to 2024, the trio presented Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;.

Hammond has also presented entertainment documentary series &quot;&quot; (2003–2008), the game show &quot;Total Wipeout&quot; (2009–2012) and nature documentary series &quot;Planet Earth Live&quot; (2012). In 2016, along with Clarkson and May, Hammond launched the automotive social media website DriveTribe, which is a popular motoring channel on Youtube.

==Early life==
Richard Mark Hammond was born on 19 December 1969, in Solihull, Warwickshire, eldest of three sons of Alan and Eileen Hammond. His younger brothers are Andrew (writer of the &#x27;Crypt&#x27; series) and Nicholas. He is the grandson of workers in the Birmingham car industry. In the mid-1980s Hammond moved with his family to the North Yorkshire cathedral city of Ripon located 10 miles south of the market town of Bedale, and 8 miles south of the village of Thornton Watlass where his father ran a probate business in the market square. He attended Blossomfield Infant School in Solihull&#x27;s Sharmans Cross district from the age of 3–7. Originally a pupil of Solihull School, a fee-paying boys&#x27; independent school, he moved to Ripon Grammar School, and from 1986 to 1988 attended Harrogate College of Art and Technology. According to a 2011 episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; (Series 16, Episode 5), Hammond&#x27;s first job was shovelling grit into a water filtration plant.

==Career==
After graduation, Hammond worked for several BBC radio stations, including Radio Cleveland, Radio York, Radio Cumbria, Radio Leeds and Radio Newcastle; as well as working for Renault&#x27;s press office as a means to meet people from the motoring press. 

Presenting the afternoon programme at Radio Lancashire, his regular guests included motoring journalist Zog Ziegler, who would review a car of the week by being interviewed by Hammond over the phone. The two became good friends, and it was Ziegler who encouraged Hammond to enter into motoring reviews on television. After starting out on satellite TV (&quot;Men &amp; Motors&quot;), he auditioned for &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

===&quot;Top Gear&quot;===
Hammond became a presenter on &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2002, when the show began in its revamped format. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Hamster&quot; by fans and his co-presenters due to his name and relatively small stature compared to May and Clarkson.

Following a high-speed dragster crash while filming in September 2006 near York, Hammond returned in the first episode of series 9 (broadcast on 28 January 2007) to a hero&#x27;s welcome, complete with dancing girls, aeroplane-style stairs and fireworks. The show also contained images of the crash, which had made international headlines, with Hammond talking through the events of the day after which the audience broke into spontaneous applause. Hammond then requested that the crash never be mentioned on the show again, though all three &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenters have since referred to it in jokes during the news segment of the programme. He told his colleagues, &quot;The only difference between me now and before the crash is that I like celery now and I didn&#x27;t before&quot;.

Following the BBC&#x27;s decision not to renew Clarkson&#x27;s contract with the show on 25 March 2015, Hammond&#x27;s contract expired on 31 March. In April, he ruled out the possibility of continuing to present &quot;Top Gear&quot;, commenting via Twitter that &quot;amidst all this talk of us &#x27;quitting&#x27; or not: there&#x27;s nothing for me to &#x27;quit&#x27;. Not about to quit my mates anyway&quot;. On 12 June 2015, the BBC confirmed that &quot;Top Gear&quot; would return with a 75-minute special, combining two unseen challenges featuring all three presenters from series 22, with studio links from Hammond and May. It aired in the UK on BBC Two on 28 June at 8 p.m, and in the United States on BBC America on 13 July at 9 p.m.

====&quot;Vampire&quot; dragster crash====

During filming of a &quot;Top Gear&quot; segment at the former RAF Elvington airbase near York on 20 September 2006, Hammond was injured in the crash of the jet-powered car he was piloting. He was travelling at at the time of the crash.

His vehicle, a dragster called &quot;Vampire&quot;, was theoretically capable of travelling at speeds of up to . The vehicle was the same car that in 2000, piloted by Colin Fallows, set the British land speed record at . The &quot;Vampire&quot; was powered by a single Bristol-Siddeley Orpheus afterburning turbojet engine producing of thrust.

Some accounts suggested that the accident occurred during an attempt to break the British land speed record, but the Health and Safety Executive report on the crash found that a proposal to try to officially break the record was vetoed in advance by &quot;Top Gear&quot; executive producer Andy Wilman, due to the risks and complexities of such a venture. The report stated: &quot;Runs were to be carried out in only one direction along a pre-set course on the Elvington runway. Vampire&#x27;s speed was to be recorded using GPS satellite telemetry. The intention was to record the maximum speed, not to measure an average speed over a measured course, and for (Hammond) to describe how it felt.&quot;

Hammond was completing a seventh and final run to collect extra footage for the programme when his front-right tyre failed, and, according to witness and paramedic Dave Ogden, &quot;one of the parachutes had deployed but it (the car) went on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100 yards from us.&quot; The emergency crew quickly arrived at the car, finding it inverted and partially embedded in the grass. During the roll, Hammond&#x27;s helmet had embedded itself into the ground, flipping the visor up and forcing soil into his mouth and damaging his left eye. Rescuers felt a pulse and heard the unconscious Hammond breathing before the car was turned upright. Hammond was cut free with hydraulic shears, and placed on a backboard. &quot;He was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain&quot;. He was then transported by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to the neurological unit of the Leeds General Infirmary. Hammond&#x27;s family visited him at the hospital along with &quot;Top Gear&quot; co-presenters James May and Jeremy Clarkson. Clarkson wished Hammond well, saying &quot;Both James and I are looking forward to getting our &#x27;Hamster&#x27; back&quot;, referring to Hammond by his nickname. For five weeks while Hammond was recovering in hospital, Clarkson sent a funny message to Mindy, Hammond&#x27;s wife, every day to try to keep her going. Hammond thought if everyone found out, Clarkson would &quot;die of shame&quot; &quot;cos it makes him look soppy&quot;.

The Health &amp; Safety Executive report stated that &quot;Hammond&#x27;s instantaneous reaction to the tyre blow-out seems to have been that of a competent high performance car driver, namely to brake the car and to try to steer into the skid. Immediately afterwards he also seems to have followed his training and to have pulled back on the main parachute release lever, thus shutting down the jet engine and also closing the jet and afterburner fuel levers. The main parachute did not have time to deploy before the car ran off the runway.&quot; The HSE notes that, based on the findings of the North Yorkshire Police (who investigated the crash), &quot;the accident may not have been recoverable&quot;, even if Hammond&#x27;s efforts to react were as fast as &quot;humanly possible&quot;.

Hammond made his first TV appearance since the crash on the BBC chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 22 December, just three months after the incident, where he revealed he was in a medically induced coma for two weeks and afterwards suffered from post-traumatic amnesia and a five-second memory. Despite saying he was &quot;absolutely fixed&quot; on the Jonathan Ross episode, in 2011, while talking to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Hammond admitted he had no memory of the interview, saying: &quot;I lost a year. I don&#x27;t remember doing the interview with Jonathan Ross or doing Top Gear Live in South Africa&quot; showing the full impact of his brain injury five years before.

The crash was shown on an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; on 28 January 2007 (Series 9, Episode 1); this was the first episode of the new series, which had been postponed pending Hammond&#x27;s recovery. Hammond requested at the end of the episode that his fellow presenters never mention the crash again, a request which has been generally observed, although occasional oblique references have been made by all three presenters. &quot;On The Edge: My Story&quot;, which contains first-hand accounts from both Hammond and his wife about the crash, immediate aftermath, and his recovery, was published later that year.

In February 2008, Hammond gave an interview to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper in which he described the effects of his brain injuries and the progression of his recovery. He reported suffering loss of memory, depression and difficulties with emotional experiences, for which he was consulting a psychiatrist. He also talked about his recovery in a 2010 television programme where he interviewed Sir Stirling Moss and they discussed the brain injuries they had both received as a result of car crashes.

===&quot;Brainiac: Science Abuse&quot;===

In 2003, Hammond became the first presenter of &quot;&quot;; he was joined by Jon Tickle and Charlotte Hudson in series 2. After the fourth series it was announced that Hammond was no longer going to present the Sky1 show after he signed an exclusive deal with the BBC. Vic Reeves took his place as main presenter for the show&#x27;s final two series.

===Other television work===
Early in his career, as well as his radio work, Hammond presented a number of daytime lifestyle shows and motoring programmes such as &quot;Motor Week&quot; on Men &amp; Motors.

He presented the &quot;Crufts&quot; dog show in 2005, the 2004 and 2005 British Parking Awards, and has appeared on &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, a quiz show on BBC One where celebrities answer questions about things they learned at school. He has also presented &quot;The Gunpowder Plot: Exploding the Legend&quot;. Along with his work on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, he presented &quot;Should I Worry About...?&quot; on BBC One, &quot;Time Commanders&quot; on BBC Two and the first four series of &quot;&quot; on Sky 1. He was also a team captain on the BBC Two quiz show, &quot;Petrolheads&quot;, in which a memorable part was one where Hammond was tricked into bumping his classic Ferrari while trying to parallel park blindfolded in another car.

In 2006, Hammond fronted the &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s 5 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; with his co-presenter Mel Giedroyc. The programme, which discussed a wide range of topics, was shown every weekday on ITV between 17:00 and 18:00.

In July 2005, Hammond was voted one of the top 10 British TV talents.

He presented &quot;Richard Hammond and the Holy Grail&quot; in 2006. During the special, he travelled to various locations around the world, including the Vatican Secret Archives, exploring the history of the Holy Grail.

As part of Red Nose Day 2007, Hammond stood for nomination via a public telephone vote, along with Andy Hamilton and Kelvin MacKenzie, to be a one-off co-presenter of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on 16 March 2007. However, he was defeated by Andy Hamilton.

In April 2007, Hammond presented a one-off special on BBC Radio 2 for Good Friday followed by another in August 2007 for the bank holiday.

Hammond recorded an interview with the famed American stuntman Evel Knievel, which aired on 23 December 2007 on BBC Two, and was Knievel&#x27;s last interview before his death on 30 November 2007.

In September 2008, Hammond presented the first episode of a new series; &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Engineering Connections&quot; on the National Geographic Channel. In this show, Hammond discovered how the inventions of the past, along with assistance from nature, help designers today. Episodes include the building of the Airbus A380, Taipei 101 and the Keck Observatory. Series 2 of &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Engineering Connections&quot; began in May 2010 and has included the building of the Wembley Stadium and the Sydney Opera House.

Hammond appeared in an advertisement for Morrisons supermarkets in 2008, and joined the cast of TV show &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; for a special insert on the 2008 Children in Need special.

While in New Zealand for &quot;Top Gear Live 2009&quot;, Hammond filmed several television commercials for Telecom New Zealand&#x27;s new XT UTMS mobile network. Telecom claimed that the new network was &quot;faster in more places&quot;, compared to its competitors and its existing CDMA network. After the network suffered three highly publicised outages in late 2009 and early 2010, Hammond became the butt of a joke when he did not return to New Zealand for &quot;Top Gear Live 2010&quot;. His fellow &quot;Top Gear&quot; co-hosts said he was too embarrassed to come back to New Zealand, and in a supposed live feed back to Hammond, the feed suddenly drops out as the &quot;XT Network had crashed&quot;. Hammond was later given the right of reply to his colleagues during an interview with Marcus Lush on RadioLIVE&#x27;s breakfast show in New Zealand.

Hammond hosted the UK version of the US series &quot;Wipeout&quot;, called &quot;Total Wipeout&quot; for BBC One. It took place in Argentina, and was co-presented by Hammond and Amanda Byram. Hammond presented and performed the voiceover for the clips in a London studio, and Byram was filmed at the obstacle course in Buenos Aires. The series was cancelled at the end of 2012.

Hammond also presented a science-themed game show for children, &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Blast Lab&quot; which aired on BBC Two and CBBC.

In March 2010, Hammond presented a three-episode series called &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Invisible Worlds&quot;, which looked at things too fast for the naked eye to see, things that are beyond the visible spectrum (e.g., ultraviolet and infra-red light), as well as microscopic things.

One of Hammond&#x27;s lesser known television roles was as presenter of the BBC Two gameshow &quot;Time Commanders&quot;, a sophisticated warfare simulator which used a modified version of Creative Assembly&#x27;s &quot;&quot; game engine.

Since February 2011, Hammond has presented an online technology series &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Tech Head&quot;. In July 2011, Hammond presented a two-part natural science documentary &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Journey to the Centre of the Planet&quot;, focused on Earth geology and plate tectonics.

In April 2012, Hammond hosted a BBC America programme titled &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Crash Course&quot;, which was also shown in the UK from September 2012 on BBC Two. In May 2012, Hammond co-presented an animal documentary for BBC One called &quot;Planet Earth Live&quot; alongside Julia Bradbury. The programme recorded animals living in extreme conditions.

In September 2015, Hammond presented a two-part documentary for Sky 1 called &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Jungle Quest&quot;, supported by Sky Rainforest Rescue.

In March 2017, whilst filming for &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; episode &quot;Feed the world&quot; in Mozambique, Hammond frequently fell off his motorbike due to the poor roads. On one occasion he reportedly hit his head and was knocked unconscious.

During the season finale of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; season three, Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson announced the current format was coming to the end and later announced that there would be two more seasons of specials, without the tent or live audience.

In January 2021, Hammond starred alongside &quot;MythBusters&quot;″ Tory Belleci in &quot;The Great Escapists&quot;, a fictional six-episode adventure series for Amazon, which was produced by Chimp Productions. The series stranded the pair on a deserted island where they used the resources they could find to build the means to survive.

====Rimac Concept One crash====
On 10 June 2017, Hammond crashed a Rimac Concept One while filming for &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; in Hemberg, Switzerland. He was on his last run up a timed hillclimb course during the Bergrennen Hemberg event. Just after crossing the finish line, the car ran off the road, tumbled down the hill and eventually came to rest upside down from the road.

Hammond remained conscious throughout and he later described the feeling of &quot;oh god, I&#x27;m going to die&quot;, as well as being &quot;aware of tumbling – sky, ground, sky, ground, sky, ground, sky, ground.&quot; He was airlifted to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a tibial plateau fracture in his left knee, and a plate and ten screws were surgically inserted.

Jeremy Clarkson and James May, fellow presenters on &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;, both witnessed the scene from afar; believing Hammond was dead, May recalled feeling a &quot;blossoming, white-hot ball of pure, sickening horror forming in my heart&quot;, and Clarkson described his &quot;knees turning to jelly&quot; at the sight of the crash.

After the ordeal, the FIA allegedly ruled that the &quot;show runs&quot; that Hammond and company were doing at the time of the accident violated the governing body&#x27;s International Sporting Code and that the crash &quot;acted against the interests of the sport.&quot; As a result, the Bergrennen Hemberg organizers were fined $5,138, and six-month license suspensions were imposed on race director Christian Müller and stewards Hermann Müller, Karl Marty, and Daniel Lenglet. In August of that year, Motorsport.com reported that the future of the entire event was &quot;now in jeopardy.&quot; Despite the reports, the Bergrennen Hemberg continues to be run annually.

====&quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Workshop&quot;====

Hammond announced on Twitter on 21 June 2021 that he would be making a show with Discovery+ about the restoration of old cars. Its first episode has been shown on 18 October 2021 with a total of 26 episodes in three seasons.

==Personal life==
Hammond married Amanda &quot;Mindy&quot; Hammond (), a columnist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, in May 2002, after they first met while working at a PR firm in London. They have two daughters born in 2001 and 2004. In January 2025, Hammond announced that he and his wife were separating after 28 years together. On February 9, 2025 Hammond announced on his podcast that his father had passed away. 

It was his friend Zoggy Ziegler who first gave Hammond his nickname Mr.Hamster. After the couple announced the impending birth of their first child, Ziegler&#x27;s response was &quot;And out will pop another hamster.&quot; The nickname stuck, especially on &quot;Top Gear&quot; due to his name and relatively small stature compared to May and Clarkson.

He and his family adopted TG, the official &quot;Top Gear&quot; dog, after it became apparent that the labradoodle was afraid of cars. The dog died at age 11 in January 2017.

Hammond plays bass guitar, on which he accompanied the other &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenters when they performed alongside Justin Hawkins on &quot;Top Gear of the Pops&quot; for Comic Relief in 2007.
He likes to ride his bicycle, scooter, or motorbike in cities, for which he is mocked mercilessly by fellow presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

During the news segment of &quot;Top Gear&quot;″s 2010 USA Road Trip special, Hammond openly expressed his dislike of the band Genesis. This fact was later exploited by his co-presenters (particularly by Clarkson, who has called Genesis one of his favorite bands) in three special episodes: during the Middle East Special, when they installed a secret second stereo unit in his Fiat Barchetta that only plays the band&#x27;s &quot;Live over Europe 2007&quot; album; in the India Special, Clarkson played the same song, &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; which was used in the previous special (albeit the &quot;Seconds Out&quot; version) through the megaphone mounted in his Jaguar XJS, despite Hammond driving a different car (a Mini Cooper Sport). In the 2013 Africa Special, Clarkson (BMW 528i Touring) once again played Genesis in an attempt to get Hammond (Subaru Impreza WRX Estate) to let him pass.

In 2007, Hammond went to Africa on a &quot;Top Gear&quot; special across Botswana, with his choice of car being a 1963 Opel Kadett, which he subsequently named Oliver. A week after the special was aired, Hammond announced during the news section that he had shipped Oliver back to the UK, where it was restored by a team from &quot;Practical Classics&quot; magazine. Oliver features on Hammond&#x27;s children&#x27;s science television show &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Blast Lab&quot; and in another episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; as a kind of &quot;Hill-holder&quot; in the trailer truck challenge (after it acquired the fake personal plate &quot;OLI V3R&quot;). Oliver is also mentioned in Hammond&#x27;s second autobiography &quot;As You Do&quot;.

In 2010, Hammond was the president of the 31st Herefordshire Country Fair held at Hampton Court in Hope under Dinmore. His involvement caused unprecedented attendance with &quot;nearly 15,000 people&quot; drawn to the event to meet the presenter.

In March 2012, Hammond passed his B206 LST helicopter licence and has since owned a Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter.

In September 2018, his wife reported that she and Richard, along with their fifteen-year-old daughter, had been burgled while sleeping at a holiday villa in Saint-Tropez, speculating that they might have been rendered unconscious by noxious gas.

===Residences===
The Hammond family live in a mock castle in Herefordshire, and they also have an apartment in London. In an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in February 2008, it was reported that Hammond had moved briefly from Gloucestershire to Buckinghamshire, then back again, because he missed the country life.

In October 2012, it was reported he had spent over £2 million buying Bollitree Castle which is situated near Weston under Penyard, Ross-on-Wye. It has been rumoured he has also bought a large house in the town of Wantage, Oxfordshire.

==Charity work==
Hammond is an ambassador of UK charity for children with brain injury and neuro-disability The Children&#x27;s Trust.

On 29 September 2013, terminally-ill eight-year-old Emilia Palmer was driven by Hammond in a pink Lamborghini Aventador Roadster (newly repainted for the occasion). Hammond flew his Robinson R44 helicopter, G-OHAM, to Shobdon Airfield in Herefordshire, then picked Palmer up from her home in Kimbolton, Herefordshire and drove her back to the airport for a high-speed run on the main runway. The event was arranged at short notice by Rays of Sunshine.

==Controversies==
Hammond&#x27;s comments and actions have sometimes resulted in complaints from viewers, LGBT rights charities, and foreign diplomats.

During the second episode of series sixteen of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Hammond suggested that no one would ever want to own a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be &quot;lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence, asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat.&quot; Hammond finished with the remark &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but can you imagine waking up and remembering you&#x27;re Mexican?!&quot; The comments prompted Mexico&#x27;s ambassador in London, Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza, to lodge an official complaint to the BBC. Demanding an apology from the BBC, the ambassador stated: &quot;These offensive, xenophobic and humiliating remarks only serve to reinforce negative stereotypes and perpetuate prejudice against Mexico and its people.&quot; The BBC defended the broadcast of this segment on the grounds that such national stereotyping was a &quot;robust part&quot; of traditional British humour.

In December 2016, in reference to the interior styling of a Volvo S90, co-presenter Clarkson joked that &quot;the only problem is that in one of those, you couldn&#x27;t enjoy a chocolate Magnum ice cream&quot; – to which Hammond responded: &quot;It&#x27;s all right, I don&#x27;t eat ice cream. It&#x27;s something to do with being straight.&quot; It has been speculated that the joke was written as a reference to a Kingis ice cream advert in Finland, where that episode of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; was filmed. LGBT rights campaigner Peter Tatchell who was unaware of the reference, accused Hammond of &quot;pandering to prejudice&quot;, adding that &quot;it&#x27;s a perverse world when everyday pleasures like ice cream becomes the butt of homophobic innuendo.&quot; A spokesperson for UK LGBT rights charity Stonewall stated that &quot;Hammond&#x27;s choice of words were not just ridiculous, but chosen purposefully to mock and belittle.&quot; A year later, in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, Hammond stated: &quot;Look, anyone who knows me knows I wasn&#x27;t being serious, that I&#x27;m not homophobic. Love is love, whatever the sex of the two people in love... It may be because I live in a hideously safe and contained middle-class world, where a person&#x27;s sexuality is not an issue&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Newsweek Today&quot;, Hammond denied making homophobic comments, and refused to apologise for the remarks: &quot;I entirely reject any criticism of me being anti-gay. That&#x27;s just not the case.&quot;

<text>Pratas Island, also known as the Tungsha Islands or the Dongsha Islands (), is a coral island situated in the northern part of the South China Sea administered as part of Cijin District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. It is located about southeast of Hong Kong. It has an area of about , including of lagoon, and is the largest of the South China Sea Islands. It is the location of the Dongsha Airport.

There are three undersea features in the waters associated with Pratas Island: Pratas Atoll, North Vereker Bank and South Vereker Bank. The atoll is circular, and the crescent-shaped Pratas Island occupies its western part. Below the ocean&#x27;s surface to the northwest () of Pratas Island, North Vereker Bank rises to below sea level and South Vereker Bank to below sea level.

There are numerous oil wells to the west of the banks. In 2007, the Dongsha Atoll National Park was established on the island. The People&#x27;s Republic of China claims the island, atoll and banks as part of Guangdong Province.

== Pratas Islands ==

 Pratas Atoll is also called Pratas Reef.

Tungsha Island (Tung-sha Tao) () is the Wade–Giles-derived romanization of the Mandarin Chinese name for the island, and Dongsha Island (Dongsha Dao) is the pinyin-derived name. A smaller island with the same Chinese character name is located in the Taiwan-administered Dongyin Township in the Matsu Islands in the East China Sea.

The area including the island, atoll and banks is also called the Pratas Islands (), the Tungsha Islands and the Dongsha Islands. Despite these names, Pratas Island is the only island; there is no group of islands. Yoshiyuki Ogasawara in &quot;The Diplomat&quot; described the other entities as &quot;essentially rocks&quot;.

== History ==
The East Indiaman was wrecked on Pratas Island on or about 22 October 1800 with the loss of all aboard. At the time the island was known to British sailors as &quot;Perates&quot;. In 1851, the British screw sloop wrecked on the south-east bend of Pratas Atoll while going to the aid of another wrecked vessel; the crew were all saved. Decades later, the boilers and parts of the machinery of the wreckage of HMS &quot;Reynard&quot; remained visible on the atoll.

In 1859–1861, there was a correspondence between the British Colonial Office and the Hong Kong colonial authorities about building a lighthouse on the main island on the atoll. Despite an offer by a British businessman in Xiamen (Amoy) to build it, it was decided that the cost was too great and the matter lapsed. It is clear from the correspondence that no one supposed the atoll to be a part of any known jurisdiction, so negotiations might have been required to ensure that any construction would be legal.

One consequence of that initiative was that, in 1858, the Royal Navy survey ship completed the first detailed survey of the atoll, resulting in the &quot;Plan of the Pratas Reef and Island&quot;, J. Richards and others, April 1858, being published by the British Admiralty. On the resulting chart three positions are proposed for a lighthouse: on Pratas Island, on the north-east corner, or on the southern edge near where HMS &quot;Reynard&quot; had stranded. In the north-east corner of the lagoon the chart notes &quot;Anchorage for junks&quot;, indicating regular use by fishing and other small vessels taking shelter. The chart&#x27;s rubric noted that the available safe draft for vessels entering was only , so it was restricted to relatively small vessels only.

In 1866, naturalist Cuthbert Collingwood visited Pratas Island and later published a description of it.

In 1908–1909, a Japanese businessman named Nishizawa Yoshizi (西澤吉次) established a guano collecting station. He destroyed the Dawang Joss House (大王庙), dug up graves and poured the bone ashes of Chinese fishermen into the sea, and renamed the atoll &quot;Nishizawa Island&quot;. After a diplomatic confrontation, Chinese sovereignty was re-established, and Nishizawa withdrew, after being compensated by the Guangdong provincial government, and after paying compensation for the destruction of a Chinese fishermen&#x27;s shrine.

In December 1930, the schooner (Sweden) ran aground on a coral reef off Pratas Island and was wrecked.

On 22 May 1944, the Japanese gunboat was torpedoed and sunk by the US submarine , in the South China Sea off Pratas Island at , while towing the disabled passenger-cargo ship &quot;Tsukuba Maru&quot;. Casualties are unknown but her commanding officer was killed.

Japanese naval personnel occupied Pratas Island during World War II. The Japanese Navy used the island as a weather station and listening post. On May 29, 1945, at 10:22 AM, a landing party consisting of Australian commandos and US naval personnel from the submarine raised the US flag, declared the island a United States territory, and named it Bluegill Island. The landing party destroyed a radio tower, weather station, fuel and ammunition dumps, and several buildings. They encountered no resistance because the Japanese had left the island prior to the arrival of &quot;Bluegill&quot;.

Pratas Island was later restored to Guangdong Province of the Republic of China (ROC). On September 12, 1946, the navy of the Republic of China took over and garrisoned Pratas Island.

On 6 June 1949, the ROC established the Hainan Special Administrative District (海南特別行政區), which included Pratas Island.

In autumn 1954, the senior ROC politician Chiang Ching-kuo visited the island and made an inspection.

On 9 June 1960, during Typhoon Mary, the Hong Kong cargo ship was driven against Pratas Reef and wrecked. Her 55 crew took to the liferafts and were rescued by the USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (CV-10).

While underway in the South China Sea on 18 July 1965, the USS &quot;Frank Knox&quot; ran aground on Pratas Reef, and was only freed on 24 August after a very difficult salvage effort.
On 13 April 1996, the jurisdiction of the Taiwan Kaohsiung District Court was extended to include Tungsha Island (Pratas Island).

In May 1999, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh visited the island and hung an address plate on the island’s fishing service station. On 21 December 2000, ROC President Chen Shui-bian visited the island with Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh. On 28 July 2005, President Chen Shui-bian again visited the island and inaugurated the Fifth Maritime Patrol Squad of the Coast Guard Administration.

In January 2007, the ROC government designated the Pratas atoll as the Dongsha Atoll National Park, the first marine national park in Taiwan.

On 8 January 2013, an office of Chunghwa Post was established on Pratas Island.

In September 2020, the PRC conducted air drills over the waters between the main island of Taiwan and Pratas Island that intruded into the ROC air defense identification zone (ADIZ). The planes were issued radio warnings by the ROC military until they left.

On 15 October 2020, a regular civilian charter flight by Uni Air had to abandon its trip from the main island of Taiwan to Pratas Island when Hong Kong air traffic controllers told the captain of the aircraft that there were &quot;dangerous activities&quot; happening below and that the Uni Air aircraft could not enter the Hong Kong Flight Information Region (FIR). The transcript of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic control was released by the ROC Civil Aeronautics Administration. The next day, the ROC Minister of National Defense Yen Teh-fa called on PRC not to &quot;disrupt the order of international aviation&quot;. On 20 October, Deputy Chief of the ROC General Staff, Lieutenant-General Li Ting-sheng (李廷盛), visited Pratas Island. He made an inspection of the living facilities of the military personnel and gave them instructions. On 26 October, the same Uni Air aircraft made the round trip flight between the main island of Taiwan and Pratas Island.

On 27 October 2020, a Y8 PRC military aircraft entered ROC air defense identification zone (ADIZ) between the main island of Taiwan and Pratas Island for the twenty-first time that month. On 28 October, Zhu Fenglian of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the PRC was asked whether, in light of PLA military exercises in Fujian and Guangdong, there was or was not a plan to take Pratas Island from the ROC. Feng responded that she did not have to answer hypothetical questions. On 2 November, eight Chinese PLAAF aircraft breached the ROC ADIZ above an area of sea near Pratas Island. On 3 November, Y-8 plane entered the ADIZ of the ROC in the area between the main island of Taiwan and Pratas Island. On 4 November, the ROC Minister of National Defense, Yen Teh-fa, stated in a legislative hearing that since January 2020, 276 PRC military planes had entered the airspace between the main island of Taiwan and Pratas Island, activity that Yen associated with plans by the PRC for a creating its own ADIZ in the South China Sea. On 6 December, a PRC air force Y-8 plane entered the Taiwan ADIZ between the main island of Taiwan and Pratas Island, the fifth day in December that PRC military aircraft entered Taiwan&#x27;s ADIZ.

== Geography ==

Pratas Island is located from the rest of Kaoshiung, southwest of Taipei, southeast of Hong Kong and south of Shantou, Guangdong in the northern part of the South China Sea (). An international team of researchers conducted a comprehensive population genetic analysis of 11 marine species sampled from the island. They concluded that Dongsha Atoll is an important regional stepping-stone that promotes genetic connectivity among South China Sea reefs, as marine larvae can potentially reach a large number of reefs in the northern South China Sea. The protection of the island and surrounding reefs by the Taiwanese government as Dongsha Atoll National Park may therefore benefit the entire region.

Pratas Island is long and wide; it is the only feature of the group above sea level. The island is made up of coral atolls and reef flats. Brush, vines and bushes cover some of the island - the rest is white sand. Flora and fauna on and around Pratas Island include:
* Silver silk tree
* Strawberry tung tree
* Coconut tree
* Little terns
* Turnstones
* Gull-billed terns
* Parrotfish
* Starfish
* Rock lobsters

In the &quot;Journal of Science&quot; (April 1867) there is a nine-page article entitled &quot;The Natural History of Pratas Island in the China Sea&quot; by Dr. Cuthbert Collingwood, the naturalist on board . It describes what was observed, especially bird life, during a visit of two days while the survey ship lay at anchor. Collingwood explored the island on 30 April 1866.

The Vereker Banks () are northwest of Pratas Atoll. North and South Vereker Banks are under water. North Vereker Bank (北衛灘) rises to below sea level with an average depth of to below sea level. A well head with a depth of lies off North Vereker Bank. Two to three miles of deep water separate North Vereker Bank and South Vereker Bank. South Vereker Bank (南衛灘) rises to below sea level. A well head, in a depth of over , lies north of the Vereker Banks at . The associated production platform and SPM make up Lu Feng Terminal; the terminal is enclosed by a restricted area. Exploration for oil is taking place in this area.

There are also some seamount formations nearby which are not part of the three atolls:
* Jianfeng Seamount (尖峰海山)
* Maojia Seamount (芼架海山)
* Beipo Seamount (北波海山)

== Politics and government ==
The island is part of the Republic of China (Taiwan) with the postal code 817. Although there are no long-term inhabitants on the island, Pratas is administered by the Kaohsiung City Government under Cijin District (Qijin). The island has been uninhabited, yet nations (including China and Japan) have claimed them to be their overseas territory.

===Military===
, about five hundred Taiwanese marines were stationed on Pratas Island. The island has a network of underground bunkers. According to regulations updated on December 2, 2020, in the event that communication is cut off between mainland Taiwan and Pratas Island or Taiping Island (Itu Aba), the highest-ranking local officer can make the decision to fire back at assailants.

===Cross-strait relations===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China claims the Pratas Islands () as part of Chengqu, Shanwei (Swabue), Guangdong Province.

According to an anonymous PLA source, plans created around 2010 by China for an air defence identification zone in the South China Sea include Pratas Island airspace. The PLA&#x27;s actions near the southwest corner of the Taiwan ADIZ and Pratas Island in late 2020 led to speculation that the area might be declared part of an ADIZ by China.

In the later half of 2020, repeated reports of Chinese military exercises and fly overs near the island were interpreted as an apparent attempt to cut off the supply line between Pratas Island and mainland Taiwan.

== Pratas Island settlement ==
As an island with no permanent inhabitants, it is visited largely by fishermen, military personnel and researchers. Amateur radio operators participating in the DXCC and Islands on the Air awards programs also visit occasionally.

===Landmarks===
An obelisk was erected after 1946.

In 1954 the ROC Government personnel stationed on Pratas erected a stone tablet on the southern side of the island, facing the ocean.

The Da Wang temple is dedicated to &#x27;Kuang Kang&#x27; and &#x27;The South China Sea Goddess&#x27; - Mazu. It is said that the statue of Guan Gong came to Pratas Island on a canoe in 1948. The soldiers on Pratas Island built a temple to worship her in 1975. Today, the canoe is still kept in the temple. The joss sticks and candles are donated by soldiers, as was the golden sign hung in front of the statue. There is an &#x27;Ever Green&#x27; pavilion in front of the temple which was also built by the soldiers. It is the most verdant place on the island.

The Minister for Internal Affairs of the ROC erected the South China Sea Defense stone tablet to declare Republic of China sovereignty in 1989.

In July 1991 the Kaohsiung City Government erected the Pratas Island measuring memorial stone tablet as a symbol that Pratas Island falls within the jurisdiction of Kaohsiung City. Within Kaohsiung, the island belongs to Cijin District (Qijin).

The ROC Government established the Triangulation Benchmark as the triangulation point for Pratas Island in December 1991. There are words on each side of the base of the triangulation point stone tablet. They read &#x27;The Pratas Triangulation Point&#x27; on the front, and &#x27;Longitude: 116o 43&quot; 42.5601&#x27;E, Latitude: 20o 42&#x27; 6.2415&#x27;N, Height: 2.4875 meters.&#x27; The words &#x27;Defend the South China Sea&#x27;, written by the commander, Lo Ben Li, were also engraved on the stone tablet. The National Tsing Hua University webpage about the island states: &quot;In addition to making it more convenient to survey and draw navigational maps, and to construct and develop facilities on the island, the establishment of the triangulation point is also the basis of our sovereign rights.&quot;

===Public buildings===

The library is located on one side of the main plaza, and is the center for soldiers to use educational services. The library contains more than two thousand books.

The military post office is Office No. 67. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications issued the &#x27;South China Sea Islands Map Stamps&#x27; in 1996, as a set of two stamps. The inscription &#x27;South China Sea Defense&#x27; from the national stone tablet on Pratas Island was printed on the five-dollar stamp, and the &#x27;Defend the South China Sea&#x27; inscription from the national stone tablet on Taiping Island was printed on the seventeen-dollar stamp. The background was the south China coastline, Taiwan and Hainan Island with the blue sky and sea. This was the first time that the ROC had issued stamps with the theme of the South China Sea.

In 1987 the military and civilian occupants built the &#x27;Pratas Fishermen&#x27;s Service Station&#x27;. The station was built in traditional Chinese courtyard house style, and provides convenient services for fishermen and boats in the South China Sea, insuring the fishermen&#x27;s safety and upholding ROC sovereignty. The services provided include lodging, medical rescue, entertainment and supply. The station also provides lodging for the scientists who come to conduct research on the island.

In 2012 National Sun Yat-sen University&#x27;s Dongsha Atoll Research Station (DARS) was established for biology, biogeochemistry, and oceanography research.

===Energy===
Diesel-fueled generators are used to power the island. In March 2016, a solar energy system built by the Coast Guard Administration went into operation. The system covers an area of 310.6 m2 and produces 53,200 kWh of electricity each year.

==Transportation==
The Dongsha Island Airport features a runway located on the north end of Pratas Island with a small airport terminal at the eastern end. The airport is used by the ROC military. A main shack and subordinate shack are located on the southeast end of the island. There are no refueling facilities.

Two piers on the southeast shore allow for small watercraft to land.

A circle with a radius of centered on Pratas Island, referred to as VHR7, is a prohibited area for aeronautical purposes. The &#x27;VH&#x27; in VHR7 denotes &#x27;Hong Kong&#x27; and the &#x27;R&#x27; denotes a &#x27;Restricted Area&#x27;. Pratas Island and VHR7 are located within the Hong Kong Flight Information Region (FIR).

<doc id="410491" wikidata="Q1540463" url="?curid=410491" title="Government of Wales Act 1998">
<text>The Government of Wales Act 1998 (c. 38) () is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Passed in 1998, the act created the National Assembly for Wales, Auditor General for Wales and transferred devolved powers to the assembly. The act followed the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum.

==Act==
The Government for Wales Act 1998 brought about the then National Assembly for Wales as a corporate body.

Under the 1998 act, the Welsh Assembly received powers to legislate on powers previously held by the Secretary of State for Wales. Powers included agriculture, forestry, fisheries and food; ancient monuments and historic buildings; culture (including museums, galleries and libraries); economic development; education and training; the environment; health and health services; highways; housing; industry; local government; social services; sport and recreation; tourism; town and country planning; transport; water and flood defence; the Welsh language.

The Act also established the Auditor General for Wales and the Welsh Administration Ombudsman and also gave the National Assembly for Wales the ability to reorganise some Welsh public bodies.

== Bill provisions ==
On 26 November 1997, the Government of Wales Bill was first read in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. This followed the white paper policy objectives in further legal detail and added the &quot;First Secretary&quot; role to lead the executive committee of a &quot;National Assembly&quot; (rather than &quot;Assembly for Wales&quot;). The Assembly would be an independent &quot;corporate body&quot; able to make secondary legislation in devolved areas whereas primary legislation powers would stay at Westminster for all matters.The Welsh Assembly would be funded using a &quot;block grant&quot; similarly to the already existing Welsh Office using the Barnett formula.

Welsh Assembly elections would include one vote for a constituency Assembly Member (AM) and one regional vote of Wales&#x27; five electoral regions. There would be 40 constituency AM&#x27;s were elected &quot;first past the post&quot; and 20 &quot;list&quot; AMs were elected via the D&#x27;Hondt method.

Clause 34 of the Bill would allow the Assembly to consider “any matter affecting Wales” and a mechanism for potential further transfer of powers to allow the &quot;process&quot; of devolution to continue as suggested by Ron Davies.

The Bill became an Act on 31 July 1998 and, on 1 July 1999, the Welsh Office was replaced with the &quot;Wales Office&quot;.

<text>Tashi Namgyal (Sikkimese: ; Wylie: &quot;Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal&quot;) (26 October 1893 – 2 December 1963) was the ruling Chogyal (King) of Sikkim from 1914 to 1963. He was the son of Thutob Namgyal. He was the first independent king of Sikkim.

==Biography==
Namgyal was the 11th ruler of the Namgyal dynasty of Sikkim, succeeding his half brother Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal, who had ruled from February to December 1914 - when he died, suddenly, under mysterious circumstances. Born in Tibet and crowned by the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, he was a strong advocate for closer links with India.

He was educated in St. Paul&#x27;s School, Darjeeling. He was married in October 1918 to Kunzang Dechen, and they had 3 sons and 3 daughters. The eldest son died in a plane crash during World War Two. On his death he was succeeded as Chogyal by his second son Palden Thondup Namgyal.

During his reign, he was known for land reform and free elections. He also favoured closer links between Sikkim, India and Tibet. Many people attribute his death to Indian agents.

About a decade after his death, his son Palden Thondup Namgyal, the incumbent hereditary Chogyal, was formally deposed. Prime Minister Lendup Dorji appealed to India to change the status of Sikkim from protectorate to statehood. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim was officially made the 22nd state of India.

<text>A manhole cover is a removable plate forming the lid over the opening of a manhole, an opening large enough for a person to pass through that is used as an access point for an underground vault or pipe. It is designed to prevent anyone or anything from falling in, and to keep out unauthorized persons and material.
Manhole covers date back at least to the era of ancient Rome, which had sewer grates made from stone.

==Description==
Manhole covers are often made out of cast iron, concrete or a combination of the two. This makes them inexpensive, strong, and heavy, usually weighing more than . The weight helps to keep them in place when traffic passes over them, and makes it difficult for unauthorized people without suitable tools to remove them.

Manhole covers may also be made from glass-reinforced plastic or other composite material (especially in Europe, or where cover theft is of concern). Because of law restricting acceptable manual handling weights, Europe has seen a move towards lighter weight composite manhole cover materials, which also have the benefits of greater slip resistance and electrical insulating properties.

A manhole cover sits on a metal base, with a smaller inset rim which fits the cover. The base and cover are sometimes called &quot;castings&quot;, because they are usually made by a casting process, typically sand-casting techniques.


The covers usually feature &quot;pick holes&quot;, into which a hook handle tool is inserted to lift them. Pick holes can be concealed for a more watertight lid, or can allow light to shine through. A manhole pick or hook is typically used to lift them, though other tools can be used as well, including electromagnets.

Although the covers are too large to be easily collectible, their ubiquity and the many patterns and descriptions printed on them has led some people to collect pictures of covers from around the world. According to Remo Camerota, the author of a book on the subject titled &quot;Drainspotting&quot;, 95% of Japanese municipalities have their own cover design, often with colorful inlaid paint.

Despite their weight and cumbersome nature, manhole covers are sometimes stolen, usually for resale as scrap, particularly when metal prices rise.

Manhole covers may be marked to indicate what sort of services exist under them and what group maintains those services, such as the local water system, telecommunications firm, subway or train services, or natural gas firm.

The name &quot;manhole&quot; is sometimes changed to make it gender neutral. The city of Berkeley, California, for example, changed the official term to &quot;maintenance hole&quot; in 2019.

==Shape==
===Circular===

The question of why manhole covers are typically round (in some countries) was made famous by Microsoft when they began asking it as a job-interview question. Originally meant as a psychological assessment of how one approaches a question with more than one correct answer, the problem has produced a number of alternative explanations, from the tautological (&quot;Manhole covers are round because manholes are round&quot;) to the philosophical.

Reasons for the shape might include:
* A round manhole cover cannot fall through its circular opening, whereas a square manhole cover might fall in if it were inserted diagonally in the hole. The existence of a &quot;lip&quot; holding up the lid means that the underlying hole is smaller than the cover, so that other shapes might suffice. (A Reuleaux triangle or other curve of constant width would also serve this purpose, but round covers are much easier to manufacture.)
* Round tubes are the strongest and most material-efficient shape against the compression of the earth around them.
* A round manhole cover of a given diameter has a smaller surface area than a square cover of the same width, thus less material is needed to cast the manhole cover, meaning lower cost. 
* The bearing surfaces of manhole frames and covers are machined to assure flatness and prevent them from becoming dislodged by traffic. Round castings are much easier to machine using a lathe.
* Circular covers do not need to be rotated to align with the manhole.
* A round manhole cover can be more easily moved by being rolled.
* A round manhole cover can be easily locked in place with a quarter turn (as is done in countries like France), which makes them hard to open without a special tool. Lockable covers do not have to be made as heavy to resist being dislodged.
* A round flat metal casting will typically warp in its center (concave or convex) leaving the rim flat and evenly supported, whereas a casting with multiple sides will typically warp at its corners which allows the grate to rock as traffic crosses it.

===Other===
Other manhole shapes can be found, usually squares or rectangles. For example, in the United Kingdom nearly all manhole covers are square or rectangular and very occasionally triangular, but almost never circular. Nashua, New Hampshire, is unusual for having triangular manhole covers that point in the direction of the underlying flow. In 2011, the city began gradually phasing out the triangles, which were made by a local foundry, because they were not large enough to meet modern safety standards and a manufacturer for larger triangles could not be found. Some manhole covers in Hamilton, Bermuda, are triangular, and hinged. Some triangular water-main covers also exist in San Francisco.

A robotics research paper in 2011 suggested that robots could examine the shapes of specific manhole covers and use them to calculate their geographic position, as a double-check on GPS data.

==Security and safety==

In urban areas, stray voltage issues have become a significant concern for utilities. On January 16, 2004, Jodie S. Lane was electrocuted after stepping on a metal manhole cover, while walking her dog in New York City. As result of this and other incidents, increased attention has been focused on these hazards, including technical conferences on stray voltage detection and prevention.
Insulation failures can be caused by road salt, age, rats biting the wires, or vibrations from traffic.

Electrical arcing can ignite insulation, leaking natural gas, methane from decaying organic matter, fumes from smouldering insulation, or even gasoline poured down the toilet. This can cause a fire, power outages, and in some cases, an explosion. In the United States, they are most common in New York City, with 3,369 &quot;manhole events&quot;, including 32 explosions recorded in 2014. They were most common in summer due to increased electricity use. Chicago reported fewer than 10 events with no explosions, despite also using road salt in the winter.

The Boston area experienced 62 &quot;events&quot; in 2021 (down from 212 in 2018). As of 2022, local utility company Eversource is replacing 38,000 maintenance hole covers, starting in high-traffic areas, with a safer design. A rail allows the cover to lift up to and let gases escape, but prevents it from flying into the air and damaging buildings or cars or injuring pedestrians. In some places where road salt is not a concern, the covers have vents to let gases escape. To prevent and mitigate safety problems, the company is also installing monitoring equipment to detect dangerous gases and fires, and increasing inspection frequency.

Because of their aerodynamic design, some modern racing cars create enough vacuum to lift a manhole cover off its recess. During races on city streets, manhole covers must therefore be welded or locked down to prevent injury. In 1990, during the Group C World Sportscar Championship race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve (located in a public park in Montreal, Quebec), a Brun Motorsport Porsche 962 struck a manhole cover that was lifted by the ground effect of the car he was following, a Courage C24 Porsche. This caused the trailing Porsche to catch fire, and safety issues ended the race shortly afterwards.

== Theft ==

The theft of manhole covers often increases when scrap metal prices are high.

Manhole cover theft can be a serious problem in China, where missing manhole covers caused at least eight deaths in 2004. According to China&#x27;s Xinhua News Agency, about &quot;240,000 manhole and street-drain covers were stolen in Beijing in 2004.&quot;

In &quot;China Shakes the World&quot;, James Kynge describes the phenomenon:... in the several weeks beginning in mid-February 2004, when, slowly at first but with mounting velocity, manhole covers started to disappear from roads and pavements around the world. As Chinese demand drove up the price of scrap metal to record levels, thieves almost everywhere had the same idea. As darkness fell, they levered up the iron covers and sold them to local merchants, who cut them up and loaded them onto ships to China. The first displacements were felt in Taiwan, the island country just off China&#x27;s southeast coast. The next were in other neighbors such as Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan ... Wherever the sun set, pilferers worked to satisfy China&#x27;s hunger. More than 150 covers disappeared during one month in Chicago. Scotland&#x27;s &quot;great drain robbery&quot; saw more than a hundred vanish in a few days. From Montreal to Gloucester to Kuala Lumpur, unsuspecting pedestrians stumbled into holes.In Newham, East London, nearly 200 grates and covers were stolen in 2004. A manhole cover designed by artist Antony Gormley was stolen in 2013, ten years after its installation.

In the city of Kolkata, India, more than 10,000 manhole covers were taken in two months in 2004. These were replaced with concrete covers, but these were also stolen, this time for the rebar inside them.

In March and April 2012, Ajax, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, had dozens of manhole covers stolen.

In December 2021, Chatham County, Georgia, reported 30 manhole covers stolen in a single day.

==1957 Operation Plumbbob nuclear test==
A manhole cover was accidentally launched from its shaft during an underground nuclear test in 1957. During the Operation Plumbbob nuclear tests, a steel plate cap was blasted off the test shaft at an unknown speed and appeared as a blur on a single frame of film of the test. It was never recovered, but it likely burned up in the atmosphere due to friction. If by some stroke of luck the manhole cover had made it into orbit, it would have been the first man-made object to do so, as it pre-dated the launch of Sputnik 1 by 38 days. A calculation before the event gave a predicted speed of six times Earth escape velocity. After the event, Dr. Robert R. Brownlee described the best estimate of the cover&#x27;s speed from the photographic evidence as &quot;going like a bat out of hell!&quot;

== Loading classification ==
The European norm EN 124 of 1994 applies to manhole and storm drain tops with a clear opening up to 1 m for areas subjected to pedestrian or vehicular traffic (covers with a clear opening over 1 m are specified in the British Standard BS9124 for example). EN 124 specifies several weight classes depending on the application and is also being used in some countries outside the European Union. The lightest class A15 (cast iron) manhole cover can withstand a maximum weight of 1.5 tonnes. It would typically be restricted to light duty applications in pedestrian areas, gardens, patios, driveways and similar. By contrast, the heaviest class F900 manhole cover can withstand a maximum weight of 90 tons, making it suitable for docks, airports, and other extreme heavy-duty applications.

EN 124 does not apply for gratings of prefabricated drainage channels (according to EN 1433) or floor and roof gullies in buildings (specified in EN 1253-1).

The Fabricated Access Covers Trade Association (FACTA) provides its own specification which came into effect in 2013. It has a similar scope as the EN 124, focuses on wheel loadings and is based on the European standards for structural steelwork.
The FACTA specification applies to solid top covers, recessed covers designed for structural or non-structural infill and surface drainage products.

== As art ==
In Japan, a number of manhole covers have been featuring artistic designs since the 1980s. There is enough interest in them to allow merchandise and conventions, with an estimated 12,000 designs spread across Japan by 2019. These could be found in nearly all cities and towns in the country. Popular media franchises, such as Gundam and Pokémon, have also been featured in the covers with hundreds of Pokémon-themed manhole covers across Japan.

The utilization of manhole covers as street art has also been done in Taiwan and Vietnam.

<text>Mark Durkan (born 26 June 1960) is a retired Irish nationalist politician from Northern Ireland. Durkan was the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland from November 2001 to October 2002, and the Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) from 2001 to 2010. He contested the Dublin constituency for Fine Gael at the 2019 European Parliament election.

==Early life==
John Mark Durkan was born in Derry, County Londonderry; his father, Brendan, was a Royal Ulster Constabulary District Inspector in Armagh. He was raised by his mother, Isobel, after his father was killed in a road accident in 1961. He was educated at St. Patrick&#x27;s Primary School and at St. Columb&#x27;s College, where he was Head Boy.

He studied politics at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (QUB), and later did a part-time postgraduate course in Public Policy Management with the University of Ulster at Magee. While at QUB Durkan served as Deputy President of Queen&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union from 1982 to 1983. He was also elected Deputy President of the Union of Students in Ireland from 1982 to 1984.

==Political career==

He became involved in politics in 1981 when he became a member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. In 1984 he went to work for John Hume as his Westminster Assistant. He became a key figure in organising by-election campaigns for Seamus Mallon and Eddie McGrady in the 1980s.

In 1990 Durkan became chairperson of the SDLP, a position he served in until 1995. He was a key member of the party&#x27;s negotiating team in the run up to the Good Friday Agreement. Following the Agreement he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998, and became a member of the Northern Ireland Executive as Minister for Finance and Personnel. He served in that position until 2001 when he replaced Seamus Mallon as deputy First Minister. He was also elected Leader of the SDLP the same year.

Durkan was re-elected to the Assembly in the election of November 2003. However, the Assembly and the Executive remained suspended. In the 2005 general election he retained the Foyle seat at Westminster for the SDLP, succeeding John Hume. While down on Hume&#x27;s vote, Durkan won with a comfortable majority, despite a strong effort by Sinn Féin to take the seat. He garnered 21,119 votes, 46.3% of the total.

Durkan announced his intention to stand down as leader of the SDLP in September 2009 so he could concentrate on his parliamentary career. He was replaced as leader by Margaret Ritchie in February 2010. He is a Fellow of the British-American Project. 

Durkan has publicly supported gay rights by supporting the Foyle Pride Festival in Derry, in solidarity with those who suffer homophobic prejudice and in some cases violent hate attacks.

In 2011, he voted against the military intervention in Libya.

He joined Fine Gael in March 2019 to contest the 2019 European Parliament election for the Dublin constituency but failed to gain a seat. He is now retired from frontline politics, but remains an active member and supporter of the SDLP.

==Family==
He and his wife Jackie have one child, Dearbháil. His nephew Mark H. Durkan is an SDLP MLA for Foyle.

<doc id="410507" wikidata="Q4883179" url="?curid=410507" title="Bell High School (Ottawa)">
<text>Bell High School is a high school located in the Bells Corners neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The school was established by the Carleton Board of Education in 1962 as a public high school for grades 9-13. In 2018, Bell High School became a 7-12 school after the nearby D. Aubrey Moodie Intermediate School closed down.

==Facilities and infrastructure==
Bell High School is located on a 10 hectare (25 acre) campus. The school building itself is in the shape of the letter &quot;E&quot; and divided into several wings. Each wing contains a different educational discipline, one each for science, mathematics, English, Geography, and social studies. The school also has a cafeteria, a library, two music rooms, an art studio, a drama studio, a dance studio, a drafting studio, two full-sized gyms, a greenhouse, an automotive garage, two construction workshops, a soccer/football field with a 400-meter gravel track, and indoor weight training and exercise facilities. In 2021, the building was expanded to accommodate the newly-integrated intermediate students from the former D. A. Moodie Intermediate School. The school is adjacent to two baseball diamonds, a soccer/football field, an indoor ice rink (Bell Centennial Arena), and a forested section of the Greenbelt.

OC Transpo routes buses serving Bayshore, Crystal Beach, Kanata, and Barrhaven to the school.

==Student activities==
Bell High School offers programs in gifted education, advanced placement, enrichment studies, student exchange, French immersion, and an ESL in addition to the normal academic program. Approximately 50% of the school&#x27;s student population are transfers from other districts who attend Bell High School for these specialized programs.

Bell High School engages extensively in fundraising efforts. Through these efforts, Bell has contributed significantly to the local community and even managed to construct a sister school in Kenya which it maintains as an ongoing humanitarian project. Other than its fundraisers and humanitarian projects, Bell High School also hosts a plethora of events to actively promote arts and culture, though performances, banquets, and shows.

The school also has a large roster of sports teams which in many sports under the Bell Bruins name. The teams offered by Bell High School include: tennis, soccer, football, basketball, volleyball, badminton, field hockey, rugby, cross country running, Nordic skiing, Alpine skiing, hockey, track and field, curling, baseball, wrestling, and swimming.

== Incidents ==
In spring 2016, two former Bell students separately filed complaints with the Ottawa Police Service that Tim Stanutz, their former music teacher had groomed and then sexual assaulted them. In May 2017, Stanutz died before trial. The two complainants filed civil lawsuits against the deceased&#x27;s estate and the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB), each seeking $1.95 million in damages. 

By 2018, the OCDSB was sued by victims and alleged victims of sexual abuse by three former teachers at the school, with the total amount of damages sought between all lawsuits being over $25 million. The lawsuits claimed that the OCDSB was negligent over the periods of historical abuse from the 1970s to the 2000s.

The OCDSB&#x27;s defense in the Stanutz case denied that any students were groomed or abused, but that if they did occur, such activity was not authorized by the board.

In 2022, a disciplinary panel with the Ontario College of Teachers found a former Bell High School teacher, Peter Des Brisay, guilty of professional misconduct after sexually abusing a student in the late 1990s.

<doc id="410512" wikidata="Q1644792" url="?curid=410512" title="Battle of Lake Regillus">
<text>The Battle of Lake Regillus was a legendary Roman victory over the Latin League shortly after the establishment of the Roman Republic and as part of a wider Latin War. The Latins were led by an elderly Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, who had been expelled in 509 BC, and his son-in-law, Octavius Mamilius, the dictator of Tusculum. The battle marked the final attempt of the Tarquins to reclaim their throne. According to legend, Castor and Pollux fought on the side of the Romans.

==Background==
The threat of invasion by Rome&#x27;s former allies in Latium led to the appointment of Aulus Postumius Albus as dictator.

The year in which the battle occurred is unclear, and has been unclear since ancient times. Livy places the battle in 499 BC, but says some of his sources also suggest the battle occurred during Postumius&#x27; consulship in 496 BC. The other major source for this historical period, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, also places the battle in 496 BC. Some modern authors have suggested 493 BC. or 489 BC.

Lake Regillus was located in the remains of a volcanic crater between Rome and Tusculum. The lake was drained in the fourth century BC.

According to Livy, the Volsci (a neighbouring tribe to the south of Latium) had raised troops to send to the aid of the Latins against Rome; however, the haste of the Roman dictator in joining battle meant that the Volscian forces did not arrive in time.

==Battle==
The dictator Postumius led the Roman infantry, while Titus Aebutius Elva was &quot;Magister Equitum&quot; (Master of the Horse). Tarquin was accompanied by his eldest and last remaining son, Titus. It was said that the presence of the Tarquins caused the Romans to fight more passionately than in any previous battle.

Early in the battle, the king was injured attacking Postumius. The &quot;magister equitum&quot; charged at Mamilius, and both were wounded: Aebutius in the arm, and the Latin dictator in the chest. The &quot;magister equitum&quot; had to withdraw from the field and direct his troops from a distance. The king&#x27;s soldiers, including many exiled Romans, began to overpower the republican forces, and the Romans suffered a setback when Marcus Valerius Volusus was killed by a spear while attacking Titus Tarquinius. However, Postumius brought in fresh troops from his own bodyguard and halted the exiles&#x27; progress.

Meanwhile, Titus Herminius Aquilinus, who had won fame fighting alongside Horatius at the Sublician bridge, and served as consul in 506 BC, engaged Mamilius and slew him; but while attempting to strip his fallen enemy and claim the spoils, Herminius was killed by a javelin. As the outcome of the battle seemed in doubt, Postumius ordered the cavalry to dismount and attack on foot, forcing the Latins to retreat and capturing the Latin camp. Tarquin and the Latin army abandoned the field, resulting in a decisive Roman victory. Postumius returned to Rome with his army, and celebrated a triumph.

A popular legend reported that the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, fought alongside the Romans, transfigured as two young horsemen. Postumius ordered a temple built in their honour in the Roman Forum, in the place where they had watered their horses. According to Plutarch, the battle was the young Coriolanus’ first military engagement, for which received an oak garland.

In the 19th century, the battle was celebrated in Thomas Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot;.

<doc id="410517" wikidata="Q202357" url="?curid=410517" title="Târgu Jiu">
<text>Târgu Jiu (, is the capital of Gorj County in the Oltenia region of Romania. It is situated on the Southern Sub-Carpathians, on the banks of the river Jiu. Eight localities are administered by the city: Bârsești, Drăgoieni, Iezureni, Polata, Preajba Mare, Romanești, Slobozia, and Ursați.

The city is noted for the Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2024.

==History==
The city takes its name from the river Jiu, which runs through it. In antiquity, there was a Dacian village in around the location of today&#x27;s city surrounded by forests. After the Roman conquests of Oltenia (101-102), military units were stationed around the roads that connected different important routes at the time. During the digging of the Târgu Jiu - Rovinari railroad, mosaics, coins, ceramics and Roman bricks were found in the south-eastern part of the city. This and ancient testimonies support the idea that Târgu Jiu was a commercial town (a &quot;vicus&quot;) while under the Roman Empire&#x27;s rule. A very important route that connects the Danube to Transylvania runs through the city, so historians believe that part of the Roman army under Trajan&#x27;s leadership stayed and then passed in the actual location of the city.

After the 271 withdrawal of the Roman army, the city remained in the Latin influence zone, mainly because of Constantine The Great&#x27;s involvement in Oltenia which he sought to bring under imperial rule. The importance of keeping this zone under Rome&#x27;s control was underlined by Constantine&#x27;s decision to build a second bridge over the Danube between today&#x27;s Corabia (then Sucidava) and the Bulgarian city of Gigen. It was over 2400 meters long, one of the longest of all time.

This territory was under Litovoi&#x27;s rule, a Vlach (Romanian) &quot;voivode&quot; in the 13th century, whose territory comprised northern Oltenia. He is mentioned for the first time in a diploma issued by king Béla IV of Hungary (1235–1270) on 2 July 1247. In 1277 (or between 1277 and 1280), Litovoi was at war with the Hungarians over lands King Ladislaus IV of Hungary (1272–1290) claimed for the crown, but for which Litovoi refused to pay tribute. Litovoi was killed in battle.

The first written account of the city appears in a document dating from 23 November 1406 in an order signed by Mircea cel Batran. Since 1497, the city has been the seat of Gorj County.

Constantin Brâncuși, who had lived here as a boy, was commissioned to contribute to a memorial monument to the fighters of World War I, called Calea Eroilor, &quot;Heroes&#x27; Street&quot;, which was finished in 1938. His large sculptures are now the main tourist attractions in Târgu Jiu: The Table of Silence, Stool Alley, The Gate of the Kiss, and The Endless Column. The latter is shown in the middle section of the city&#x27;s coat of arms. In the 1950s the Communist mayor planned to demolish Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;bourgeois&quot; art. The plan was not carried out.

The Târgu Jiu internment camp was a detention facility in the northeastern part of the city. It was a regular prison from 1895 to 1939 and again after 1945, but is best known for its role as an internment camp for various categories of individuals during World War II. Internees in 1943–1944 included Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, Mișu Dulgheru, Nicolae Ceaușescu, and Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. 

Starting in the 1960s, coal surface mining contributed to a rapid population growth. Other local industries include wood, machine building, textiles, glassware and construction materials (cement, bricks, and tiles).

In 1992, a university was founded and named after Brâncuși.

==Brâncuși ensemble==
Mihai Radu, a Romanian architect based in New York, described Târgu Jiu&#x27;s downtown - rebuilt during the Communist era - as little more than &quot;a mix of poorly maintained paving, disheveled mass housing, jumbled signage and buildings of every size and description&quot;. The overall cityscape is &quot;mundane, but vibrant and no doubt livable&quot;, with &quot;often dissonant&quot; street pattern and urban fabric. Representing the interior space of Brâncuși&#x27;s ensemble, the &quot;Calea Eroilor&quot; - otherwise an unprepossessing, uninspiring and &quot;unacceptably vernacular&quot; street - defines through his sculptures the town&#x27;s civic areas in the same manner as the Great Axis of Paris.

Brâncuși&#x27;s work in Târgu Jiu is “absolutely revolutionary”: the sculptures exist at the same time as conventional public art with multiple meanings and as functional structures (seats, gateway, monumental marker). Most importantly for Târgu Jiu&#x27;s urban design, they shape a larger urban structure, being spatially integrated with the town&#x27;s urbanism in a dramatic and fundamental way. One&#x27;s progression through the entire ensemble is a spatial experience rare in any modern day city. The sculptures peacefully coexist with and transcend their mundane context. Through Brâncuși&#x27;s work, East and West come together in Târgu Jiu in a “completely unique” way. The town&#x27;s imperfections reinforce his ensemble&#x27;s place in the &quot;messy&quot; cityscape and its history. Juxtaposed against the city&#x27;s messy urbanism, Brâncuși&#x27;s ensemble is pluralist urbanism in its finest form. Civic in every way, his ensemble is closely integrated with Târgu Jiu&#x27;s everyday life. A small-town Romanian fabric merged with a sculptural ensemble of world significance makes Târgu Jiu&#x27;s plural urbanism astonishing. 

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Târgu Jiu consists of a shield with seven towers. In the centre of the shield lies the representation of Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;Endless Column&quot;, a symbol of Romanian art and culture. In the right and left sides of the shield lies a golden lion holding a black sword, &quot;guarding&quot; the column. The lion is the ancient symbol of Oltenia, thought to originate in the logo of one of Rome&#x27;s legion stations in this area, the 13th Legion &quot;Gemina (Legio XIII Gemina)&quot;. It represents the bravery and combative spirit of the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 73,545. At the 2011 census, 78,553 inhabitants lived within the city limits; of those, 75,640 (96,29%) were Romanians, 2,683 (3,41%) were Romani people, and 0,20% others.

<text>A manhole (utility hole, maintenance hole, or sewer hole) is an opening to a confined space such as a shaft, utility vault, or large vessel. Manholes, typically protected by a manhole cover, are often used as an access point for an underground public utility, allowing inspection, maintenance, and system upgrades. The majority of underground services have manholes, including water, sewers, telephone, electricity, storm drains, district heating, and gas.

Manholes are generally found in urban areas, in streets and occasionally under sidewalks. In rural and undeveloped areas, services such as telephone and electricity are usually carried on utility poles or even pylons rather than underground.

In Australia, &quot;manhole&quot; also commonly refers to an access hatch used to get access from a room or hallway into the ceiling cavity of a building. These manholes are typically around square.

== Construction ==

Manhole closings are protected by a grating or manhole cover, a flat plug designed to prevent accidental or unauthorized access to the manhole. These covers are traditionally made of metal, but may be constructed from precast concrete, glass reinforced plastic or other composite materials (especially where cover theft is of concern). Because of legislation restricting acceptable manual handling weights, Europe has seen a move toward lighter-weight composite manhole cover materials, which also have the benefits of greater slip resistance and electrical insulating properties.

Manholes are usually outfitted with metal, polypropylene, or fiberglass steps installed in the inner side of the wall to allow easy descent into the utility space.

Manholes are usually round, primarily because roundness is the best shape to resist the compression of the earth; covers are round because they are easier to manufacture than square or rectangular shapes, they are easier to move by rolling, and they can&#x27;t fall into the opening. But in the United Kingdom they are nearly always square, or rectangular, in shape, at least at street level. Manholes can also be found in a triangular shape (e.g. in Cambridge, and surrounding villages).

== Composite manholes ==
Composite (fiberglass) manholes are commonly used in applications where infiltration, exfiltration, or corrosion by hydrogen sulfide (from sewer gas) are a concern, or where structures need to be factory integrated into a manhole before placement. In these manholes, the entire underground enclosure is constructed of some composite material, in addition to the cover.

Structures that can be integrated into composite manholes include:
* Flow inverts
* Flumes
* Drop structures from higher elevation flows to lower elevation discharge pipes
* Weirs
* Storm water screening structures
* Sewage grinders
* Energy absorbing structures to dissipate undesirable flow stream turbulence or velocity

== Hazards caused by stray voltage in manholes ==
In urban areas, stray voltage issues have become a significant concern for utilities. On January 16, 2004, Jodie S. Lane was electrocuted after stepping on a metal manhole cover, while walking her two dogs in New York City.

== Sewer manhole location ==
The location of a sewer manhole must be carefully considered to ensure that the drainage system is effective and easy to maintain. According to design standards, the distance between two manholes is typically between 7 and 20 meters, depending on the specific characteristics of the project. In cities, the distance is 20 meters per manhole, while in industrial or commercial settings it is 10-15 meters per manhole. The distance between manholes in homes or restaurants is typically 7-10 meters.

<text>A sanitary sewer is an underground pipe or tunnel system for transporting sewage from houses and commercial buildings (but not stormwater) to a sewage treatment plant or disposal.

Sanitary sewers are a type of gravity sewer and are part of an overall system called a &quot;sewage system&quot; or sewerage. Sanitary sewers serving industrial areas may also carry industrial wastewater. In municipalities served by sanitary sewers, separate storm drains may convey surface runoff directly to surface waters. An advantage of sanitary sewer systems is that they avoid combined sewer overflows. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller in diameter than combined sewers which also transport urban runoff. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive stormwater inflow or groundwater infiltration occurs due to leaking joints, defective pipes etc. in aging infrastructure.

== Purpose ==
Sewage treatment is less effective when sanitary waste is diluted with stormwater, and combined sewer overflows occur when runoff from heavy rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the hydraulic capacity of sewage treatment plants. To overcome these disadvantages, some cities built separate sanitary sewers to collect only municipal wastewater and exclude stormwater runoff, which is collected in separate storm drains. The decision to build a combined sewer system or two separate systems is mainly based on the need for sewage treatment and the cost of providing treatment during heavy rain events. Many cities with combined sewer systems built their systems prior to installing sewage treatment plants, and have not subsequently replaced those sewer systems.

== Types ==
=== Conventional gravity sewers ===



In the developed world, sewers are pipes from buildings to one or more levels of larger underground trunk mains, which transport the sewage to sewage treatment facilities. Vertical pipes, usually made of precast concrete, called manholes, connect the mains to the surface. Depending upon site application and use, these vertical pipes can be cylindrical, eccentric, or concentric. The manholes are used for access to the sewer pipes for inspection and maintenance, and as a means to vent sewer gases. They also facilitate vertical and horizontal angles in otherwise straight pipelines.

Pipes conveying sewage from an individual building to a common gravity sewer line are called laterals. Branch sewers typically run under streets receiving laterals from buildings along that street and discharge by gravity into trunk sewers at manholes. Larger cities may have sewers called interceptors, receiving flow from multiple trunk sewers.

Design and sizing of sanitary sewers considers the population to be served over the anticipated life of the sewer, per capita wastewater production, and flow peaking from timing of daily routines. Minimum sewer diameters are often specified to prevent blockage by solid materials flushed down toilets; gradients may be selected to maintain flow velocities generating sufficient turbulence to minimize solids deposition within the sewer. Commercial and industrial wastewater flows are also considered, but diversion of surface runoff to storm drains eliminates wet weather flow peaks of inefficient combined sewers.

=== Force mains === 
A force main or rising main is a pumped sewer that may be necessary where gravity sewers serve areas at lower elevations than the sewage treatment plant, or distant areas at similar elevations. A lift station is a sewer sump that lifts accumulated sewage to a higher elevation. They may also be used to prime an inverted siphon used to cross underneath rivers or other obstructions. The pump may discharge to another gravity sewer or directly to a treatment plant. Force mains are typically constructed of welded steel or HDPE jointed to resist pressures within the pipe. Force mains are substantially different from pressure sewers which serve individual properties or groups of properties and provide a means of injecting sewage into a local gravity main.

=== Effluent sewer ===

Effluent sewer systems, also called septic tank effluent drainage (STED) or solids-free sewer (SFS) systems, have septic tanks that collect sewage from residences and businesses, and the effluent that comes out of the tank is sent to either a centralized sewage treatment plant or a distributed treatment system for further treatment. Most of the solids are removed by the septic tanks, so the treatment plant can be much smaller than a typical plant. In addition, because of the vast reduction in solid waste, a pumping system, rather than a gravity system, can be used to move the wastewater. The pipes have small diameters, typically . Because the waste stream is pressurized, they can be laid just below the ground surface along the land&#x27;s contour.

===Pressure sewer===

Where it is impossible or impractical to discharge sewage from a property into a gravity sanitary sewer, a pressure sewer may provide an alternative means of connection. A macerator pump in a pumping well close to the property ejects sewage through a small-diameter high-pressure pipe into the nearest gravity sewer.

=== Simplified sewer ===

Simplified sanitary sewers consist of small-diameter pipes, typically around , often laid at fairly flat gradients (1 in 200). Although the investment cost for simplified sanitary sewers can be about half the cost of conventional sewers, the requirements for operation and maintenance are usually higher. Simplified sewers are most common in Brazil and other developing countries.

=== Vacuum sewer ===

In low-lying communities, wastewater is often conveyed by vacuum sewer. Pipelines range in size from pipes of in diameter up to in diameter. Vacuum sewer systems use differential atmospheric pressure to move the liquid to a central vacuum station.

==Maintenance==

Sanitary sewer overflow can occur due to blocked or broken sewer lines, infiltration of excessive stormwater or malfunction of pumps. In these cases untreated sewage is discharged from a sanitary sewer into the environment prior to reaching sewage treatment facilities. To avoid such overflows, maintenance is required. Blockage prevention campaigns or regulations (e.g. requiring the use of grease interceptors by some customers) may also be necessary.

The maintenance requirements vary with the type of sanitary sewer. In general, all sewers deteriorate with age, but infiltration and inflow are problems unique to sanitary sewers, since both combined sewers and storm drains are sized to carry these contributions. Holding infiltration to acceptable levels requires a higher standard of maintenance than necessary for structural integrity considerations of combined sewers. A comprehensive construction inspection program is required to prevent inappropriate connection of cellar, yard, and roof drains to sanitary sewers. The probability of inappropriate connections is higher where combined sewers and sanitary sewers are found in close proximity, because construction personnel may not recognize the difference. Many older cities still use combined sewers while adjacent suburbs were built with separate sanitary sewers.

For decades, when sanitary sewer pipes cracked or experienced other damage, the only option was an expensive excavation, removal and replacement of the damaged pipe, typically requiring street repavement afterwards. In the mid-1950s a unit was invented where two units at each end with a special cement mixture in between was pulled from one manhole cover to the next, coating the pipe with the cement under high pressure, which then cured rapidly, sealing all cracks and breaks in the pipe. Today, a similar method using epoxy resin is used by some municipalities to re-line aging or damaged pipes, effectively creating a &quot;pipe in a pipe&quot;. These methods may be unsuitable for locations where the full diameter of the original pipe is required to carry expected flows, and may be an unwise investment if greater wastewater flows may be anticipated from population growth, increased water use, or new service connections within the expected service life of the repair.

Another popular method for replacing aged or damaged lines is called pipe bursting, where a new pipe, typically PVC or ABS plastic, is drawn through the old pipe behind an &quot;expander head&quot; that breaks apart the old pipe as the new one is drawn through behind it.

These methods are most suitable for trunk sewers, since repair of lines with lateral connections is complicated by making provisions to receive lateral flows without accepting undesirable infiltration from inadequately sealed junctions.

==Ventilation==
Some sewers have tall vent pipes to release foul gases well up away from people. Common names for these pipes are stink pipe, stink pole, stench pipe and sewer ventilation pipe.

==History==
Sanitary sewers evolved from combined sewers built where water was plentiful. Animal feces accumulated on city streets while animal-powered transport moved people and goods. Accumulations of animal feces encouraged dumping chamber pots into streets where night soil collection was impractical. Combined sewers were built to use surface runoff to flush waste off streets and move it underground to places distant from populated areas. Sewage treatment became necessary as population expanded, but increased volumes and pumping capacity required for treatment of diluted waste from combined sewers is more expensive than treating undiluted sewage.

Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.

In the UK, the term &quot;foul sewer&quot; was also in use for a sanitary sewer.

<doc id="410535" wikidata="Q2411940" url="?curid=410535" title="Marquess of Winchester">
<text>Marquess of Winchester is a title in the Peerage of England that was created in 1551 for the prominent statesman William Paulet, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. It is the oldest of six surviving English marquessates; therefore its holder is considered the premier marquess of England. It is also now the only marquessate in the Peerage of England not being subsidiary to a higher title (although it was formerly subsidiary to the extinct Dukedom of Bolton; the other five are all still held by dukes). The current holder is Christopher Paulet, 19th Marquess of Winchester (born 1969), whose son uses the courtesy title Earl of Wiltshire.

==History==
The peerage was created in 1551 for the prominent statesman William Paulet, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. The king at the time was Edward VI, who was not of age, and the decision was that of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, who in the same year promoted himself to a dukedom. Paulet had already been created Baron St John in 1539 and Earl of Wiltshire in 1550, also in the Peerage of England. The first marquess was one of the most noted statesmen of his time, serving in high positions under King Henry VIII and his children, and served as Lord High Treasurer of England from 1550 to 1572. He was succeeded by his son, the second marquess, who had been summoned to the House of Lords in his father&#x27;s lifetime through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron St John. His son, the third marquess, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord St John in 1572. His grandson, the fifth marquess, represented St Ives in the House of Commons. During the Civil War he was a strong supporter of King Charles I and became known as &quot;the loyal Marquess&quot;. The family seat of Basing House was burnt to the ground by the Parliamentarians during the conflict. During this period, the courtesy title for the heirs apparent of the marquesses was Baron St John; that of Earl of Wiltshire does not seem to have been used, perhaps because of an unsubstantiated tradition that that title was surrendered upon the creation of the marquessate. Another explanation could be possible embarrassment arising from the fact that his son Charles married Mary Scrope, whose father the 11th Lord Scrope of Bolton and 1st Earl of Sunderland, was the direct heir of the original Earl of Wiltshire, beheaded by Henry IV in 1399. The original &quot;Earl of Wiltshire&quot; title had been in abeyance since then.

He was succeeded by his son, the sixth marquess. The sixth marquess was a supporter of King William III and Queen Mary II and was rewarded for his support after the Glorious Revolution when he was created Duke of Bolton. He was succeeded by his son, the second duke, who, as heir apparent to the marquessate in 1675, was the first to adopt the courtesy title of Earl of Wiltshire. The second Duke was a politician and notably served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. On his death the titles passed to his son, the third duke, who was also a politician. He was a Whig Member of Parliament and served as lord lieutenant of several counties. In 1717 he was meant to be summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron St John (of Basing). However, he was mistakenly summoned as Lord Pawlett of Basing and this inadvertently created a new barony.

However, the barony of Pawlett of Basing became extinct as he had no legitimate offspring while he was succeeded in the other titles by his younger brother, the fourth duke. He notably served as a Lord of the Admiralty and as lord lieutenant of both Hampshire and Glamorganshire. His eldest son, the fifth duke, was a member of Parliament and Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth duke. He was an admiral of the White. The sixth duke had no sons and on his death in 1794 the dukedom became extinct. Most of the family estates passed to his niece Jean Mary Browne-Powlett, illegitimate daughter of the fifth duke. She was the wife of Thomas Orde, who assumed the additional surname of Powlett and was created Baron Bolton in 1797.

The sixth duke was succeeded in the Barony of St John, the Earldom of Wiltshire and the Marquessate of Winchester by his third cousin once removed George Paulet, who became the twelfth marquess. He was the great-grandson of Lord Henry Paulet, third son of the fourth marquess. He had earlier represented Winchester in Parliament. His son, the thirteenth marquess, was a member of Parliament for Truro and served as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. In 1839 Lord Winchester assumed the additional surname of Burroughs. He was succeeded by his son, the fourteenth marquess. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. His son, the fifteenth marquess, was a major in the Coldstream Guards and was killed in action at the Battle of Magersfontein in 1899 during the Second Boer War. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixteenth marquess. He was Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire and Chairman of the Hampshire County Council. On his death in 1962 at the age of 99 the line of the fourteenth marquess failed.

He was succeeded by his first cousin twice removed, the seventeenth marquess. He was the great-grandson of the Reverend Lord Charles Paulet, second son of the thirteenth marquess. On the seventeenth marquess&#x27;s death in 1968 this line of the family also failed and the title passed to the seventeenth marquess&#x27;s first cousin once removed, the eighteenth marquess, who died in 2016. Lord Winchester lived in South Africa.

The surname of the later dukes of Bolton is usually spelled &quot;Powlett&quot; rather than &quot;Paulet&quot;. This spelling continues to be used by the Orde-Powlett family.

The Marquessate of Winchester is the oldest English marquessate still in existence, and as a result the holder of the peerage is the premier marquess of England. The marquess of Winchester is also the only one in the peerage of England without a higher title; as all other marquesses in that peerage are also dukes.

Earl of Wiltshire is used as the courtesy title of Lord Winchester&#x27;s eldest son and heir, while Lord Wiltshire&#x27;s son and heir has the courtesy title Lord St John.

One of the main family seats was Basing House, near Old Basing, Hampshire.

<text>Canterbury High School is an Ottawa-Carleton District School Board high school in the Urbandale neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
It is an arts magnet school which draws in students from the Ottawa area to their specialized arts program.
==History==
The school opened in 1969 as a comprehensive high school. It was the last in a series of ten high schools built by the Collegiate Board to deal with a growing population of teenagers. At the time of its opening, it was considered an extremely modern school, employing all the latest ideas in education. Most notably, many of its walls were movable (no longer a feature), allowing for an easy reorganization of space. It also had one of the largest libraries and auditoriums of any Ottawa area school. From 1969 to 1976, Canterbury offered a technical program based in aerospace engineering. The school operated a 1969 Cessna 190J (CF-CHS) and a Schweitzer 2-33 glider (CF-ABE), providing unique research opportunities to students. However, the Ottawa Board of Education eventually withdrew support due to liability issues.

The school&#x27;s arts program began in 1983, making Canterbury High School an arts magnet school for the Ottawa-Gatineau region. There are five different arts programs that students must audition and interview for to be accepted into: dance, dramatic arts, literary arts, music (winds and percussion, strings, or voice), and visual arts.

The school maintains an athletics program which includes wrestling, rowing, swimming, volleyball, baseball, basketball, soccer, football, water polo, curling, ultimate frisbee, ice hockey, rugby and track and field.

<text>The Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) is an American utility company that supplies electric power to the city of Washington, D.C., and to surrounding communities in Maryland. It is owned by Exelon.

The company&#x27;s current trademarked slogan is &quot;Your life. Plugged in.&quot; Its former slogan was &quot;We&#x27;re connected to you by more than power lines.&quot;

Pepco&#x27;s bulk transmission system consists of transmission lines operating at 115 kV, 138kV, 230 kV and 500 kV. Pepco has interconnections with Potomac Edison (230kV, 500kV), Baltimore Gas and Electric (500kV, 230kV, 115kV), and Dominion Virginia Power (500kV, 230kV).

==History==

The company&#x27;s predecessor, Potomac Electric Co., was organized in 1891 to provide street lighting and streetcar power in Georgetown and Northwest D.C. After suffering during the Panic of 1893, the company filed bankruptcy and, on November 6, 1895, was acquired by Oscar T. Crosby and Charles A. Lieb for $5,500.

The company was incorporated as Potomac Electric Power Company on April 28, 1896 in Virginia. It became a subsidiary of the North American Company, which owned the Washington Traction and Electric Company, one of the private streetcar companies in Washington.

On December 17, 1896, after a court battle, the company received a contract to light the city of Washington, D.C.

In January 1889, the company merged with its rival, United States Electric Lighting Company.

In 1899, the company merged with Washington Traction and Electric Company.

In June 1901, the company filed for bankruptcy and was acquired by the Washington Railway and Electric Company.

In 1905, revenues exceeded $1 million for the first time.

In 1906, the company began construction of the first unit of the Benning Road Power Plant, along the Anacostia River. When its last unit was completed in 1931, the power plant had a 185,000-kilowatt capacity.

In 1928, the North American Company, a holding company that owned many public utilities, gained control of Washington Railway and Electric.

The Public Utility Holding Company Act was enacted in 1935 to force the breakup of large utility holding companies. Under this law, the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1942 ordered the North American Company and its subsidiaries to split up. A years-long legal battle ensued, culminating in a Supreme Court decision upholding the order. As a result, Pepco&#x27;s stock was distributed to Washington Railway&#x27;s shareholders in December 1947, making Pepco an independent, publicly traded company.

In 1954, revenue exceeded $50 million for the first time.

In 1969, the company suspended its dividend due to rising costs.

In 1980, the company cancelled plans to build a $930 million power plant in Montgomery County as a result of reduced demand.

In September 1995, the company announced a merger with Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric; however, the merger was cancelled in December 1997.

In 2001, Pepco agreed to acquire Conectiv Power Delivery, the parent company of Delmarva Power and Atlantic City Electric, for $2.2 billion. The purchase was completed in 2002, with Pepco and Conectiv becoming subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company, Pepco Holdings. In 2003, Pepco&#x27;s investment subsidiary, Potomac Capital Investment, was transferred to Pepco Holdings.

In 2014, Pepco Holdings agreed to be acquired by Exelon for $6.8 billion. The deal faced opposition from Pepco customers and from officials in Washington and Maryland, but was ultimately approved. The acquisition was completed on March 23, 2016, making Pepco a subsidiary of Exelon.

==Controversies==
===Most hated company in America===
In 2011, &quot;Business Insider&quot; named the company first on its list of &quot;The 19 Most Hated Companies In America&quot; based on its American Customer Satisfaction Index rating.

===Poor reliability and outages===
An investigation by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2010 faulted Pepco for poor reliability. The report noted that the company&#x27;s performance had slipped since 2005, comparing poorly to other major utilities in the frequency and duration of power outages. Thousands of people lost power for as many as five days after only 5–8 inches of heavy wet snow.

During the June 2012 North American derecho, more than half of the customers in Montgomery County, Maryland lost electric power. The company was criticized for being slow to restore power and for charging its customers for the power outage.

===Environmental impact===
The company&#x27;s Benning Road Power Plant produced air pollution that negatively affected neighboring communities. In 2017, the company agreed to pay regulators $1.6 million for violations of the Clean Water Act. In October 2023, Pepco agreed to pay $47 million in costs and $10 million in penalties to D.C. for decades of discharging toxic chemicals in the city, affecting the Anacostia River and other areas.

===Alleged fraud===
In March 2022, the D.C. Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the People’s Counsel alleged Pepco was committing a &quot;pattern of systemic violations&quot; in carrying out community solar panel installations. According to the complaint, Pepco has botched its handling of community solar projects in numerous ways. The utility is undercounting solar energy generation at community solar projects, according to the filing, and is “systematically failing” to provide accurate and timely solar credits to customers.

<doc id="410550" wikidata="Q731927" url="?curid=410550" title="Elektra (opera)">
<text>Elektra, Op. 58, is a one-act opera by Richard Strauss, to a German-language libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which he adapted from his 1903 drama &quot;Elektra&quot;. The opera was the first of many collaborations between Strauss and Hofmannsthal. It was first performed at the Königliches Opernhaus in Dresden on 25 January 1909. It was dedicated to his friends Natalie and Willy Levin.
== History ==

While based on ancient Greek mythology and Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Electra&quot;, the opera is highly modernist and expressionist in style. Hofmannsthal&#x27;s and Strauss&#x27;s adaptation of the story focuses tightly on Elektra, thoroughly developing her character by single-mindedly expressing her emotions and psychology as she meets with other characters, mostly one at a time. (The order of these conversations closely follows Sophocles&#x27; play.) The other characters are Klytaemnestra, her mother and one of the murderers of her father Agamemnon; her sister, Chrysothemis; her brother, Orestes; and Klytaemnestra&#x27;s lover, Aegisthus.

Various aspects from the myth are minimized as background to Elektra&#x27;s character and her obsession. Other facets of the ancient story are completely excluded, in particular the earlier sacrifice by Agamemnon of his and Klytaemnestra&#x27;s daughter Iphigenia, which was the motivation for Klytaemnestra&#x27;s subsequent murder of Agamemnon. These changes tightened the focus on Elektra&#x27;s furious lust for revenge. The result is a very modern, expressionistic retelling of the ancient Greek myth. Compared to Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Electra&quot;, the opera presents raw, brutal, violent, and bloodthirsty horror. Some scholars detect hints of incest in Elektra&#x27;s dysfunctional family relationships. Norwegian musicologist Ståle Wikshåland has analysed the use of time and temporality in the dramaturgy of &quot;Elektra&quot;.

&quot;Elektra&quot; is the second of Strauss&#x27;s two highly modernist operas (the other being &quot;Salome&quot;), characterized by cacophonous sections and atonal leitmotifs. These works contrast highly with his earliest operas and his later period. The reception of &quot;Elektra&quot; in German-speaking countries was mostly divided along traditionalist and modernist lines.

==Performance history==

&quot;Elektra&quot; is one of the most frequently performed operas based on classical Greek mythology, with a performance lasting—like the composer&#x27;s earlier &quot;Salome&quot;—around 100 minutes. &quot;Elektra&quot; received its UK premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1910 with Edyth Walker in the title role and Thomas Beecham conducting at the first- ever performance of a Strauss opera in the UK. The first United States performance of the opera in the original German was given by the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company at the Academy of Music on 29 October 1931, with Anne Roselle in the title role, Charlotte Boerner as Chrysothemis, Margarete Matzenauer as Klytaemnestra, Nelson Eddy as Orest, and Fritz Reiner conducting. The opera made its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 3 December 1932, with Gertrude Kappel singing the title role and Artur Bodanzky conducting.

==Synopsis==
Before the opera begins, Agamemnon has sacrificed Iphigenia on the ruse that she is to be married, and subsequently goes off to war against Troy. Iphigenia&#x27;s mother Klytaemnestra has thus come to hate her husband. After his return, with the help of her paramour Aegisth, she murders her husband and now is afraid that her crime will be avenged by her other children, Elektra, Chrysothemis, and their banished brother Orest. Elektra has managed to send her brother away while remaining behind to keep her father&#x27;s memory alive, but all the while, suffering the scorn of her mother and the entire court.

===Plot===

====&quot;Wo bleibt Elektra?&quot; (&quot;Where is Elektra?&quot;)====
Five servants try to wash the courtyard of the palace in Mycenae. While they do their work, they ask where can Elektra be, and she emerges from the shadows with a wild look on her face. The servants continue commenting how she came to be in that state and talk about how they taunt her only to receive insults from her. Only one servant shows sympathy for her, but she is taken away by the overseer to be flogged.

====&quot;Allein! Weh, ganz allein.&quot; (&quot;Alone! Alas, all alone.&quot;)====
Elektra comes back for her daily ritual in memory of her father, who upon his return from Troy was killed while bathing by Klytaemnestra and Aegisth and dragged out into the courtyard. Elektra now starts imagining the day when her father will be avenged and then of the ensuing celebration in which she will lead the triumphal dance.

====&quot;Elektra!&quot;====
Chrysothemis enters the courtyard. Unlike Elektra, she is meek and accommodating, and has remained on decent terms with Klytaemnestra and Aegisth. However, she cares for the welfare of her sister. She tells Elektra that their mother plans to lock Elektra in a tower, where no daylight will enter. Elektra laughs at this plan. Elektra asks where Chrysothemis heard it. When she tells her that she heard it at the Queen&#x27;s door, Elektra screams that there is nothing to find in this house but death. She might as well sit and wish death on her mother and stepfather, as Elektra does.

====&quot;Ich kann nicht sitzen und ins Dunkel starren.&quot; (&quot;I can not sit and stare into the darkness.&quot;)====
Chrysothemis does not wish to go on living a half-death in her own house: she wants to leave, marry and raise children.

====&quot;Es geht ein Lärm los.&quot; (&quot;What tumult is this?&quot;)====
As loud sounds are heard inside, Elektra mocks her sister that it is her wedding party. In reality, it is Klytaemnestra, who has just been awakened by her own nightmares. She goes with a large processional on her way to appease the gods through sacrifice. Chrysothemis tells Elektra that Klytaemnestra dreams of Orest murdering her. Chrysothemis begs Elektra not to stir trouble with Klytaemnestra today. She tells her that when their mother is scared, she is the most vicious. Elektra shuns her sister&#x27;s pleas, telling her that she will speak to her mother as never before. Chrysothemis flees the courtyard.

====&quot;Was willst du? Seht doch, dort!&quot; (&quot;What do you want? Behold, there!&quot;)====
Klytaemnestra stops at the sight of Elektra and wishes that she were not there to disturb her. She asks the gods for the reason for her burdens, but Elektra appeases her by telling her mother that she is a goddess herself.

====&quot;Ich will nichts hören!&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t want to hear anything.&quot;)====
Despite the protests of the Trainbearer and Confidante, Klytaemnestra climbs down to talk to Elektra. She passionately remembers her years of motherhood with her daughter. She accuses her retinue of being contradictory in their justifications of her nightmares, so she relies on her daughter for a true interpretation.

====&quot;Ich habe keine guten Nächte.&quot; (&quot;I have no good nights.&quot;)====
Klytaemnestra confides to her daughter that she has been suffering nightmares every night and that she still has not found the way to appease the gods. But, she claims, once that happens, she will be able to sleep again.

====&quot;Wenn das rechte Blutopfer unterm Beile fällt.&quot; (&quot;When the right blood under the hatchet flows.&quot;)====
Elektra teases her mother with little pieces of information about the right victim that must be slain, but she changes the conversation to her brother and why he is not allowed back. To Elektra&#x27;s horror, Klytaemnestra says that he has become mad and keeps company with animals. She responds that this is not true and that all the gold that her mother has sent was not being used to support her son but to have him killed. Angered by this, Klytaemnestra goes off on an insane tirade, telling Elektra that she would give the proper information for a rite and sacrificial victim if she were starved.

====&quot;Was bluten muß? Dein eigenes Genick.&quot; (&quot;Who must bleed? Your own throat.&quot;)====
Then Elektra reveals who is to be the actual victim: it is Klytaemnestra herself. She goes on to describe how the gods must be appeased once and for all. She must be awakened and chased around the house just like an animal that is being hunted. Only when she wishes that all was over and after envying prisoners in their cells, she will come to realize that her prison is her own body. At that time, the axe, with which she killed her husband and which will be handed to Orest by Elektra, will fall upon her. Only then the dreams will stop.

====&quot;Lichter! Mehr Lichter&quot; (&quot;Lights! More lights!&quot;)====
The Trainbearer and Confidante enter and whisper to her. Klytaemnestra laughs hysterically and, mocking Elektra, leaves. Elektra wonders what has made her mother laugh.

====&quot;Orest! Orest ist tot!&quot; (&quot;Orest! Orest is dead!&quot;)====
Chrysothemis comes bolting into the courtyard. She says that two messengers have arrived with the news that Orest is dead, trampled by his own horses. Elektra screams that it is not true. Both sisters sink to the ground in misery.

====&quot;Platz da! Wer lungert so vor einer Tür?&quot; (&quot;Give way! Who spies thus upon the threshold?&quot;)====
As a young servant comes out of the house to fetch the master, he trips over Elektra and Chrysothemis.

====&quot;Nun muß es hier von uns geschehn.&quot; (&quot;It is for us to act now.&quot;)====
Elektra does not relent and a terrified Chrysothemis listens as her sister demands that she help her to avenge their father.

====&quot;Wie stark du bist.&quot; (&quot;How strong you are.&quot;)====
Elektra goes on to praise her sister and her beauty, promising that she shall become Chrysothemis&#x27;s slave at her bridal chamber in exchange for the assistance in her task. Chrysothemis fights off her sister and flees. Elektra curses her.

====&quot;Nun denn, allein!&quot; (&quot;Well, alone!&quot;)====
Determined to do it alone, she digs for the axe that killed her father, but is interrupted by a mysterious man who comes into the courtyard.

====&quot;Was willst du, fremder Mensch?&quot; (&quot;What do you want, stranger?&quot;)====
She hears that he is expecting to be called from within the palace because he has a message for the lady of the house. He claims to be a friend of Orest, and says that he was with him at the time of his death.

====&quot;Wer bist denn du?&quot; (&quot;Who are you?&quot;)====
Elektra grieves. The man first guesses that she must be a blood relative of Orest and Agamemnon, then, upon asking her name, discovers she is Elektra.

====&quot;Orest!&quot;====
Then, taken aback, she recognizes him: it is Orest who has come back in disguise. Elektra is initially ecstatic, but also ashamed of what she has become and how she has sacrificed her own royal state for the cause.

====&quot;Du wirst es tun? Allein? Du armes Kind?&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;ll do it? Alone? Poor child?&quot;)====
Orest&#x27;s Tutor comes and interrupts the siblings; their task is dangerous and anything can jeopardize it. The Trainbearer and Confidante come out of the palace and lead Orest in.

====&quot;Ich habe ihm das Beil nicht geben können!&quot; (&quot;I could not give him the axe!&quot;)====
Elektra realizes that she forgot to give the axe to Orest. Horrified, she has no other choice but to wait. Nevertheless, the piercing shriek of Klytaemnestra is heard from within the palace, then a grim moan. Elektra smiles brightly, knowing that Orest has killed their mother.
====&quot;Es muss etwas geschehen sein!&quot; (&quot;Something must have happened!&quot;)====
Chrysothemis and the maids run into the courtyard with torches. They realize what is going on, and are horrified. They notice Elektra at the threshold of the door and call out to her. A maid notices the approaching Aegisth outside the palace. Fearing his wrath, she tells the others to run inside. All do so, except for Elektra.
====&quot;He! Lichter!&quot; (&quot;Torches there!&quot;)====
Aegisth arrives. He is oblivious to what has just occurred; he is ecstatic to have heard that Orest is dead and wishes to speak with the messengers. Elektra, eerily dancing with a torch, happily ushers him inside the palace, reassuring him of her new change of heart.

====&quot;Helft! Mörder!&quot; (&quot;Help! Murder!&quot;)====
As Aegisth screams and calls for help, Elektra replies: &quot;Agamemnon can hear you.&quot;

====&quot;Elektra! Schwester!&quot; (&quot;Elektra! Sister!&quot;)====
Chrysothemis comes out of the palace stating that Orest is inside and that he has killed Klytaemnestra and Aegisth. A massacre has begun with Orest&#x27;s followers killing those who supported Aegisth and the Queen.

====&quot;Ob ich nicht höre?&quot; (&quot;How can I not hear?&quot;)====
Elektra is ecstatic and wants to lead the crowd to dance but at first cannot.

====&quot;Hörst du denn nicht?&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t you hear?&quot;)====
Chrysothemis and Elektra praise their brother&#x27;s feat.

====&quot;Schweig, und tanze.&quot; (&quot;Be silent and dance.&quot;)====
At last Elektra begins to dance. As she reaches the climax of her dance, she falls to the ground: Elektra is dead. Horrified, Chrysothemis calls for Orest, but to no avail.

==Style and instrumentation==
Musically, &quot;Elektra&quot; deploys dissonance, chromaticism and extremely fluid tonality in a way which recalls but moves beyond the same composer&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; of 1905, and thus &quot;Elektra&quot; represents Strauss&#x27;s furthest advances in modernism, from which he later retreated. The bitonal or extended Elektra chord is a well known dissonance from the opera while harmonic parallelism is also a prominent modernist technique.

To support the overwhelming emotional content of the opera, Strauss uses an immense orchestra of about 110—one of the largest in opera—with the following instrumentation:
* Woodwind: piccolo (doubling fourth flute, although this is omitted from the instrumentation list at the beginning of the score), 3 flutes (flute 3 doubling piccolo 2), 3 oboes (oboe 3 doubling English horn), heckelphone, clarinet in E-flat, 4 clarinets in B-flat and A, 2 basset horns, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon
* Brass: 8 horns (horns 5–8 doubling 2 B-flat tenor and 2 F bass Wagner tubas), 6 trumpets, bass trumpet, 3 trombones, contrabass trombone, tuba
* Percussion: 6–8 timpani (2 players), snare drum, bass drum (with switch), cymbals, tam-tam, triangle, tambourine, castanets, glockenspiel
* Keyboards: celesta &quot;(ad libitum)&quot;
* Strings: 2 harps (doubled if possible at the end), 24 violins divided into three groups, 18 violas divided into three groups (the first of which, unusually, doubles as the fourth violin section), 12 cellos divided into two groups, 8 double basses

In addition to the massive orchestral forces and the large principal cast of singers, a full chorus is briefly used at the end of the opera from &quot;Stimmen hinter der Scene&quot; (&quot;voices behind the scene&quot;) calling out the arrival of Orestes from within the Palace following the murder of Aegisth.

==Motives and chords==

The characters in &quot;Elektra&quot; are characterized in the music through leitmotifs or chords including the Elektra chord, a polychord consisting of E major and C# major stacked on top of each other, building a chain of thirds accompanied by added thirds on top. The final form is an eleventh chord. 

Klytaemnestra, in contrast to Agamemnon&#x27;s clearly diatonic minor triad motif, is characterized by a bitonal six note collection most often represented as a pair of two minor chords a tritone apart, typically on B and F, rather than simultaneously.

Agamemnon&#x27;s leitmotif is an arpeggiated D minor chord in the second inversion.

<doc id="410551" wikidata="Q542882" url="?curid=410551" title="List of monarchs of Kush">
<text>The monarchs of Kush were the rulers of the ancient Kingdom of Kush (8th century BCE – 4th century CE), a major civilization in ancient Nubia (roughly corresponding to modern-day Sudan). Kushite power was centralised and unified over the course of the centuries following the collapse of the New Kingdom of Egypt , leading to the eventual establishment of the Kingdom of Kush under Alara .

Kush reached the apex of its power –656 BCE, when the Kushite kings also ruled as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt. The kingdom remained a powerful state in its heartland after Kushite rule in Egypt was terminated and it survived for another millennium until its collapse . Egyptian culture heavily influenced Kush in terms of its royal and monumental iconography, though indigenous elements were also used and became increasingly prominent in the Meroitic period (c. 270 BCE–350 CE).

There are no preserved Kushite lists of rulers and the regnal sequence is instead largely reconstructed based on evidence such as royal inscriptions and burials. Surviving sources are at several points scant, meaning that parts of the chronology and sequence are approximate and tentative. The list of rulers might also be incomplete given that future discoveries of additional royal names and burials are possible.

== Introduction ==
=== Royal succession in Kush ===

The system of royal succession in the Kingdom of Kush is not well understood. There are no known administrative documents or histories written by the Kushites themselves; because very little of the royal genealogy can be reliably reconstructed, it is impossible to determine how the system functioned in theory and when or if it was ever broken. Royal women were prominent in Kushite society, especially in the Meroitic period ( 270 BCE–350 CE). As a consequence it has long been disputed whether the Kushite succession was mainly patrilineal (inherited through male lines) or matrilineal (inherited through female lines). Further uncertainties would exist within either system; a patrilineal system can for instance be based around successions that are mainly father→son or mainly brother→brother. 

No ruling Kushite queens are known from before the Meroitic period, suggesting that they may have been excluded from holding office during earlier periods. Despite this, there are numerous royal inscriptions from pre-Meroitic kings, for instance Aspelta, that place emphasis only on their female ancestors. This is on its own generally not considered sufficient evidence for purely matrilineal succession and patrilineal relations are often assumed between rulers even when unsupported by evidence. As examples, kings Alara and Kashta are often assumed to have been brothers and Piye is often assumed to have been Kashta&#x27;s son, though neither relation is supported by any direct evidence. Based on succession in Egypt during the New Kingdom ( 1550–1069 BCE) and Third Intermediate (–664 BCE) periods, it is conceivable that female lines of descent were just as important as male ones for establishing legitimacy. According to the archaeologist Robert Morkot, the heir who succeeded in claiming the throne might simply have been the strongest eligible royal descendant, instead of there being a clear succession system. Some successions, such as Taharqa to Tantamani to Atlanersa (seventh century BCE), are difficult to explain under either pure patrilineality or pure matrilineality.

It was in older scholarship on Kush assumed that all monarchs were direct descendants of earlier monarchs. In the case of the especially limited material available for large parts of the Meroitic period, this in cases led to the assumption that any figure mentioned as the father of a ruling monarch must also have been a king, even if they are never attested in that role or mentioned elsewhere. Examples of such fathers of monarchs include Pisakar, Adeqetali, Teritnide, Arotnide, and Teritedakhetey, who sometimes still figure in modern reconstructed regnal lists (though most reconstructions omit them). In addition to not being directly attested as monarchs themselves, the names of these individuals do not fit with the known type of Kushite royal names, and counting them as kings ignores the prospect of succession through indirect and/or female lines, both of which are believed to have transpired. There were Kushite rulers in the Meroitic period who can be confidently established to have had non-ruling fathers.

=== List format and content ===
There is no universally used periodisation of Kushite history. This list uses the chronological scheme proposed by Emberling (2023), which divides Kushite history into the following four periods: &quot;Early Napatan&quot; (coalescence of Kushite political authority in Napata), &quot;Middle Napatan&quot; (from Alara to the end of Kushite dominion over Egypt), &quot;Late Napatan&quot; (after the loss of Egypt while royal burials continued at Napata), and &quot;Meroitic&quot; (royal burials at Meroë) periods.

Precise regnal dates are not known for any Kushite monarchs after the end of Kushite dominion over Egypt. This list thus only includes approximate timeframes, cited to modern sources. Some older sources provide precise dates for each ruler. These dates usually derive from a speculative 1923 chronology by George Andrew Reisner, who based the dates on a handful of synchronisms with Egyptian history, used a wholly hypothetical average reign length of 15 years, and assigned longer reigns and shorter reigns based on the size and richness of burials.

This list includes the tomb of each monarch (in the &#x27;burial&#x27; column) and names them using abbreviations. The abbreviations are shorthands for the different Kushite burial pyramid complexes, with the numbers indicating a particular pyramid or temple. &quot;Kur.&quot; stands for Kurru (i.e. El-Kurru) ,&quot;Nu.&quot; stands for Nuri, &quot;Bar.&quot; stands for Jebel Barkal, and &quot;Beg.&quot; stands for Begrawiyah (Meroë). &quot;Beg. N&quot; and &quot;Beg. S&quot; refer to the northern and southern cemeteries of Meroë, respectively. El-Kurru, Nuri, and Jebel Barkal are all located by the ancient city of Napata; Meroë was a different city further south.

== List of monarchs ==

=== Early Napatan period (1069–780 BCE) ===
The Early Napatan period began with Kush becoming autonomous or independent in the wake of the collapse of the New Kingdom of Egypt, 1069 BCE. The material from Kush during this time is extremely scant. There may have been several local Kushite political units, not properly unified into a single kingdom until the beginning of the later Middle Napatan period. During the Early Napatan period, political authority in the region slowly coalesced around Napata. The original royal cemetery of Napata (El-Kurru) contains several (unnamed) burials that are earlier in age than the later Middle Napatan period, perhaps the burials of local chieftains. These have sometimes been interpreted as the burials of around five generations of kings earlier than Alara, the earliest Kushite king known by name. Alara is however generally considered the founder of Kush by historians since he was referenced in the writings of later monarchs as a dynastic founder, in contexts suggesting that he also established the kingdom.

=== Middle Napatan period (780–656 BCE) ===

The Middle Napatan period began with the rule of the earliest known named Kushite monarch, Alara, and encompassed the later period of Kushite rule over Egypt (as Ancient Egypt&#x27;s 25th dynasty). This list includes the conventional speculative patrilineal relationships between some of the rulers; these are not accepted by all scholars and it is possible that as many as three intermarrying families were involved in the early stages of the kingdom.

=== Late Napatan period (656–270 BCE) ===
The Late Napatan period encompasses Kushite history after the loss of Egypt, for as long as Napata remained the site used for royal burials.
=== Meroitic period (270 BCE–350 CE) ===
In third century BCE, the royal burial ground was moved from Napata to Meroë for the burial of Arakamani. This marked the final step in a more gradual transfer of political authority and wealth to Meroë and is regarded as the beginning of the Meroitic period. The change in capital should not be misinterpreted as indicating a break in historical or cultural continuity; Napata continued to function as an important religious centre and evidence suggests that Meroë had been important from very early on. It is possible that Meroë served as the residence of the Kushite kings from as early as the fifth century BCE.

From the 2nd century BCE onwards, Kush is noteworthy for a large number of queens regnant (queens ruling in their own right). Queens regnant retained their earlier style (often &quot;kandake&quot;) when becoming rulers, though they also adopted the kingly title of &quot;qore&quot; to indicate their new authority. Due to the high number of ruling queens in the Meroitic period, absent in earlier times, the gender of each monarch is here indicated by a gender symbol (♀ or ♂). In cases where the gender is unknown, no symbol is included. 

The royal succession, sequence, and chronology of Kushite rulers is especially uncertain in the Meroitic period. By necessity this list shows only one interpretation, though noteworthy alternate ideas are featured in footnotes. Given that the throne appears to have been able to pass through male, female, and indirect lines, this list simply records the parents (if known) of each monarch in the &#x27;filiation&#x27; column, without speculation on their overall relations. The use of the ♔ symbol in this column indicates that the parent of a monarch was also a monarch.

Beg. N 25 is the last known royal burial in Meroë and is assumed to mark the end of the dynasty ruling from that city. Circumstantial and indirect evidence also dates the end of Meroitic political authority to the middle decades of the fourth century CE.

== Successor states of Kush ==

László Török hypothesised that a unified (Nubian?) &#x27;Post-Meroitic successor state&#x27; ruled a territory roughly corresponding to the Kushite kingdom for several decades after the end of the Meroitic period. Such a realm may be indicated by later burials of elites at Ferkeh, Gemai, Qustul and El-Hobagi. Török suggested that these elites were non-royal deputies of a monarch residing in the south. The southern cemetery of Ballana, where seven generations of post-Kushite but pre-Christian rulers are buried, has sometimes been suggested to belong to a successor state of Kush, though the burials share few ideological similarities with those of the Kushite rulers beyond the presence of silver crowns in a similar style. The existence of a unified post-Meroitic state is not universally accepted. Josefine Kuckertz, for instance, instead dates the disintegration of the kingdom to already in the middle fourth century CE, at the same time as the fall of the Meroitic dynasty.

Around 420 CE, the aforementioned elites or deputies began assuming royal insignia of their own, resulting in the disintegration of the supposed successor state (if one existed) into the later kingdoms of Nobatia (north), Makuria (center), and Alodia (south). Out of these three, Nobatia is in particular sometimes considered a small post-imperial remnant of Kush, maintaining some aspects of Kushite culture but also exhibiting Hellenistic and Roman influences. The early stage of Nobatia is conventionally associated with the Ballana cemetery.

== Unattributed royal burials ==
There are many Kushite pyramids in addition to those listed above, built for individuals such as consorts, princes, and high officials. Because of the size and the number of chambers, some pyramids without preserved names have been suggested to have belonged to monarchs. Some such pyramids are included in the list above, with tentative and hypothetical attributions put forth by researchers. Other pyramids sometimes identified as belonging to rulers are listed below. There are no unattributed royal burials from El-Kurru or Nuri.

Whether these pyramids belong to monarchs is often disputed. Pyramids thought to belong to rulers have sometimes been reinterpreted: Beg. S 10 was once attributed to King &quot;Bartare-(Kalkai)&quot; but is now recognised as the tomb of a non-ruling queen consort. These additional tombs should not be interpreted as on their own indicating additional Kushite rulers. In addition to possible misinterpretation, some tombs could match rulers whose burials are &#x27;unidentified&#x27; in the list above and some of the tentative and hypothetical attributions listed above could be wrong.

<text>The 2003 [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) was a semifinal series in Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2003 postseason played between the Wild Card Boston Red Sox and the top-seeded New York Yankees from October 8 to 16, 2003. The Yankees won the series four games to three to advance to the World Series, where they lost in six games to the National League champion Florida Marlins.

==Summary==
This series delivered yet another blow to Red Sox fans&#x27; hopes of winning a World Series for the first time since 1918. The series seemed evenly matched, with the lead being held first by the Red Sox, then by the Yankees. The Sox forced the series to a full seven games, with the seventh game setting another major league record for the rivalry between the two teams: it marked the first time two major league teams played more than 25 games against each other over the course of a single season. The Red Sox also set an ALCS record with 12 home runs in the series.

===New York Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox===
==Game summaries==

===Game 1===
Wednesday, October 8, 2003 at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York 8:07ET MLB on FOX
Tim Wakefield shut the Bronx Bombers down for six innings in Game 1, allowing only back-to-back one-out singles to Jorge Posada and Hideki Matsui in the second. Mike Mussina pitched three shutout innings before allowing a leadoff single to Manny Ramirez in the fourth, when the Red Sox began to flex their muscles. David Ortiz homered into the third deck in right field to put the Red Sox up 2–0. Next inning, Todd Walker drove Mussina&#x27;s first pitch down the right-field line; the ball appeared to strike the foul pole, but was called foul by right field umpire Angel Hernandez. Home plate umpire Tim McClelland immediately overruled him, and awarded Walker home plate. Ramirez followed with a home run later that inning to put the Red Sox ahead 4–0. In the top of the seventh, Jeff Nelson allowed a two-out single to Ramirez and hit Ortiz with a pitch before Kevin Millar&#x27;s RBI single made it 5-0 Boston. In the bottom of the inning, Wakefield walked Jason Giambi and Bernie Williams before being relieved by Alan Embree, who allowed an RBI double to Posada and sacrifice fly to Matsui to make it 5-2 Boston. But the Yankees did not score again and the Red Sox took a 1–0 series lead, with Scott Williamson earning the save.

===Game 2===
Thursday, October 9, 2003 at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
After leaving the bases loaded in the first, the Red Sox took a 1–0 lead in the second off Andy Pettitte when Jason Varitek hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Trot Nixon&#x27;s single, and scored on Damian Jackson&#x27;s single. In the bottom of the inning, Derek Lowe issued a leadoff walk to Jorge Posada and one out later, Nick Johnson&#x27;s home run put the Yankees up 2-1. Next inning, Lowe allowed three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which, by Bernie Williams, scored Derek Jeter to make it 3-1 Yankees. In the fifth, Williams doubled with one out and scored on a single by Hideki Matsui, who was tagged out at second to end the inning. Varitek&#x27;s home run in the sixth off Pettitte made it 4-2 Yankees. In the seventh, Lowe allowed a two-out single to Jason Giambi and walked Williams before being relieved by Scott Sauerbeck, who allowed a two-run double to Posada to make it 6-2 Yankees. Their lead held, tying the series at 1-1 heading to Boston.

===Game 3===
Saturday, October 11, 2003 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
Game 3 was highly anticipated, a classic matchup between Sox ace Pedro Martínez and former Sox pitcher Roger Clemens, who, on the cusp of retirement, was thought to be pitching his last game at Fenway Park. Early on, Karim Garcia was hit in the back by a Martínez fastball. Words were exchanged and Martínez threateningly gestured towards Yankee catcher Jorge Posada. When Garcia was forced out at second, he slid hard into Todd Walker. The following inning, Manny Ramírez took exception to a high Clemens pitch and charged the mound. Both benches cleared, and the resulting brawl turned surreal when 72-year-old Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer charged Martínez. Martínez sidestepped Zimmer, placed his hands on Zimmer&#x27;s head and propelled Zimmer to the ground. The Zimmer/Martinez altercation ended there as Yankee trainer Gene Monahan and various Yankee players attended to him. After a 13-minute delay, during which Fenway Park stopped all beer sales for the remainder of the game, Clemens struck out Ramirez and proceeded to pitch effectively as the Yankees held a lead. The game did not end quietly: a Fenway groundskeeper got into a scuffle with Yankee reliever Jeff Nelson and Garcia in the middle of the 9th inning in the bullpen area. The employee had cheered a double play the Red Sox turned and Nelson was upset; the employee was taken to the hospital with cleat marks on his back and arm, while Garcia left with a cut hand.

In the bottom of the first, Clemens allowed a leadoff single to Johnny Damon and subsequent double to Todd Walker. After Nomar Garciaparra struck out, Ramirez&#x27;s double put the Red Sox up 2-0. The Yankees cut it to 2–1 in the second off Martinez when Posada hit a leadoff double and scored on Garcia&#x27;s single two outs later. Jeter&#x27;s home run next inning tied the game. In the fourth, Posada drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on Nick Johnson&#x27;s single, and scored on Matsui&#x27;s ground-rule double. After Garcia was hit by a pitch to load the bases, Alfonso Soriano hit into a double play that scored Johnson and put the Yankees up 4-2. In the bottom of the seventh, reliever Félix Heredia issued a leadoff walk to Ortiz. Jose Contreras relieved Heredia and allowed a single to Kevin Millar that moved Ortiz to third. Ortiz scored when Trot Nixon hit into a double play to make it 4-3 Yankees. Their lead held, though, putting them up 2–1 in the series.

===Game 4===
Monday, October 13, 2003 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
Rain postponed Game 4 from Sunday, October 12, to Monday, October 13. The Red Sox went up 1–0 on Todd Walker&#x27;s second home run of the series in the fourth off Mike Mussina. In the top of the fifth, Tim Wakefield allowed back-to-back one-hit singles before Jeter&#x27;s double tied the game and put runners on second and third. Bernie Williams walked with two outs to load the bases, but Posada lined out to left to end the inning. In the bottom half, Nixon&#x27;s home run put the Red Sox up 2-1. They loaded the bases in the seventh off Mussina on a double and two walks with one out when Varitek hit into a force out at second, narrowly beating Soriano&#x27;s throw to first to avoid a double play and allow Millar to score to make it 3-1. Ruben Sierra&#x27;s one-out home run in the ninth off Scott Williamson made it 3-2, but Williamson struck out David Dellucci and Soriano to end the game, pick up his second save of the series, and tie the series at 2-2.

===Game 5===
Tuesday, October 14, 2003 at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
The Yankees loaded the bases in the second off Derek Lowe on two walks and a hit when Garcia&#x27;s single scored two, then Soriano&#x27;s single scored another. Ramirez&#x27;s leadoff home run in the fourth off David Wells made it 3-1. They made it 4–1 in the eighth when Bernie Williams reached on a force out at second, moved to third on Posada&#x27;s single and scored on Matsui&#x27;s groundout off Alan Embree. In the bottom of the inning, Todd Walker hit a leadoff triple off Mariano Rivera and scored on Garciaparra&#x27;s groundout to make it 4-2 Yankees. Rivera, though, shut out the Red Sox for the rest of the game, leaving the Yankees one win away from the World Series.

===Game 6===
Wednesday, October 15, 2003 at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
Jason Giambi&#x27;s two-out home run in the first off John Burkett put the Yankees up 1-0, but Varitek&#x27;s leadoff home run in the third off Andy Pettitte tied the score. The Red Sox loaded the bases with one out on two walks and a single before Ortiz&#x27;s single scored two and Millar&#x27;s single scored another to put them up 4-1. In the bottom of the fourth, Posada and Matsui hit back-to-back one-out singles before Nick Johnson&#x27;s double and Aaron Boone&#x27;s groundout scored a run each. Garciaparra&#x27;s error allowed Garcia to reach base before Soriano&#x27;s two-run double put the Yankees on top, 5-4, and ended Burkett&#x27;s night. Posada&#x27;s home run next inning off Bronson Arroyo made it 6-4 Yankees. In the top of the seventh, Garciaparra hit a leadoff triple off Jose Contreras and scored on Matsui&#x27;s errant throw to third. Ramirez then doubled, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on Ortiz&#x27;s single to tie the game. After allowing a one-out single to Bill Mueller, Contreras was relieved by Félix Heredia, who struck out Trot Nixon, but threw a wild pitch that put runners on second and third. After intentionally walking Varitek to load the bases, Heredia walked Damon to force in a run and put the Red Sox up 7-6. They added insurance in the ninth when Mueller doubled with one out off Jeff Nelson. Gabe White relieved Nelson and allowed a home run to Nixon to make it 9-6. Scott Williamson retired the Yankees in order in the bottom half for his third save of the series, forcing a Game 7.

===Game 7===
Thursday, October 16, 2003 at Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York
In the Martinez–Clemens rematch of Game 3, Clemens allowed a one-out single to Millar before Nixon&#x27;s home run put Boston up 2-0. After Mueller struck out, Varitek doubled and scored on third baseman Enrique Wilson&#x27;s throwing error to first on Damon&#x27;s ground ball. Millar&#x27;s leadoff home run in the fourth made it 4-0 Boston. Nixon then walked and moved to third on Mueller&#x27;s single to knock Clemens out of the game. In the first relief appearance of his career, Mike Mussina cleaned up Clemens&#x27;s mess by striking out Varitek and inducing a Johnny Damon double play. His three innings of scoreless relief, and home runs in the fifth and seventh innings by Giambi kept the Yankees in the game. 

But in the eighth inning, with the Red Sox leading 5–2 after Ortiz homered in the top half off David Wells, things unraveled for Boston. Sox manager Grady Little kept a tiring Martínez in for the eighth, a controversial move still discussed years later. Little had two relievers who had shown effectiveness in the games leading up to the seventh game—Scott Williamson and Mike Timlin (who had not allowed a single hit in the playoffs), but both had experienced stretches of ineffectiveness during the season, while Martínez had Hall of Fame credentials. Critics of the move note that Martínez had experienced diminished effectiveness in the late innings of games in which he had thrown more than 100 pitches. After Martínez recorded the first out of the inning, he gave up a double to Jeter and an RBI single to Bernie Williams, prompting Little to go to the mound. To the surprise of many, Little left Martínez in the game, leaving lefty Alan Embree in the bullpen with the left-handed Matsui coming to the plate. Martínez gave up a ground rule double to Matsui and a two-run bloop double to Posada to tie the game, sending it to extra innings. Mariano Rivera came in for the ninth and pitched three shutout innings.

Tim Wakefield pitched a scoreless tenth for Boston and in the bottom of the 11th faced Aaron Boone, who had entered earlier as a pinch-runner. On Wakefield&#x27;s first pitch of the inning, Boone launched a walk-off home run into the left field seats, sending the Yankees to the World Series. Fox Sports displayed a collection of images thereafter: tears welling up in the eyes of Aaron&#x27;s brother, Seattle Mariners infielder Bret Boone (the guest announcer), ALCS MVP Rivera running to the mound and collapsing on it in joy, Boone jumping on home plate, and Rivera being carried off on his teammates&#x27; shoulders.

Boone became just the second player in MLB history to end a Game 7 of a postseason series with a walk-off home run; the only other player is Bill Mazeroski, who did so in the 1960 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates (ironically against the Yankees).

==Aftermath==
The series is widely considered one of the most devastating losses in Boston sports history. The loss was crushing for Red Sox fans, many of whom blamed Little for leaving Martínez in the game since Martínez had experienced difficulty beyond 100 pitches. In his book &quot;Now I Can Die in Peace&quot;, Bill Simmons writes that the Boston owners and Theo Epstein had ordered Little to remove Martínez from the game when he finished the seventh inning and/or topped the three-digit pitch count. Martínez was sure he would not be called on for the eighth inning, but agreed to pitch when Little asked. After the game, Little reportedly prophetically told Martínez, &quot;Petey, I might not be here anymore.&quot; Little defended his move by saying he felt that even a tired Martínez was the best option. Little&#x27;s defenders also noted that the Red Sox offense collapsed in the game, as the club scored only two runs in the last nine innings, and also noted Damon&#x27;s poor defensive play in center field during the crucial inning. Others have noted that by staying with a physically fragile pitcher in an ultimate game with two runners on base, a three-run lead, a rested pitcher who had performed well in the postseason ready in the bullpen and the other team&#x27;s MVP on deck, Little did exactly what Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston did with Sandy Koufax in Game 7 of the 1965 World Series, which Alston&#x27;s Dodgers won. Little&#x27;s contract was not renewed after the season and he was replaced by Terry Francona. Little went on to manage the Los Angeles Dodgers before being replaced by Joe Torre after the 2007 season.

Boone&#x27;s pennant-clinching home run often draws comparisons to another famous Yankee home run against the Red Sox in the postseason: the one Bucky Dent hit in a one-game playoff between the two teams that decided the American League East division title in 1978. But the Yankees won the World Series that year, against the Dodgers. As with Dent, Boone has had the expletive &quot;Fucking&quot; assigned as a middle name by Red Sox fans in the following years.

Until the final game of the pennant race, some baseball fans had been hoping for a rematch of the 1918 World Series between the Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs, one of only two major league teams to have played for a longer period of time since winning the World Series (the other was the Chicago White Sox, who won the Series in ). The Cubs reached the 2003 National League Championship Series against the Florida Marlins. As with the Red Sox, they had a three-run lead and were only five outs away from reaching the World Series, although this was in Game 6, when the Marlins scored eight runs in that inning and won the game 8–3. The Marlins won Game 7, 9–6, to advance to the World Series, where they defeated the Yankees, four games to two. The Cubs did not reach the World Series until , winning in seven games over the Cleveland Indians.

The following year, Boston and New York met again in the ALCS, with Boston becoming the first team in major league history—as well as just the third team in American professional sports history—to come back to win a playoff series after being down three games to none; they then swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series to win their first championship since 1918 and thus end the Curse of the Bambino.

In the 2005–06 offseason, the rivalry between Boston and New York revived the Yankees&#x27; loss to the Marlins in the 2003 World Series when they traded Josh Beckett, the pitcher who pitched a complete-game shutout against the Yankees in the deciding game of the Series, to the Red Sox.

The Yankees eventually hired postseason hero Boone as their manager in 2018. The two teams have met in the postseason twice during his tenure (2018, 2021), with Boston winning both times; in , the Red Sox beat the Yankees en route to becoming the first team to win two World Series exactly one century apart, a feat that Boone kept them from doing in 2003, as the Red Sox won the inaugural World Series.

Produced by National Hockey League Hall of Fame player Mark Messier in 2024, Amazon Prime spotlighted the 2003 ALCS in their series documentary &#x27;Game 7&#x27;.

<text>The National League for Democracy (, ; abbr. NLD; Burmese abbr. ဒီချုပ်) is a deregistered liberal democratic political party in Myanmar (formerly Burma). It became the country&#x27;s ruling party after a landslide victory in the 2015 general election but was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état in February 2021 following another landslide election victory in 2020.

Founded on 27 September 1988, the NLD has become one of the most influential parties in Myanmar&#x27;s pro-democracy movement. Aung San Suu Kyi, the former State Counsellor of Myanmar, serves as its leader. The party won a substantial parliamentary majority in the 1990 Myanmar general election. However, the ruling military junta refused to recognise the result. On 6 May 2010, the party was declared illegal and ordered to be disbanded by the junta after refusing to register for the elections slated for November 2010. In November 2011, the NLD announced its intention to register as a political party to contest future elections, and Myanmar&#x27;s Union Election Commission approved their application for registration on 13 December 2011.

In the 2012 by-elections, the NLD contested 44 of the 45 available seats, winning 43, with its only loss being in one seat to the SNDP. Party leader Aung San Suu Kyi won the seat of Kawhmu. In the 2015 general election, the NLD won a supermajority in both houses of the Assembly, paving the way for the country&#x27;s first non-military president in 54 years. The NLD is an observer party of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats.

On 21 May 2021, the junta-controlled Union Election Commission (UEC) announced plans to permanently dissolve the NLD, though the junta later temporarily reversed this decision. In January 2023, the junta enacted a new electoral law designed to favor the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the military&#x27;s electoral proxy, leading the NLD to announce that it would not re-register as a political party. On 28 March 2023, the UEC dissolved the NLD for failing to register, a decision which the NLD rejected as illegitimate.

==History==

=== 1990s: Beginnings ===
The NLD was formed in the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising, a series of protests in favour of democracy which took place in 1990 and ended when the military again took control of the country in a coup. It formed under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Aung San, a pivotal figure in the Burmese independence movement of the 1940s. She was recruited by concerned democracy advocates. The first founding chair is Brigadier General Aung Gyi and Aung San Suu Kyi is the General Secretary of the Party.

In the 1990 parliamentary elections, the party took 59% of the vote and won 392 out of 492 contested seats, compared to 10 seats won by the governing National Unity Party. However, the ruling military junta (formerly SLORC, later known as the State Peace and Development Council or SPDC) did not let the party form a government. Soon after the election, the party was repressed and in 1996 Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest. This was her status for 16 of the following 21 years until her release on 13 November 2010. A number of senior NLD members escaped arrest, however, and formed the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB).

=== 2000s: Continued repression under military rule ===
In 2001, the government permitted NLD office branches to re-open throughout Burma and freed some imprisoned members. In May 2002, NLD&#x27;s general secretary, Aung San Suu Kyi, was again released from house arrest. She and other NLD members made numerous trips throughout the country and received support from the public. However, on their trip to Depayin township in May 2003, dozens of NLD members were shot and killed in a military-sponsored massacre. Its general secretary, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the party&#x27;s vice president, U Tin Oo, were again arrested.

From 2004, the government prohibited the activities of the party. In 2006, many members resigned from NLD, citing harassment and pressure from the Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) and the Union Solidarity and Development Association. In October 2008, following the crackdown on the aftermath of the Saffron Revolution a bomb exploded in the Htan Chauk Pin quarter of the Shwepyitha Township of Yangon, near the office of the military junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Association killing one. The victim was identified as Thet Oo Win, a former Buddhist monk who participated in the Saffron Revolution, was killed while improvising the bomb at his own residence. The junta blamed the National League for Democracy party of planting that bomb, but experts believed at the time that the opposition was not in a position to carry out such acts amidst the tightly controlled security environment. The junta detained several members of the party in connection with the bombings that year.

=== 2010s: Transition to power-sharing with the military ===

The NLD boycotted the general election held in November 2010 because many of its most prominent members were barred from standing. The laws were designed in such a way that the party would have had to expel these members to be allowed to run. This decision, taken in May, led to the party being officially banned. A splinter group named the National Democratic Force broke away from the NLD to contest the elections, but secured less than 3% of the vote. The election was won in a landslide by the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), and was described by U.S. President Barack Obama as &quot;stolen&quot;.

Discussions were held between Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands. In October, around a tenth of Myanmar&#x27;s political prisoners were freed in an amnesty and trade unions were legalised.

On 18 November 2011, following a meeting of its leaders, the NLD announced its intention to re-register as a political party in order to contend in 48 by-elections necessitated by the promotion of Union Solidarity and Development Party MPs who had been appointed as ministers. Following the decision, Suu Kyi held a telephone conference with Barack Obama, in which it was agreed that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would make a visit to Myanmar, a move received with caution by Burma&#x27;s ally China. The visit took place on 30 November. European Union Vice President Catherine Ashton welcomed the possibility of &quot;fair and transparent&quot; elections in Burma, and said that the EU would be reviewing its foreign policy towards the country.

The NLD contested the all available seats during the 2012 Myanmar by-elections. The election was marred with skepticism over whether the results would be legitimate, and the NLD reported issues with campaign conduct and other irregularities in the election&#x27;s lead-up. NLD candidates, including Suu Kyi, won 43 of the 45 available seats at both the national and regional levels. Its main rival, the USDP also contested all available seats, losing all but one seat.

During preparations for the 2015 elections, the party was criticised for discouraging Muslim candidates, a step interpreted as a desire to maintain relations with hardline Buddhist monks such as the Ma Ba Tha association. The NLD secured 85% of all available parliamentary seats during the election.

Ko Ni, a legal advisor to the party and a Muslim, was assassinated in January 2017. The party was criticised by international media outlets for its lack of response to renewed military-led violence against the Rohingya beginning in 2016, as well as for &quot;doing little to address the country’s weak rule of law, corrupt judiciary, or impunity for security force abuses&quot; with the power they had (although security institutions remain dominated by the military).

=== 2020s-present: Return to military rule ===
The NLD won the 2020 Myanmar general election by a larger margin than in 2015, securing the mandate to form a new government. By contrast, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party lost 8 additional seats in both chambers of the national legislature. Domestic and international election observers deemed the election results credible, noting no major irregularities. Nonetheless, the military claimed the vote was fraudulent, citing 8.6 million irregularities in voter lists. On 28 January 2021, the Union Election Commission rejected the military&#x27;s fraud allegations, unable to corroborate the military&#x27;s claims.

During the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état on 1 February, the military quickly mobilised to key NLD leaders, including Suu Kyi, President Win Nyunt, and 400 MP-elects, who were all in Naypyidaw to be sworn into office the following day. On 4 February 70 NLD MPs took an oath of office, in clear defiance of the coup. In the succeeding weeks, the military junta continued arresting hundreds of NLD members, most of whom were arrested under the pretext of participating in anti-coup protests. , 1,232 NLD members have been jailed (including 80 MP-elects), while at least 84 NLD members have died in custody. The NLD rejected the military&#x27;s legal basis for the staging a coup.

Post-coup, NLD offices were occupied and raided by police authorities, starting on 2 February. Documents, computers and laptops were forcibly seized, and the NLD called these raids unlawful. On 9 February, police raided the NLD headquarters in Yangon. On 21 May 2021, the junta-controlled Union Election Commission (UEC) announced plans to permanently dissolve the NLD, though the junta later reversed this decision, with spokesman Zaw Min Tun saying that the NLD will decide whether to stand in the next general election. After the junta enacted a new electoral law in January 2023 designed to favor the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the military&#x27;s electoral proxy, the NLD announced it would not re-register as a political party and would not recognize the results of any election held by the junta. On 28 March 2023, the UEC dissolved the NLD, which, in turn, challenged the decision saying that the UEC has no legitimacy as the junta itself &quot;is by no means legal&quot;.

== Ideology and political positions ==
The party advocates a non-violent movement towards multi-party democracy in Myanmar, which was under military rule from 1962 to 2011. The party also claims to support human rights (including broad-based freedom of speech), the rule of law, and national reconciliation. The NLD is described as liberal, democratic-liberal, liberal-conservative, and social-liberal. The NLD supports populism and protectionist economic policies. Historically, the NLD has been a social-democratic party.

Aung San Suu Kyi also claimed amendments to the constitution of 2008, drafted with the input of the armed forces, such as the mandatory granting of 25% of seats in parliament to appointed military representatives, are undemocratic.

==Party symbols==
The party flag features the peacock, a prominent symbol of Myanmar. The dancing peacock (the peacock in courtship or in display of its feathers) was frequently featured in Burmese monarchic flags as well as other nationalist symbols in the country. The fighting peacock is associated with the decades-long democratic struggle against military dictatorship in the country. The latter closely resembles a green peafowl, as it has a tufted crest. The NLD party symbol is adopted from the Myanmar (Burmese) Student Union flag. This student union organised since the uprising against British colonial rule in Burma, years before the independence of Burma in 1948, had played a major political role in Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s late father Bogyoke Aung San (General Aung San) was one of the former presidents of the Rangoon University Student Union.

The party emblem is a traditional bamboo hat ().

<text>The Dukedoms of Richmond (in the peerage of England) and of Lennox (in the peerage of Scotland) have usually been held by the same person since 1623. In 1675, King Charles II created his illegitimate son Charles Lennox Duke of Richmond (created on 9 August 1675) and Duke of Lennox (created on 9 September 1675), and the two Dukedoms have since been held concurrently by Lennox&#x27;s descendants. Since 1734 he has also held the Dukedom of Aubigny (in the peerage of France). Since 1876 he has also held the Dukedom of Gordon (in the peerage of the United Kingdom).

<text>120 (one hundred [and] twenty) is the natural number following 119 and preceding 121.

In the Germanic languages, the number 120 was also formerly known as &quot;one hundred&quot;. This &quot;hundred&quot; of six score is now obsolete but is described as the [[long hundred]] or great hundred in historical contexts.

==In mathematics==
120 is 
* the factorial of 5, i.e., formula_1.
* the fifteenth triangular number, as well as the sum of the first eight triangular numbers, making it also a tetrahedral number. 120 is the smallest number to appear six times in Pascal&#x27;s triangle (as all triangular and tetragonal numbers appear in it). Because 15 is also triangular, 120 is a doubly triangular number. 120 is divisible by the first five triangular numbers and the first four tetrahedral numbers. It is the eighth hexagonal number.
* The 10th highly composite, the 5th superior highly composite, superabundant, and the 5th colossally abundant number. It is also a sparsely totient number. 120 is also the smallest highly composite number with no adjacent prime number, being adjacent to formula_2 and formula_3 It is also the smallest positive multiple of six not adjacent to a prime.
* 120 is the first multiply perfect number of order three (&quot;a 3-perfect&quot; or &quot;triperfect number&quot;). The sum of its factors (including one and itself) sum to 360, exactly three times 120. Perfect numbers are order two (&quot;2-perfect&quot;) by the same definition.
* 120 is the sum of a twin prime pair (59 + 61) and the sum of four consecutive prime numbers (23 + 29 + 31 + 37), four consecutive powers of two (8 + 16 + 32 + 64), and four consecutive powers of three (3 + 9 + 27 + 81).
*120 is divisible by the number of primes below it (30). However, there is no integer that has 120 as the sum of its proper divisors, making 120 an untouchable number.
* The sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function formula_4 over the first nineteen integers is 120.
* As 120 is a factorial and one less than a square (formula_5), it—with 11—is one of the few Brown number pairs. 
*120 appears in Pierre de Fermat&#x27;s modified Diophantine problem as the largest known integer of the sequence 1, 3, 8, 120. Fermat wanted to find another positive integer that, when multiplied by any of the other numbers in the sequence, yields a number that is one less than a square. Leonhard Euler also searched for this number. He failed to find an integer, but he did find a fraction that meets the other conditions: formula_6.
*The internal angles of a regular hexagon (one where all sides and angles are equal) are all 120 degrees.

==In science==
In electrical engineering, each line of the three-phase system are 120 degrees apart from each other.

Three soap films meet along a Plateau border at 120° angles. 

==In religion==
* The age at which Moses died (Deut. 34:7).
** By extension, in Jewish tradition, to wish someone a long life, one says, &quot;Live until 120&quot;
* In astrology, when two planets in a person&#x27;s chart are 120 degrees apart from each other, this is called a trine. This is supposed to bring good luck to the person&#x27;s life.

==In other fields==
120 is also:
* TT scale, a scale for model trains, is 1:120.
* The Standard AC Voltage in US, Canada, Mexico and some other countries.

<text>Friedrich Richard Rudolf Schlechter (16 October 1872 – 16 November 1925) was a German taxonomist, botanist, and author of several works on orchids.

He went on botanical expeditions in Africa, Indonesia, New Guinea, South and Central America and Australia.

His vast herbarium was destroyed during the bombing of Berlin in 1945.

== Early life ==

Rudolf Schlechter was born on 16 October 1872 in Berlin, the third of six children. His father Hugo Schlechter was a lithographer. After finishing school at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium he started a horticulture education, first at a gardening market, later at the University of Berlin garden. There he worked as an assistant till the autumn of 1891. His brother was Max Schlechter (1874–1960), was a German trader and collector of natural history specimens.

==Career==

Schlechter began his career of botanical fieldwork by leaving Europe in 1891 to journey to Africa and subsequently across Indonesia and Australia. Throughout his career he has focused on expanding his research collection of orchids. He was a leader of expeditions in German Africa, investigating the Caoutchouc industry, but continually collecting plant specimens. He also lived extensively in German New Guinea in the first decade of the new century. Before World War I he settled in Berlin, marrying his wife Alexandra Schlechter and becoming curator of Berlin&#x27;s botanical garden in Dahlem. He is estimated to have proposed one thousand new species in the family Orchidaceae alone. In his 1901-1902 expedition he discovered 230 orchid species, while on his 1907-1910 expedition he discovered 1,100 additional orchid species.

<doc id="410582" wikidata="Q5148103" url="?curid=410582" title="Colonel By Secondary School">
<text>Colonel By Secondary School is a high school in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is a non-semestered school, and was the only English public school in Ottawa that offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma programme until Merivale High School began its IB programme in September 2019. Colonel By has a reptuation locally and provincially as an academically rigorous school. In the 2018–19 school year, it was ranked the sixth best secondary school in Ontario by the Fraser Institute.

==History==
Colonel By Secondary School was unveiled on March 10, 1972. The school was designed by Craig and Kohler architects with P.E. Brule Co. Ltd. contractors. The school was erected by the Carleton Board of Education. The school is dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel John By. J.L. McDonald served as the first principal of Colonel By Secondary School.

Colonel By Secondary School was named for Lieutenant Colonel John By, the Royal Engineers officer who supervised the building of Ottawa&#x27;s Rideau Canal and 1826–1832 and founded Bytown. A historical plaque located on the grounds of Colonel By Secondary School states, &quot;Colonel John By (1779–1836) was born and educated in England and first came to Canada in 1802. As a member of the Royal Engineers, he worked on the first small locks on the St. Lawrence River as well as the fortifications of Quebec. He returned to England in 1811 and fought in the peninsular War, but came back to Canada in 1826 to spend five summers heading the construction of the Rideau Canal, the 200 km long waterway which now connects Ottawa and Kingston. This formidable task included the building of about 50 dams and 47 locks, without the aid of modern equipment. But the amazing feat was never recognized in Colonel By&#x27;s own lifetime, and he died three years after its completion, never imagining that many thousands of Canadians would greatly admire and value his achievement in the centuries to come. Colonel By&#x27;s attributes of courage, determination, and diligence, inspire us
to emulate him, in the hopes that we too may somehow serve our country in a way which will benefit future generations.&quot;

==Academics==

===International Baccalaureate Programme===
Colonel By Secondary School offers the IB Diploma Programme, a pre-university course of studies offered to students over a two-year period from grade 11 to 12. Preparation for the challenge of the IB Diploma is begun in grade 9 and grade 10 through the enrichment and acceleration of various courses.

All successful recipients of the IB Diploma also receive their Ontario Secondary School Diploma.

===Cougar Vision===
Cougar Vision is a high school digital television station that provides coverage of school activities founded in 1999. It is Canada&#x27;s first all‐digital high school television station, commercial‐free educational programming through &quot;Cable in the Classroom&quot;.

=== Mathematics ===
Colonel By has had a history of strong math students who have performed well on national math contests administered by the University of Waterloo, as well as other local and national mathematics contests. For instance, in the 2009 Grade 9 Pascal&#x27;s Math Contest, Colonel By came first in the city and fifth in Canada. However, its prominence in Olympiad mathematics has been more limited, with few outstanding results on the Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge that have warranted invitation to the Canadian Mathematical Olympiad.

This changed in the 2008–2009 school year with the arrival of freshman James Rickards. Despite his youth, he received an invitation to write the 2009 Canadian Mathematical Olympiad and scored in the 3rd division. His arrival coincided with the school registering for its first writing of the American Mathematics Competitions (a lobbying effort by the senior students at the time that was finally granted). Over half the students who wrote the AMC qualified for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination. James Rickards was the sole participant who went on to receive an invitation to write the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad.

In the 2009–2010 school year, James Rickards continued to represent Colonel By on the national scale as a sophomore. He placed 2nd in the 2010 Canadian Mathematical Olympiad, outperforming returning members of the 2009 Canadian International Mathematical Olympiad team. Surprisingly, the Canadian Mathematical Society did not invite James Rickards to the 2010 Canadian IMO team, making him the first student in over a decade to have placed 2nd on the CMO, but not to have been announced a member of the IMO team. Nonetheless, in 2012, James Rickards was announced as a member of the Canadian IMO team, making him the first Colonel By student in history to have received said honour.

=== Computer Science ===
Colonel By has produced students who have performed well on the national CCC, administered by the University of Waterloo. Notably, Zeyu Chen achieved a perfect 75/75 on the CCC Senior and was invited to the CCO in 2021, where he achieved a Silver medal. Zeyu Chen is also known for his performance on Advent of Code (AoC), in which he solidified places 43rd (2020) and 37th (2021) out of over 200 000 participants.

== Music and arts ==

=== Music ===
Colonel By is also home to the &quot;C-Flats&quot;, Colonel By&#x27;s award-winning vocal jazz ensemble. The ensemble won the gold award as well as 1st place standing in the vocal jazz category of the New York City Heritage Festival in 2014, and were invited to perform at Carnegie Hall. The C-Flats were also given the opportunity to perform at the National Day of Honour on Parliament Hill in May 2014.

Colonel By also has many award-winning jazz and concert bands that have performed and won awards at a variety of music festivals including the National Capital Region MusicFest and MusicFest Canada.

=== Theatre ===
Many students from Colonel By Secondary School participate in Canada&#x27;s Capital Cappies, a theatrical club that involves putting together a play that is to be evaluated by several judges from across Ottawa. In 2012, Colonel By won the Cappies awards for Top Critic Team, Top Female Critic, Top Male Critic, and Featured Actor in a Play. In 2019, the school&#x27;s production of Chicago (musical) won Cappie awards for Female Lead Actor in a Musical, Best Song, and Best Orchestra. In 2023, the Cappies team (Zoe Whitlock, Safya Khan, Calia Hare, Amelia Alam, Ishita Goswami and Samuel Khosla) was nominated for Best School. Safya Khan, Samuel Khosla, Zoe Whitlock and Amelia Alam were all also nominated for best Junior Critic. 

==Athletics==
Colonel By competed at OFSAA for a few ski and snowboarding events in the 2006/2007 season. In addition, the Colonel By Badminton team has done well in Junior and Senior events.The Colonel By Nordic Ski team has also done well in the past finishing 4th last year in Junior Combined and now looking for the NCSSAA championships for the Senior Boys. The Varsity Girl&#x27;s Waterpolo team is the two year running NCSSAA champions in 2007 and 2008 and placed second in 2006. The Colonel By rugby teams are known throughout the city, with the Varsity Girls&#x27; Team winning the NCSSAA championship in the 2011 season and placing among the top teams in previous years.

Soccer for Colonel By proved tone successful once again in 2015, as both the senior and junior girls teams were seen winning the championship in their tiers, tier 1 and tier 2, respectively.

===Track and field===
Colonel By is known for its recent surge of notable athletes in track and field. Four of Colonel By&#x27;s athletes who competed in the 2007 OFSAA Track and Field Championships in Ottawa won medals (two gold, one silver and one bronze). Putting this into perspective, excluding this year, there has only been three athletes from eastern Ottawa from the past three years that have won medals in OFSAA.

One Colonel By&#x27;s gold medalists in 2007, 15-year-old Oluwasegun Makinde, set a new junior provincial record in the men&#x27;s 200m running a personal best of 21.74 seconds, demolishing the old record of 22.75. He attended the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics in the Czech Republic that summer. Footage of the record-breaking 200m finals can be seen here In his final year, Oluwasegun set the senior provincial record in the men&#x27;s 200m running a personal best of 20.99 seconds. Footage of the record-breaking 200m finals can be seen here. He opted to not take a victory lap and went off to studies in university. Since then, he has had continued success, including the opportunity to run in the same relay race against Usain Bolt.

The track and field team has continued to progress and in 2010, it sent an Ottawa school board best 19 athletes and 5 relay teams to OFSAA.

===Swimming===
In 2008, Nathan Lam and Brian Chen tied for first place in the junior boys&#x27; 100-metre freestyle with a time of 58.48 seconds at the National Capital Secondary School Athletic Association swimming championships.

In 2011, Nathan Lam, Kashtin Patterson, Cody Lombardo and Brian Chen placed eighth in the senior boys&#x27; 4x50-metre freestyle relay at the Ontario Federal of School Athletic Association short-course swimming championships in Toronto.

== Clubs and fundraising ==

The Colonel By Open Eyes club hosts the Community Pancake Breakfast, an annual fundraising event in the community.

=== Reach for the Top and Quizbowl ===
The Colonel By Reach for the Top team won provincials in 2001, and has attended Reach for the Top and Quiz Bowl events consistently. The Reach for the Top team at Colonel By participated in provincials in 2014, coming in the top ten. Colonel By&#x27;s Quiz Bowl team has also consistently achieved success, winning the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 Quiz Bowl Provincial Championships.

<text>In ballroom dancing (and in some other types of partner dance), directions of progressive movement, in particular directions of steps, can be indicated either in relation to the room or in relation to the body position. Directions of turns, although there are only two of them, may also be indicated in several ways.

== Directions of progressive movement ==
===Basic directions of movement with respect to the room===

Dancers can align their bodies and move in any of these directions:
* line of dance (LOD)
* against LOD
* center (C)
* wall (W)
* diagonal center (DC)
* diagonal wall (DW)
* diagonal center against LOD (DC against LOD)
* diagonal wall against LOD (DW against LOD)

These directions may be taken either &quot;facing&quot; if the dancer&#x27;s feet are pointing in the direction of the movement, or &quot;backing&quot; if the dancer&#x27;s feet are oriented in the opposite direction and the dancer is moving backwards with respect to their body. For example, &quot;backing DC against LOD&quot; means that a dancer is moving diagonally to the center against the line of dance, but as they are dancing backwards, the feet (and, roughly, the body) are pointing diagonally to the wall.

The term &quot;pointing&quot; refers explicitly to the direction the feet are pointing, which is useful if they are not, or not yet, aligned with the orientation of the body. For example, a dancer can be pointing DW while facing the wall.

===Basic directions of step with respect to body position===
These are described in one of the following ways.

* With respect to the line of the supporting foot, the next step may be placed
** in one of the primary directions:
*** forward,
*** back,
*** side(ways),
** in a diagonal line:
*** diagonally forward,
*** diagonally back,
** in a hybrid diagonal:
*** forward and slightly leftward (for the left foot) or rightward (for the right foot)
*** side(ways) and slightly forward
*** side(ways) and slightly back
*** back and slightly leftward (for the left foot) or rightward (for the right foot)
** in contra body movement position (CBMP):
*** forward in CBMP (i.e., the moving foot is placed directly in front of the supporting foot),
*** forward and across in CBMP (i.e., the moving foot crosses in front of the supporting foot),
*** back in CBMP,
*** back and across in CBMP.
* By clock: The leader (man) is said to face 12 o&#x27;clock immediately before a figure starts. Then directions can be described by saying, for example, that the direction of the second step is 3 o&#x27;clock, and the direction of the third step is between 4 and 5 o&#x27;clock.
* By compass points: Assuming that the dancer faces North at any moment, one may say, e.g., &quot;take a step North-West&quot;.

== Directions of turns ==

Ballroom dancing distinguishes
* &quot;natural&quot; (that is, right or clockwise) and &quot;reverse&quot; (left or counter-clockwise) turns,
* &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; turns (not to be confused with a dancer being on the &quot;inside&quot; or on the &quot;outside&quot; of a turn).

===Natural vs. reverse turns ===

The term &quot;natural turn&quot; describes a right or clockwise turn of the dance couple. This usage originated from the names of waltz moves and was transferred to other, similar dances.

A commonly stated theory of the origin of the term is that considering the right-shifted position in a couple (even more pronounced in older times) and the counter-clockwise direction of travel along the line of dance, the right turns are easier to perform, they are more &quot;natural&quot;. This is especially true at the corners of the dance floor: the amount of the right turn is effectively only of a full turn, and the amount of the left turn is effectively as much as , because the LOD changes its direction by 90 degrees to the left (CCW).

The partner dancing forward is said to be on the &quot;outside&quot; of the turn, having the longer way to move, and the partner dancing backward is on the &quot;inside&quot; of the turn.

===Inside vs. outside turns===
The terms &quot;inside turn&quot; and &quot;outside turn&quot; apply only to an individual turn of a partner, not to a turn of a couple. They occur in Latin dances and in American style. An &quot;inside turn&quot; is a turn that begins with the held hands (often the leader&#x27;s left and the follower&#x27;s right) moving toward the &quot;inside&quot; of the couple (along the imaginary line between the centers of the partners); an &quot;outside turn&quot; is the opposite. The turns may be performed in numerous ways and using different handholds. In dances such as swing and salsa, &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; turns typically refer to underarm turns performed by the follower. In these dances the follower&#x27;s right arm is normally used to lead a turn (most commonly by the leader&#x27;s left arm, but sometimes by the leader&#x27;s right arm when a cross-hand or &quot;handshake&quot; position is used), an inside turn is normally a left (counter-clockwise) turn, while an outside turn is a right (clockwise) turn. However, if the follower&#x27;s left arm is used to initiate the turn, the intended direction of turning may be opposite.

&quot;Inside turn&quot; is most intuitively clear if initially the couple is in an open single-handhold position facing each other, and the name corresponds to the direction of the lead. To lead the inside turn, the leader moves the follower&#x27;s arm inside, and conversely for the outside turn. In other positions the term is not so clear, therefore in some dances, some prefer to use this term according to its usage in ballet, based on footwork rather than arm style. In ballet, when describing pirouettes, an &quot;outward&quot; (en dehors) turn is the turn in the direction towards the working leg. Accordingly, an &quot;inward&quot; (en dedans) turn is the turn in the direction towards the support leg. See also rond de jambe.

The latter definition is unambiguous, but in other contexts it is only applicable to a single footstep. For example, according to this definition, chaînés turns are alternating inside and outside turns, although the direction of the rotation is the same. Therefore, it is common to name the turning figure according to the direction of the first turning step.

<doc id="410586" wikidata="Q128058" url="?curid=410586" title="Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis)">
<text>The Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, also known as the Saint Louis Cathedral or the New Cathedral, is a Catholic cathedral in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. Completed in 1914, it is the mother church of the Archdiocese of St. Louis and the seat of Archbishop Mitchell T. Rozanski. The cathedral is named for Saint Louis and was designated a basilica by Pope John Paul II in 1997.

The cathedral was built as a replacement for the previous cathedral, the Basilica of Saint Louis, King of France, located along the Mississippi River. Although workers began clearing ground for the building on May 1, 1907, dedication of the cathedral and its first Mass did not take place until October 18, 1914, when the superstructure was complete. Consecration of the church took place more than a decade later on June 29, 1926. The church is known for its large mosaic installation (which is one of the largest in the Western Hemisphere), and for its burial crypts.

==History==
Planning for the cathedral began under the authority of Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick in the 1870s and 1880s, and a fund was created for the construction of the building by Archbishop John Joseph Kain. A formal organization promoting the new cathedral was created on April 28, 1871, and among the members of the St. Louis Cathedral Building Association were Archbishop Kenrick, Bishop Patrick John Ryan, and a variety of local businessmen. Initial site selection indicated that the new cathedral would be built on a city block bounded by 22nd and 23rd streets, and by Pine and Chestnut streets, at a location east of the actual construction site.

However, the initiative for construction was only begun after the elevation of Archbishop John J. Glennon. The architecture firm of Barnett, Haynes &amp; Barnett was selected, and Thomas P. Barnett led the design team for the project. A ceremony was conducted on May 1, 1907, for the groundbreaking of the site, and a formal laying of the building&#x27;s cornerstone took place on October 18, 1908. By 1914, enough of the building was complete for a dedication ceremony, yet full consecration did not take place until June 29, 1926. Even after consecration, completion of the cathedral&#x27;s mosaics was not accomplished until 1988.

On December 20, 1943, a Solemn Pontifical Mass of Requiem was offered for Butch O&#x27;Hare, US Navy fighter pilot and Medal of Honor winner.

The grounds of the cathedral also contain the distinctive circular Chancery Building, , designed by the Peruvian-American modernist architect Wenceslaus Sarmiento.

==Mosaics==

In 1912, installation of mosaics in the interior began. Completed in 1988, the mosaics collectively contain 41.5 million glass tesserae pieces in more than 7,000 colors. Covering , it is the largest mosaic collection in the world outside Russia.
While the mosaics in the side chapels and sanctuary walls were designed and installed by Tiffany Studios, the mosaics in the main cathedral areas were designed by August Oetken. Installation of the mosaics was completed by dozens of artisans, including Hildreth Meiere, Ravenna Mosaic, Inc., and especially the father and son team, Paul and Arno Heuduck, who worked on the mosaic for nearly their entire working lives, and Emil Frei, Inc., of St. Louis. The narthex of the church depicts the life of King Louis IX of France, namesake of the city and church, the rear dome includes mosaics of significant archdiocesan events, while the main dome by Jan Henryk de Rosen depicts Biblical scenes from both the Old Testament and New Testament.

==Crypts and museum==
The church basement contains a museum dedicated to the mosaics in the church as well as to some of the other artifacts found within the cathedral. Also in the church undercroft is a chapel dedicated to the souls of former leaders of the Archdiocese. Currently, Cardinals John J. Glennon, Joseph Ritter, and John Carberry, as well as Archbishop John L. May, are buried in the cathedral&#x27;s crypt.

==&quot;The Angel of Harmony&quot;==

In 1999, a 14-foot high, welded stainless steel sculpture by Wiktor Szostalo was installed on the side lawn of the church. The sculpture was a gift from Adelaide Schlafly in memory of her late husband, Daniel Schlafly, a Catholic layman who was dedicated to the cause of racial justice and peace. It features a winged angel with African-American features, standing behind three children with Hispanic, Asian and European features, playing a song of peace on their instruments. The statue&#x27;s base is of granite and is inscribed with quotations from the New Testament, Pope John Paul II, and Martin Luther King Jr. The sculpture emphasizes a theme of harmony, peace, and racial justice, according to Auxiliary Bishop Edward Braxton, who suggested the project to Archbishop Justin Rigali.

The statue was vandalized and destroyed by a 35-year-old man, who tampered with construction equipment being used for renovations on the cathedral on September 17, 2024. The man was arrested and being held without bond for first degree tampering, first degree property damage, unlawful use of a weapon, as he was suspected of firing into an unoccupied vehicle, and resisting arrest.

==The organ==

The cathedral has a large organ that was originally built by Geo. Kilgen and Son, Inc., in 1915. Originally, the organ had two four-manual (keyboard) organ consoles, one in the gallery with the organ, and another console behind the sanctuary. In 1946, Kilgen put a new organ into the cathedral. The 1946 organ had 77 ranks of pipes, 14 of which came from the older organ. In 1948, an Echo Organ from Carnegie Hall, New York City was installed in the cathedral. In 1984, the M. P. Moller organ company refurbished the organ.

In 1997 the Wicks Organ Company of nearby Highland, Illinois, began a restoration project. They added more ranks of pipes, which brought the organ to 96 ranks of pipes. The company also added some digital stops to the organ. A new four-manual organ console replaced the old Kilgen console behind the sanctuary, and the second gallery console was refurbished. Wicks also updated the organ&#x27;s electronics.

In the winter of 2002 the gallery organ was expanded, and a new dome division of pipes was added to the organ. The final step in the project, the replacement of the original gallery console (and a smaller, two-manual console that took its place) with a five-manual console was completed in 2010. The Ragen Organ Console, named for its donor, Professor Brian Abel Ragen, was taken from St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in New York City and completely restored. It is now possible to control every part of the organ from either the gallery console or the moveable sanctuary console.

The original Kilgen console was moved into the basement museum, and can be viewed by visitors. The gallery organ is featured on many of Saint Louis&#x27;s cultural tours.

<text>Maulana Ndabezitha Karenga (born Ronald McKinley Everett, July 14, 1941), previously known as Ron Karenga, is an American activist, author and professor of Africana studies, best known as the creator of the pan-African and African-American holiday of Kwanzaa.

Born in Parsonsburg, Maryland, to an African-American family, Karenga studied at Los Angeles City College and the University of California, Los Angeles. He was active in the Black Power movement of the 1960s, joining the Congress of Racial Equality and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. In 1965, Karenga and Hakim Jamal co-founded the black nationalist group US Organization, which became involved in violent clashes with the Black Panther Party by 1969. In 1971, he was convicted of felony assault, torture, and false imprisonment of women. He denied involvement and claimed the prosecution was political in nature. Karenga was imprisoned in California Men&#x27;s Colony until he received parole in 1975.

In 1966, Karenga notably created Kwanzaa, modeling the holiday after the African &quot;first fruit&quot; traditions. The rituals of the holiday promote African traditions, including the &quot;seven principles of African heritage&quot;. During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be a black alternative to Christmas. Karenga, a secular humanist, challenged the sanity of Jesus and declared Christianity a &quot;White religion&quot; that black people should shun. However, Karenga later changed his opinion, stating that Kwanzaa was not meant to provide people with an alternative to &quot;their own religion or religious holiday&quot;.

Karenga has been awarded two doctorates, one in Political Science in 1976 and one in Social Ethics in 1994. He currently chairs the Africana Studies Department at California State University, Long Beach, and has authored several books.

==Early life==
Karenga was born in Parsonsburg, Maryland, the 14th child and seventh son in the family. His father, Levi Everett, was a tenant farmer and Baptist minister who employed the family to work fields under an effective sharecropping arrangement. Karenga moved to Los Angeles in 1959, joining his older brother who was a teacher there, and attended Los Angeles City College. He became active with civil rights organizations Congress of Racial Equality and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, took an interest in African studies, and was elected as LACC&#x27;s first African-American student president.

After earning his associate degree, he matriculated into the University of California, Los Angeles and earned BA and MA degrees in political science. He studied Swahili, Arabic, and other African-related subjects. Among his influences at UCLA were Jamaican anthropologist and Negritudist Councill Taylor, who contested the Eurocentric view of alien cultures as primitive. During this period, he took the name &quot;Karenga&quot; (Swahili for &quot;keeper of tradition&quot;) and the title &quot;Maulana&quot; (Swahili-Arabic for &quot;master teacher&quot;).

==US Organization==

The Watts riots broke out when Karenga was a year into his doctoral studies. The Black Congress (&quot;BC&quot;) was formed as a community-rebuilding organization in the aftermath. Within the BC, a discussion group centered on black nationalist ideas, called the Circle of Seven, was formed, which included Hakim Jamal (a cousin of Malcolm X) and Karenga. The group published &quot;US Magazine&quot; (meaning &quot;Us black people&quot;) and in 1966 formed an organization called US. The organization joined in several community revival programs and was featured in press reports. Karenga cited Malcolm X&#x27;s Afro-American Unity program as an influence on US Organization&#x27;s work:

Malcolm was the major African American thinker that influenced me in terms of nationalism and Pan-Africanism. As you know, towards the end, when Malcolm is expanding his concept of Islam, and of nationalism, he stresses Pan-Africanism in a particular way. And he argues that, and this is where we have the whole idea that cultural revolution and the need for revolution, he argues that we need a cultural revolution, he argues that we must return to Africa culturally and spiritually, even if we can&#x27;t go physically. And so that&#x27;s a tremendous impact on US.

Karenga soon diverged from Malcolm X&#x27;s ideas on Black nationalism and took US in a direction more focused on promoting African culture. Jamal and other adherents to Malcolm X&#x27;s ideas left the group.

As racial disturbances spread across the country, Karenga appeared at a series of Black power conferences, joining other groups in urging the establishment of a separate political structure for African Americans. US developed a youth component with paramilitary aspects called the Simba Wachanga, which advocated and practiced community self-defense and service to the masses.

In 1966, Karenga founded the newspaper &quot;Harambee&quot;, which started as a newsletter for US and eventually became the newspaper for the Los Angeles Black Congress, an umbrella organization for several groups.

During the late 1960s, US Organization became bitter rivals with the Black Panther Party over their differing views on Black nationalism. The Federal Bureau of Investigation intensified this antipathy as part of its COINTELPRO operations, sending forged letters to each group which purported to be from the other group, so that each would believe that the other was publicly humiliating them. The rivalry came to a climax during 1969, with a series of armed confrontations and retaliatory shootings that left four Panthers dead, and more injured on both sides. A memorandum of the Los Angeles field office of the FBI dated May 26, 1970, confirmed that the surge of conflict suited their objectives and more would be encouraged:

According to Louis Tackwood, a former informant with the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Criminal Conspiracies Section and author of &quot;The Glass House Tapes&quot;, Ronald Karenga was knowingly provided financial, arms, and other support by LAPD, with Tackwood as liaison, for US operations against the Black Panthers. Karenga enjoyed a level of trust among figures in government, including LAPD Chief Thomas Reddin and California Governor Ronald Reagan.

==Kwanzaa==

Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 to be the first pan-African holiday. Karenga said his goal was to &quot;give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.&quot;

Kwanzaa is inspired by African &quot;first fruit&quot; traditions, and the name chosen is from Swahili, &quot;matunda ya kwanza.&quot; The rituals of the holiday promote African traditions and &quot;Nguzo Saba&quot;, the &quot;seven principles of African Heritage&quot; that Karenga described as &quot;a communitarian African philosophy&quot;:
* Umoja (unity)—To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.
* Kujichagulia (self-determination)—To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves.
* Ujima (collective work and responsibility)—To build and maintain our community together and make our brother&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s problems our problems and to solve them together.
* Ujamaa (cooperative economics)—To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.
* Nia (purpose)—To make our collective vocation the building and development of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.
* Kuumba (creativity)—To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.
* Imani (faith)—To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

==Criminal conviction and imprisonment==

In 1971, Karenga was sentenced to one to ten years in prison on counts of felony assault and false imprisonment. A May 14, 1971, article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the testimony of one of the women:

Deborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis&#x27; mouth and placed against Miss Davis&#x27; face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said. They also were hit on the heads with toasters.

Jones and Brenda Karenga testified that Karenga believed the women were conspiring to poison him, which Davis has attributed to a combination of ongoing police pressure and his own drug abuse.

Karenga denied any involvement in the torture, and argued that the prosecution was political in nature. He was imprisoned at the California Men&#x27;s Colony, where he studied and wrote on feminism, Pan-Africanism, and other subjects. The US Organization fell into disarray during his absence and was disbanded in 1974. After he petitioned several black state officials to support his parole on fair sentencing grounds, it was granted in 1975.

Karenga has declined to discuss the convictions with reporters and does not mention them in biographical materials. During a 2007 appearance at Wabash College, he again denied the charges and described himself as a former political prisoner.

==Later career==
After his parole, Karenga re-established the US Organization under a new structure. 

He was awarded his first PhD in leadership and human behavior in 1976 from United States International University (later merged into Alliant International University) for a dissertation titled &quot;Afro-American Nationalism: Social Strategy and Struggle for Community&quot;. In 1977, he formulated a set of principles called &quot;Kawaida&quot;, a Swahili term for . Karenga called on African-Americans to adopt his secular humanism and reject other practices as mythical.

He was also the director of the Kawaida Institute for Pan African Studies and the author of several books, including his &quot;Introduction to Black Studies&quot;, a comprehensive Black/African Studies textbook now in its fourth edition (2010), originally published in 1982. He is also known for having co-hosted, in 1984, a conference that gave rise to the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations. 

In 1994, he was awarded a second PhD in social ethics from the University of Southern California for a dissertation titled &quot;Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics.&quot; In 1995, he sat on the organizing committee and authored the mission statement of the Million Man March.

Karenga delivered a eulogy at the 2001 funeral service of New Black Panther Party leader Khalid Abdul Muhammad, praising him for his organizing activities and commitment to black empowerment. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Maulana Karenga on his list of &quot;100 Greatest African Americans&quot;.

As of 2023, Karenga chairs the Africana Studies Department at California State University, Long Beach.

<doc id="410593" wikidata="Q2942378" url="?curid=410593" title="Basilica of St. Louis, King of France">
<text>The Basilica of Saint Louis, King of France (), formerly the Cathedral of Saint Louis, and colloquially the Old Cathedral, is a Catholic church in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the first cathedral west of the Mississippi River and until 1844 the only parish church in St. Louis. It is one of two Catholic basilicas in St. Louis (with the current cathedral) and both are named for King Louis IX of France (the namesake of the city).

The current structure (built 1831–1834) is located near the historic riverfront of St. Louis. It is surrounded by Gateway Arch National Park. However, the church is not part of the park. Because of the historical significance of the church, it was left intact while all neighboring buildings were demolished to make way for the Gateway Arch and related park. Rev. Nicholas Smith serves as Rector.

The basilica serves as a personal parish church rather than a territorial parish church. It ranks 177th of 196 churches in number of Catholics per church in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. However, because of its historical significance (and its location along the Mississippi River near the iconic Arch), the basilica remains a popular church for marriage ceremonies in the archdiocese (ranking second of 196 churches) and a popular tourist destination.

==History==
===Previous structures===
When Pierre Laclède and Auguste Chouteau established the city of St. Louis, they dedicated a plot of land west of Laclède&#x27;s home for the purposes of the Catholic Church. The earliest Catholic records suggest that a tent was used by an itinerant priest in 1766, but by 1770 a small log house was built on the site. This building, consecrated by the Reverend Pierre Gibault, an itinerant priest, on June 24, 1770, was expanded in 1776 to include a log church. In spite of a more substantial structure, no priest permanently resided in the village of St. Louis until 1811.

These buildings began to be replaced in 1818 with a brick structure, on the orders of the Bishop Louis William Valentine Dubourg. The brick structure was designed by Gabriel Paul. During Dubourg&#x27;s tenure as bishop, many artifacts, paintings, and an organ were donated to the church. While the brick church was under construction, a cemetery was established near the building, in which many of the founders of St. Louis were interred. The current church was built on the ground of the original cemetery. Those buried in the original cemetery were either moved to “Second Catholic cemetery” or reinterred under the current church. There were no burials at original cemetery after 1828. Those moved to Second Catholic Cemetery and those buried after that were ordered removed in the mid-1850s, they were moved to Calvary Cemetery after 1854. The current church was completed and dedicated in 1834. (Forgotten but not Gone, Tour of St. Louis’ Earliest Cemetery and Where it Went - Landmarks Assn of St. Louis, Inc.)

Additionally, Dubourg was influential in the establishment of St. Louis Academy (which later developed as Saint Louis University) in a two-story brick building adjacent to the new church in 1818. Construction of the brick church was not complete until 1821.

===Construction===
In 1826, population growth prompted the establishment of the Diocese of St. Louis. The first bishop of the St. Louis diocese, Joseph Rosati, began construction of a new cathedral, now the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France, to mark this growth. The cornerstone of the church was laid by Rosati during a ceremony on August 1, 1831.

The church was designed and built by the architectural firm of Laveille and Morton, among the first architectural firms west of the Mississippi River north of New Orleans. Construction was complete by late 1834. On Sunday, October 26, 1834, the cathedral was consecrated at a ceremony featuring the local militia and parishioners.
After the elevation of the Diocese of St. Louis to archdiocese status in 1847, the cathedral became home to an early chapter of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, a Catholic charity for the indigent. Both Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick and St. Louis Mayor Bryan Mullanphy were counted among the founders of the chapter, initially dedicated to assisting immigrants at a time of waves of immigration from Ireland and Germany, but later expanding to all St. Louis residents.

The tradition of care for the poor and needy was carried on in the early 20th century after the appointment of the Reverend John Tannrath to head the church on September 5, 1915. Tannrath not only refurbished the rectory and church, but also reestablished a parish school for local immigrant children. He arranged care for disabled children and adults.

===Recent history===
Again due to the growth of the city, a larger church was consecrated in 1914 farther west of the current church, in the city&#x27;s Central West End neighborhood. This larger church, the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, continues to serve as the seat of the archbishop of St. Louis. To recognize the original cathedral&#x27;s significance, on January 27, 1961, Pope John XXIII designated it a basilica, giving it the present name, the Basilica of Saint Louis, King of France. Shortly after, in 1963, the church was renovated by the prominent St. Louis architectural firm Murphy and Mackey.

In 2015, the Basilica underwent a restoration, including:
* Repaired exterior limestone and sandstone
* Replaced the mullioned windows with energy efficient yet historically accurate glass in the original Gothic design
* Repaired the steeple, roofs, and gutters
* Restored the front doors
* Upgraded the parking lot, entrance pavers, and landscaping

The current parish serves the needs of local parishioners, described as &quot;few in number but strong in loyalty&quot;, along with working people and tourists. However, because of its location along the Mississippi River and near the Gateway Arch (which provide backdrops for wedding photos) the church is often used for weddings, only ranking behind St. Francis Xavier College Church at Saint Louis University in the number of Catholic marriages in the archdiocese.

==Design and artifacts==

Built in Greek Revival style, the church is noted for its marble altars, a painting of &quot;Saint Louis venerating the Crown of Thorns&quot; given by Louis XVIII, King of France and Navarre, and an accurate copy of the painting of the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; by Diego Velázquez installed in the church in the latter half of the twentieth century.

Engraved in gold over the entrance to the church are the words &quot;In honorem s. Ludovici. Deo uni et trino dicatum. A. MDCCCXXXIV&quot;, which translates as &quot;In honor of St. Louis. Dedicated to the one and triune God. A.D. 1834&quot;. Hebrew letters, intended to spell out the Tetragrammaton, are also inscribed in Hebrew above the engraving on the main entrance. An urban legend of unknown origin claims that &quot;the letter Heth was substituted for the letter He, so the inscription merely reads &quot;yachuch&quot;, which has no meaning in Hebrew&quot;; however, the letters in the inscription appear to indeed be He.

The church basement has a number of artifacts associated with the history of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Louis, including a bell given to the church by the governor of the territory of Louisiana during the early 19th century. Bishop Joseph Rosati, who ordered the construction of the church, is interred in a vault underneath the sanctuary.

<doc id="410596" wikidata="Q770935" url="?curid=410596" title="Alaska Airlines Flight 261">
<text>Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in Seattle, Washington, United States, with an intermediate stop at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, California. On January 31, 2000, the aircraft operating the route, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, crashed into the Pacific Ocean roughly north of Anacapa Island, California, following a catastrophic loss of pitch control. The accident killed all 88 on board: two pilots, three cabin crew members, and 83 passengers.

The subsequent investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that inadequate maintenance led to excessive wear and eventual failure of a critical flight control system during flight. The probable cause was stated to be &quot;a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly&#x27;s Acme nut threads.&quot; For their efforts to save the plane, both pilots were posthumously awarded the Air Line Pilots Association Gold Medal for Heroism.

==Background==

=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved in the accident was a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, serial number 53077, and registered as N963AS. The MD-83 was a longer-range version of the original MD-80 (itself an improved version of the DC-9) with higher weight allowances, increased fuel capacity, and more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-219 engines. The aircraft had logged 26,584 flight hours and 14,315 cycles since it was delivered in 1992.

===Crew===
The pilots of Flight 261 were both highly experienced pilots. Captain Ted Thompson, 53, had accrued 17,750 flight hours, and had more than 4,000 hours experience flying MD-80s. First Officer William &quot;Bill&quot; Tansky, 57, had accumulated 8,140 hours as first officer on the MD-80. Thompson had flown for Alaska Airlines for 18 years and Tansky for 15; neither pilot had been involved in an accident or incident prior to the crash. Both pilots lived in Greater Los Angeles area and had previous military experience — Thompson in the U.S. Air Force and Tansky in the U.S. Navy. Three Seattle-based flight attendants were also on board, completing the five-person crew.

===Passengers===
The five crew members and 47 of the passengers on board the plane were bound for Seattle. Of the remaining passengers, 30 were traveling to San Francisco; three were bound for Eugene, Oregon; and three passengers were headed for Fairbanks, Alaska. Of the passengers, one was Mexican and one was British, with all others being U.S. citizens.

At least 35 occupants of Flight 261 were connected in some manner with Alaska Airlines or its sister carrier Horizon Air, including 12 people directly employed by the company. As is common practice among airlines, employees can sit in seats that would otherwise have been left empty. Employees can also grant the same privilege to their family members or friends. Bouquets of flowers started arriving at the company&#x27;s headquarters in SeaTac, Washington, the day after the crash.

==== Notable passengers ====
* Jean Gandesbery, author of the book &quot;Seven Mile Lake: Scenes from a Minnesota Life&quot;, died alongside her husband, Robert.
* Cynthia Oti, an investment broker and financial talk show host at San Francisco&#x27;s KSFO-AM, was killed.
* Tom Stockley, wine columnist for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, died alongside his wife Margaret.
* Morris Thompson, commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Alaska from 1973 to 1976, died alongside his wife Thelma and daughter Sheryl.

== Accident flight ==
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 departed from Puerto Vallarta&#x27;s Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport at 13:37 PST (21:37 UTC), and climbed to its intended cruising altitude of flight level 310 (). The plane was scheduled to land at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) less than 4 hours later. Sometime before 15:49 (23:49 UTC), the flight crew contacted the airline&#x27;s dispatch and maintenance-control facilities in SeaTac, Washington, on a company radio frequency shared with operations and maintenance facilities at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), to discuss a jammed horizontal stabilizer and a possible diversion to LAX. The jammed stabilizer prevented the operation of the trim system, which would normally make slight adjustments to the flight control surfaces to keep the plane stable in flight. At their cruising altitude and speed, the position of the jammed stabilizer required the pilots to pull on their yokes with about of force to keep level. Neither the flight crew nor company maintenance could determine the cause of the jam. Repeated attempts to overcome the jam with the primary and alternate trim systems were unsuccessful.

During this time, the flight crew had several discussions with the company dispatcher about whether to divert to LAX or continue on as planned to SFO. Ultimately, the pilots chose to divert. Later, the NTSB found that while &quot;the flight crew&#x27;s decision to divert the flight to Los Angeles... was prudent and appropriate&quot;, &quot;Alaska Airlines dispatch personnel appear to have attempted to influence the flight crew to continue to San Francisco... instead of diverting to Los Angeles&quot;. Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcripts indicate that the dispatcher was concerned about the effect on the schedule (&quot;flow&quot;), should the flight divert.
At 16:09 (00:09 UTC), the flight crew successfully used the primary trim system to unjam the stuck horizontal stabilizer. Upon being freed, however, it quickly moved to an extreme &quot;nose-down&quot; position, forcing the aircraft into an almost vertical nosedive. The plane dropped from about to between in around 80 seconds. Both pilots struggled together to regain control of the aircraft, and only by pulling with 130 to 140 lb (580 to 620 N) on the controls did the flight crew stop the descent of the aircraft and stabilize the MD-83 at roughly .

Alaska 261 informed air traffic control (ATC) of their control problems. After the flight crew stated their intention to land at LAX, ATC asked whether they wanted to proceed to a lower altitude in preparation for the approach. The captain replied: &quot;I need to get down to about ten, change my configuration, make sure I can control the jet and I&#x27;d like to do that out here over the bay if I may.&quot; Later, during the public hearings into the accident, the request by the pilot not to fly over populated areas was mentioned. During this time, the flight crew considered, and rejected, any further attempts to correct the runaway trim. They descended to a lower altitude and started to configure the aircraft for landing at LAX.

Beginning at 16:19 (00:19 UTC), the CVR recorded the sounds of at least four distinct &quot;thumps&quot;, followed 17 seconds later by an &quot;extremely loud noise&quot;, as the overstrained jackscrew assembly failed completely and the jackscrew separated from the acme nut holding it in place. As a result, the horizontal stabilizer failed at and the aircraft rapidly pitched over into a dive while rolling to the left. The crippled plane had been given a block altitude, and several aircraft in the vicinity had been alerted by ATC to maintain visual contact with the stricken jet. These aircraft immediately contacted the controller. One pilot radioed, &quot;That plane has just started to do a big huge plunge.&quot; Another reported, &quot;Yes sir, ah, I concur. He is, uh, definitely in a nose down, uh, position, descending quite rapidly.&quot; ATC then tried to contact the plane. The crew of a SkyWest airliner reported, &quot;He&#x27;s, uh, definitely out of control.&quot; Although the CVR captured the co-pilot saying &quot;mayday&quot;, no radio communications were received from the flight crew during the final event.

The CVR transcript reveals the pilots&#x27; constant attempts for the duration of the dive to regain control of the aircraft. After the jackscrew failed, the plane pitched -70° and was rolling over to the left. Performing an upset recovery maneuver, the captain commanded to &quot;push and roll, push and roll,&quot; managing to increase the pitch to -28°, he stated, &quot;ok, we are inverted...and now we gotta get it.&quot; Over the next minute, completely inverted and still diving at a -9 degree pitch, the crew struggled to roll the plane, with the captain calling to &quot;push push push...push the blue side up,&quot; &quot;ok now let&#x27;s kick rudder...left rudder left rudder&quot;, to which the copilot responded, &quot;I can&#x27;t reach it&quot;. The captain then replied, &quot;ok right rudder...right rudder,&quot; followed 18 seconds later by &quot;gotta get it over again...at least upside down we&#x27;re flying.&quot;

Despite the attempt to fly the plane inverted, which almost entirely arrested its descent, the aircraft had lost too much altitude in the dive and was far beyond recovery. A few seconds before 16:21 (00:21 UTC), Flight 261 hit the Pacific Ocean at high speed between the coastal city of Port Hueneme, California, and Anacapa Island. At this time, pilots from aircraft flying in the vicinity reported in, with one pilot saying, &quot;and he&#x27;s just hit the water.&quot; Another reported, &quot;Ah, yes sir, he, ah, he, ah, hit the water. He&#x27;s, ah, down.&quot; The aircraft was destroyed by the impact forces, and all occupants on board were killed by blunt-force impact trauma.

==Investigation==
===Wreckage recovery and analysis===
The USS &quot;Cleveland&quot; (LPD-7) assisted in recovery operations.
Using side-scan sonar, remotely operated vehicles, and a commercial fishing trawler, workers recovered about 85% of the fuselage (including the tail section) and a majority of the wing components. In addition, both engines, as well as the flight data recorder (FDR) and CVR were retrieved. All wreckage recovered from the crash site was unloaded at the Seabees&#x27; Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme, California, for examination and documentation by NTSB investigators. Both the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew (also referred to as &quot;acme screw&quot;) and the corresponding acme nut, through which the jackscrew turns, were found. The jackscrew was constructed from case-hardened steel and is long and in diameter. The acme nut was constructed from a softer copper alloy containing aluminum, nickel, and bronze. As the jackscrew rotates, it moves up or down through the (fixed) acme nut, and this linear motion moves the horizontal stabilizer for the trim system. Upon subsequent examination, the jackscrew was found to have metallic filaments wrapped around it which were later determined to be the remains of the acme nut thread.

The later analysis estimated that 90% of the thread in the acme nut had already worn away previously and that it had finally stripped out during the flight while en route to San Francisco. Once the thread had failed, the horizontal stabilizer assembly was subjected to aerodynamic forces that it was not designed to withstand, leading to the complete failure of the stabilizer assembly. Based on the time since the last inspection of the jackscrew assembly, the NTSB determined that the acme nut thread had deteriorated at per 1,000 flight hours, much faster than the expected wear of per 1,000 flight‑hours. Over the course of the investigation, the NTSB considered a number of potential reasons for the substantial amount of deterioration of the nut thread on the jackscrew assembly, including the substitution by Alaska Airlines (with the approval of the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas) of Aeroshell 33 grease instead of the previously approved lubricant, Mobilgrease 28. The use of Aeroshell 33 was found not to be a factor in this accident. Insufficient lubrication of the components was also considered as a reason for the wear. Examination of the jackscrew and acme nut revealed that no effective lubrication was present on these components at the time of the accident. Ultimately, the lack of lubrication of the acme-nut thread and the resultant excessive wear were determined to be the direct causes of the accident. Both of these circumstances resulted from Alaska Airlines&#x27; attempts to cut costs.

===Identification of passengers===
Due to the extreme impact forces, only a few bodies were found intact, and none were visually identifiable. All passengers were identified using fingerprints, dental records, tattoos, personal items, and anthropological examination.

===Inadequate lubrication and end-play checks===
The investigation then proceeded to examine why scheduled maintenance had failed to adequately lubricate the jackscrew assembly. In interviews with the Alaska Airlines mechanic at SFO, who last performed the lubrication, the task was shown to take about one hour, whereas the aircraft manufacturer estimated the task should take four hours. This and other evidence suggested to the NTSB that &quot;the SFO mechanic who was responsible for lubricating the jackscrew assembly in September 1999 did not adequately perform the task.&quot; Laboratory tests indicated that the excessive wear of the jackscrew assembly could not have accumulated in just the four-month period between the September 1999 maintenance and the accident flight. Therefore, the NTSB concluded, &quot;more than just the last lubrication was missed or inadequately performed.&quot;

A periodic maintenance inspection called an &quot;end-play check&quot; was used to monitor wear on the jackscrew assembly. The NTSB examined why the last end-play check on the accident aircraft in September 1997 did not uncover excessive wear. The investigation found that Alaska Airlines had fabricated tools to be used in the end-play check that did not meet the manufacturer&#x27;s requirements. Testing revealed that the nonstandard tools (&quot;restraining fixtures&quot;) used by Alaska Airlines could result in inaccurate measurements and that if accurate measurements had been obtained at the time of the last inspection, these measurements possibly would have indicated the excessive wear and the need to replace the affected components.

===Extension of maintenance intervals===
Between 1985 and 1996, Alaska Airlines progressively increased the period between both jackscrew lubrication and end-play checks, with the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Since each lubrication or end-play check subsequently not conducted had represented an opportunity to adequately lubricate the jackscrew or detect excessive wear, the NTSB examined the justification of these extensions. In the case of extended lubrication intervals, the investigation could not determine what information, if any, was presented by Alaska Airlines to the FAA prior to 1996. Testimony from an FAA inspector regarding an extension granted in 1996 was that Alaska Airlines submitted documentation from McDonnell Douglas as justification for their extension.

End-play checks were conducted during a periodic comprehensive airframe overhaul process called a C-check. Testimony from the director of reliability and maintenance programs of Alaska Airlines was that a data-analysis package based on the maintenance history of five sample aircraft was submitted to the FAA to justify the extended period between C-checks. Individual maintenance tasks (such as the end-play check) were not separately considered in this extension. The NTSB found, &quot;Alaska Airlines&#x27; end-play check interval extension should have been, but was not, supported by adequate technical data to demonstrate that the extension would not present a potential hazard.&quot;

===FAA oversight===
A special inspection conducted by the NTSB in April 2000 of Alaska Airlines uncovered widespread significant deficiencies that &quot;the FAA should have uncovered earlier.&quot; The investigation concluded, &quot;FAA surveillance of Alaska Airlines had been deficient for at least several years.&quot; The NTSB noted that in July 2001, an FAA panel determined that Alaska Airlines had corrected the previously identified deficiencies. However, several factors led the board to question &quot;the depth and effectiveness of Alaska Airlines corrective actions&quot; and &quot;the overall adequacy of Alaska Airlines&#x27; maintenance program.&quot;

Systemic problems were identified by the investigation into the FAA&#x27;s oversight of maintenance programs including inadequate staffing, its approval process of maintenance interval extensions, and the aircraft certification requirements.

===Aircraft design and certification issues===
The jackscrew assembly was designed with two independent threads, each of which was strong enough to withstand the forces placed on it. Maintenance procedures such as lubrication and end-play checks were to catch any excessive wear before it progressed to a point of failure of the system. The aircraft designers assumed that at least one set of threads would always be present to carry the loads placed on it; therefore, the effects of catastrophic failure of this system were not considered, and no &quot;fail-safe&quot; provisions were needed.

For this design component to be approved (&quot;certified&quot;) by the FAA without any fail-safe provision, a failure had to be considered &quot;extremely improbable&quot;. This was defined as &quot;having a probability on the order of 1 or less each flight hour&quot;. The accident showed that certain wear mechanisms could affect both sets of threads and that the wear might not be detected. The NTSB determined that the design of &quot;the horizontal stabilizer jackscrew assembly did not account for the loss of the acme-nut threads as a catastrophic single-point failure mode&quot;.

===Jackscrew design improvement===
In 2001, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognized the risk to its hardware (such as the Space Shuttle) attendant upon the use of similar jackscrews. An engineering fix developed by engineers of NASA and United Space Alliance promised to make progressive failures easy to see and thus complete failures of a jackscrew less likely.

===John Liotine===
In 1998, an Alaska Airlines mechanic named John Liotine, who worked in the Alaska Airlines maintenance center in Oakland, California, told the FAA that supervisors were approving records of maintenance that they were not allowed to approve or that indicated work had been completed when, in fact, it had not. Liotine began working with federal investigators by secretly audio recording his supervisors. On December 22, 1998, federal authorities raided an Alaska Airlines property and seized maintenance records. In August 1999, Alaska Airlines put Liotine on paid leave, and in 2000, Liotine filed a libel suit against the airline. The crash of AS261 became a part of the federal investigation against Alaska Airlines, because, in 1997, Liotine had recommended that the jackscrew and gimbal nut of the accident aircraft be replaced, but had been overruled by another supervisor. In December 2001, federal prosecutors stated that they were not going to file criminal charges against Alaska Airlines. Around that time, Alaska Airlines agreed to settle the libel suit by paying about $500,000; as part of the settlement, Liotine resigned.

==Conclusions==
In addition to the probable cause, the NTSB found these contributing factors:
*Alaska Airlines extended its lubrication interval for its McDonnell Douglas MD-80 horizontal stabilizer components based on McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s recommendation, and the FAA approved the extended schedule. This increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in the near complete deterioration of the jackscrew-assembly acme-nut threads. The extended lubrication interval was a direct cause of the excessive wear and contributed to the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 accident.
*Alaska Airlines extended the end-play check interval and the FAA approved the change. This allowed the acme-nut threads to deteriorate to the point of failure without the opportunity for detection.
*The absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut loss.
During the course of the investigation, and later in its final report, the NTSB issued 24 safety recommendations, covering maintenance, regulatory oversight, and aircraft design issues. More than half of these were directly related to jackscrew lubrication and end-play measurement. Also included was a recommendation that pilots were to be instructed that in the event of a flight-control system malfunction, they should not attempt corrective procedures beyond those specified in the checklist procedures, and in particular, in the event of a horizontal stabilizer trim-control system malfunction, the primary and alternate trim motors should not be activated, and if unable to correct the problem through the checklists, they should land at the nearest suitable airport.

In NTSB board member John J. Goglia&#x27;s statement for the final report, with which the other three board members concurred, he wrote:
==Aftermath==
After the crash, Alaska Airlines management said that it hoped to handle the aftermath in a manner similar to that conducted by Swissair after the Swissair Flight 111 accident. They wished to avoid the mistakes made by Trans World Airlines in the aftermath of the TWA Flight 800 accident, in other words, TWA&#x27;s failure to provide timely information and compassion to the families of the victims.

Steve Miletich of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote that the western portion of Washington, &quot;had never before experienced such a loss from a plane crash&quot;.

===Liability===

Both Boeing (who had acquired McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) and Alaska Airlines eventually accepted liability for the crash, and all but one of the lawsuits brought by surviving family members were settled out of court before going to trial. While the financial terms of settlements had not been officially disclosed, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported the total amount to be in excess of US$300 million, covered entirely by insurance. According to other sources, the individual settlements were &quot;anywhere from a couple million dollars up to $20 million&quot;, purportedly &quot;among the largest ever in an air disaster&quot;. Candy Hatcher of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote: &quot;Many lost faith in Alaska Airlines, a homegrown company that had taken pride in its safety record and billed itself as a family airline.&quot;

===Flight number===

As of 2024, Flight 261 no longer exists, and Alaska Airlines no longer operates the Puerto Vallarta–San Francisco–Seattle/Tacoma route. Alaska Airlines now flies from Puerto Vallarta–Seattle/Tacoma nonstop with Flights 1380 and 1411 and Puerto Vallarta—San Francisco nonstop with Flights 1369 and 1370. The airline retired the last of its MD-80s in 2008 and now uses Boeing 737s for these routes.

===Memorials===

Captain Thompson and First Officer Tansky were both posthumously awarded the Air Line Pilots Association Gold Medal for Heroism, in recognition of their actions during the emergency. The Ted Thompson/Bill Tansky Scholarship Fund was named in memory of the two pilots.

The victims&#x27; families approved the construction of a memorial sundial, designed by Santa Barbara artist James &quot;Bud&quot; Bottoms, which was placed at Port Hueneme on the California coast. The names of each of the victims are engraved on individual bronze plates mounted on the perimeter of the dial. The sundial casts a shadow on a memorial plaque at 16:22 each January 31.

Many residents of Seattle had been deeply affected by the disaster. As part of a memorial vigil in 2000, a column of light was beamed from the top of the Space Needle. Students and faculty at the John Hay Elementary School in Queen Anne, Seattle, held a memorial for four Hay students who were killed in the crash. In April 2001, John Hay Elementary dedicated the &quot;John Hay Pathway Garden&quot; as a permanent memorial to the students and their families who were killed on Flight 261. The City of Seattle public park Soundview Terrace was renovated in honor of the four Pearson and six Clemetson family members who were killed on board Flight 261 from the same Seattle neighborhood of Queen Anne. The park&#x27;s playground was named &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Playground&quot;, in memory of six-year-old Rachel Pearson, who was on board the MD-83 and who was often seen playing at the park.

===Attempted fraud===

Two victims were falsely named in paternity suits as the fathers of children in Guatemala in an attempt to gain insurance and settlement money. Subsequent DNA testing proved these claims to be false.

The crash has appeared in various advance-fee fraud (&quot;419&quot;) email scams, in which a scammer uses the name of someone who died in the crash to lure unsuspecting victims into sending money to the scammer by claiming the crash victim left huge amounts of unclaimed funds in a foreign bank account. The names of Morris Thompson and Ronald and Joyce Lake were used in schemes unrelated to them.

==In popular culture==
*In the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot;, the flight was featured in the season-one (2003) &quot;Cutting Corners&quot; episode (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatization was broadcast in the United States with the title &quot;Fatal Error&quot;. The flight was also included in a &quot;Mayday&quot; season-six (2007) &quot;Science of Disaster&quot; special titled &quot;Fatal Flaw&quot;, which was called &quot;Fatal Fix&quot; in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia. The crash was covered again (with an entirely new cast) in season 22, episode 5 of &quot;Mayday&quot;, titled &quot;Pacific Plunge&quot;.
* The film drama &quot;Flight&quot; (2012) featured an airplane crash of an aircraft resembling an MD-83, which flies inverted and ultimately crash lands, though the film&#x27;s version recorded just six fatalities (four passengers, two crew) of the 102 persons aboard. In the film, NTSB investigators determine the probable cause of this crash to be the fatigue of a jackscrew due to excess wear and poor maintenance. The final seconds of the CVR of Flight 261 indicates the plane stabilized and was flying inverted shortly before the crash, an event depicted in the film. Screenwriter John Gatins later explained that the film&#x27;s featured crash was &quot;loosely inspired&quot; by the events of Flight 261.

<text>Santa Catarina is a city in Santa Catarina Municipality in the state of Nuevo León, Mexico that is part of the Monterrey Metropolitan area.

==History==

The name of this city comes from the Catholic Saint Catherine of Alexandria.
The city of Santa Catarina was not &quot;founded&quot; in a traditional manner; at the beginning, it was only a resting point for travelers between Monterrey and Saltillo. The first recorded name was &quot;Estancia de Santa Catarina&quot; (Shelter of Santa Catarina).

During the French Invasion of Mexico in the second half of the 19th century, the president Benito Juárez spent some days in Santa Catarina while traveling to Monterrey, and it was during this time that he elevated its status to Village. The category of Village was maintained until 1979 when the state government elevated its status to City.

==Geography==
Santa Catarina is located about 15 kilometers southwest of central Monterrey. As of the Mexican census of 2005, its population was 259,202 in the city and 259,896 in the municipality. The city and municipality both rank sixth in population in the state. The municipality has an area of and includes numerous very small localities outside of the city itself.

Most of the National Park Cumbres of Monterrey, including the canyon of La Huasteca is located within Santa Catarina.

Also a certain portion of Cerro de las Mitras is located in Santa Catarina.

<doc id="410604" wikidata="Q1509918" url="?curid=410604" title="Swan song">
<text>The swan song (; ) is a metaphorical phrase for a final gesture, effort, or performance given just before death or retirement. The phrase refers to an ancient belief that swans sing a beautiful song just before their death while they have been silent (or alternatively not so musical) for most of their lifetime.

The belief, whose basis has been long debated, had become proverbial in ancient Greece by the 3rd century BC and was reiterated many times in later Western poetry and art. In reality, swans learn a variety of sounds throughout their lifetime; their sounds are more distinguishable during courting rituals and not correlated with death.

==Origin and description==
In Greek mythology, the swan was a bird consecrated to Apollo, and it was therefore considered a symbol of harmony and beauty and its limited capabilities as a singer were sublimated to those of songbirds.

Aesop&#x27;s fable of &quot;The Swan and the Goose&quot; incorporates the swan song legend as saving its life when it was caught by mistake instead of the goose but was recognized by its song. There is a subsequent reference in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Agamemnon&quot; from 458 BCE. In that play, Clytemnestra compares the dead Cassandra to a swan who has &quot;sung her last lament&quot;. 

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot;, the character of Socrates says that, although swans sing in early life, they do not do so as beautifully as before they die. He adds that there is a popular belief that the swans&#x27; song is sorrowful, but Socrates prefers to think that they sing for joy, having &quot;foreknowledge of the blessings in the other world&quot;. Aristotle noted in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; that swans &quot;are musical, and sing chiefly at the approach of death&quot;. By the third century BC the belief had become a proverb.

Ovid mentions the legend in &quot;The Story of Picus and Canens&quot;:
It is also possible that the swan song has some connection to the lament of Cycnus of Liguria at the death of his lover, Phaethon, the ambitious and headstrong son of Helios and Clymene. The name Cycnus is the Latinised form of the Greek, which means &quot;swan&quot;. Hyginus proposes in his &quot;Fabulae&quot; that the mournful Cycnus, who is transformed into a swan by the gods, joins the dirge of the amber-crying poplars, the Heliades, the half-sisters of the dead Phaethon, who also experienced a metamorphosis at the death of the reckless Phaethon.

==Ornithological accuracy==
The most familiar European swan, the mute swan (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;), although not actually mute, is known neither for musicality nor to vocalize as it dies. This has led some to criticize swan song beliefs since antiquity, one of the earliest being Pliny the Elder: in CE 77, &quot;Natural History&quot; (book 10, chapter xxxii: &quot;olorum morte narratur flebilis cantus, falso, ut arbitror, aliquot experimentis&quot;), states: &quot;observation shows that the story that the dying swan sings is false.&quot; Peterson et al. note that &quot;Cygnus olor&quot; is &quot;not mute but lacks bugling call, merely honking, grunting, and hissing on occasion.&quot;

However, the whooper swan (&quot;Cygnus cygnus&quot;), a winter visitor to parts of the eastern Mediterranean, possesses a &#x27;bugling&#x27; call, and has been noted for issuing a drawn-out series of notes as its lungs collapse upon expiry, both being a consequence of an additional tracheal loop within its sternum. This was proposed by naturalist Peter Pallas as the basis for the legend. Both mute and whooper swans appear to be represented in ancient Greek and Egyptian art.

The whooper swan&#x27;s nearest relatives, the trumpeter and tundra swans, share its musical tracheal loop. Zoologist D.G. Elliot reported in 1898 that a tundra swan he had shot and wounded in flight began a long glide down whilst issuing a series of &quot;plaintive and musical&quot; notes that &quot;sounded at times like the soft running of the notes of an octave&quot;.

==Later cultural references==
The notion that swans sing a final song before dying continued to influence Western culture into the early modern era. For instance, Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot; contains a reference to &quot;the Ialous swan, ayens his deth that singeth [the jealous swan, that sings at his death]&quot;. Leonardo da Vinci also mentioned the legend in his notebooks: &quot;The swan is white without spot, and it sings sweetly as it dies, that song ending its life.&quot;

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Portia exclaims &quot;Let music sound while he doth make his choice; / Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, / Fading in music.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;Othello&quot;, the dying Emilia exclaims, &quot;I will play the swan, / And die in music.&quot;

A well-known madrigal by Orlando Gibbons, &quot;The Silver Swan&quot;, states the legend thus:
Other poets who have taken inspiration from the legend include Alfred, Lord Tennyson, whose poem &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; is a poetic evocation of the &quot;wild swan&#x27;s death-hymn&quot;; Thomas Sturge Moore&#x27;s poem of the same name; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who quipped: &quot;Swans sing before they die— &#x27;t were no bad thing / Should certain persons die before they sing.&quot;

===Idiomatic usage===
The phrase &quot;swan song&quot; has also taken on a metaphorical sense, referring to the final work of a creative artist, especially when produced shortly before death, or more generally to any final performance or accomplishment. For example, &quot;Schwanengesang&quot; (&quot;Swan Song&quot;) is the title of a posthumously published collection of songs by Franz Schubert, written at the end of his life. It is the title usually given to Heinrich Schuetz&#x27; Opus 13 from 1671, the year before he died. The term is often applied in a similar way to the works of modern musicians, such as David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Blackstar&quot;, Johnny Cash&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Hurt&quot;, J Dilla&#x27;s &quot;Donuts&quot;, Queen&#x27;s &quot;Innuendo&quot; and Nirvana&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot;. 

A dramatic or notable achievement by an athlete just prior to their retirement, such as baseball player Derek Jeter&#x27;s walk-off hit in his final game at Yankee Stadium, might also be referred to as their &quot;swan song&quot;. An example, in the film industry, is represented by &quot;The Last Movie Star&quot;, Rolling Stone referred to the film as Burt Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;swan song&quot;. The film was one of Reynolds&#x27;s last film projects, and he died several months after the film&#x27;s release.
