<text>Hesse-Homburg was a state of the Holy Roman Empire and a sovereign member of the German Confederation, which consisted of the lordship of Homburg at the foot of the Taunus, which was then known as &quot;Die Höhe&quot; (&quot;the Heights&quot;). The reigning princes belonged to the Darmstadt line of the House of Hesse. It was created in 1622 by the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt to be ruled by one of his sons, but from 1622 to 1768 and again from 1806 to 1815, the territory was part of Hesse-Darmstadt. It was briefly divided into Hesse-Homburg and Hesse-Homburg-Bingenheim; but these parts were reunited in 1681. In 1815, it became a sovereign principality, expanded with the addition of Oberamt Meisenheim in the Rhineland to give a total area of 221 km². When the reigning princely family died out in March 1866, the territory returned to Hesse-Darmstadt, but the latter was forced to cede the territory to Prussia in September of the same year after it was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War.

==History==
=== Holy Roman Empire (1622–1806) ===
The landgraves of Hesse-Homburg were a cadet branch of the Darmstadt branch of the House of Hesse, which existed from 1622 until 1866. Hesse-Darmstadt, like many principalities, was theoretically inherited through primogeniture. However, in practice, the younger sons were often endowed with a piece of land. Thus, the first landgrave of Hesse-Homburg, Frederick I (1585-1638), the youngest son of George I, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt (1547-1609), received the territory of Homburg in 1622, after his brother Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt had fallen significantly behind with his appanage payments. Frederick I received the city and amt of Homburg before the heights &quot;with all prestige and authority&quot; but &quot;without princely power&quot; and allowed to draw his appanage payments from the incomes of Homburg. The treaty governing this was concluded on 6 March 1622 and Homburg was handed over to Frederick on 23 July 1622. The landgraves thus remained subordinate to the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt under Imperial law, owing it homage, for example. Darmstadt was obliged to pay Homburg 15,000 gulder annually, but generally did not manage to do so. The law of the time did not clearly distinguish between princely authority and a simple transfer of territory for economic purposes. Thus, Hesse-Homburg early began to seek independence. It succeeded in 1768, when a dynastic treaty was agreed, known as the &quot;Vergleichspunktuation&quot;, in which Hesse-Darmstadt waived its sovereignty over Hesse-Homburg. In this treaty, the territory received wide-ranging internal sovereignty, but whether Hesse-Homburg thereafter possessed Imperial immediacy is doubted by the historian , among others: &quot;Hesse-Darmstadt reserved for itself only the relationship with the Emperor and Empire; it represented Hesse-Homburg in the Reichstag and in the assembly of the Imperial circle and paid the Imperial and circle taxes for Homburg. Hesse-Homburg thus never possessed Imperial immediacy... Therefore, the incorporation of Homburg into... Hesse-Darmstadt between 1806 and 1816 can... probably not be called &#x27;mediatization&#x27;.&quot;

Landgrave Frederick II (1633-1708), the prince of Homburg &quot;with the silver leg,&quot; was notable as a Swedish and Brandenburger general, who followed a mercantalist economic policy and carried out numerous developmental projects, based on his experiences in the service of Brandenburg. These included the settlement of Huguenot colonists at Friedrichsdorf. The resulting economic prosperity is evidenced by the early Baroque Bad Homburg Castle.

It is notable that five landgraves (Frederick VI, Louis, Philip, Gustave, and Ferdinand) were members of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.

At the end of the Holy Roman Empire, Hesse-Homburg consisted of the settlements of , , , Friedrichsdorf, , Homburg, , Oberstedten, and half of . By a treaty signed on 26 April 1803, an exchange of territory between Hesse-Homburg and Nassau-Usingen was agreed, which granted the village of Kirdorf to Hesse-Homburg, in exchange for Espa, which had been acquired by Hesse-Homburg in 1785.

===German Confederation (1815-1866)===

Frederick V lost his lands in the German mediatisation of 1806, when Hesse-Homburg was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Hesse (Hesse-Darmstadt). But in 1815, the Congress of Vienna forced Hesse-Darmstadt to recognize the independence of Hesse-Homburg, which was increased by the addition of Meisenheim (176 km²), part of the former French département of Sarre, located on the left side of the Rhine some 80 km southwest of Homburg. 

Hesse-Homburg joined the German Confederation as a sovereign state on 7 July 1817. In 1848, the landgraviate had a population of 22,800 and a total land area of 430 km², thus making it one of the smallest states in the German Confederation. The landgraviate was the only principality that was not one of the founding members of the Confederation, apart from the Duchy of Limburg ruled by the King of the Netherlands (added in 1839) and the Duchy of Schleswig (1848-1851) ruled by the Danish king. The landgraviate supplied the Homburg Scouts battalion in the Federal Army of the new Confederation. This battalion was stationed at the in Bad Homburg. Hesse-Homburg was represented by the Grand Duchy of Hesse in the Inner Council of the Confederate Diet, but had a seat of its own on the Plenary Council. 

In 1833, baths were opened in Homburg, which brought unexpected wealth and attention to the landgraviate. A casino and gambling saloons soon opened, which also contributed greatly to the state&#x27;s burgeoning economy. Several legal overtures were made by the diet in an attempt to end gambling, but all attempts failed until after Hesse-Homburg passed into Prussian hands. Hesse-Homburg joined the Central German Commercial Union in 1828, but Meisenheim became part of the Prussian customs area in 1830 and the Prussian-led Zollverein in 1834. In 1836, when the Hessian customs system was merged with the Zollverein, Homburg followed it into the Zollverein.
On 8 December 1837, Hesse-Homburg joined the South German monetary convention, which had been formed in Munich on 25 August 1837. On 20 November 1838, it also coined the monetary convention that was formed at Dresden on 20 July 1838. In accordance with these conventions, the landgraves Louis William and Philip minted coins worth 1/2, 1, and 2 gulders and coins worth 1, 3 and 6 kreuzer. On 24 January 1857, Hesse-Homburg also joined the Vienna monetary convention. Between 1858 and 1863, Hesse-Homburg minted 38,000 Vereinsthaler. In 1848, the issuing of bank notes was discussed in Hesse-Homburg, but the plan was not executed. From 1855, the was Hesse-Homburg&#x27;s private note bank, which issued bank notes until 1876.

Despite the provisions of article 13 of the Constitution of the German Confederation, Hesse-Homburg had no constitution until 3 January 1850, when Landgrave Gustav issued a constitution in response to the March Revolution. A was elected in 1848, but it had no significant power. On 20 April 1852, the landgrave rescinded the constitution.

With the death of Landgrave Ferdinand on 24 March 1866, the Hesse-Homburg dynasty&#x27;s male line came to an end. Hesse-Homburg returned to the Grand Duke of Hesse, while Meisenheim fell to Prussia. In the peace treaty which concluded the Austro-Prussian War later that same year, Prussia took the other territories of Hesse-Homburg from Hesse-Darmstadt again. The former landgraviate was combined with the Electorate of Hesse, Duchy of Nassau, the Free City of Frankfurt and some former parts of the Kingdom of Bavaria to form the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau. Meisenheim became part of Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Provicne.

Today, the former Homburg district forms part of the German state of Hesse while Meisenheim forms part of Rhineland-Palatinate.

====Government and administration====

The landgraviate was an absolute monarchy, headed by the landgrave, who was simultaneously head of government and head of administration. All decisions about laws and ordinances were made by the landgrave.

The most important administrative body in Hesse-Homburg was the Privy Council (), which was created by an ordinance of 12 May 1816. It had wide powers, including dynastic affairs, foreign affairs, the direction of internal affairs, oversight of local government, judicial appeals, acts of clemency, and the landgrave&#x27;s personal affairs. The landgrave presided over the Council and appointed its members. It had only an advisory function. The directors of the Privy Council were the highest-ranking civil servants in the landgravate. They were responsible for preparation and passage of matters reserved to the central government, as well as countersigning laws and ordinances. The following individuals held the role. 

* 1817–1818: , Director of the Privy Council and President 
* 1820–1827: Johann Philipp von Hert, Director of the Privy Council and President of all state colleges
* 1828–1832: Carl Friedrich Emil von Ibell, Director of the Privy Council and President of all state colleges
* 1832–1841: Vacant
* 1841–1847: Karl Bernhard von Ibell, Director of the Privy Council
* (1847–1848): Ludwig Karl Wilhelm Henrich, provisional director of government
* 1848–1862: Dr. jur. 
* 1862–1866: , Director of the Privy Council

On 18 February 1818, Frederick V founded the State Government, which combined all formerly independent state colleges (consistories, chamber, forestry college, college medicum, and court) into a central authority, divided into three deputations:
* I. Justice (Civil and criminal law, as well as marital and disciplinary matters of the former consistories)
* II. State administration, police, health, poor aid, oversight of trusts, postal service, churches, schools, etc.
* III. Finance and cameral administration, including administration of domains and forests.

Hesse-Homburg had no constitution except from a brief period between 1850 and 1852.

<doc id="405996" wikidata="Q1024886" url="?curid=405996" title="Apollonia–Arsuf">
<text>Apollonia (; ), known in the Early Islamic period as Arsuf () and in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem as Arsur, was an ancient city on the Mediterranean coast of today&#x27;s Israel. In Israeli archaeology it is known as Tel Arshaf (). Founded by the Phoenicians during the Persian period in the late sixth century BCE, it was inhabited continuously until the Crusader period, through the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, during the latter being renamed to Sozusa (, or &quot;Sozusa in Palaestina&quot; to differentiate it from Sozusa in Libya). 
It was situated on a sandy area ending towards the sea with a cliff, about south of Caesarea.

It fell to the Muslims in 640, was fortified against Byzantine attacks and became known as Arsuf. In 1101 it was conquered by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was a strategically important stronghold in the Third Crusade, during which the Battle of Arsuf (1191) was fought nearby. The fortified city and the castle fell to the Mamluks in 1265, when both were completely destroyed.

The site of Arsuf (also &quot;Apollonia–Arsuf&quot; ) is now in Herzliya municipality, Israel (just north of Tel Aviv). The site was intensively excavated from 1994. In 2002 Apollonia National Park was opened to the public.

==Names==
The city is first recorded under its Greek name &quot;Apollonia&quot; in the final decades of the Persian period (mid-4th century BCE). In a long-standing suggestion, first proposed by Clermont-Ganneau in 1876, it was assumed that the Greek name was given due to the &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; of the Canaanite deity Resheph (&quot;ršp&quot;) as Apollo (as god of the plague), suggesting that the settlement would originally have been a &quot;Phoenician&quot; foundation. The Semitic name &quot;ršp&quot; would then have been &quot;restored&quot; in the medieval Arabic toponym of &quot;Arsūf&quot;. There is indeed no archaeological evidence for a settlement prior to the Persian period, and Izre&#x27;el (1999) upholds this identification, suggesting that the Semitic name might have been preserved by the Aramaic-speaking Samaritan community. The Samaritan chronicle of Abu l-Fath (14th century, written in Arabic) records a toponym &quot;rʿšfyn&quot; (with ayin). Izre&#x27;el (1999) considers the possibility of identifying this toponym with the Arabic &quot;Arsūf&quot;, assuming that the ayin may derive from a &quot;mater lectionis&quot; used in Samaritan Aramaic orthography.

A tradition connecting the name with the biblical Resheph, a grandson of Ephraim, is spurious.

The name of the nearby Israeli settlement of &quot;Rishpon&quot; was given in 1936, inspired by a misreading of an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III, where *&quot;rašpūna&quot; was read for &quot;kašpūna&quot;; recognition of the misreading rendered void the identification of &quot;Arsuf&quot; with a supposed Iron Age Phoenician settlement of *&quot;Rašpūna&quot;.

The renaming of &quot;Apollonia&quot; &quot;city of Apollo&quot; to &quot;Sozusa&quot; (Σώζουσα &quot;Sōzousa&quot;) &quot;city of the Saviour&quot; took place in the Byzantine period, under the influence of Christianity as the state religion, motivated by &quot;Soter&quot; (Σωτήρ) &quot;savior&quot; being a byname of Apollo as well as of Christ. The renaming is paralleled in at least three other cities called &quot;Apollonia&quot;: Sozusa in Cyrenaica, Sozopolis in Pisidia and Sozopolis in Thrace. The identification of ancient Apollonia with Byzantine-era Sozusa is due to Stark (1852), that of medieval Arsuf with Apollonia/Sozusa to Clermont-Ganneau (1876).

The site is variously referred to as &quot;Apollonia, Arsin, Arsuf, Arsuph, Arsur, Arsuth, Assur, Orsuf&quot; and &quot;Sozusa&quot; in Crusader-era documents, with a large dominance of &quot;Arsur&quot; among the secondary sources discussed by Schmidt.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Although some Chalcolithic and Iron Age remains were uncovered at the site, there is no evidence that there was a settlement prior to the Persian period (ca. 500 BCE). While the importance of the town was overshadowed by both Jaffa and Caesarea, Apollonia developed into a regional center after the decline of its neighbouring site at Tel Michal in the Late Persian period, and was likely the main city and harbour in the southern Sharon Plain by the mid-4th century BCE. It is mentioned in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax.

During the Hellenistic period it was a port town ruled by the Seleucids.

Under Roman rule, the town prospered and grew into the chief commercial and industrial centre of the region between the Poleg and Yarkon rivers. In 113 CE, Apollonia was partially destroyed by an earthquake, but recovered quickly.

Apollonia is mentioned by Pliny, &quot;Hist. nat.&quot;, V, 14, and Ptolemy, V, xv, 2, between Cæsarea and Joppa, and by other ancient authors, including Josephus, &quot;Ant. jud.&quot;, XIII, xv, 4, Appianus, &quot;Hist. rom. Syr.&quot;, 57. The Roman proconsul, Gabinius, found it ruined in 57 BCE, and had it rebuilt (Josephus, &quot;Bel. jud.&quot;, I, viii, 4). Apollonia is depicted in the Tabula Peutingeriana, on the coastal highway between Joppa and Caesarea, at the distance of 22 miles from Caesarea, confirming the identification of Arsuf with Apollonia.

There was no coin minting in Apollonia, confirming that the town did not have the role of a Roman provincial center but was rather considered a medium-sized coastal town like Jamnia and Azotus.

&quot;Sozusa in Palaestina&quot; was the name of the city in the late Roman province of Palaestina Prima, and its episcopal see was a suffragan of Caesarea, the provincial capital. 
The name had changed from Apollonia to Sozusa before 449, when Bishop Baruchius signed the acts of the Robber Council of Ephesus with this title. The name Sozusa also occurs in the works of the Byzantine geographers Hierocles and George of Cyprus. Apart from Baruchius of 449, the names of two more of its bishops, Leontius in 518, and Damianus in 553, are also known.
The death of patriarch Modestus in 630 in the city is recorded in both Georgian and Arabic texts, the Georgian texts using &quot;Sozos&quot; (for &quot;Sozusa&quot;) and the Arabic texts &quot;Arsuf&quot;, suggesting that both names remained in use for some time in the early medieval period.

During the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the city surrendered on terms in 614 to Shahrbaraz and was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war.

===Early Muslim period===
In 640, the town fell to the Muslims. The Arabic name &quot;Arsuf&quot; or &quot;Ursuf&quot; occurs in works of Arab geographers from the 10th century, e.g. Al-Muqaddasi said it was &quot;smaller than Yafah, but strongly fortified and populous There is here a beautiful pulpit, made in the first instance for the Mosque of Ar Ramlah, but which being found too small, was given to Arsuf&quot;.

At the time of the Muslim conquest, Sozusa was inhabited by Samaritans.
In 809, following the death of Harun al-Rashid, the local Samaritan community was destroyed and their synagogue ruined. In 809 the Abbasids violently removed the large group of Samaritans that had been living in the city.

The town&#x27;s area decreased to about and, for the first time, it was surrounded by a fortified wall with buttresses, to resist the constant attacks of Byzantine fleets from the sea.

===Crusader to Mamluk period===

Godfrey de Bouillon attempted to capture it, but failed for want of ships (William of Tyre, IX, x). King Baldwin I took it in 1102, after a siege by land and sea, allowing the inhabitants to withdraw to Ascalon.
The Crusaders, who called it &quot;Arsur&quot;, rebuilt the city&#x27;s walls and created the Lordship of Arsur in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1187 Arsuf was recaptured by the Muslims, but fell again to the Crusaders on 7 September 1191 after the Battle of Arsuf, fought between the forces of Richard I of England and Saladin.

John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut became Lord of Arsuf in 1207 when he married Melisende of Arsuf. Their son John of Arsuf (d. 1258) inherited the title. The title then passed to John of Arsuf&#x27;s eldest son Balian of Arsuf (d. 1277). He built new walls, the large castle and new harbor in 1241. In 1251 Louis IX of France re-erected its ramparts. From 1261, the city was ruled by the Knights Hospitaller.

In 1225, Yakut wrote: &quot;Arsuf remained in Muslim hands till taken by Kund Furi [Godfrey of Bouillon], lord of Jerusalem, in the year 494 [ AH 494, i.e. 1101 CE], and it is in the hand of the Franks [Crusaders] at the present day.&quot;

In 1265, sultan Baibars, ruler of the Mamluks, captured Arsuf after 40 days of siege, after almost getting killed in the moat by a sortie of the defenders. The inhabitants were killed or sold as slaves and the town completely razed. The destruction was so complete that the site was abandoned and never regained its urban character – in the 14th century the geographer Abulfeda said it contained no inhabitants (&quot;Tabula Syriæ&quot;, 82).

According to Mujir al-Din (writing c. 1496), the Sidna Ali Mosque just south of Arsuf was dedicated by Baibars at the site of a saint&#x27;s tomb where he prayed for victory prior to retaking Arsuf.

In the Middle Ages, Sozusa was confused with Antipatris. The identity of Arsuf with ancient Apollonia was first noted by Clermont-Ganneau in 1876.

===Ottoman period===

In 1596, Ottoman tax registers recorded a village called Arsuf with 22 families and 4 bachelors, all Muslims. The villagers paid a total of 2,900 akçe in taxes. 1/3 the revenue went to a waqf: Hadrat &#x27;Ali bin &#x27;Ulaym. It appeared, just named &quot;village&quot; on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799.

===Catholic titular see until 1965===

&quot;Sozusa in Palaestina&quot; is listed as a titular see in the 2013 &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;. Due to the confusion with the other ancient city in classical Palestine known as Apollonia, it was also assigned under the name &quot;Antipatris&quot;. Its last titular bishop of the Latin Church was Francis Joseph McSorley, the Apostolic Vicar of Jolo (d. 1970). It has no longer been assigned since, in accordance with the practice established after the Second Vatican Council regarding all titular sees situated in what were the eastern patriarchates.

===British Mandate and Israeli periods===

The site was incorporated in Herzliya municipality in 1924. At the time, a village called al-Haram existed adjacent to the ruins, but it was depopulated during the 1948 Nakba, and the area south of the site was built up as the &quot;Shikun Olim&quot; ( &quot;immigrant housing&quot;) district of Herzeliya in the 1950s.

Rishpon was established in 1936 to the immediate north-east of the site. It is part of the Hof HaSharon Regional Council, Central District.

Arsuf is a modern &quot;exclusive clifftop community&quot; named for Arsuf, built in 1995 north of the site, in Hof HaSharon Regional Council.

==Archaeology==
The site of Apollonia–Arsuf was excavated in the 1990s and opened for visitors as &quot;Apollonia National Park&quot; in 2002.
Excavations were ongoing as of 2015. The excavation report is prepared in three volumes, of which the first was published in 1999. The second and third volume, covering the excavation seasons until 2015, were in preparation as of 2016.

The above-ground remains before the excavations included the medieval city wall and moat, enclosing an area of about 90 dunam, a Crusader castle with a double-wall system with an area of about 4 dunam, a port with built jetties and a sheltered anchorage, protected by a sandstone reef.

Large amounts of pottery were recovered in the area surrounding the city, mostly of the Byzantine and early Islamic period, indicating that the city extended significantly beyond its old walls in the 7th century. A large Roman-era &quot;villa maritima&quot; was uncovered to the south of the site.

<text>Newton Stewart (Gd: &quot;Baile Ùr nan Stiùbhartach&quot;) is a former burgh town in the historical county of Wigtownshire in Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland.
The town is on the River Cree with most of the town to the west of the river, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Galloway Hills&quot;.

The main local industries are agriculture, forestry and tourism. The town hosts a local market, and a number of services to support the farming industry. There are many mountain biking trails in the area. Newton Stewart lies on the southern edge of the Galloway Forest Park, which supplies many jobs to the town. Newton Stewart is from Scotland&#x27;s book town Wigtown.

==History==

The town was founded in the mid 17th century by William Stewart, fourth and youngest son of the 2nd Earl of Galloway. The &quot;New Town of Stewart&quot; was granted burgh status by charter from King Charles II, allowing a weekly market and two annual fairs to be held.

It was on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Ninian at Whithorn in 1329 that Robert the Bruce forded the river where the present bridge stands. Designed by John Rennie the Elder and built in 1813 the present bridge replaced the old bridge of 1745.

The industrialist Sir William Douglas (died 1809), best known for founding the planned town of Castle Douglas, also established cotton mills in Newton Stewart, which was renamed &quot;Newton Douglas&quot; in his honour but soon reverted to Newton Stewart.

The main municipal building in the town, the McMillan Hall, was completed in 1885.

<text>Port Glasgow (, ) is the second-largest town in the Inverclyde council area of Scotland. The population according to the 1991 census for Port Glasgow was 19,426 persons and in the 2001 census was 16,617 persons. The most recent census in 2011 states that the population has declined to 15,414. It is located immediately to the east of Greenock and was previously a burgh in the county of Renfrewshire.

Originally a fishing hamlet named Newark, Port Glasgow came about as a result of large ships being unable to navigate the shallow and meandering River Clyde to the centre of the city of Glasgow. As a result, it was formed as a remote port for Glasgow in 1668 and became known as &#x27;New Port Glasgow&#x27;, which was shortened to &#x27;Port Glasgow&#x27; in 1775. Port Glasgow was home to dry docks and shipbuilding beginning in 1780.

The town grew from the central area of the present town and thus many of the town&#x27;s historic buildings and people are found here. Port Glasgow expanded up the steep hills inland to open fields where areas such as Park Farm, Boglestone, Slaemuir and Devol and Oronsay were founded. This area has subsequently become known as upper Port Glasgow and most of the town&#x27;s population occupies these areas.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of Port Glasgow go back to the construction by Sir George Maxwell between 1450 and 1477 of the &quot;New Werke of Finlastoun&quot;, which became Newark Castle. At a good anchorage near the castle, a small fishing hamlet known as Newark formed, like other scattered hamlets along the shores of the River Clyde. After 1589 the village of Greenock formed just under to the west of Newark, and gradually became a market town with growing fishing and sea trade, although it had only a jetty in the bay to unload ships. Since seagoing ships could not go further up the Clyde due to sandbanks and shallows, the Glasgow merchants such as the Tobacco Lords wanted harbour access, but got into arguments with Greenock over harbour dues and warehouses. They put a bid in for the Easter Greenock estate for a harbour, but were outbid and the lands became the Barony of Cartsburn. They then negotiated with Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark Estate, and in 1668 he agreed to feu (lease) to the City of Glasgow of land to the west of the castle, for payment of 1,300 merks and an annual feu duty of four merks. Construction of piers and breakwaters enclosing the harbour began promptly, and Newport Glasgow was constituted as a free port.

Trade prospered quickly, and by 1710 Newport Glasgow had the principal Clyde custom house, initially in Customhouse Lane, then after 1754 in a new building constructed on the west quay of the harbour. Through that century the town became known simply as Port Glasgow. Ships, mostly owned by Glasgow merchants, imported tobacco, sugar, rum, cotton and mahogany from the Americas, as well as timber, iron and hemp from the Baltic. These goods were then taken by road to Glasgow, as was market garden produce from farms around Port Glasgow. A change began in 1773 when the Lang Dyke was constructed to deepen the upper river, and ships increasingly went upriver straight to Glasgow. In 1830, the custom house collected £243,349 3s 1d in revenue, but after that income from the port declined, while by then Greenock had its own customs house.

In the 1690s, the grid-iron street layout, which still forms much of the town centre today, was laid out.

===Shipbuilding===

In 1780, Thomas McGill set up one of the first shipyards in the area, located near Newark castle. 
By the 19th century, Port Glasgow had become a centre of shipbuilding. The Comet was built in the town in 1812 and was the first commercial steam vessel in Europe. A replica of the Comet was built in 1962 to mark the 150th anniversary. It, and a plaque commemorating the actual site of construction, were situated in Port Glasgow town centre in 1973.
The Town Buildings were completed in 1815 and Port Glasgow became a parliamentary burgh in 1832, but around this time, the River Clyde up to Glasgow was deepened and new road and rail links meant that the town was no longer needed much as a port. The shipbuilding industry then took over as the main source of employment and prosperity. Port Glasgow has been responsible for about a quarter of the total tonnage of ships launched on the Clyde, and also dealt in scrapping old ships, most notably the French liner &quot;L&#x27;atlantique&quot;, the burnt out wreck of which was broken up in the yard of Smith &amp; Houston. However, as with most of Inverclyde&#x27;s industry, the shipbuilding industry has all but gone and only Ferguson Marine, which was nationalised in 2019, remains in the town today.

===Regeneration===
The former Gourock Ropeworks building, built as a sugar refinery in 1866, was redeveloped as luxury flats in 2006, and a retail park has been laid out adjacent to the town centre.

==Transport==

The town is served by Port Glasgow railway station (main station) in the town centre and Woodhall railway station in the east end of the town. Both stations are on the electrified Inverclyde Line, which has frequent services to the termini at Glasgow Central, Gourock and Wemyss Bay.

From 1869 to 1959, the town was also served by rail at Port Glasgow Upper railway station on the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway.

The town is connected to nearby Glasgow by the A8 dual carriageway and the M8 motorway.

Glasgow Airport located 21 km (13 mi) to the east is the closest airport to Port Glasgow.
==Visitor attractions==

===Newark Castle===

Newark Castle stands very close to the shore of the Clyde, and dates to around 1484. It was home to the Maxwell Family until 1694. By 1800, the castle was surrounded by shipyards, but today only Ferguson&#x27;s shipyard remains, standing immediately to the west of the castle. A park and waterfront walkway have been constructed to the east, on the site of Lamont&#x27;s shipyard and Smith &amp; Houston&#x27;s shipbreaking yard. The castle is now a visitor attraction maintained on behalf of the nation by Historic Scotland.
===Parklea===

About upstream from the castle and its surrounding park, several acres of the Clyde foreshore at Parklea are owned by the National Trust for Scotland. For many years, the land has been leased to the local council as playing fields. When the NTS acquired the land, it was regarded as protecting the foreshore from the widespread acquisition by shipyards. However, this did not prevent the construction of extensive timber ponds along this stretch of the river.
===Shipbuilders of Port Glasgow sculpture===

A new sculpture by John McKenna was installed in Coronation Park in March 2022. The 10m high stainless steel structure depicts two larger than life shipyard workers wielding sledgehammers to bend steel plates into shape to form the hull of a ship, part of which is also depicted. They became known as &quot;The Skelpies&quot; (the word combined with &quot;The Kelpies&quot;), and the sculpture was officially launched on 24 June 2023.

===Coronation Park===
Coronation Park was opened on the site of the West Harbour in 1937 to celebrate the coronation of King George VI. It contains a memorial to the Clyde boating tragedy when 20 people died when a pleasure cruiser capsized in bad weather on 14 September 1947.

==Football==
Port Glasgow has played host to several successful football clubs, including Port Glasgow Athletic F.C. and their sister side Port Glasgow Athletic Juniors F.C., which are both now defunct. Port Glasgow F.C., formed in 1948, returned &quot;home&quot; to a new stadium at Parklea, Port Glasgow in 2012, following a spell playing their home games in nearby Greenock.

==Parliamentary representation==
Port Glasgow was a parliamentary burgh as part of the Kilmarnock Burghs constituency from 1832 to 1918, when it was merged into the West Renfrewshire constituency. From 1974 to 1997, it was part of the Greenock and Port Glasgow constituency. It returned to the West Renfrewshire constituency in 1997, before becoming part of the present Inverclyde constituency in 2005. In the Scottish Parliament, Port Glasgow has been part of the West Renfrewshire Holyrood constituency since 1999.

<doc id="406010" wikidata="Q1010537" url="?curid=406010" title="Portsoy">
<text>Portsoy () is a small town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Historically, Portsoy was in Banffshire until 1975. The original name may come from &quot;Port Saoithe&quot;, meaning &quot;saithe harbour&quot;. Portsoy is located on the Moray Firth coast of northeast Scotland, northwest of Aberdeen and east of Inverness. It had a population of 1,752 at the time of the 2011 census.

==History==

Portsoy became a burgh of barony in 1550, under Sir Walter Ogilvie of Boyne Castle, and the charter was confirmed by parliament in 1581.

From the 16th century until 1975, Portsoy was in the civil and religious parish of Fordyce but was administered by its own Town Council and Banffshire County Council.

Following the commencement of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, on 16 May 1975, lower Banffshire, including Portsoy, became part of Banff &amp; Buchan District Council area which was, in turn, part of the larger Grampian Regional Council area.

A further reorganisation of local government in Scotland came via the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. With effect from 1 April 1996, 32 unitary authorities came into existence covering the whole of Scotland, Banff &amp; Buchan District Council and Grampian Regional Council ceased to exist and Portsoy came under the jurisdiction of the Aberdeenshire Council unitary authority.

The &quot;old harbour&quot; dates to the 17th century and is the oldest on the Moray Firth. The &quot;new harbour&quot; was built in 1825 for the growing herring fishery, which at its peak reached 57 boats. The Old Town Hall in The Square was completed in 1798.

==Economy==
Portsoy is known for local jewellery made from &quot;Portsoy marble&quot; (which is not marble, but rather serpentinite). The annual Scottish Traditional Boat Festival was started in 1993 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the old harbour.

==In popular culture==
Portsoy, notably the harbour, has featured in BBC period dramas &quot;The Camerons&quot;, &quot;The Shutter Falls&quot; and &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; and a Tennent&#x27;s Lager advert parodying the 1949 film &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; It was also the principal location for Gillies MacKinnon&#x27;s film &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, a 2016 remake of the 1949 film; Portsoy represented the fictional island of Todday.

==Transport==
Portsoy railway station was formerly the terminus of the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway branch of the Great North of Scotland Railway system. It closed in 1968.

<doc id="406011" wikidata="Q6237389" url="?curid=406011" title="Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury">
<text>Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury, (30 June 1800 – 20 July 1873) was a British lawyer, judge and Liberal politician. He served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain between 1861 and 1865. He was knighted in 1852 and raised to the peerage in 1861.

==Background and education==
Born at Bradford on Avon, in Wiltshire, he was the eldest son of the physician Richard Bethell of Bristol and Jane (&quot;née&quot; Baverstock). He was from an old Welsh family originally named &quot;Ap Ithel&quot;. His younger brother was John Bethell.

He was educated in Bath and Bristol before attending Wadham College, Oxford at only 14 years old. He received a scholarship the next year. He took first-class honours in classics and second class in mathematics, and he graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1818 and was elected a fellow of his college. In 1823, Bethell was called to the bar at the Middle Temple.

==Career==
Westbury was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1840 was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster in 1851. His most important public service was the reform of the then existing mode of legal education, a reform which ensured that students before call to the bar should have at least some acquaintance with the elements of the subject which they were to profess.

In 1847, he ran unsuccessfully for Parliament; contesting Shaftesbury, he lost to Whig politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan. He was successful in his second attempt in 1851, when he was elected for Aylesbury. Attaching himself to the liberals, he became Solicitor General in 1852, on which occasion he was made a Knight Bachelor.

In 1854, Westbury was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

Westbury was nominated Attorney-General in 1856 and again in 1859, serving both times for two years. He represented Wolverhampton from 1859 to 1861.

On 26 June 1861, on the death of Lord Campbell, he was appointed Lord Chancellor and raised to the peerage as Baron Westbury, of Westbury, in the County of Wiltshire. Owing to the reception by parliament of reports of committees nominated to consider the circumstances of certain appointments in the Leeds Bankruptcy Court, as well as the granting a pension to a Mr Leonard Edmunds, a clerk in the patent office, and a clerk of the parliaments, the Lord Chancellor felt it incumbent upon him to resign his office, which he accordingly did on 5 July 1865, and was succeeded by Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth. After his resignation he continued to take part in the judicial sittings of the House of Lords and the Privy Council until his death. In 1872 he was appointed arbitrator under the European Assurance Society Act 1872.

==Character==
Perhaps the best known of his decisions was the judgment delivering the opinion of the judicial committee of the privy council in 1863 against the heretical character of certain extracts from the well-known publication &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;.

His principal legislative achievements were the passing of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, and of the Land Registry Act 1862 (generally known as Lord Westbury&#x27;s Act), the latter of which in practice proved a failure. What chiefly distinguished Lord Westbury was the possession of a certain sarcastic humour; and numerous are the stories, authentic and apocryphal, of its exercise. In fact, he and Sir William Henry Maule filled a position analogous to that of Sydney Smith, convenient names to whom good things may be attributed.

==Family==
Lord Westbury married Ellinor Mary, daughter of Robert Abraham, in 1825. His younger brother John married another daughter of Abraham, Louisa Sarah, in 1833. They had four sons and four daughters:

*Ellen (1826–1880)
*Eliza (1828–1916)
*Richard Augustus, 2nd Baron (1830–1875) 
*Slingsby (1831–1896)
*Arthur Howard (1833–1834)
*Emma Louisa (1835–1877)
*Augusta (1839–1931)
*Walter John (1842–1907)

After Ellinor Mary&#x27;s death in March 1863, Richard Bethell married Eleanor Margaret, daughter of Henry Tennant, in January 1873. After an illness, Westbury died six months later on 20 July 1873, within a day of the death of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, his special antagonist in debate. He was buried in the Great Northern Cemetery (now the New Southgate Cemetery). He was succeeded in the barony by his son from his first marriage, Richard, who committed suicide two years later. Lady Westbury died in December 1894.

Lord Westbury&#x27;s daughter Augusta Bethell was a children&#x27;s author and translator who was sought in marriage by Edward Lear before marrying Henry Charles Adamson Parker and then barrister Thomas Arthur Nash.

<text>The Colombian Liberal Party (; PLC) is a centre to centre-left political party in Colombia. It was founded as a classical liberal party but later developed a more social-democratic tradition, joining the Socialist International in 1999.

The Liberal Party along with the Colombian Conservative Party dominated the Colombian political scene from the end of the 19th century until 2002, in bipartisan political hegemony. The two parties were in direct military conflict between 1948 and 1958, during the civil war period known as &quot;La Violencia&quot;, after which they established the &quot;National Front&quot;, agreeing to rotate power, intercalating for a period of four presidential terms. The election victory of independent candidate Álvaro Uribe in 2002 put an end to dominance of two party politics in Colombia.

Currently, the Liberal Party is the largest party in Congress and supported the left-wing presidency of Gustavo Petro until leaving Petro&#x27;s coalition on 28 November 2023.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1848 and, in opposition to the Colombian Conservative Party, became one of the two main political forces in the country for over a century. The two parties frequently engaged in armed conflict with one another, precipitating several civil wars.

During a convention in March 1922, the Liberals adopted a progressive platform which emphasized social justice. In the 1940s, the liberal party turned towards socialism under the influence of the charismatic lawyer Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, despite the antipathy it provoked among party members and liberal leaders. In the rural area, Gaitanism faced a bloody repression to which its scrupulous respect for legality did not prepare it: 15,000 militants were murdered between 1945 and 1948 by death squads supposedly close to the conservatives. Gaitán himself, who was a likely winner of the next presidential election, was assassinated in 1948.

After the period known as La Violencia the Liberals and the Conservative Party reached an agreement to share power from 1958 to 1974 in the so-called National Front agreement that followed the fall of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Nowadays there are many critics of the 16-year agreement but it greatly reduced the intensity of the violent political warfare that preceded it.

Following the end of the National Front agreement in 1974, the Liberal Party dominated Colombian politics until 2002; Liberal candidates won five of the seven Presidential elections and the party was the largest in both the Chamber of Representatives and Senate throughout the entire period.

In the 1994 election the Liberal Party&#x27;s Ernesto Samper was narrowly elected president. Immediately afterwards he was accused of accepting millions from the Cali Cartel to fund his campaign. While Samper had immunity to prosecution as president, a number of his close associates were convicted of involvement in the so-called Proceso 8000 scandal, including Defence Minister Fernando Botero Zea. Partly due to the scandal the Liberal Party lost seats in the 1998 parliamentary election, although it remained easily the largest party. More seriously, the Liberals were defeated in the presidential election held the same year.

The Liberal Party suffered a major split in the lead-up to the 2002 elections. Horacio Serpa Uribe, the party&#x27;s unsuccessful 1998 presidential candidate was nominated to run again. However Álvaro Uribe, a former senator and governor from the party launched an independent presidential campaign, backed by the Conservatives and dissident Liberals. Whereas Serpa supported the ongoing idea of negotiations with FARC, Uribe advocated confronting the guerrillas. Uribe was victorious in the elections, securing a majority in the first round. In the aftermath, the &quot;Government endorsed&quot; leadership of the party continued to oppose Uribe&#x27;s administration, but many senators and representatives supported the government, becoming known as the &quot;Uribist&quot; faction. As a compromise, former president César Gaviria Trujillo was elected party leader in 2005.

At the 2006 legislative election, the Liberals lost around half their seats. While they remained the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives, they finished third in the Senate. Horacio Serpa was again nominated as the Liberal candidate for the subsequent presidential elections of 28 May 2006 and won 11.84% of the popular vote, placing him third, the worst ever result for a Liberal candidate.

During the parliamentary elections of 14 March 2010, the Liberal Party obtained 17 senators and 37 representatives, placing third in both the Chamber of Representatives and Senate. At the 2010 presidential election Liberal candidate Rafael Pardo finished sixth with 4.38% of the vote, worse than Horacio Serpa&#x27;s 2006 vote. The Liberal Party went on to join the governing coalition of President Juan Manuel Santos, and supported his bid for reelection in the 2014 Colombian presidential election.

For the 2018 Colombian presidential election, the party nominated former Vice President from 1994-1996 Humberto De la Calle. De La Calle was eliminated in the first round, and for the second round declined to endorse either of the candidates, announcing he would cast a blank vote instead.

The party did not run a presidential candidate for the 2022 Colombian presidential election, and instead endorsed the candidacy of Federico Gutiérrez. For the second round, the party endorsed Rodolfo Hernández Suárez.

<text>The phrase &quot;balance of terror&quot; is usually, but not invariably, used in reference to the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

== During the Cold War ==
It describes the tenuous peace that existed between the two countries as a result of both governments being terrified at the prospect of a world-destroying nuclear war. The term is usually used for rhetorical purposes, and was probably coined by Lester Pearson in June 1955 at the 10th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter: &quot;the balance of terror has succeeded the balance of power&quot;.

Some political scientists use this phrase as a means of differentiating the world situation that followed World War II from that which preceded it. Previously, empires had prevented war between each other by maintaining a relative balance of their ability (economic, military, and political) to wage war against each other—the phrase &quot;balance of power&quot; was often used to describe this kind of tentative peace.

The atomic bomb created a new political reality, in which two superpowers had the ability to destroy each other and at least gravely damage all of human civilization. The obstacle to war between the communists and capitalists was no longer the fear that the other side was more powerful, but rather the realization that nuclear arsenals were now large enough and deadly enough that winning would still likely result in the destruction of one&#x27;s own country and perhaps the rest of the world as well.

In this counterintuitive way, the existence of the most powerful weapons ever created actually supported a kind of peace: while many wars were fought around the world during the Cold War, the superpowers never fought each other directly, nor have atomic bombs been dropped in war since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in 1945.

== Other uses ==
Lawrence Summers, after the financial meltdown of 2008, adopted the term as appropriate for the situation of a &#x27;financial balance of terror&#x27; in global markets.

==Uses==
*John F. Kennedy used the phrase in his 1961 inaugural address in which he described the United States and the Soviet Union were &quot;both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind&#x27;s final war.&quot;
*Albert Wohlstetter of the RAND Corporation wrote the paper &quot;The Delicate Balance of Terror&quot; in 1958.
* The classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode, &quot;Balance of Terror,&quot; borrowed the catch phrase for the title. The story had Captain Kirk matching wits with a Romulan commander whose ship had superior weaponry and was capable of invisibility. Kirk had to find a way to stop the Romulan attacks without starting a war.

<doc id="406022" wikidata="Q1395689" url="?curid=406022" title="Fanmi Lavalas">
<text>Fanmi Lavalas (; &quot;lavalas&quot; is Haitian Creole for &#x27;avalanche&#x27; or &#x27;flood&#x27;
) is a social-democratic political party in Haiti. Its leader is former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It has been a powerful force in Haitian politics since 1991. Fanmi Lavalas governments advocate a policy of &quot;growth with equity&quot; based on Western European social democratic principles. Fanmi Lavalas governments have emphasised investment in education and health care as their priorities and have refused International Monetary Fund austerity measures.

==History==
Lavalas emerged as a powerful social movement in the late 1980s, and it backed Jean Bertrand Aristide&#x27;s election campaign in 1990. The establishment of the Lavalas movement as a formal political party, renamed Fanmi Lavalas, took place in 1996 as a split by Aristide from the Struggling People&#x27;s Party (OPL) over the question of his resumption of the three years he lost in exile following the 1991 coup Two main reasons for its creation are known: (1) to allow the Lavalas movement to remain inclusive while opposing the neo-liberal policies of the foreign-influenced OPL, which was one of the conditions for Aristide&#x27;s return to power in 1994; (2) to prevent rival politicians from taking over the movement&#x27;s leadership from Aristide and other more left-wing leaders. The Haitian military overthrew Aristide&#x27;s first government in 1991. &quot;Fanmi Lavalas&quot; may be roughly translated into English as &quot;Avalanche Family&quot; or &quot;Waterfall Family&quot; (referring to the Biblical flood), but the name is almost never completely translated from Haitian Creole, although it is sometimes given as &quot;Lavalas Family&quot;. It was registered officially as a political party on 30 October 1996, and on 14 February 1997 it was recognized by the electoral authorities.

Elections were set for 2006 by the Interim Government, which was established by the governments of Canada, the US, and France. Certain members of Fanmi Lavalas claimed that Marc Bazin was the Lavalas candidate. However, its grassroots supporters overwhelmingly supported René Garcia Préval in his campaign as president. Lavalas candidates boycotted the election for the most part, but its voters supported the emergence of Preval&#x27;s Lespwa party. The results of the election of the 7 February and 21 April 2006 Chamber of Deputies are not available.

===Election exclusion===
The performance of the Fanmi Lavalas party in Haitian elections has been difficult to measure since the 2004 coup d&#x27;état that toppled it from power as it has been repeatedly excluded from the democratic process. It was again excluded from participation in the 2010–2011 Haitian general election by the electoral council after the candidates did not receive the necessary votes.

===2015 presidential and legislative election===
CEP accepted Lavalas&#x27; request to contest election in the 2015 election. In highly controversial elections that were forced to be rerun due to credible charges of electoral fraud, the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, Maryse Narcisse only received 110,449 votes, or 7.32% of popular votes. The party&#x27;s legislature candidates received 5 seat out of 85 already elected seats in the 2015 parliamentary election, a second round will be held in December 27. The process and outcome of the 2015-2016 elections are still seen as controversial and are widely viewed as having damaged the credibility of the government of President Jovenel Moise and the Parti Haïtien Tèt Kale (Bald-head party).

<doc id="406029" wikidata="Q1022169" url="?curid=406029" title="Primetime (American TV program)">
<text>Primetime was an American news magazine television program that debuted on ABC in 1989 with co-hosts Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer and originally had the title Primetime Live. The program&#x27;s final episode aired May 18, 2012.

==History==

===Early history===
Originally, the program aired live on the ABC network and featured a live studio audience. The first interviews included Roseanne Barr and a piece on a Middle East hostage crisis reported by Chris Wallace. Donaldson and Sawyer would allow audience members to comment on the program and ask questions of the guests, who were usually interviewed live via satellite or in studio, a practice that resulted in many technical difficulties and easy satirization on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Internal conflicts between Sawyer and Donaldson later led them to be separated, and the audience eliminated. However, the program has always had some live elements when broadcast as &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, generally consisting of Donaldson reading the opening remarks of packaged stories and the opening title as &quot;Primetime... LIVE!&quot;. Over time, live interviews were de-emphasized and hidden camera investigations began to occupy more of the schedule.

===Cancellation and changes===
In 1998, ABC, in an effort to consolidate all of their news magazines, cancelled &quot;Primetime Live&quot; and combined it with ABC&#x27;s other well-known news magazine, &quot;20/20&quot;. The move was made to compete more effectively with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot;, which ran multiple nights of the week. In 2000, however, ABC relaunched the program. It was renamed &quot;Primetime Thursday&quot; with Charles Gibson, after they replaced Donaldson.

In 2003, ABC aired a short-lived 2003 continuation of the newsmagazine, &quot;20/20 Downtown,&quot; as &quot;Primetime Monday&quot;.

Beginning in the 2004–2005 season, the show was known once again as &quot;Primetime Live&quot;. Its pair of co-hosts from the previous four seasons, Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, was replaced by the rotating team of Sawyer, David Muir, Chris Cuomo, Cynthia McFadden and John Quiñones. The format shifted back to investigative reporting and a new executive producer, Shelley Ross, was brought on board. On July 21, 2005, the show&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Primetime&quot;.

Beginning in the 2006–2007 television season, the news magazine adopted a subseries format, where multiple episodes would be focused on one topic such as crime and medical mysteries, with no set weekly timeslot. Sawyer departed the program around the time this change in format occurred, though she occasionally anchored special editions of &quot;Primetime&quot;. David Muir joined as co-anchor in 2007. &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; has become the most popular sub-series and can be regularly seen on ABC, often with a set timeslot. In 2011 ABC aired a special edition of &quot;Primetime&quot;: an interview by Diane Sawyer with Jaycee Dugard. In 2012, beginning with the sixth season, the &quot;Primetime&quot; branding was removed from the &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; show. It still airs sans branding and is anchored by Quiñones. The branding has not been used by any program or special since this time.

===Food Lion scandal===
One hidden-camera investigation, of south-eastern U.S. grocery chain Food Lion, backfired when Food Lion sued ABC. Food Lion sued for trespass and breach of loyalty, claiming that the report was produced under deceptive pre-tenses, and ABC employees hired by Food Lion wearing hidden cameras filmed other Food Lion employees without following proper notification procedures. Food Lion did not sue for libel, as the one-year statute of limitations had already run by the time it received all the footage shot by ABC, and prior to receiving the footage, its attorneys believed it would be difficult to prove that ABC acted with actual malice. A jury awarded Food Lion $5.5 million, but later appeals by ABC to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals resulted in the damages reduced to $2.00. This scandal caused significant damage to Food Lion&#x27;s business operations, leading to the closures of recently opened stores in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, affecting their plans for future expansion, all while generating negative media attention and financial losses for the company.

<text>Sehnsucht (; &quot;Desire&quot; or &quot;Longing&quot;) is the second studio album by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released on 22 August 1997, through Motor Music in Europe and Slash Records in the United States. It is the only album entirely in German to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the US. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Austrian and German charts.

In 2020, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it in their list of Top 10 1997 Albums.

==Cover art==
The album booklet folds out to reveal six different covers, one for each band member (each photo depicting the member with vintage medical / surgical instruments). The cover most commonly seen shows Christoph Schneider with a barbed-wire-laced worn as an oral gag and his eyes rolled back into his head. The cover art was created by Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein, who also created the cover for the Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Blackout&quot; album, which the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; cover resembles. 
==Track listing==
===Additional notes===
===Special editions===
Multiple special editions of &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; were released, offering different bonus tracks:
*The following songs as tracks 12 and 13 for the North American and Japanese releases:

**&quot;Du hast (English Version)&quot;
**These songs are also included on micro-cassettes, and may be hidden tracks on certain editions.
*&quot;Du riechst so gut &#x27;98&quot; as track 12. A version also includes the video for &quot;Du riechst so gut &#x27;98&quot;.
*Polish cassettes included a short Polish introduction to the album, spoken by Till.
*A limited edition release in Europe features 14 tracks:
**&quot;Rammstein (Eskimos &amp; Egypt Radio Edit)&quot;
**&quot;Du riechst so gut &#x27;98&quot;
**&quot;Du hast (Remix by Clawfinger)&quot;
*&quot;Stripped&quot; as a twelfth track, which may be included on the micro-cassette version and/or be included as a hidden track.
*&quot;Stripped&quot; as a twelfth track and the &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; single as a second CD. The &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; single may be included on the first CD to make a total of 18 tracks.
*A 2001 &quot;Australian Tour Edition&quot;, which had &quot;Stripped&quot; as a twelfth track, and a second CD with the &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; single as the first track, followed by five live songs.

===Anniversary Edition===
On 15 April 2023, Rammstein released a short teaser to their social media channels, showing the album&#x27;s various front covers along to the intro of Bück dich. A day later, another teaser was posted, with footage of the band rehearsing Engel on 18 April 1997. The caption of that video announced the &quot;Sehnsucht Anniversary Edition&quot;. On 17 April 2023, a third teaser followed, including footage from Live aus Berlin and the announcement, that the pre-order of the anniversary edition would start the next day, 19 April. 

The Anniversary Edition was scheduled for release on 9 June 2023.

Besides being remastered, the album features an exclusive new mix of Spiel mit mir, titled &quot;2023 Mix&quot;, and a 40 page booklet with previously unreleased photos of Gottfried Helnwein.

<doc id="406051" wikidata="Q1025105" url="?curid=406051" title="Grant's Tomb">
<text>Grant&#x27;s Tomb, officially the General Grant National Memorial, is the final resting place of Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president of the United States, and of his wife Julia. It is a classical domed mausoleum in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S. The structure is in the median of Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, just east of to Riverside Park. In addition to being a national memorial since 1958, Grant&#x27;s Tomb is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and its facade and interior are New York City designated landmarks.

Upon Grant&#x27;s death in July 1885, his widow indicated his wish to be interred in New York. Within days, a site in Riverside Park was selected, and the Grant Monument Association (GMA) was established to appeal for funds. Although the GMA raised $100,000 in its first three months, the group only raised an additional $55,000 in the next five years. After two architectural competitions in 1889 and 1890, the GMA selected a proposal by John Hemenway Duncan for a tomb modeled after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Following a renewed fundraising campaign, the cornerstone was laid in 1892, and the tomb was completed on April 27, 1897, Grant&#x27;s 75th birthday.

Initially, the GMA managed the tomb with a $7,000 annual appropriation from the city. The tomb was extensively renovated in the late 1930s with help from Works Progress Administration workers, who added murals and restored the interior. The National Park Service took over the operation of Grant&#x27;s Tomb in 1959. After a period of neglect and vandalism, the tomb was restored in the 1990s following a campaign led by college student Frank Scaturro. Despite various modifications over the years, some portions of the monument were never completed, including a planned equestrian statue outside the tomb.

The mausoleum&#x27;s base is shaped like a rectangle with colonnades on three sides and a portico in front, on the south side. The upper section consists of a cylindrical shaft with a colonnade, as well as a stepped dome. Inside, the main level of the memorial is shaped like a Greek cross, with four barrel-vaulted exhibition spaces extending off a domed central area. The Grants&#x27; bodies are placed in red-granite sarcophagi above ground in a lower-level crypt. Over the years, the design of Grant&#x27;s Tomb has received mixed commentary, and the tomb has been depicted in several films.

==Context and planning==
Ulysses S. Grant was born in 1822 and led the Union Army to victory during the American Civil War, then served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877. Grant was bankrupt at the end of his life. Days after Grant published his memoirs to raise money, he died of throat cancer at age 63 in Wilton, New York, on July 23, 1885. The American public still held Grant in high regard when he died: his empty casket drew 15,000 mourners on July 26, and Americans and foreigners alike wrote thousands of letters expressing their condolences.

In his will, Grant had indicated that he wished to be interred in St. Louis, Missouri, or Galena, Illinois, where his family owned plots in local cemeteries, or in New York City, where he had lived in his final years. His friend, publisher George William Childs, said the president had previously expressed a desire to be buried at the Old Soldier&#x27;s Home in Washington, D.C., or at West Point. Ulysses wanted his wife Julia to eventually be interred next to him; this eliminated military cemeteries and installations such as West Point, as they did not permit women to be interred. The Grant family decided against burying him at Galena because that site was not easily accessible, and other sites in Springfield, Illinois, and Troy, New York, were also rejected.

=== Creation of Grant Monument Association ===

After Grant died, there were many calls for a monument honoring him. On the same day as Ulysses&#x27;s death, William Russell Grace, the mayor of New York City, sent a telegram to Julia offering New York City as the burial ground for both Grants. Grace gave Julia a list of city parks where her husband could be buried, and she agreed to have Ulysses&#x27;s remains interred in New York City. Grace wrote a letter to prominent New Yorkers on July 24, 1885, to gather support for a national monument in Grant&#x27;s honor:

The preliminary meeting was attended by 85 New Yorkers who established the Committee on Organization. Twenty of the attendees created an executive committee, which was to make decisions on the group&#x27;s behalf. On July 29, the Committee on Organization was incorporated as the Grant Monument Association (GMA). Its chairman was Chester A. Arthur, the 21st U.S. president, and its secretary was Richard Theodore Greener, the first black alumnus of Harvard College. In addition, mayor Grace and former U.S. secretary of state Hamilton Fish were named as vice chairmen, as was financier J. P. Morgan of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. The association had &quot;between 100 and 150&quot; members in total, including numerous sitting and retired politicians. The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York allowed the GMA to use an office in one of its buildings.

=== Site selection and temporary tomb ===
City officials initially planned to bury Ulysses in Central Park, and the Grant family examined three sites in the park. The general public greatly opposed the plans, and the Grant family believed the sites in Central Park were too small to fit both Ulysses and Julia. The family then considered another site in Riverside Park on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side; though the site was undeveloped, many local businessmen and politicians endorsed the park as the Grants&#x27; burial site. On July 28, city officials decided to bury Ulysses in Riverside Park after his family agreed to the change. The Riverside Park site was perched atop a bluff.

The day after the Grant family decided on the site, Jacob Wrey Mould designed a temporary tomb. The structure was rectangular in plan, with a door and a Christian cross facing the Hudson River. It was enclosed by brick walls and a barrel-vaulted roof. Grant&#x27;s coffin was to be placed slightly below ground level, and a semicircular driveway was built around the tomb. Work on the temporary tomb began on July 29 and took nine days to complete. Grant was interred on August 8, following a funeral that attracted up to 1.5 million mourners. The temporary tomb briefly became one of the city&#x27;s most popular sites, with an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 visitors on August 16 alone. Benches were installed in the area, and guidebooks were sold to visitors. Thirty soldiers were stationed outside the tomb, which was nicknamed &quot;Camp Grant&quot;. Many passersby tried to obtain pieces of the tomb. The public continued to visit and leave mementos during late 1885.

The site of the permanent tomb had yet to be finalized when Grant was interred. The city&#x27;s park commissioners had tentatively decided to place the tomb in Riverside Park between 122nd and 127th Streets, but Frederick Law Olmsted, who had co-designed Riverside Park with Calvert Vaux, was unenthusiastic about this plan. By mid-August, the city&#x27;s park commissioners had asked Vaux and engineer William Barclay Parsons to determine the boundaries of a permanent memorial site for Grant&#x27;s tomb. Officials also planned to construct a road north of the tomb to separate it from the rest of Riverside Park. The park commissioners set aside a site on Riverside Drive, between 121st and 124th Streets, for the monument in October 1885. The tomb had spurred real estate development in the area, and the Manhattan Railway Company had proposed constructing an elevated line to the tomb by the end of 1886. Some members of the public claimed the relatively remote site had been selected only to attract tourists and encourage real estate development, although the surrounding area was built up in the 1890s.

=== Fundraising ===

==== Initial efforts and opposition ====
The Grant Monument Association did not originally announce the function or structure of the monument, but the idea drew public support nonetheless. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; had suggested the idea of a permanent monument on July 26, three days after he died. On July 29, the day the GMA was established, Western Union donated $5,000 to the association&#x27;s fund. The GMA continued to receive large and small donations, and the fund surpassed $50,000 in less than a month. At a membership meeting on August 20, the committee set a fundraising goal of $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), spurred by a suggestion from former governor Alonzo B. Cornell. Funding came from such sources as private companies and benefit concerts. Fundraising had slowed down by the end of August 1885, in part because of the GMA members&#x27; lackadaisical attitude, as well as the existence of a competing association with the same name in Illinois.

Although there was great enthusiasm for a monument to Grant, early fundraising efforts were stifled by growing negative public opinion expressed by out-of-state press. The opposition was vocal in the view that the monument should be in Washington, D.C. Grace tried to calm the controversy by publicly releasing Julia&#x27;s justification for the Riverside Park site as the resting place for her husband in October 1885. Even though many major newspapers published Julia&#x27;s statement, this failed to boost fundraising.

There was also discontent with the management of the GMA, whose members were among the city&#x27;s wealthiest but made comparatively small donations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the members as &quot;sitting quietly in an office and signing receipts for money voluntarily tendered&quot;. Furthermore, the GMA still had no definite plan for the monument, which frustrated and discouraged donors. Joan Waugh wrote in her book, &quot;U.S. Grant: American Hero, American Myth&quot;: &quot;Why should citizens give money to build a monument whose shape was still a mystery?&quot; Many of the GMA&#x27;s members also had responsibilities of their own and could not devote their full attention to the project. Ten of the GMA&#x27;s executive meetings were canceled in four months because there were not enough members to form a quorum. The GMA had raised $100,000 by November, and the fund totaled $111,000 by the end of the year, following lackluster fundraising efforts that netted as little as $1.50 on some days.

==== Slowdown in fundraising ====

A bill was proposed in the United States Congress in January 1886, which would have provided $500,000 for the project (later reduced to $250,000). This allocation would have been provided after the GMA had independently raised $250,000, but the bill failed because it did not receive unanimous consent. By February 1886, the fund had raised $115,000, much less than the $500,000 that the association had expected by that time. A new Grant Monument Association was legally incorporated that month, with 29 trustees and four politicians who were &quot;ex officio&quot; members. The reorganized GMA held its first meeting in March, superseding the old association, and had raised either $123,000 or $129,000 by the first anniversary of Grant&#x27;s death. Despite uncertainty over the permanent tomb&#x27;s fate, the temporary tomb hosted events such as a Memorial Day ceremony in May 1886.

U.S. troops continued to patrol Grant&#x27;s tomb until June 1886, when city park police began patrolling the tomb. Although the presence of Grant&#x27;s temporary tomb had attracted visitors to Riverside Park, the number of visitors to the tomb had tapered off by the middle of that year. The fund continued to receive small donations from such sources as a benefit concert at the Metropolitan Opera House and the Nickel Fund Association of Montclair, New Jersey. Julia donated $987.50, while a puzzle contest at the end of 1886 raised another $1,000. The fund had raised only $10,000 during the entire 1886–1887 fiscal year, and it raised the same amount during the following fiscal year. By the late 1880s, some trustees had resigned because of frustration over the fund, and the Grant family was considering interring the former president somewhere else.

== Design and construction ==

=== Unsolicited plans ===
As fundraising slowed down, people began to lose confidence in the Grant Monument Association, and members of the public offered their own proposals for the memorial. &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot; hosted a design competition in late 1885, although some members of the public erroneously thought the competition was an official one. Although the American Institute of Architects (AIA) recommended that the GMA host a formal architectural design competition, the association ignored this advice and did not contact other groups that had built similar monuments. Instead, in October 1885, the GMA started requesting proposals from &quot;artists, architects, and all others&quot;. Richard Greener had drafted plans for a design competition with a $400,000 budget, but the invitations never went out. Although the GMA promised in January 1886 to select a design &quot;at once&quot;, this did not happen.

The association continued to receive proposals through 1886. According to historian David Kahn, one plan by Calvert Vaux was &quot;so complicated that written descriptions give little idea of what it was actually intended to look like&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; said another plan would &quot;frighten people ... completely away from the fund&quot;. By November 1886, the GMA was planning to erect a permanent memorial. Within a few months, the GMA had received &quot;a number of designs, sketches and suggestions&quot; from across America and Europe, with 14 plans being submitted by February 1887. Among the plans the association received were those by American sculptor William Wetmore Story, German sculptor Joseph Echteler, and architect George Matthias. Greener began writing to other groups, such as the Garfield National Monument Association, for advice in early 1887, and he hired Napoleon LeBrun as consulting architect.

=== Design competitions ===

==== First design competition ====

In June 1887, the GMA formally announced a design competition for the memorial, with a deadline of October 31. Under the terms of the competition, the memorial was to be made in bronze, marble, granite, or &quot;other appropriate material&quot;. The GMA did not respond to several requests for clarification, and some days after the deadline, Greener claimed that &quot;no time line had ever been fixed&quot;. The editorial team of &quot;The New York Times&quot; contrasted the GMA&#x27;s inefficiency against the rapid development of the nearby Cathedral of St. John the Divine.

On February 4, 1888, after a year&#x27;s delay, the GMA publicly announced a design competition with a budget of $500,000, although the budget could be increased if necessary. As was common practice at the time, architects were requested to submit their proposals anonymously; the five best plans would receive cash prizes. The AIA objected to the rules of the competition; the GMA ignored both the AIA&#x27;s complaints and those of other architectural associations, though it changed the rules slightly. After many of the competitors requested extra time for their designs, the original deadline of November 1, 1888, was rescheduled twice to January 10, 1889. The GMA had raised $130,000 at the time of the competition.

The first competition received 65 entries, of which 42 came from outside the United States. Some of the plans had been submitted to the &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot; three years earlier, and about one-third of these entries had intact drawings or illustrations by the late 20th century. A panel of six judges selected five winners in April 1889. The winning plan, by Cluss &amp; Schulze of Washington, D.C., called for a mausoleum measuring about across at its base, with a pinnacle measuring high. An equestrian statue of Grant was to be placed in front of the shaft. Though the judges gave out five awards, they did not recommend any of these entries, and many major newspapers, including the &quot;Times&quot;, derided the plans. The &quot;Weekly Mail and Express&quot; donated $10,000 at the end of 1889, increasing the fund to $140,000, and the GMA distributed awards for the competition in February 1890.

==== Second design competition ====

The failure of the first competition damaged the GMA&#x27;s reputation further. The Grand Army of the Republic had proposed a competing plan for a temple on the site, and many out-of-state supported the idea of moving Grant&#x27;s remains to Arlington National Cemetery. The judges for the first competition had recommended in December 1889 that qualified architects be invited to compete in a second competition with more specific rules, and Adolph L. Sanger of the GMA announced at the end of March 1890 that the association would launch a second competition. At the beginning of April, the GMA formally sent out letters to potential competitors. John H. Duncan, Carrère &amp; Hastings, Charles W. Clinton, John Ord, and Napoleon LeBrun were selected to participate. Each contestant was required to design a tall monument with space for a memorial hall and for Ulysses and Julia Grant&#x27;s coffins. In addition, the plans could not cost more than $500,000.

A bill was introduced in Congress in May 1890, which would provide $250,000 for the monument if the GMA raised $200,000. The same month, the GMA opened a gift shop next to the temporary tomb. Though few details of the second competition were publicly announced, numerous architects attempted to compete anyway. The five competitors wanted the deadline to be extended from July to October, but the GMA only gave each competitor until September 1, as the United States Senate had passed a resolution in August to move Grant&#x27;s remains to Arlington. Each architect was invited to explain his plan in front of the GMA&#x27;s executive committee; the designs varied in complexity. On September 9, 1890, the GMA awarded the commission to Duncan, who estimated his design would cost between $496,000 and $900,000. Duncan wrote that he wanted &quot;to produce a monumental structure that should be unmistakably a tomb of military character&quot; and that he wanted to avoid &quot;resemblance of a habitable dwelling&quot;. Duncan&#x27;s plans called for a square base, a cylindrical shaft, and a pyramidal dome, with a portico in the front and an apse in the rear. The runners-up each received $500 checks.

That October, the GMA signed a contract with Duncan. Although there were continued efforts to relocate Grant&#x27;s remains to Arlington, the House of Representatives voted down the Senate&#x27;s resolution in December 1890. While representatives from other states favored relocating the president&#x27;s remains, New York representatives, including Roswell P. Flower and John Raines, were opposed. The GMA had raised only about $150,000 by the start of 1891; the previous four years had netted just $40,000. All &quot;nonessential&quot; design elements, including a $54,000 approach from the Hudson River, were removed from the plans to save money. Although the GMA&#x27;s members had assumed that the permanent tomb would be built on the same site as the temporary tomb, the city&#x27;s park commissioners favored a site slightly to the east, within Claremont Park.

=== Construction ===

==== Foundation and fundraising ====
A groundbreaking ceremony was hosted on April 27, 1891, on what would have been Grant&#x27;s 69th birthday, despite confusion over the site. The next week, the GMA awarded a $18,875 contract to John T. Brady for the foundation&#x27;s construction, and Cornelius Vanderbilt II established a second fund for the Grant Monument. Brady signed a contract for the northern half of the foundation on June 10, and excavations for the foundation began shortly thereafter. The park commissioners and GMA also agreed to build the permanent tomb on the temporary site. Duncan continued to refine and simplify his design through July. After preliminary excavations were completed in August 1891, Brady started constructing the foundation. That October, Brady received a contract for the southern half of the foundation, and the vault holding Grant&#x27;s coffin was relocated. Over the next month, Brady carefully lifted the vault onto the new concrete foundation.

Meanwhile, the GMA was embroiled in internal disputes over leadership, prompting the resignation of its fourth president William H. Grace and several trustees in late 1891. Grant&#x27;s friend Horace Porter took over the organization in early 1892 and served in that position for 27 years. Porter soon moved the organization&#x27;s headquarters, tripled the number of trustees to 100, and discontinued trustees&#x27; salaries. The New York State Legislature did not approve a proposal to rename the organization to the Grant Tomb and Monument Association due to a clerical error. The foundations were completed in March. The same month, Brady received a contract to erect the lowest part of the facade with granite from the Union Granite Company&#x27;s quarries. The GMA&#x27;s new leadership asked Duncan to downsize the monument to save money. Porter also tried to convince the state legislature to give $500,000 for the monument, but the bill was withdrawn after legislators requested a 10% kickback.

The GMA&#x27;s funds had stalled at $155,000, so Porter enlisted businessman Edward F. Cragin to raise money and announced plans on March 22 to raise another $350,000 in four weeks. The group reached out to various businesses and trades across the city. The campaign began nine days later, raising funds through newspaper advertisements and public donation boxes, as well as from 185 committees. Mayor Hugh J. Grant (who was unrelated to the Grants) encouraged everyone to give to the fund on April 8. U.S. president Benjamin Harrison laid the permanent cornerstone on April 27, 1892, at which point the campaign had raised $202,800. Another attempt to obtain $250,000 from Congress failed in late May 1892. The total fund exceeded $500,000 by the end of May, more than enough for the entire project; the GMA had raised $350,000 in these two months. The vast majority of the money came from New Yorkers, and the fundraiser had incurred less than $18,000 in expenses. Fundraising continued through early 1893, at which point $600,000 had been raised from over 90,000 individual donors, making it the world&#x27;s largest fundraiser ever at the time.

==== Progress and completion ====
The temporary tomb was relocated north in May 1892, allowing visitors to see the tomb without disrupting work. A stonecutters&#x27; strike in New England delayed construction for much of that year, lasting six months. Duncan and Porter began acquiring of granite from New England, and Brady was awarded a $104,482 contract to construct the rest of the structure in early 1893. At their annual meeting that February, the GMA&#x27;s trustees awarded a granite contract to the Maine and New Hampshire Granite Company, with a completion date of late 1895. The company was ready to deliver granite for the superstructure by June 1893. However, Brady could not accept the granite because the monument&#x27;s water table needed to be fixed. In response to a media inquiry that October, Duncan blamed the contractors for the delays. By the end of 1893, the water table was the only completed above-ground portion of the tomb.

At the GMA&#x27;s 1894 annual meeting, the trustees changed the completion date to early 1896. Trains began delivering granite to the site in May 1894. After finding that some of the stone had coal-dust stains, Duncan threatened to reject any granite that was stained, and he returned any stones with stains greater than in diameter. The monument had been built to a height of by December 1894, when work was paused due to cold weather. Further slowdowns occurred in early 1895 due to delays in delivering granite and disputes over smoke from a construction hoist. The base had topped out by that May, and the monument had reached when work was paused at the end of the year. Duncan had also begun soliciting estimates for interior work.

The GMA reported at its 1896 meeting that the completion date had been changed to early 1897. Although a dedication was supposed to occur on April 25, before the tomb was even complete, one newspaper reported that &quot;not a flower was to be seen&quot; on Grant&#x27;s birthday two days later. Work on the steel frame of the monument&#x27;s roof had resumed in early 1896, and the roof was completed by the middle of that year, with the scaffolding being removed in July. The Department of Parks announced plans that August to spend $120,000 on terraces and paths around the monument, although the department did not approve several other proposals for the area, which included a system of boulevards leading to the monument. The stonework on the facade was completed the next month. Brady received the contract for the interior work. Although there was originally supposed to be one sarcophagus for both Grants, this was changed to two sarcophagi before the monument was finished. The red granite for Grant&#x27;s sarcophagus was delivered in March 1897. The front doors were installed on April 12, marking the completion of all work.

=== Opening ===
The New York City Board of Estimate budgeted $50,000 in 1896 just for the monument&#x27;s opening ceremony. Grant&#x27;s remains were transferred to the sarcophagus on April 17, 1897, and placed in the mausoleum. Brady was awarded a $20,250 contract to build a temporary triumphal arch and a grandstand for the ceremony. On April 25, two days before the dedication, the tomb had an estimated 200,000 visitors. The state legislature had declared the day of the dedication, April 27, 1897, as a state holiday in four New York City-area counties. The dedication marked what would have been Grant&#x27;s 75th birthday. Despite inclement weather, the dedication drew an estimated one million spectators, as well as more than 50,000 marchers who paraded to the tomb from Madison Square Park to the south.

The grandstand was disassembled after the ceremony, although the temporary arch remained for another month. Bricks from the temporary tomb were sent to Grand Army posts across the U.S.; other members of the public also requested the temporary tomb&#x27;s bricks but were denied. To avoid stampedes, the tomb was closed to the public until the day after the dedication, when between ten and fifteen thousand people entered the monument. Policemen were stationed outside the monument to direct crowds, although a 24-hour patrol of Grant&#x27;s Tomb was withdrawn shortly after the monument opened. Chinese diplomat Yang Yü planted a ginkgo biloba tree next to the tomb in May 1897, honoring Grant on behalf of Li Hongzhang. A memorial tablet was placed near the tree that September.

=== GMA operation ===
The New York City government initially did not provide any appropriation for the tomb&#x27;s maintenance. In November 1897, the Department of Parks agreed to pay the GMA $7,000 annually to maintain the monument for 11 years. George D. Burnside, who had been a foreman during the monument&#x27;s construction, was hired as the first curator, serving for nearly five decades. Julia&#x27;s sarcophagus was placed in the tomb in January 1898. The monument&#x27;s policies included a loud-talking ban and a requirement that men take off their hats. Grant&#x27;s Tomb attracted 560,000 visitors in its first eight months, and it consistently recorded at least 500,000 annual visitors over the next few years. Most visitors arrived to the site by either elevated railway, carriage, bicycle, or boat, although some traveled there on foot. The Grand Army of the Republic hosted annual ceremonies at the tomb on Grant&#x27;s birthday and on Memorial Day until 1929.

==== 1900s to mid-1920s ====
Most visitors in the early 20th century generally adhered to the monument&#x27;s strict rules. Some visitors talked loudly, loitered, vandalized, or roller-skated on the steps, and there were also &quot;relic hunters&quot; who took pieces of the monument. The New York City Board of Estimate provided $300,000 in early 1901 for &quot;general improvements&quot; to the area around Grant&#x27;s Tomb. Julia died on December 14, 1902, and she was placed in her sarcophagus the week afterward. The Grant family also donated to the GMA several thousand letters that Ulysses had written, and battle flags were placed in the reliquary rooms at the tomb&#x27;s northwest and northeast corners in 1903. The GMA requested in early 1904 that the state fund a heating plant in the tomb. The monument had also started to leak, causing the plaster to flake off. As such, in late 1904, workers coated the interior with paraffin wax to reduce leaks; the work was completed the next year.

In its early years, Grant&#x27;s Tomb attracted more visitors than the Statue of Liberty did, with around 600,000 visitors in 1906. The monument also attracted many foreign delegations, as well as ceremonies and demonstrations. The city renewed its contract with the GMA in 1908 for 21 years, continuing to pay the association $7,000 annually. The next year, three policemen were temporarily stationed outside the tomb to deter vandals. A pavilion with restrooms was erected to the west of Grant&#x27;s Tomb in 1910 at a cost of $45,000, replacing a temporary wooden structure there. A set of Japanese cherry trees were planted behind the tomb in 1912. The same year, Duncan recommended &quot;urgent&quot; repairs to the tomb and surrounding pavement, as he believed the foundations had been undermined due to improper drainage. The GMA paid Louis Comfort Tiffany $975 for nine purple stained-glass windows on the monument, which were installed in March 1913. The Parks Department also planned to repair the pavement, and there were plans to install statuary once sufficient funds had been raised. A wooden booth for the staff was installed next to the entrance in 1915.

The number of visitors was in decline by the 1910s, in part since many Civil War veterans were dying, and many younger Americans were unaware of Grant&#x27;s importance to previous generations. World War I and the growing popularity of amusement parks, theaters, and sports also negatively impacted visitor numbers; by the end of the 1910s, the tomb had only 300,000 annual visitors. The tomb was originally illuminated by gas jets at night, but these were replaced by electric lamps in 1923. Additionally, the tomb continued to have drainage problems: by 1925, one corner was sagging by . This prompted the city to rebuild the plaza outside the tomb in a project which was completed in 1927. During the 1920s, there were several plans to complete the statuary on the tomb, but this had been complicated by Duncan&#x27;s indecision over the designs. A grove of trees outside the tomb was dedicated in 1928.

==== 1920s and 1930s renovation ====
Multiple modifications, including a statue of Grant on horseback outside Grant&#x27;s Tomb, were announced in February 1929. This was part of a larger plan designed by John Russell Pope, which included a pediment above the main entrance and an expanded entrance plaza. The GMA began raising funds that month, with plans to obtain $400,000, and the city&#x27;s Municipal Art Commission approved Pope&#x27;s plans that March. Pope signed a contract to design the renovation in June 1929, and the GMA had raised $121,000 by September. With the Wall Street Crash of 1929 later the same year, fundraising slowed significantly, but the project was not officially canceled until 1933. Grant&#x27;s Tomb recorded fewer than 100,000 annual visitors for the first time in its history in 1933, and visitor counts had decreased to fewer than 500 a day. The annual ceremonies at Grant&#x27;s Tomb were drawing fewer and fewer people, and vandalism was becoming more common. The facade had also become dirty over time.

In 1934, the city again renewed its contract with the GMA for 21 years; the $7,000 annual payment was not changed to adjust for inflation. Some of Pope&#x27;s plans were carried out later in the decade. There were plans to clean the monument by July 1935, and Works Progress Administration (WPA) laborers installed new marble flooring that December. According to Joan Waugh, WPA funding and the sale of souvenirs helped keep the tomb solvent. Exposed cables were relocated inside the walls during 1936, and workers completed a 14-month renovation of the roof and part of the interior in May 1937 at a cost of $22,500. In June, the GMA hired Dean Fausett to design two murals of battle maps, which were completed the next year. Swinging racks, bronze markers, a lamp, and a brass lectern were also added for visitors&#x27; benefit. The GMA announced in late 1937 that it would complete the renovation before the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair started.

Numerous modifications were made to Grant&#x27;s Tomb in 1938, including the installation of a heating plant and an air-conditioning system. Workers also installed anti-bird screens, built a plaza around the monument, cleaned the interior of the dome, and relocated the curator&#x27;s office to the southeast corner. Two eagle statues from the New York City Post Office were relocated to the tomb, and the purple stained-glass panels in nine windows were replaced with amber panels. Artists William Mues and Jeno Juszko designed five busts of Union Army generals around the crypt as part of the Federal Art Project. Four hundred and fifty WPA workers ultimately completed the project by January 1939. Workers installed two flagpoles and exterior floodlights in early April 1939, and the GMA rededicated the tomb on Grant&#x27;s 117th birthday. The renovation cost either $300,000 or $450,000, of which the GMA paid around $90,000.

==== 1940s and 1950s ====
During the 1930s renovation, the GMA had attempted to add an equestrian statue outside the tomb, which never occurred. The GMA first proposed relocating an existing statue in Brooklyn in 1938; although parks commissioner Robert Moses supported this plan, residents of the borough heavily opposed it. GMA president Herbert L. Satterlee and Grant&#x27;s grandson Ulysses S. Grant III rejected a model of the statue created by a sculptor named Flinta, as well as another design from William Mues. George D. Burnside&#x27;s son George G. Burnside took over as the monument&#x27;s curator in 1940. After the American entry into World War II, the GMA considered closing the monument. The monument ultimately remained open, but the sarcophagi were covered by tarpaulin sheets at night between 1942 and 1945 to protect them from air raid damage. In addition, a silk sheet donated by Japanese citizens was removed in 1944. Vandalism continued to occur, as in 1942 when the cork tree next to the tomb was damaged, and the tomb also saw fewer visitors over the years.

By the end of World War II, the tomb was only guarded by New York City Police Department officers when they patrolled the neighborhood. Although annual attendance increased to about 125,000 by the late 1940s, the tomb was becoming dilapidated. There were continued efforts to fund an equestrian statue outside the tomb after the war. The city finally increased its annual appropriation to the GMA in the early 1950s, but even with the increased appropriation, the GMA recorded a net profit of only $230 in 1952. Much of the organization&#x27;s funding still came from the city, and annual maintenance costs had reached $11,635 by the mid-1950s.

At its 1953 and 1954 meetings, GMA trustees discussed the possibility of transferring the monument to the federal government, but no action was taken in either case. The GMA also wrote a letter to U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose secretary rejected the plan, though Eisenhower sent a team to look at the site in late 1955. State lawmakers introduced two bills to transfer the land and the tomb&#x27;s operation to the federal government in January 1956, and the governor signed the land-transfer bill that March. U.S. representative Herbert Zelenko introduced a bill in early 1957 to transfer the tomb&#x27;s operation to the United States Department of the Interior, and Eisenhower signed the bill in August 1958 after Congress approved it. The move was expected to save the city $13,000 per year and would cost the federal government $19,000 annually. The Board of Estimate voted to give the site to the federal government in November; the tomb had recorded over 18.6 million all-time visitors at the time.

=== NPS operation ===
The National Park Service (NPS) took over the operations of Grant&#x27;s Tomb on May 1, 1959, without any ceremony. The structure was officially renamed the General Grant National Memorial. Thomas Pitkin, the tomb&#x27;s newly appointed historian, wanted to renovate Grant&#x27;s Tomb to emphasize its role as a memorial rather than as a tomb. Ulysses S. Grant III requested that the NPS keep his grandparents&#x27; bodies there.

==== 1960s and 1970s renovations ====
After taking over Grant&#x27;s Tomb, the NPS wanted to add an equestrian statue, install a pediment, modify the roof, and improve pedestrian flow around the memorial. In 1961, the NPS announced plans to spend $200,000 on an equestrian statue and repairs to the tomb. The NPS dropped plans for the pediment that year, but it did make some minor changes, such as the addition of new labels and a telephone, as well as replacement of display panels. Paul Manship, who had designed a model of a statue for the GMA three decades earlier, was hired to design the statue; amid strong opposition, the statue was canceled in 1962. Pitkin proposed installing colorful lunette murals within the memorial in 1962, and the NPS also installed floodlights to deter loitering. The memorial was documented in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1963. Grant&#x27;s Tomb continued to record 300,000 annual visitors during the mid-1960s, even as it was being vandalized frequently.

The GMA transferred $20,000 to the NPS in 1964 to help pay for the installation of two mosaic murals; the NPS also spent $10,000 on a third mural. The NPS hired Allyn Cox to design the murals. The GMA officially dissolved itself in April 1965, using its last $9,095.50 to buy a model of an equestrian statue by Manship, which was then displayed in the tomb. Cox&#x27;s murals were dedicated in May 1966, and additional modifications took place throughout the decade. The tomb was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, at which point annual patronage dropped to 120,000. The NPS also loosened restrictions within the memorial, allowing visitors to see the crypt and take pictures for the first time. In the late 1960s, the NPS painted over two of the WPA-era murals and replaced them with portraits; two other murals were revised to include portraits of African Americans. By the end of the decade, annual patronage had declined to 95,300.

In 1970, NPS workers demolished bronze cases that had displayed battle flags. The flags themselves, as well as some letters and other documents, were placed into storage; the documents were stored under a water heater, where they were damaged significantly. That year, more floodlights were added to the memorial. Beginning in 1972, the granite benches around the memorial were replaced with mosaic-tile benches designed by Pedro Silva. The benches were intended to discourage graffiti on the tomb, which by then cost $11,000 a year to remove. Initially budgeted at $20,000, the benches ended up costing $50,000 and took two years to complete. The NPS added fans and reinforced the steel frame of the roof from 1973 to early 1974. This was followed later the same year by a repainting of the dome and barrel vaults inside the monument, which required a two-month closure of Grant&#x27;s Tomb in late 1974. Both the facade and interior of the tomb were designated as city landmarks in 1975.

==== Late 1970s to early 1990s ====
By the 1970s, the tomb was vandalized and graffitied on a regular basis, and homeless persons, drug users, and muggers frequented the memorial. Local residents reported that the sculptures around the tomb were generally spared from graffiti, though there were calls to remove the sculptures, which had decreased by the 1980s. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the mausoleum as a city landmark in 1975; the designation applied to both the facade and the interior. The visitor pavilion west of Grant&#x27;s Tomb closed in the 1970s, and annual patronage bottomed out at just over 35,000 in 1979. Meanwhile, the NPS was largely unsuccessful in its attempts to prevent graffiti and other damage. Even when the tomb was repaired, it was often damaged again; for example, the eagle statues were damaged so frequently that the NPS procured several replacement beaks for these sculptures. The NPS spent $50,000 to renovate the tomb from 1982 to 1984, at which point the tomb averaged 75,000 visitors per year. The NPS hired security guards to patrol the tomb, but vandals simply waited until the guards&#x27; shifts ended. The tomb&#x27;s entire staff consisted of two janitors and one person handing out pamphlets, and there were no longer guided tours. The upper level was closed because of staff shortages.

Newspapers regularly reported on crimes at the tomb in the late 1980s and early 1990s, describing the monument as a frequent site for public urination and defecation, drug use, and muggings. Funding cuts forced the NPS to close the memorial on Sundays starting in 1986. There was no nighttime security in the early 1990s, and the memorial was open for only eight hours on Wednesdays through Sundays. The exhibits had become neglected, and the public had largely forgotten about the tomb itself: according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, many tourists did not know whose tomb it was. One rare photo of Grant was not replaced after being stolen, while another photo depicted the wrong person. Preservationists estimated in 1993 that the monument only had 40,000 annual visitors, even though the NPS claimed the memorial had 100,000 visitors per year.

The federal government gave the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation $300,000 for a restoration of the tomb&#x27;s long-closed visitor pavilion in 1989. Meanwhile, the monument itself continued to fall into disrepair. NPS superintendent Georgette Nelms said the graffiti on the facade was deterring visitors and prompting concerned letters from around the world. The memorial also had leaks in its roof and cracks on its pillars. The interior had peeling paint, and the facade was being damaged by the chemical solution that was used to wipe away the graffiti. By contrast, Robert E. Lee&#x27;s burial site at University Chapel was well-maintained and open seven days a week. The dilapidated conditions at Grant&#x27;s Tomb also contrasted with the well-kept nature of Columbia University&#x27;s campus a few blocks away, as well as nearby churches such as Riverside Church.

==== 1990s restoration ====
 Frank Scaturro, a Columbia University student, launched an effort to restore the tomb after he became a volunteer park ranger in 1991. Scaturro recalled that homeless people and drug users still congregated around the tomb and that it was common to smell human waste and drugs there. Early the next year, the NPS proposed several options for improving the exhibits in Grant&#x27;s Tomb. Scaturro sent weekly memos to the NPS for over two years, to no avail. He published a 325-page whistleblower report in 1993 and sent it to news media, as well as government officials including U.S. president Bill Clinton and members of Congress. After WNBC aired a report on the tomb&#x27;s condition in November 1993, the NPS fired Scaturro, who said &quot;whistle-blowing was the last resort&quot;. Grant&#x27;s descendants called Scaturro a hero for his advocacy. The same year, George M. Craig formed a group known as the Friends of Grant&#x27;s Tomb to advocate for the memorial&#x27;s restoration; the group could not raise the $11.5 million that the NPS said was required for the tomb.

By the end of 1993, the NPS&#x27;s Manhattan office was considering numerous options to restore the monument. The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; reported in March 1994 that Scaturro had spent $2,000 of his own money to improve the tomb&#x27;s condition. He also reestablished the Grant Monument Association, although the newly reconstituted GMA was not involved in the tomb&#x27;s operation. The bad condition of the tomb had prompted several proposals to relocate the Grants&#x27; remains. The Illinois General Assembly approved a resolution by lawmaker Judy Baar Topinka in March 1994, asking the NPS to either restore Grant&#x27;s Tomb or move the remains to Illinois. Scaturro and one of Grant&#x27;s descendants, Ulysses Grant Deitz, sued the NPS the next month, claiming the agency had left the structure to rot. A bill to relocate the Grants&#x27; remains was also introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. Politicians from Grant&#x27;s birth state of Ohio wanted the remains to be relocated there instead.

Following the lawsuit and relocation proposals, the NPS requested $850,000 in federal funds to renovate the tomb over the next two years. The agency was also working on a long-term plan for Grant&#x27;s Tomb and needed $250,000 per year for extra security around the monument. The same year, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation to restore the tomb before its centennial. This plan provided up to $375,000 for the memorial&#x27;s renovation, a move that Scaturro and Deitz criticized as insufficient. Deitz still threatened to move Ulysses and Julia Grant&#x27;s remains elsewhere unless the memorial was fully restored before 1997. Ultimately, $1.8 million was provided for the tomb&#x27;s renovation.

The exterior was renovated first, followed by the interior. The NPS used an abrasive and chemicals to clean the facade, and it replaced the leaking roof. In addition, new displays and mechanical systems were added, and the NPS spent $80,000 to restore one of Fausett&#x27;s two murals. Bronze trophy cases were placed in the memorial to replace older cases that had been destroyed. During the restoration, the NPS attempted to disassemble &quot;The Rolling Bench&quot;; this prompted protests, so the NPS ultimately kept the benches. The facade and roof modifications had been completed by 1995, and the NPS had hired additional guards to patrol the memorial 24 hours a day. The tomb was rededicated on April 27, 1997, its 100th anniversary and Grant&#x27;s 175th birthday, with a parade and a two-day-long celebration attended by 1,300 people.

==== Post-renovation and 21st century ====
The renovated Grant&#x27;s Tomb recorded 126,432 visitors in 1997, a 32-year high, and the memorial also recorded over 100,000 annual visitors during the next two years. Although the Grants&#x27; descendants were satisfied with the renovation, Topinka continued to advocate for relocating the Grants&#x27; remains. During the early 21st century, the memorial continued to record about 100,000 annual visitors, or fewer than 300 daily visitors. Many of the visitors were American Civil War enthusiasts. The visitor center on the western side of Riverside Drive remained abandoned through the early 2000s. The New York City government gave the NPS an easement in 2004, allowing the NPS to begin restoring the pavilion. The visitor center reopened on April 27, 2011. By then, the tomb recorded 120,000 annual visitors.

Parts of the memorial had again begun to fall into disrepair by the late 2010s, with such issues as peeling paint, cracks, rusted flagpoles, and water damage. &quot;AM New York Metro&quot; reported in 2018 that the memorial needed $777,355 for repainting and for repairs to the stairs and pathways. Although U.S. senator Chuck Schumer had pledged money to restore the memorial in 2019, it still saw occasional vandalism, such as during the early 2019 federal government shutdown when the memorial was vandalized. Scaturro, who by then was the president of the Grant Monument Association, advocated for federal and city officials to add security and refurbish the memorial. Due to staffing shortages, the memorial had to close on Mondays and Tuesdays; even on days when Grant&#x27;s Tomb was open, visitors were only allowed into the memorial on alternating hours. Scaturro also wanted the city and federal governments to help fund the addition of a finial atop the tomb.

== Description ==
The design of Grant&#x27;s Tomb was inspired by ancient Greek and Roman structures, in particular the Pantheon, Rome. Duncan may have taken some elements of his design, such as dimensions, from his onetime classmate Henry O. Avery, who created a drawing for the monument in 1885. This has not been substantiated, as Avery died in 1890 before construction started. The Ionic colonnade of the upper section may have been inspired by a design created by an architect named Bernier, although Bernier&#x27;s blueprints were not published until 1892 at the earliest.

=== Site ===
Grant&#x27;s Tomb is in the median of Riverside Drive at 122nd Street in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It occupies a high bluff, standing above mean high water. The northbound lanes of Riverside Drive abut the memorial to the east, while the southbound lanes are to the west. The area near the memorial is served by the M5, M4, and M104 routes of MTA Regional Bus Operations, while the of the New York City Subway stops at 125th Street and Broadway. The mausoleum is not wheelchair-accessible. It is generally open Wednesday through Sunday, year-round, although the tomb is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s Day.

A granite plaza, dating from the late 1930s, surrounds the tomb. Two flagpoles with brass plaques were erected within the plaza during the 1930s. The western flagpole commemorates Frederick Dent Grant—the first son of Ulysses and Julia Grant—and contains an American flag. The eastern flagpole commemorates Horace Porter and contains Grant&#x27;s four-star general&#x27;s flag. There is also a grove of trees, which was not part of the original design for the memorial&#x27;s grounds. The area north of Grant&#x27;s Tomb has several ginkgo trees, as well as a Chinese cork, which date from Li Hongzhang&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1897. There is also a commemorative tablet from Li&#x27;s visit.

A visitor center or pavilion is located across Riverside Drive to the west of the mausoleum and contains a bookstore, a community space, and restrooms. This pavilion displays memorabilia and a movie about Grant&#x27;s life. The visitor center, dating from 1910, is a classical-style pavilion designed by Theodore E. Videto. The structure is made of granite and supported by Doric columns, with restrooms on a lower level. The visitor center is wheelchair-accessible.

==== Art and other memorials ====
According to NYC Parks, &quot;some popular local folk art in Riverside Park contrasts strikingly with the Tomb&#x27;s severity&quot;. Among these is &quot;The Rolling Bench&quot;, a sculpture consisting of 17 concrete benches bearing colorful mosaics. Completed in 1972, it was designed by artist Pedro Silva and built with help from local residents. The benches depict various scenes, animals, people, objects, and fictional characters in addition to Grant himself. The project was sponsored by the nonprofit organization CITYarts. The sculpture was restored during mid-2008 under Silva&#x27;s supervision.

There are two other memorials in the vicinity of Grant&#x27;s Tomb. The General Horace Porter memorial, at 122nd Street, is a flagpole on a pedestal dedicated in 1939. Another flagpole on a pedestal, &quot;Major General Frederick D. Grant&quot;, was also dedicated at 122nd Street in 1939.

=== Form and facade ===
The structure is tall. It uses as little glass as possible to give the impression that the monument &quot;would last through the ages&quot;. The total height was downsized from to save money. Until Riverside Church to the east was completed in 1930, Grant&#x27;s Tomb was the tallest structure in the area.

The exterior is made of North Jay, Maine, granite. The facade is modeled after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, with some differences, including the design of the roofline. The base of the tomb is shaped almost like a cube (actually a rectangular prism), measuring high. The base measures ; it was originally intended to be but was downsized to save money. Although the upper section of Grant&#x27;s Tomb is cylindrical, in contrast to the square Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, both structures had a similarly proportioned base and peristyle. Due to the tomb&#x27;s design, early visitors mistook it for a bank, house of worship, library, post office, or mansion, while later visitors confused it with the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument to the south.

==== Base ====

The main entrance is through a -wide set of stairs facing a plaza to the south, which leads to a hexastyle portico with fluted columns in the Doric order. The portico is supported by ten columns, which are grouped into two rows. There are six columns at the front of the portico. Atop the columns is a Doric entablature with wreaths and circular bosses, as well as stone blocks above each column on the portico&#x27;s cornice. Early plans for Grant&#x27;s Tomb called for the installation of equestrian statues, depicting generals who led the Union Army, on each stone block. The wooden entrance doors, made by Borkelt &amp; Debevoise, measure wide by tall and weigh in total. The doors are covered with 296 rosettes, which conceal parchment papers with dozens of New Yorkers&#x27; signatures.

Behind the portico is the memorial&#x27;s rectangular base. There is a cornice and a sloped parapet running around the perimeter of the rectangular base. At the center of the base&#x27;s southern elevation, above the portico, is a plaque with the inscription &quot;Let us have peace&quot;, referring to Grant&#x27;s acceptance statement after the Republican Party nominated him as its candidate for the 1868 United States presidential election. On either side of the plaque are female figures, which may have been derived from those on the Medici Tomb; these were designed by J. Massey Rhind and represent peace and victory. The western, northern, and eastern elevations have colonnades of Doric columns supporting an entablature, with six columns on each elevation. In contrast to the southern elevation, the other three elevations have small square openings between each column, and the parapet above each colonnade is flat. There is a fret molding below the northern elevation&#x27;s colonnade. A similar fret molding on the western and eastern elevations was scrapped for lack of money.

==== Upper section ====

The memorial&#x27;s upper section contains a cylindrical drum with an Ionic colonnade, which measures about across. Behind the colonnade is an inner wall that rises to the monument&#x27;s roof. The columns support an entablature, as well as a cornice with palmettes and bosses. Above the cornice, there are pilasters and panels on the inner wall of the colonnade. There is a stepped cone above the inner wall, with a capstone weighing . When Duncan designed Grant&#x27;s Tomb, he had intended for the cone&#x27;s shape to evoke that of the Egyptian pyramids, where Egyptian monarchs were buried. Early plans for the monument called for a statue of Grant to be placed atop the cone, although it was not built. There is also an observation deck about above ground.

=== Interior ===
The interior has a cruciform layout, with arms extending off all four sides of a rectangular space. It is clad with white marble from Lee, Massachusetts. The maximum distance from arm to arm is . The design was strongly inspired by the interior of Napoleon&#x27;s tomb at Les Invalides, Paris. Rhind was responsible for the original interior decorations. The entire tomb rests on a foundation measuring deep.

==== Main level ====
The center of the memorial&#x27;s main room is topped by a circular dome with coffers. The dome measures across and is surrounded by a balcony or gallery. The gallery contains 12 openings, separated by pilasters with eagle sculptures at their capitals. Each opening contains a pair of Ionic columns, topped by pairs of panels with wreaths and shields. There were originally supposed to be 13 openings to represent the Thirteen Colonies, with seals in each opening. At each corner of the room, the dome is supported by piers measuring high. Above these piers are pendentives depicting various eras of Grant&#x27;s life, which include allegorical figures sculpted by Rhind. The southeast pendentive represents Grant&#x27;s birth; the southwest pendentive depicts his time in the military; the northwest pendentive symbolizes his time as a politician and statesman; and the northeast pendentive signifies his death.

There are barrel vaults with coffered panels above each of the arms; these vaults measure high. The western, northern, and eastern arms each have three square windows with amber-colored glass, which date to a 1930s renovation. The southern arm contains a pair of bronze doors. The lunettes above the windows, and below the barrel vaults, feature mosaics designed in 1966 by Allyn Cox. These mosaic murals measure high by across. The battles of Chattanooga, Appomattox, and Vicksburg are depicted in the murals on the western, northern, and eastern walls respectively.

At the southwestern and southeastern corners of the main room are spiral staircases under quarter-domed skylights, which lead to the gallery. Before the tomb opened, Duncan decided not to open the gallery to the public. There are circular reliquary rooms with false domes to the northwest and northeast of the main room. The reliquary rooms contained murals by Dean Fausett, which each measured and depicted maps of Civil War battle sites. The northwestern room&#x27;s mural depicted battles between Pennsylvania and North Carolina, while the northeastern room&#x27;s mural depicted battles between North Carolina and Florida. The murals were painted over in the 1960s, but one mural was restored in the 1990s. By the 1990s, there were exhibits about the monument&#x27;s construction, the Black community of Upper Manhattan, and the lifetime of Ulysses S. Grant.

==== Crypt ====
The northern arm contains a double staircase descending to the crypt, which is at ground level. Ulysses and Julia Grant are placed in identical separate red-granite sarcophagi placed side by side beneath the center of the dome. The granite was quarried by the Berlin and Montello Granite Company of Wisconsin and was selected for its visual similarity to the material used in Napoleon&#x27;s tomb. Each sarcophagus measures across. Under both sarcophagi is a single gray-blue granite pedestal measuring high and across. A plaque with the name of each Grant is placed on either sarcophagus. A balustrade separates the sarcophagi from a corridor that wraps around the crypt.

The outer wall of the crypt is divided by square piers, which support an entablature and a ceiling with paneling. On the wall are five niches with busts depicting Union generals in the Civil War. The busts depict William T. Sherman, Phillip H. Sheridan, George H. Thomas, James B. McPherson, and Edward Ord. William Mues designed the busts of Sheridan and Sherman, while Jens Juszko designed the other three.

== Activities ==
Jazz concerts have been hosted outside the tomb since at least 1975. Since then, concerts have regularly been held at or just outside Grant&#x27;s Tomb. Examples include Jazzmobile, Inc.&#x27;s annual Free Outdoor Summer Mobile Concerts at Grant&#x27;s Tomb. The annual Grant&#x27;s Tomb Summer Concert also featured West Point&#x27;s United States Military Academy Band in 2009. A ceremony is held at the memorial every year on April 27, Grant&#x27;s birthday.

Starting in the late 20th century, &quot;Harlem Week&quot; events took place outside Grant&#x27;s Tomb. According to &quot;About...Time&quot; magazine, &quot;While many African Americans may never have visited the lesser-known sites, everybody in the New York City area knows Grant&#x27;s Tomb&quot; because of Harlem Week. During the late 20th and 21st centuries, television station WNBC-TV also hosted Independence Day television specials featuring Grant&#x27;s Tomb in the background. These specials have showcased performers such as Bon Jovi and Beyoncé. Other events at the tomb have included a spring picnic hosted by Bette Midler&#x27;s New York Restoration Project.

=== Critical reception ===

==== Contemporary commentary ====
When the design for Grant&#x27;s Tomb was announced in 1890, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;disinterested and competent observers must agree that the choice was well made&quot;, while the &quot;Brooklyn Citizen&quot; called the design &quot;worthy of the man and a credit to the great metropolis&quot;. Architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler described the design as &quot;by far the best&quot; of the five submitted in the second design competition. Duncan received several architectural awards in the years after he received the commission. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; wrote in 1895: &quot;It is a comparatively easy task to construct a mere tomb or monument, but a very great difficulty is presented in a monumental tomb, and the task has been successfully accomplished.&quot;

David Kahn wrote that, after Grant&#x27;s Tomb opened, the site &quot;was praised as being superior to that of Napoleon&#x27;s, Hadrian&#x27;s or Theoderic&#x27;s mausoleums&quot;. One newspaper called the structure &quot;our one great memorial of the struggle for union&quot;, while another described it as &quot;remarkably white and marble-like in appearance&quot;. &quot;Park and Cemetery&quot; magazine wrote in May 1897 that Grant&#x27;s Tomb was &quot;an appropriate memorial to a man worthy of a nation&#x27;s tribute&quot;. During the 1900s, the design of Grant&#x27;s Tomb inspired that of the McKinley National Memorial in Ohio.

Not all reception was positive: local newspapers variously referred to the design as &quot;cheap&quot;, &quot;flimsy&quot;, &quot;squat&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot;, &quot;clumsy&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;, and &quot;awkward&quot;. A critic for the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; wrote in 1896 that the monument &quot;is hardly harmonious height. A cenotaph stands rather irrelevantly upon a temple ... The profile lines are stiff, and the feeling is not flowing ...&quot; After the tomb opened, one magazine praised the interior and called the facade &quot;imposing, well proportioned and dignified&quot;, but it labeled the western and eastern elevations as &quot;lacking in interest&quot; and described the tomb&#x27;s two sections as being out of scale with each other. &quot;The Builder&quot; magazine similarly took issue with the scale of the exterior, and it described the &quot;motif of the interior&quot; as plainer than that of Les Invalides, but still wrote that &quot;it is entitled to rank among the most notable monuments in America&quot;. One editorial in the &quot;Times&quot; in 1910 dubbed the structure a &quot;mausoleum monstrosity&quot;.

==== Later commentary ====
After the benches around Grant&#x27;s Tomb were added in 1974, they were controversial. Ulysses Grant&#x27;s great-granddaughter Edith Grant Griffiths, who said &quot;they certainly clash with that severe and dignified building&quot;, while the Ulysses S. Grant Association&#x27;s president compared the benches to having a roller coaster outside the Lincoln Memorial. Conversely, architecture critic Paul Goldberger praised the benches as &quot;perhaps Manhattan&#x27;s finest piece of folk art of our time&quot;, and the AIA compared the benches to the buildings designed by Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona.

Of the monument itself, the &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot; wrote in 1939: &quot;The high conical roof slopes downward to a circular colonnade atop the cube of the main hall; the difficult problem of uniting the three forms harmoniously remains unsolved.&quot; Former city parks commissioner August Heckscher II wrote in 1977 that the tomb was &quot;among the comparatively few structures in the city that are absolutely safe&quot; and that &quot;one feels that the city is better for these evocations of a patriotic spirit so at odds with modernity&quot;. In 1980, Goldberger called the monument &quot;more pompous than graceful, but it &quot;is&quot; imposing, particularly from within...&quot; Robert A. M. Stern and the co-authors of his 1983 book &quot;New York 1900&quot; said Duncan&#x27;s design &quot;embodied not so much the character of Grant, a character who outlived his reputation, but to create an American Valhalla, a shrine to American power&quot;.

The 2010 edition of the &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; described the tomb as a &quot;pompous sepulcher&quot; and the benches &quot;a populist huzzah for the solemn Grants&quot;. The same year, an author for &quot;The Record&quot; of New Jersey wrote that &quot;chances are you can&#x27;t think of anyone—not even your rich Uncle Midas—who has a final resting place grander than Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s&quot;. Ralph Gardner Jr. of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in 2015: &quot;The tomb, designed by John Duncan and based on an ancient Greek mausoleum, is relatively stark without being uninviting.&quot;

=== Media ===
The author Louis Picone wrote that, after Grant&#x27;s Tomb was completed, it was &quot;one of the most recognizable structures in America&quot;. In its early years, the memorial was featured in many commemorative postcards, as well as the short films &quot;Personal&quot; (1904) and &quot;How a French Nobleman Got a Wife Through the New York Herald Personal Columns&quot; (1904). In the mid-20th century, Grant&#x27;s Tomb continued to be mentioned in such media works as &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936). As Grant&#x27;s Tomb declined physically at the end of the century, it was also shown in movies such as the 1991 crime thriller &quot;New Jack City&quot;. During the 21st century, Grant&#x27;s Tomb was also featured in shows such as &quot;Pan Am&quot;, where it stood in for a location in Paris.

When the comedian Groucho Marx&#x27;s quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; aired from 1950 to 1959, he often asked contestants, &quot;Who was buried in Grant&#x27;s Tomb?&quot; The correct answer is &quot;no one&quot;; since neither of the Grants&#x27; sarcophagi is underground, nobody is buried in Grant&#x27;s Tomb. Marx accepted the answer &quot;Grant&quot; and awarded a consolation prize to those who gave it. The riddle dates to at least the 1930s.

<doc id="406055" wikidata="Q333804" url="?curid=406055" title="Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns">
<text>Hugh McCalmont Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns (27 December 1819 – 2 April 1885) was an Anglo-Irish statesman who served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain during the first two ministries of Benjamin Disraeli. He was one of the most prominent Conservative statesmen in the House of Lords during this period of Victorian politics. He served as the seventeenth Chancellor of the University of Dublin between 1867 and 1885.

==Background and education==
Cairns was born at Cultra, County Down, Ireland. His father, William Cairns, formerly a captain in the 47th regiment, came from a family of Scottish origin which moved to Ireland around 1715. Hugh Cairns was the second son, and was educated at Belfast Academy and at Trinity College Dublin, graduating with a senior moderatorship in classics in 1838. In 1844, he was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple, to which he had moved from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

==Legal and political career==
During his first years at the Chancery Bar, Cairns showed little eloquence. He was so slow and diffident that he feared for his legal career. However, in 1852, he entered parliament as member for Belfast, and he became a QC in 1856. In 1858, Cairns was appointed Solicitor-General and was knighted.

In May of that year, he made two of his most brilliant and best-remembered speeches in the House of Commons. In the first, he defended the action of Lord Ellenborough, who, as President of the Board of Control, had not only censured Lord Canning for a proclamation issued by him as Governor-General of India but had made public the despatch in which the censure was conveyed. On the other occasion referred to, Cairns spoke in opposition to Lord John Russell&#x27;s amendment to the motion for the second reading of the government Reform Bill, winning the approval of Benjamin Disraeli. Disraeli&#x27;s appreciation found an opportunity for displaying itself some years later, when in 1868 he invited him to be Lord Chancellor in the brief Conservative administration which followed Lord Derby&#x27;s resignation of the party leadership. Meanwhile, Cairns had maintained his reputation in debate, both when his party was in power and when it was in opposition.

In 1866, Lord Derby, returning to office, appointed Cairns Attorney General, and in the same year he had availed himself of a vacancy to seek the comparative rest of the Court of Appeal. While a Lord Justice he had been offered a peerage, and though at first unable to accept it, he had finally done so when a relative provided the means necessary for the endowment of a title. The appointment of Baron Cairns as Lord Chancellor in 1868 meant superseding Lord Chelmsford, an act apparently carried out by Disraeli with little tact. Chelmsford declared that he had been sent away with less courtesy than if he had been a butler, but the testimony of Lord Malmesbury is that the affair was the result of an understanding arrived at when Lord Chelmsford took office. Disraeli held office on this occasion for only a few months. In 1869, Cairns succeeded Lord Malmesbury as the leader of the Conservative opposition in the House of Lords.

He had distinguished himself in the Commons by his resistance to the Roman Catholics Oath Bill brought in 1865; in the Lords, his efforts on behalf of the Church of Ireland were equally strenuous. His speech on Gladstone&#x27;s Suspensory Bill was afterwards published as a pamphlet, but the attitude which he and the peers who followed him had taken up, in insisting on their amendments to the preamble of the bill, was one difficult to maintain, and Lord Cairns made terms with Lord Granville in circumstances which precluded his consulting his party first. He issued a circular to explain his action. The incident appears to have demonstrated his statesmanship, for he secured concessions which would have been irretrievably lost by continued opposition. Not long after this, Lord Cairns resigned the leadership of his party in the upper house, but resumed it in 1870 and opposed the Irish Land Bill in that year. Upon the Conservatives&#x27; return to power in 1874, he again became Lord Chancellor; in 1878 he was created Viscount Garmoyle and Earl Cairns; and, in 1880, his party went out of office.

In opposition he did not take as prominent a part as previously, but when Disraeli (by then created Earl of Beaconsfield) died in 1881, there were some Conservatives who considered that his claim to lead the party was better than that of Lord Salisbury. His health, never robust, had for many years shown intermittent signs of failing. He had periodically made enforced retirements to the Riviera, and for many years had had a house at Bournemouth, where he died.

Lord Cairns was a great supporter of Barnardo&#x27;s and was called upon by Dr. Thomas John Barnardo to open his first girl&#x27;s home at Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, on 9 July 1876. Today Cairns house still stands on the one remaining green at Barkingside which was built by the children of England in memory of the First President of Dr Barnardo&#x27;s Homes, The Right Honourable Earl Cairns. Cairns House was officially opened 6 August 1887.

==Legacy==
His influence upon the legislation of the day was largely felt where questions affecting religion and the Church were involved and in matters peculiarly affecting his own profession. His power was felt, as has been said, both when he was in office and when his party was in opposition. He had been chairman of the committee on judicature reform, and although he was not in office when the Judicature Acts were passed, all the reforms in the legal procedure of his day owed much to him. He took part, when out of office, in the passing of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882, and was directly responsible for the Conveyancing Acts, and for the Settled Land Act. Many other statutes in which be was largely concerned might be quoted. His judgments are to be found in the Law Reports and those who wish to consider his oratory should read the speeches above referred to, or that delivered in the House of Lords on the Compensation for Disturbance Bill in 1880, and his memorable criticism of Mr Gladstone&#x27;s policy in the Transvaal, after Majuba Hill.

==Family==
Lord Cairns married, in 1856, Mary Harriet, eldest daughter of John MacNeile, of County Antrim, by whom he had five sons and two daughters:

* Hugh Cairns (died 1858), died in infancy
* Lady Lilias Charlotte Cairns (1860–1889), married Rev. Henry Nevile Sherbrooke
* Arthur William Cairns (1861–1890), 2nd Earl Cairns
* Herbert John Cairns (1863–1905), 3rd Earl Cairns
* Wilfred Dallas Cairns (1865–1946), 4th Earl Cairns
* Douglas Halyburton Cairns (1867–1936), married Lady Constance Anne Montagu Douglas Scott, daughter of William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch
* Lady Kathleen Mary Cairns (1870–1939), married Archdeacon Edward Eliot

<text>Richard Hengist Horne (born Richard Henry Horne) (31 December 1802 – 13 March 1884) was an English poet and critic most famous for his poem .

==Early life==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1802, Horne was born at Edmonton, London, son of James Horne, a quarter-master in the 61st Regiment. The family moved to Guernsey, where James was stationed, until James&#x27; death on 16 April 1810. Horne was raised at the home of his rich paternal grandmother and sent to a school at Edmonton and then to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as he was intended for the army. Horne appears to have had as little sense of discipline as Adam Lindsay Gordon showed at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and like him was asked to leave. It appears that he caricatured the headmaster, and took part in a rebellion. He began writing while still in his teens. In 1825 he went as a midshipman in the &quot;Libertad&quot; to fight for Mexican independence, was taken prisoner, and joined the Mexican navy. He served in the war against Spain, travelled in the United States and Canada, returned to England in 1827, and took up literature as a profession.

==Early career==

Horne became a journalist, and from 1836 to 1837 edited the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot;. In 1837 he published two tragedies, &quot;Cosmo de&#x27; Medici&quot; and &quot;The Death of Marlowe&quot;. Another drama in blank verse, &quot;Gregory VII&quot;, appeared in 1840, and in 1841 a &quot;History of Napoleon&quot; in prose.

About the end of 1840 Horne was given employment as a sub-commissioner in connection with the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Children&#x27;s Employment which particularly focused on the employment of children in mines and manufactures. This commission finished its labours at the beginning of 1843, and in the same year Horne published his epic poem, &quot;Orion&quot;. It was published originally at the price of one farthing, and was widely read; three editions were published at that price, and three more at increased prices before the end of the year. In the next year he set forth a volume of critical essays called &quot;A New Spirit of the Age&quot;, in which he was assisted by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, with whom, from 1839 to her marriage in 1846, he conducted a voluminous correspondence. 

For many years Horne lived with the writer Mary Gillies, sharing houses in Upper Montagu Street, 5 Fortess Terrace, Kentish Town (later renamed 40 Fortess Road) and Hillside, Fitzroy Park Highgate, with her sister, the artist Margaret Gillies and her partner, the physician and reformer Thomas Southwood Smith. This cohabitation of two unmarried women with their partners, one of whom was himself married, was calmly accepted by some but shocked many who ostracised them.

In 1847 Horne married Catherine Foggo (daughter of David Foggo) and they lived at Beaumont Cottage, Adelaide Road, Hampstead but their marriage was not a happy one. Catherine died in 1893 and shares a grave in Highgate Cemetery with Mary Gillies.

In December 1849 Horne&#x27;s acquaintance Charles Dickens gave him a position as a sub-editor on his new weekly magazine &quot;Household Words&quot; at a salary of &quot;five guineas a week&quot;. In 1852 with Horne&#x27;s marriage failing and being discontented with his work on &quot;Household Words&quot;, he decided to emigrate to Australia.

==Australia==
In June 1852 Horne migrated to the Colony of Victoria in Australia, travelling as a passenger on the same ship as William Howitt and arriving in Melbourne in September. With assistance from Captain Archibald Chisholm (husband of Caroline Chisholm, a contributor to &quot;Household Words&quot;), he was given a position as commander of a gold escort. It was later reported that on the first trip of the escort under Horne&#x27;s command they returned to Melbourne with &quot;two tons weight of gold&quot;. The escort was robbed in 1853 and Horne wrote to &quot;The Argus&quot; with his recollections of George Melville, the bushranger convicted of the crime and hanged.

In 1854 he was a Goldfields Commissioner at the Waranga goldrush (during the Victorian gold rush) and named the township of Rushworth. During his time there he also reached a peaceful settlement with over 4,000 gold miners who had rioted over the payment of their mining license fee and, in his memoirs, stated that he believed this action, in light of the events at the Eureka Stockade a few months later, was never adequately recognised.

During his time at Rushworth, as part of a &quot;foolhardy business transaction&quot;, Horne had invested in blocks of land at nearby Murchison on the Goulburn River. But as &quot;the village grew slowly&quot; he was eager to &quot;promote any venture which might bring prosperity to the district&quot; and joined with his friend, Rushworth storekeeper Ludovic Marie in establishing a vineyard on the river near Nagambie. The two set up a public company, the Goulburn Vineyard Proprietary, with Marie as manager and Horne as honorary secretary. A third partner &quot;died mysteriously in the Melbourne scrub&quot; but the venture lasted and still exists as the Tahbilk winery. The venture didn&#x27;t compensate Horne for the money he had lost in an early public float but he later claimed &quot;he was the father of the Australian wine industry&quot;.

In 1856, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Victorian Electoral district of Rodney. In his platform of policies was an ambitious proposal for an irrigation system, which was realised with the construction of the Waranga Basin in the 1900s.

Following Waranga, Horne acted as a counsel&#x27;s clerk to his friend, Archibald Michie. Horne became a commissioner of the Yan Yean water-supply on 18 April 1857. It is unfortunate that his lively &quot;Australian Autobiography&quot;, prefixed to his &quot;Australian Facts and Prospects&quot; published in 1859, abruptly breaks off about 1854–55. From among the Commissioners he was elected President of the Victorian Sewerage and Water Commission.

He lost the position &quot;as a consequence of departmental changes&quot; and was promised another &quot;by successive Governments&quot; however this did not eventuate. He &quot;wasted three years and upwards, in fruitless expectation&quot;, and, with his capital tied up in Goulburn River investments, he applied to the Royal Literary Fund, of London, where he &quot;was at once recognised, and a handsome assistance transmitted to him by return mail&quot;.

While in Australia Horne brought out an Australian edition of &quot;Orion&quot; (1854), and in 1864 published his lyrical drama &quot;Prometheus the Fire-bringer&quot;. Another edition, printed in Australia, came out in 1866. Also published in 1866 were &quot;The South Sea Sisters, a Lyric Masque&quot;, for which Charles Horsley (then living in Melbourne) wrote the music. It was sung at the opening of the 1866 intercolonial exhibition. Along with such literary figures as Henry Kendall, Adam Lindsay Gordon, George Gordon McCrae and Marcus Clarke he was a member of the Yorick Club where members met and discussed literature.

Horne was the founding President of Melbourne&#x27;s Garrick Club in the 1850s and at a charitable theatrical fundraiser in 1855 &quot;kindly consented to sing a Spanish Romansa and Serence&quot; between the two short plays.

==London and later life==
In 1860 Horne was again unemployed. In 1869, &quot;dissatisfied with the failure of the Victorian government to fulfil what he conceived to be its obligations to him&quot;, he returned to England. A later memoria of Horne notes that after his return from Australia he settled in &quot;poor quarters in Marylebone&quot; and &quot;ill at ease in London&quot; his health suffered. This included &quot;a melancholy increase in weight&quot; that resulted in &quot;V-shaped additions&quot; having to be added to his trousers to accommodate his girth. However, courtesy of his physician, Dr. Bird, of Welbeck Street, his health returned and one day two ladies entering the Doctor&#x27;s practice &quot;were startled to see an old gentleman sliding headfirst down the banisters. This was Mr. Horne celebrating his return to health.&quot;

During the 15 years after his return to England, Horne published several books including the &quot;Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Richard Hengist Horne&quot;.

Horne received a Civil List pension of £50 a year in 1874 (increasing to £100 in 1880) and died at Margate on 13 March 1884; leaving behind him much unpublished work. A more complete list of Horne&#x27;s published work will be found in the British Museum catalogue. Horne was buried in Margate Cemetery.

==Legacy and influence==
Horne possessed extraordinary versatility, but, except in the case of &quot;Orion&quot;, he never attained to a very high degree of distinction. That poem, indeed, has much of the quality of fine poetry; it is earnest, vivid and alive with spirit. But Horne early drove his talent too hard, and continued to write when he had little left to say. In criticism he had insight and quickness. He was one of the first to appreciate Keats and Tennyson, and he gave valuable encouragement to Mrs. Browning when she was still Miss Elizabeth Barrett.

Hornes&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;Orion&quot; was reprinted by the Scholartis Press in 1928.

He has been the subject of two biographies: 
* &quot;Always morning: the life of Richard Henry &quot;Orion&quot; Horne&quot; by Cyril Pearl (1960)
* &quot;The farthing poet: a biography of Richard Hengist Horne, 1802–84; a lesser literary lion&quot; by Ann Blainey (1968)

<text>A Roy Rogers is a non-alcoholic mixed drink made with cola and grenadine syrup, and traditionally garnished with a maraschino cherry.

The drink originated in the 1940s and is named after American actor and singer Roy Rogers (1911–1998), who was popular at the time. It was likely named after Rogers because he did not drink alcohol.

The Roy Rogers is similar to other non-alcoholic beverages, specifically the Shirley Temple. Their recipes are similar: the Roy Rogers uses cola instead of the ginger ale and/or lemon-lime soda used in the Shirley Temple. The Roy Rogers was reportedly sold as a boy&#x27;s alternative to the Shirley Temple in the 1950s and 1960s.

<text>William Howitt (18 December 1792 – 3 March 1879), was a prolific English writer on history and other subjects. Howitt Primary Community School in Heanor, Derbyshire, is named after him and his wife.

==Biography==
Howitt was born in Heanor, Derbyshire. His parents were Quakers, and he was educated at the Friends public school at Ackworth, Yorkshire. His younger brothers were Richard and Godfrey whom he helped tutor. In 1814, he published a poem on the &quot;Influence of Nature and Poetry on National Spirit&quot;. In 1821, he married Mary Botham, who, like himself, was a Quaker and a poet. William and Mary Howitt collaborated throughout a long literary career; the first of their joint productions was &quot;The Forest Minstrels and other Poems&quot; (1821).

In 1831, William Howitt produced a work that naturally resulted from his habits of observation and his genuine love of nature. It was a history of the changes in the face of the outside world in the different months of the year, and was entitled &quot;The Book of the Seasons, or the Calendar of Nature&quot; (1831). His &quot;Popular History of Priestcraft&quot; (1833) won him the favour of active Liberals and the office of alderman in Nottingham, where the Howitts had made their home.

They moved to Esher in 1837 and became friends with Elizabeth Gaskell and her husband. In 1838, the publication of his &quot;Colonization and Christianity&quot;, which was later quoted approvingly by Karl Marx in &quot;Capital, Volume I,&quot; marked a significant moment. In 1840, they went to Heidelberg, primarily for the education of their children, and remained in Germany for two years. In 1841, William Howitt, using the pseudonym Dr Cornelius, produced &quot;The Student Life of Germany&quot;, the first of a series of works on German social life and institutions. Mary Howitt devoted herself to Scandinavian literature, and between 1842 and 1863 she translated the novels of Frederika Bremer and many of the stories of Hans Christian Andersen.

In 1847 Howitt published the &#x27;Homes and Haunts of the most Eminent British Poets&#x27; with the publisher Richard Bently. The Preface to the Second Edition dated 1847, and referring to careful revision of the work is included in the third edition, published by George Routledge &amp; Sons in 1877, suggesting there were either two editions in 1847, or the first edition was earlier. With her husband Mary wrote, in 1852, &quot;The Literature and Romance of Northern Europe&quot;. 

In September 1852 William Howitt, with two of his sons, arrived in Melbourne Australia where he visited his younget brother and visited the newly discovered goldfields. The results of two years in the colony were &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Adventures in the Wilds of Australia&quot; (1854), &quot;Land, Labour and Gold; or, Two Years in Victoria&quot; (1855) and &quot;Tallangetta, the Squatter&#x27;s Home&quot; (1857). His eldest son Alfred William Howitt remained in Australia as an anthropologist, explorer and naturalist. He was known for leading the Victorian Relief Expedition, which set out to establish the fate of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition. 

On his return to England Howitt had settled at Highgate and resumed his indefatigable book-making. From 1856 to 1862 he was engaged on Cassell&#x27;s &quot;Illustrated History of England&quot;, and from 1861 to 1864 he and his wife worked at the &quot;Ruined Abbeys and Castles of Great Britain&quot;. The Howitts had left the Society of Friends in 1847, and became interested in Spiritualism. In 1863 he published &quot;The History of the Supernatural in all Ages and Nations, and in all Churches, Christian and Pagan, demonstrating a Universal Faith&quot;. He added his own conclusions from a practical examination of the higher phenomena through a course of seven years.

From 1870 onwards Howitt spent the summers in Tyrol and the winters in Rome, where he died. In 1880 Mary Howitt had a house built for her (which is still standing) in the spa town of Meran in South Tyrol (then part of Austria) and from then on divided her time between Rome and Meran.
Mary Howitt was much affected by William&#x27;s death, and in 1882 she joined the Roman Catholic Church, towards which she had been gradually moving during her connection with spiritualism. She died at Rome on 30 January 1888.

The Howitts are remembered for their untiring efforts to provide wholesome and instructive literature. Anna Mary Howitt was both an artist and a poet, and married Alaric Alfred Watts. Mary Howitt&#x27;s autobiography was edited by her daughter, Margaret Howitt, in 1889. William Howitt wrote some fifty books, and his wife&#x27;s publications, inclusive of translations, number over a hundred.

Hamilton is frequently invited as a panellist on &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and as a guest panellist on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

On television, he has been a regular contributor to a range of comedy programs, and co-created The Kit Curran Radio Show, Drop the Dead Donkey, and Outnumbered with Guy Jenkin.

<text>Middle Dutch is a collective name for a number of closely related West Germanic dialects whose ancestor was Old Dutch. It was spoken and written between 1150 and 1500. Until the advent of Modern Dutch after 1500 or , there was no overarching standard language, but all dialects were mutually intelligible. During that period, a rich Medieval Dutch literature developed, which had not yet existed during Old Dutch. The various literary works of the time are often very readable for speakers of Modern Dutch since Dutch is a rather conservative language.

==Phonology==

===Differences with Old Dutch===
Several phonological changes occurred leading up to the Middle Dutch period.

* Earlier Old Dutch , , merge into already in Old Dutch.
* Voiceless fricatives become voiced syllable-initially: &gt; , &gt; (merging with from Proto-Germanic ), &gt; . (10th or 11th century)
* &gt; or . The outcome is dialect-specific, with found in more western dialects and further east. This results in later pairs such as &quot;dietsc&quot; versus &quot;duitsc&quot; .
** Various dialects also show &gt; , while others retain . Compare southeastern Middle Dutch &quot;hiwen&quot; with modern Dutch &quot;huwen&quot; .
** In word-initial position, some northern dialects also show a change from a falling to a rising diphthong ( &gt; ) like Old Frisian. Cf. the accusative second-person plural pronoun &quot;iu&quot; &gt; northern &quot;jou&quot; versus southern &quot;u&quot; .
* Phonemisation of umlaut for back vowels, resulting in a new phoneme (from earlier Old Dutch before or ). Unlike most other Germanic languages, umlaut was only phonemicised for short vowels in all but the easternmost areas; long vowels and diphthongs are unaffected.
* Insertion of between and a vowel.
* Syllable-final &gt; in some areas. This created pairs such as &quot;duwen&quot; versus &quot;douwen&quot; , or &quot;nu&quot; versus &quot;nou&quot; .
* Lowering of &gt; when not umlauted.
** This change did not (fully) occur in the southwestern (Flemish) dialects. Hence, these dialects retain &quot;sunne&quot; &quot;sun&quot; where others have &quot;sonne&quot;.
* Fronting of , &gt; , . In some dialects, remained syllable-finally or before .
** This change did not occur in Limburgish.
** In Flemish, this change also affected cases that escaped the lowering in the previous change, hence &quot;sunne&quot; .
* Vowel reduction: Vowels in unstressed syllables are weakened and merge into , spelled . (11th or 12th century) Long vowels seem to have remained as such, at least is known to have remained in certain suffixes (such as &quot;-kijn&quot; ).
* Diphthongisation of the long mid vowels: , &gt; , , .
* Non-phonemic lowering of short , &gt; , .
* Open syllable lengthening: Short vowels in stressed open syllables become long. As a result, all stressed syllables in polysyllabic words become heavy. Old Dutch (original) long vowels are called &quot;sharp-long&quot; and indicated with a circumflex (â, ê, î, ô). Lengthened vowels are &quot;soft-long&quot; and are indicated with a macron (ā, ē, ī, ō).
** Lengthened vowels initially have the same vowel quality as the short variants, so this produces , , , , .
** and are then lowered to and respectively.
** Lengthened , , remain distinct from the previously diphthongised long mid vowels.
** In most dialects, lengthened merges with original , but in some, a distinction in backness develops.
** This introduces many length alternations in grammatical paradigms, e.g. singular &quot;dag&quot; , plural .
* Dental fricatives become stops: &gt; , &gt; , merging with existing and . (around 12th century)
** The geminate (originating from Germanic &quot;*-þj-&quot;) develops into : &gt; , &gt; .
* L-vocalisation: and &gt; before dentals.
** This change does not occur in Limburgish, which retains the distinction but undergoes its own round of vocalisation in modern times, producing and respectively.
* Lengthening of vowels before + dental consonant. This did not occur in all dialects, and in some, was lengthened to . E.g. &quot;farth&quot; &gt; &quot;vāert&quot; , &quot;ertha&quot; &gt; &quot;āerde&quot; , &quot;wort&quot; &gt; &quot;wōort&quot; .
* Syncope of schwa in certain environments, particularly inflectional endings. This phonemicises the soft-long vowels produced by open syllable lengthening, which can now also occur in closed syllables. E.g. &quot;hēvet&quot; &gt; &quot;hēeft&quot;.

===Consonants===
The consonants of Middle Dutch differed little from those of Old Dutch. The most prominent change is the loss of dental fricatives. In addition the sound was phonemicised during this period, judging from loanwords that retain to this day.

For descriptions of the sounds and definitions of the terms, follow the links on the headings.

Notes:

* All obstruents underwent final-obstruent devoicing as in Old and Modern Dutch.
* During the first part of the Middle Dutch period, geminated varieties of most consonants still occurred. Geminated was a plosive , retained in modern Limburgish as .
* were most likely bilabial, whereas were most likely labiodental.
* could have been either dental or alveolar .
** had a velar allophone when it occurred before the velars .
** After , was realized as a plosive .
* was most likely alveolar, either a trill or a tap .

===Vowels===
Most notable in the Middle Dutch vowel system, when compared to Old Dutch, is the appearance of phonemic rounded front vowels, and the merger of all unstressed short vowels.

====Short vowels====

* The exact height of is not certain, and may have varied between actual and a lower or even .
* and could have also been and , as in modern Dutch.
* was a back in most varieties, but front probably occurred in some western dialects.

====Long vowels and diphthongs====
Long vowels and diphthongs cannot be clearly distinguished in Middle Dutch, as many long vowels had or developed a diphthongal quality, while existing diphthongs could also develop into monophthongs. Sometimes, this occurred only in restricted dialects, other developments were widespread.

* The rounded front vowels in brackets only occurred in the eastern dialects, where umlaut of long vowels and diphthongs occurred.
* The rounded back vowel only occurred in the Limburgish dialects.

Many details of the exact phonetics are uncertain, and seemed to have differed by dialect. The overall system is clear, however, as almost all the vowels remain distinct in modern Limburgish: , , , and appear in modern Limburgish as , , , and respectively.

The vowels , and developed from Old Dutch opening diphthongs, but their exact character in Middle Dutch is unclear. The following can be said:
* In eastern Brabant, and all of Limburg, the pronunciation remained diphthongal.
* is frequently found written with just , which may indicate a monophthongal pronunciation. never merged with the long vowel , however, as no rhyme pairs between these vowels are found.
* In the coastal areas (Flanders, Holland), seems to have been a monophthong or . Before velar and labial consonants, the pronunciation was a close . This is revealed by the distinction in spelling between and .
* In western Brabant, the pronunciation of was more close, probably monophthongal .

The vowels , and , termed &quot;sharp-long&quot; and denoted with a circumflex &quot;ê&quot; &quot;ô&quot;, developed from Old Dutch long vowels. The opening diphthong pronunciation was probably widespread, and perhaps once universal, as it is nowadays still found in both West Flemish and in Limburgish, at opposite ends of the Middle Dutch language area. In the general area in between, including standard Dutch, the vowels merged with the &quot;soft-long&quot; vowels during the early modern Dutch period.
* In southern Flanders, southern Brabant and Holland, appears spelled with (e.g. &quot;stien&quot; for &quot;steen&quot;), while appears with (e.g. &quot;speghel&quot; for &quot;spieghel&quot;), suggesting a merger between these phonemes.
* is sometimes found to rhyme with . It is possible that the two vowels merged under some conditions, while remaining distinct in other cases.
* In Brabant, occasionally rhymes with . In western Brabant, this implies a close monophthongal pronunciation .

The vowels , and , termed &quot;soft-long&quot; and denoted with a macron &quot;ē&quot; &quot;ō&quot;, developed through the lengthening of Old Dutch short vowels in open syllables, but also frequently before . They were simple monophthongs in all Middle Dutch dialects, with the exception of western Flanders where later developed into . They might have been close-mid but also perhaps open-mid , and , as in modern Limburgish.

There were two open vowels, with &quot;sharp-long&quot; &quot;â&quot; developed from the Old Dutch long &quot;ā&quot;, and &quot;soft-long&quot; &quot;ā&quot; being the result of lengthening. These two vowels were distinguished only in Limburgish and Low Rhenish at the eastern end, and in western Flemish and coastal Hollandic on the western end. The relative backness of the two vowels was opposite in the two areas that distinguished them.
* On the coast, &quot;â&quot; was front or , while &quot;ā&quot; was central or back .
* In the eastern varieties, &quot;â&quot; was back , while &quot;ā&quot; was front or central . merged into during Middle Dutch, first in Low Rhenish, then later also in Limburgish further south.
* In all dialects between, the two vowels were not distinguished. The phonetic realisation ranged from back (in Brabant) to front (Holland further inland).

The closing diphthong remained from the corresponding Old Dutch diphthong. It occurred primarily in umlauting environments, with appearing otherwise. Some dialects, particularly further west, had in all environments (thus &quot;cleene&quot; next to &quot;cleine&quot;). Limburgish preserved the diphthong wherever it was preserved in High German.

The closing diphthong has two different origins. In the vast majority of the Middle Dutch area, it developed through l-vocalization from older and followed by a dental consonant. In the eastern area, Limburg in particular, it was a remnant of the older diphthong as in High German, which had developed into elsewhere. L-vocalization occurred only in the modern period in Limburgish, and the distinction between and was preserved, being reflected as &quot;ów&quot; and &quot;aa&quot; respectively.

===Changes during the Middle Dutch period===

Phonological changes that occurred during Middle Dutch:

* &gt; , &gt; . This eliminated the sound from the language altogether.
** and originating from and through final devoicing were not affected. This therefore resulted in alternations such as singular &quot;coninc&quot; versus plural &quot;coninghe&quot; , singular &quot;lamp&quot; versus plural &quot;lammere&quot; .
* &gt; (spelled or later ). It is unclear when this change happened, as the spelling does not seem to differentiate the two sounds (that is, and could both represent either sound).
* &gt; before plus another consonant, merging with original Old Dutch (&lt; Proto-Germanic ). E.g. &quot;ende&quot; &gt; &quot;einde&quot;, &quot;pensen&quot; &gt; &quot;peinsen&quot; (from Old French &quot;penser&quot;). This change is found sporadically in Old Dutch already, but becomes more frequent in some Middle Dutch areas.
* Epenthesis of in various clusters of sonorants. E.g. &quot;donre&quot; &gt; &quot;donder&quot;, &quot;solre&quot; &gt; &quot;solder&quot;, &quot;bunre&quot; &gt; &quot;bunder&quot;. In modern Dutch, this change has become grammaticalised for the &quot;-er&quot; (comparative, agent noun) suffix when attached to a word ending in -r.
* Shortening of geminate consonants, e.g. for &quot;bidden&quot; &gt; , which reintroduces stressed light syllables in polysyllabic words.
* Early diphthongisation of long high vowels: &gt; and &gt; except before and , probably beginning around the 14th century.
** The diphthongal quality of these vowels became stronger over time, and eventually the former merged with &quot;ei&quot;. But the diphthongal pronunciation was still perceived as unrefined and &#x27;southern&#x27; by educated speakers in the sixteenth century, showing that the change had not yet spread to all areas and layers of Dutch society by that time.
* Following the previous change, monophthongisation of opening diphthongs: &gt; , &gt; . The result might have also been a short vowel (as in most Dutch dialects today), but they are known to have remained long at least before .
* Beginning in late Middle Dutch and continuing into the early Modern Dutch period, schwa was slowly lost word-finally and in some other unstressed syllables: &quot;vrouwe&quot; &gt; &quot;vrouw&quot;, &quot;hevet&quot; &gt; &quot;heeft&quot;. This did not apply consistently however, and sometimes both forms continued to exist side by side, such as &quot;mate&quot; and &quot;maat&quot;.
** Word-final schwa was restored in the past singular of weak verbs, to avoid homophony with the present third-person singular because of word-final devoicing. However, it was lost in all irregular weak verbs, in which this homophony was not an issue: irregular &quot;dachte&quot; &gt; &quot;dacht&quot; (present tense &quot;denkt&quot;), but regular &quot;opende&quot; did not become * because it would become indistinguishable from &quot;opent&quot;.
* During the 15th century at the earliest, begins to disappear when between a non-short vowel and a schwa.
** The actual outcome of this change differed between dialects. In the more northern varieties and in Holland, the was simply lost, along with any schwa that followed it: &gt; &quot;lui&quot;, &quot;lade&quot; &gt; &quot;la&quot;, &quot;mede&quot; &gt; &quot;mee&quot;. In the southeast, intervocalic instead often became : &quot;mede&quot; &gt; &quot;meej&quot;.
** The change was not applied consistently, and even in modern Dutch today many words have been retained in both forms. In some cases the forms with lost were perceived as uneducated and disappeared again, such as in &quot;Nederland&quot; and &quot;neer&quot;, both from &quot;neder&quot; (the form &quot;Neerland&quot; does exist, but is rather archaic in modern Dutch).

==Dialects==

Middle Dutch was not a single homogeneous language. The language differed by area, with different areas having a different pronunciation and often using different vocabulary. The dialect areas were affected by political boundaries. The sphere of political influence of a certain ruler also created a sphere of linguistic influence, with the language within the area becoming more homogeneous. Following, more or less, the political divisions of the time, several large dialect groups can be distinguished. However, the borders between them were not strong, and a dialect continuum existed between them, with spoken varieties near the edges of each dialect area showing more features of the neighbouring areas.

Middle Dutch has four major dialects groups:
# Flemish in Flanders and Zeeuws in Zeeland,
# Brabantic in Brussels, Leuven, Antwerp, Mechelen, Breda,
# Hollandic in the county of Holland,
# Limburgic in the East.
Flemish, Brabantic and Hollandic are known as West Franconian, while Limburgic is known as East Franconian (not to be confused with the High German dialect East Franconian).

In a finer classification there are:
* Flemish 
** West Flemish 
** East Flemish 
* Brabantic 
** West Brabantic 
** East Brabantic 
* Hollandic 
* Utrechts 
* Limburgic 

===Brabantian===

Brabantian was spoken primarily in the Duchy of Brabant. It was an influential dialect during most of the Middle Ages, during the so-called &quot;Brabantian expansion&quot; in which the influence of Brabant was extended outwards into other areas. Compared to the other dialects, Brabantian was a kind of &quot;middle ground&quot; between the coastal areas on one hand, and the Rhineland and Limburg on the other. Brabantian Middle Dutch has the following characteristics compared to other dialects:

* Merger of â and ā, articulated as a back vowel.
* Use of the form for the second-person plural pronoun.
* Early diphthongization of and .
* Tended towards Rhinelandic and/or Limburgish in the easternmost areas, with umlaut of long vowels and diphthongs. This in turn led to stronger use of umlaut as a grammatical feature, in for example diminutives.
* Lack of umlaut &gt; before , in western varieties.

===Flemish===

Flemish, consisting today of West and East Flemish and Zeelandic, was spoken in the County of Flanders, northern parts of the County of Artois and areas around the towns of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer. Though due to their intermediary position between West Flemish and Brabantian, the East Flemish dialects have also been grouped with the latter. Flemish had been influential during the earlier Middle Ages (the &quot;Flemish expansion&quot;) but lost prestige to the neighbouring Brabantian in the 13th century. Its characteristics are:

* Fronted realisation for â.
* Unrounding of rounded front vowels.
* Loss of , with the occasional hypercorrection found in texts.
* Opening diphthong articulation of ê and ô, often spelled and .
* Old Dutch developed into instead of , thus giving forms such as &quot;vier&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) where other dialects have &quot;vuur&quot;.
* Lowering of to before + consonant, often also with lengthening. The change is generally limited to West Flemish before dentals, while before labials and velars it is more widespread.
* Lack of umlaut &gt; before .
* &gt; in some words.
* &gt; sometimes before + consonant in West Flemish.

===Hollandic===

Hollandic was spoken in the County of Holland. It was less influential during most of the Middle Ages but became more so in the 16th century during the &quot;Hollandic expansion&quot;, during which the Eighty Years&#x27; War took place in the south. It shows the following properties:

* Strong Ingvaeonic influence from earlier Frisian presence in the area. This became more apparent closer to the coast and further north (West Friesland).
* â and ā merged and had a fronted articulation (which forms the basis for the modern standard Dutch pronunciation).
* Occasional occurrence of the Ingvaeonic nasal-spirant law. Seen in some place names, such as &quot;-mude&quot; (&quot;mouth&quot;) where more southwestern areas retain the nasal: &quot;-monde&quot;.
* Use of the form &quot;ji&quot; for the second-person plural pronoun.
* Retention of .
* Lack of umlaut &gt; before .

===Limburgish===

Limburgish was spoken by the people in the provinces of modern Dutch and Belgian Limburg. It was not clearly tied to one political area, instead being divided among various areas, including the Duchy of Limburg (which was south of modern Limburg). It was also the most divergent of the dialects.

* Generally, a strong &quot;southeastern&quot; influence, tying it more to Middle High German in some respects (&quot;Colognian expansion&quot;). The effects of the High German consonant shift are occasionally found.
* Umlaut affects all vowels and is morphologically significant.
* Retention of the older Germanic diphthongs and where other Middle Dutch dialects have monophthongized these to ê and ô.
* Retention of (did not merge with ) and (remained as a back vowel).
* Orthography is also more eastern. represents a back vowel, and vowel length in closed syllables is not marked.
* Full use of &quot;du&quot; as the second-person singular pronoun.
* Long &quot;a&quot; in words ending in a single consonant, e.g. for , for , etc. and before , , , + dental,

===Kleverlandish===

Kleverlandish (&quot;Kleverlands&quot;) was spoken around the area of the Duchy of Cleves, around the Lower Rhine. It represented a transitional dialect between Limburgish and Middle Low German.

* It had an eastern influence, with a more eastern-tinted orthography. Umlaut was a regular grammatical feature.
* Stronger Middle Low German influence.

==Orthography==

Middle Dutch was written in the Latin alphabet, which was not designed for writing Middle Dutch so different scribes used different methods of representing the sounds of their language in writing. The traditions of neighbouring scribes and their languages led to a multitude of ways to write Middle Dutch. Consequently, spelling was not standardised but was highly variable and could differ by both time and place as various &quot;trends&quot; in spelling waxed and waned. Furthermore, a word could be found spelled differently in different occurrences within the same text. There was the matter of personal taste, and many writers thought it was more aesthetic to follow French or Latin practice, leading to sometimes rather unusual spellings.

The spelling was generally phonetic, and words were written based on how they were spoken rather than based on underlying phonemes or morphology. Final-obstruent devoicing was reflected in the spelling, and clitic pronouns and articles were frequently joined to the preceding or following word. Scribes wrote in their own dialect, and their spelling reflected the pronunciation of that particular scribe or of some prestige dialect by which the scribe was influenced. The modern Dutch word &quot;maagd&quot; (&quot;maiden&quot;) for example was sometimes written as &quot;maghet&quot; or , but also &quot;meget&quot;, &quot;magt&quot;, &quot;maget&quot;, &quot;magd&quot;, and . Some spellings, such as &quot;magd&quot;, reflect an early tendency to write the underlying phonemic value. However, by and large, spelling was phonetic, which is logical as people usually read texts out loud.

Modern dictionaries tend to represent words in a normalised spelling to form a compromise between the variable spellings on one hand and to represent the sounds of the language consistently. Thus, normalised spellings attempt to be a general or &quot;average&quot; spelling but still being accurate and true to the language.

===Vowels===

The general practice was to write long vowels with a single letter in an open syllable and with two letters in a closed syllable. Which two letters were used varied among texts. Some texts, especially those in the east, do not do so and write long vowels with a single letter in all cases (as is the predominant rule in modern German).

===Consonants===

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Middle Dutch nouns inflected for number as well as case. The weakening of unstressed syllables merged many different Old Dutch classes of nominal declension. The result was a general distinction between strong and weak nouns. Eventually even these started to become confused, with the strong and weak endings slowly beginning to merge into a single declension class by the beginning of the modern Dutch period.

====Strong nouns====

The strong nouns generally originated from the Old Dutch a-stem, i-stem and u-stem inflections. They mostly had a nominative singular with no ending, and a nominative plural in &quot;-e&quot; or, for some neuter nouns, with no ending. Most strong nouns were masculine or neuter. Feminines in this class were former i-stems, and could lack an ending in the dative singular, a remnant of the late Old Dutch inflection. In some rare occasions, the genitive singular was also endingless. Some nouns ended in &quot;-e&quot; in the singular also; these were primarily former ja-stems, which were masculine or neuter. A few were former i-stems with short stems. Nouns of this type tended to be drawn into the weak inflection by analogy.

The following table shows the inflection of the masculine noun &quot;day&quot;, feminine &quot;deed&quot; and neuter &quot;bread&quot;.

====Weak nouns====

Weak nouns were characterised by the ending &quot;-en&quot; throughout the plural. The singular ended in &quot;-e&quot;.

The following table shows the inflection of the masculine noun &quot;bow, arc&quot;.

===Adjectives===

Middle Dutch adjectives inflected according to the gender, case and number of the noun they modified.

The Germanic distinction between strong and weak, or indefinite and definite inflection, was fairly minimal in Middle Dutch, appearing only in the masculine and neuter nominative singular. These forms received an &quot;-e&quot; ending when a definite word (demonstrative, article) preceded, and had no ending otherwise. Adjectives were uninflected when connected through a copula. Thus, even for feminine nouns, no ending appeared: &quot;die vrouwe is goet&quot; &quot;the lady is good&quot;.

Some adjectives, namely the former ja-stems, had an &quot;-e&quot; even in the strong and copular form, e.g. &quot;die vrouwe is cleine&quot; &quot;the lady is small&quot;.

===Pronouns===
Middle Dutch pronouns differed little from their modern counterparts. The main differences were in the second person with the development of a T-V distinction. The second-person plural pronoun &quot;ghi&quot; slowly gained use as a respectful second-person singular form. The original singular pronoun &quot;du&quot; gradually fell out of use during the Middle Dutch period. A new second person plural pronoun was created by contraction of &quot;gij/jij&quot; and &quot;lui&quot; (&#x27;people&#x27;) forming &quot;gullie/jullie&quot; (literally, &#x27;you people&#x27;).
Note: There are several other forms.

===Determiners===

Definite Article&lt;BR&gt;
(&quot;die&quot;, &quot;dat&quot; = the)

===Verbs===

Middle Dutch mostly retained the Old Dutch verb system. Like all Germanic languages, it distinguished strong, weak and preterite-present verbs as the three main inflectional classes. Verbs were inflected in present and past tense, and in three moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative.

The weakening of unstressed vowels affected the distinction between the indicative and subjunctive moods, which had largely been determined by the vowel of the inflectional suffix in Old Dutch. In Middle Dutch, with all unstressed vowels merging into one, the subjunctive became distinguished from the indicative only in the singular but was identical to it in the plural, and also in the past tense of weak verbs. That led to a gradual decline in the use of the subjunctive, and it has been all but lost entirely in modern Dutch.

====Strong verbs====
The seven classes of strong verb common to the Germanic languages were retained. The four principal parts were the present tense, first- and third-person singular past tense, remaining past tense, and the past participle.

In classes 6 and 7, there was no distinction between the two different vowels of the past tense. In classes 4 and 5, the difference was primarily one of length, since &quot;ā&quot; and &quot;â&quot; were not distinguished in most dialects. The difference between &quot;ê&quot; and &quot;ē&quot;, and between &quot;ô&quot; and &quot;ō&quot;, found in classes 1 and 2, was a bit more robust, but also eventually waned in the development to modern Dutch. Consequently, the distinction was mostly lost. Class 3, which retained a clear distinction that did not rely on vowel length, was levelled in favour of the &quot;o&quot; of the plural.

In classes with a lengthened vowel in the present, the singular imperative often appears with a short vowel instead, e.g. &quot;les&quot;, &quot;drach&quot;. An alternative form, with final &quot;-e&quot; by analogy with the weak verbs, also occurs.

The eastern dialects occasionally show &quot;i&quot; in the second- and third-person singular present indicative forms, instead of &quot;e&quot;. This is a remnant of older i-mutation in these forms. Umlaut is also sometimes found in the past subjunctive in the east.

====Weak verbs====
Middle Dutch retained weak verbs as the only productive class of verbs. While Old Dutch still had two different classes of weak verbs (and remnants of a third), this distinction was lost in Middle Dutch with the weakening of unstressed syllables.

The past tense was formed with a suffix &quot;-ed-&quot;, which generally lost its &quot;e&quot; through syncope and thus came to be directly attached to the preceding stem. This triggered voicing assimilation, so that &quot;t&quot; appeared whenever the preceding stem ended in a voiceless consonant. This phenomenon remains in modern Dutch. Unsyncopated forms, which retain the fuller suffix &quot;-ed-&quot;, are sometimes found, especially with stems ending in a labial or velar consonant.

Some former class 1 weak verbs retained so-called &quot;Rückumlaut&quot;. These verbs had undergone umlaut in the present tense, but the umlaut-triggering vowel was syncopated in the past tense already in Old Dutch, preventing umlaut from taking hold there. Thus, &quot;senden&quot; had the first- and third-person singular past tense &quot;sande&quot;. These verbs tended to be reinterpreted as strong verbs in later Middle Dutch; &quot;sande&quot; itself gave rise to the modern &quot;zond&quot;, mirroring strong class 3.

<doc id="406086" wikidata="Q5990500" url="?curid=406086" title="If I Ruled the World">
<text>&quot;If I Ruled the World&quot; is a popular song, composed by Leslie Bricusse and Cyril Ornadel, which was originally from the 1963 West End musical &quot;Pickwick&quot; (based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;).

==Background==
In the context of the stage musical, the song is sung by Samuel Pickwick, when he is mistaken for an election candidate and called on by the crowd to give his manifesto. Ornadel and Bricusse received the 1963 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.

==First recordings==
*The song is usually associated with Sir Harry Secombe, who got the song to No 18 in the UK charts in 1963. 
*Tony Bennett originally recorded the song in 1965, and had a number 34 hit with it on the U.S. pop singles charts and number 8 on the Middle-Road Singles chart. In a duet with Celine Dion, he returned to the song on his Grammy-winning 2006 album &quot;&quot;. 

==Other recordings==
It has been performed by other singers, notably:
*Regina Belle
*James Brown
*Sammy Davis Jr.
*Robert Goulet
*Tom Jones
*The Supremes
*Nancy Wilson
*Stevie Wonder

*Jamie Cullum also recorded a version for his album &quot;The Pursuit&quot;, and performed it at the &quot;Late Night Prom&quot;, number Prom 55, of The Proms in London, with The Heritage Ensemble, on 26 August 2010; as shown on BBC Four the following night.

==In popular culture==
*The song was featured in the 2003 film &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, in a scene with Bennett himself singing the song at a scene in a piano-bar .
*The song is featured in the 2005 film, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; by Steven Spielberg.
*This song was featured in the Vodafone TV commercials in the UK during the Spring and Summer of 2009.
*This song is featured in the 2014 South Korean film, &quot;Night Flight&quot;, directed by Lee Song Hee-il (2014)
*The politician-spoofing BBC panel TV show &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot; is named after the song.
*Andy Hallett, the actor best known for playing the part of Lorne (&#x27;The Host&#x27;) in the television series &quot;Angel&quot;, sang the song in that series&#x27; final episode.
*A cover of the song arranged by Jamie Stevens of Elephant Music underscored the 2023 trailer for the third season of &quot;The Morning Show&quot;.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children was an honor presented to recording artists for quality children&#x27;s music albums at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award for Best Musical Album for Children was first presented to producer Alan Menken and Tim Rice in 1994 for the soundtrack to the Disney film &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. Starting in 2012, this category merged with the Best Spoken Word Album for Children category to form the new Best Children&#x27;s Album category. This merger meant essentially returning to the categorization set-up prior to 1994 (although with a small name change), when recordings for children was covered by the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children alone.

<text>CNES () is the French national space agency. Headquartered in central Paris, the agency comes under the supervision of the ministries of the Armed Forces, Economy and Finance and Higher Education, Research and Innovation.

It operates from the Toulouse Space Centre and the Guiana Space Centre. The president of CNES is Philippe Baptiste. CNES is a member of Institute of Space, its Applications and Technologies. It is Europe&#x27;s largest national organization of its type.

== History ==
CNES was established under President Charles de Gaulle in 1961. It is the world&#x27;s third oldest space agency, after the Soviet space program (Russia), and NASA (United States). CNES was responsible for the training of French astronauts, until the last active CNES astronauts transferred to the European Space Agency in 2001.

, CNES is working with Germany and a few other governments to start a modest research effort with the hope to propose a LOX/methane reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015. If built, flight testing would likely not start before approximately 2026. The design objective is to reduce both the cost and duration of reusable vehicle refurbishment, and is partially motivated by the pressure of lower-cost competitive options with newer technological capabilities not found in the Ariane 6.

=== Timeline ===

* 1947: Centre interarmées d&#x27;essais d&#x27;engins spéciaux missile range and launch facility built for the French military near Hammaguir in French Algeria.
* 1961: CNES was founded with the headquarter in Paris. Pierre Auger was the first president and Robert Aubinière the first director general.
* 1962: First Bérénice rocket launched.
* 1963: CNES became the first—and only—space agency to successfully launch a cat into space.
* 1964: Diamant Launch Vehicle introduced.
* 1965: First French satellite put in orbit. 
* 1967: Hammaguir range closed.
* 1968: Toulouse Space Centre completed.
* 1969: Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana completed.
* 1973: Évry Space Centre completed.
* 1982: Jean-Loup Chrétien became the first French astronaut in space.
* 1986: SPOT satellite mission brought about high-resolution civil Earth imaging.
* 2001: Jason-1, the joint satellite mission between CNES and NASA, was launched.
* 2014: E-CORCE Earth observation satellite launched
* 2024: Space Variable Objects Monitor launched

== Programs ==
CNES concentrates on access to space, civil applications of space, sustainable development, science/technology research, and security/defence.

===Access to space===
France was the third space power (see Diamant) to achieve access to space after the USSR and US, sharing technologies with Europe to develop the Ariane launcher family. Commercial competition in space is fierce, so launch services must be tailored to space operators&#x27; needs. The latest versions of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle can launch large satellites to geosynchronous orbit or perform dual launches—launching two full-size satellites with one rocket—while the other launch vehicles used for European payloads and commercial satellites—the European/Italian Vega and Russian Soyuz-2—are small and medium-lift launchers, respectively.

===Sustainable development===
CNES and its partners in Europe—through the Copernicus Programme —and around the world have put in place satellites dedicated to observing the land, oceans, and atmosphere, as well as to hazard and crisis management. The best-known are the SPOT satellites flying the Vegetation instrument, the Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1 and Jason-2 oceanography satellites, the Argos system, Envisat, and the Pleiades satellites.

===Civil applications===
CNES is taking part in the Galileo navigation programme alongside the European Union and the European Space Agency (ESA), and—in a wider international context—in the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme.

===Security and defense===
The aforementioned Galileo navigation programme, though intended primarily for civilian navigational use, has a military purpose as well, like the similar American Global Positioning System and Russian GLONASS satellite navigational systems.

In addition to Spot and the future Pleiades satellites, CNES is working for the defence community as prime contractor for the Helios photo-reconnaissance satellites.

Global Monitoring for Environment and Security—a joint initiative involving the EU, ESA, and national space agencies—pools space resources to monitor the environment and protect populations, though it also encompasses satellite support for armed forces on border patrol, maritime security, and peacekeeping missions.

===Ongoing missions===
France&#x27;s contribution to the International Space Station is giving French scientists the opportunity to perform original experiments in microgravity. CNES is also studying formation flying, a technique whereby several satellites fly components of a much heavier and complex instrument in a close and tightly controlled configuration, with satellites being as close as tens of meters apart. CNES is studying formation flying as part of the Swedish-led PRISMA project and on its own with the Simbol-x x-ray telescope mission.

CNES currently collaborates with other space agencies on a number of projects, including orbital telescopes like INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, XMM-Newton, and COROT and space probes like Mars Express, Venus Express, Cassini-Huygens, and Rosetta. CNES has collaborated with NASA on missions like the Earth observation satellite PARASOL and the CALIPSO environment and weather satellite.

It has also collaborated with the Indian Space Agency (ISRO) on the Megha-Tropiques Mission, which is studying the water cycle and how it has been impacted by climate change. CNES plays a major role in the ESA&#x27;s Living Planet Programme of Earth observation satellites, having constructed the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite.

===UFO Archive===

In December 2006, CNES announced that it would publish its UFO archive online by late January or mid-February. Most of the 6,000 reports have been filed by the public and airline professionals. Jacques Arnould, an official for the French Space Agency, said that the data had accumulated over a 30-year period and that UFO sightings were often reported to the Gendarmerie.

In the last two decades of the 20th century, France was the only country whose government paid UFO investigators, employed by CNES&#x27;s UFO section GEPAN, later known as SEPRA and now as GEIPAN.
On March 22, 2007, CNES released its UFO files to the public through its website. The 100,000 pages of witness testimony, photographs, film footage, and audiotapes are an accumulation of over 1,600 sightings since 1954 and will include all future UFO reports obtained by the agency, through its GEIPAN unit.

==Governance structure==
The CNES is headed by a president or CEO, a COO and a deputy CEO. The following is a list of presidents of CNES from its inception to the current day.

* 1961 - 1962 Pierre Auger
* 1962 - 1967 Jean Coulomb

<doc id="406090" wikidata="Q1753050" url="?curid=406090" title="Dead Can Dance (album)">
<text>Dead Can Dance is the eponymous debut studio album by Australian musical act Dead Can Dance. It was released on 27 February 1984 on the 4AD label.

==Background==
Dead Can Dance commented on their official website regarding the name of the band and album:

To understand why we chose the name, think of the transformation of inanimacy to animacy. Think of the processes concerning life from death and death into life. So many people missed the inherent symbolic intention of the work, and assumed that we must be &quot;morbid gothic types&quot;.

==Production==
The album was recorded at Blackwing Studios.

The musicians who performed on the album were Brendan Perry, Lisa Gerrard, Paul Erikson, James Pinker and Peter Ulrich.

The instrumentation consisted of guitars, bass guitar and drums, with added percussion and the very distinct sound of the yangqin, as played by Gerrard.

==Musical style==
AllMusic commented on the album&#x27;s sound: &quot;Bearing much more resemblance to the similarly gripping, dark early work of bands like the Cocteau Twins and the Cure than to the later fusions of music that would come to characterize the duo&#x27;s sound, &quot;Dead Can Dance&quot; is as goth as it gets in many places&quot;.

The album cover includes a photo of a piece of artwork from Papua New Guinea on the left side, and on the right, the Greek characters &quot;ΔΞΛΔ CΛΝ ΔΛΝCΞ&quot;, which aimed to visually resemble the title &quot;DEAD CAN DANCE&quot;.

== Release ==
The album was released by 4AD on 27 February 1984. Some editions included Dead Can Dance&#x27;s next release, the EP &quot;Garden of the Arcane Delights&quot;, added onto the end of the album.

== Reception ==
In its retrospective review, AllMusic wrote that, with the album, &quot;Perry and Gerrard created a striking, dour landmark in early-&#x27;80s atmospherics&quot;.

== Touring ==
The band&#x27;s touring was limited to Europe during this period.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for works containing quality &quot;spoken word&quot; performances aimed at children. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot;

The award was first presented to Audrey Hepburn and producers Deborah Raffin and Michael Viner in 1994 for the album &quot;Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Enchanted Tales&quot;. Its last winners were the artists, producers, audio engineers, and audio mixers who contributed to the album &quot;Julie Andrews&#x27; Collection of Poems, Songs, and Lullabies&quot; in 2011, when it was announced the award would be combined with the Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children to form the Grammy Award for Best Children&#x27;s Album.

Tom Chapin holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of three. Artists Bill Harley and Jim Dale, along with audio engineer David Correia, and producers Arnold Cardillo and David Rapkin, and audio engineer-musical director Rory Young, are the others to win the award more than once, all winning it twice. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has also won the award, along with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren, for their work on the album &quot;Wolf Tracks and Peter and the Wolf&quot; at the 2003 installment of the awards.

<doc id="406106" wikidata="Q44599" url="?curid=406106" title="Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow">
<text>Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow, PC (9 December 1731 – 12 September 1806), was a British lawyer and Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1765 to 1778 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Thurlow. He served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain for fourteen years and under four Prime Ministers.

== Early life ==
Born at Bracon Ash, Norfolk, Thurlow was the eldest son of Reverend Thomas Thurlow. Thomas Thurlow, Bishop of Durham, was his brother. He studied at King&#x27;s School, Canterbury and at Caius College, Cambridge. However, he was forced to leave Cambridge in 1751 without a degree after coming into conflict with the authorities of the university. He was for some time articled to a solicitor in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but in 1754 he was called to the Bar, Inner Temple. After a slow start, Thurlow eventually established a successful legal practice. He was made a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1761 and was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1762.

== Political career ==
Thurlow then turned to politics, and in 1768 he was elected Member of Parliament for Tamworth as a Tory. Two years later, as a recognition of his defence the previous January of the expulsion of John Wilkes he was appointed Solicitor-General in the government of Lord North. He held this post for a little under a year, chiefly involved in the prosecution of libels and limitations on the freedom of the press, until he was promoted to Attorney General in January 1771. He was to remain in this office for seven years, during which period he became known as an ardent opponent of the American colonists&#x27; strive for independence. He is noted for his defeat in the case of Woodfall, who was publisher of the Letters of Junius, upon which a verdict of mistrial was entered by Lord Mansfield.

In 1778 Thurlow was admitted to the Privy Council, raised to the peerage as Baron Thurlow, of Ashfield in the County of Suffolk, and appointed Lord Chancellor by Lord North, taking his seat on 14 July 1778. In this post he notably opposed the economical and constitutional reforms proposed by Edmund Burke and John Dunning. The Tory administration of Lord North fell in March 1782, after twelve years in office. The Whigs under Lord Rockingham came to power, but Thurlow managed to cling on as Lord Chancellor. Rockingham died in July 1782, but Thurlow remained Lord Chancellor also when Lord Shelburne became prime minister. The latter government fell in April 1783, when a coalition government under Charles James Fox and Lord North was formed (with the Duke of Portland as titular prime minister). Thurlow was not invited to resume the role of Lord Chancellor, and instead the Great Seal was put into commission. He went into opposition and contributed to the downfall of the coalition in December 1783. William Pitt the Younger became prime minister and reinstated Thurlow as Lord Chancellor. The relationship between Pitt and Thurlow was always fragile, and Thurlow often relied on his friendship with King George III to be able to remain in office. He opposed a bill for the restoration to the heirs of estates forfeited in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Partly to please the king, he consistently and strongly supported Warren Hastings, and negotiated with the Whigs to ensure his continued power in the event of a change of government. In 1792, when he attacked Pitt&#x27;s bill to establish a fund to redeem the national debt, he was finally dismissed.

==Later life==

As a way of compensation, Thurlow was given a second peerage as Baron Thurlow, of Thurlow in the County of Suffolk, with remainder to his three nephews and their heirs male. He was never to hold office again and retired into private life. However, in 1797 he intrigued for the formation of a government from which Pitt and Fox should be excluded, and in which the Earl of Moira should be prime minister and himself Lord Chancellor. Despite the tacit support of the Prince of Wales the enterprise failed. His last recorded appearance in the House of Lords was in 1802.

Thomas Creevey described Thurlow towards the end of his life:Thurlow was always dressed in a full suit of cloaths of the old fashion, great cuffs and massy buttons, great wig, long ruffles, &amp;c.; the black eyebrows exceeded in size any I have ever seen, and his voice, tho&#x27; by no means devoid of melody, was a kind of rolling, murmuring thunder. He had great reading, particularly classical, and was a very distinguished, as well as most &quot;daring&quot;, converser.

==Personal life==
Thurlow had a number of illegitimate children Two of his daughters, Caroline and Catharine, had their portrait painted by George Romney in 1783. Catharine, who died in 1826, married Alexander Fraser, 17th Lord Saltoun, in 1815. Another daughter Maria, who died in 1816, married Colonel Sir David Cunynghame of Milncraig, 5th Baronet, in 1801, and had several children.
Lord Thurlow never married, but left three natural daughters. He died at Brighton on 12 September 1806, aged 76, and was buried in the Temple Church. The barony of 1778 became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1792 according to the special remainder by his nephew Edward, who was the eldest son of the first baron&#x27;s brother, Right Reverend Thomas Thurlow, Bishop of Durham.

==In popular culture==
Thurlow appears as a character in Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot; and the subsequent film adaptation, in which he was played by John Wood.

John Poynder&#x27;s &quot;Literary Extracts&quot; (1844) attributes to Thurlow the following widely quoted saying:

<doc id="406108" wikidata="Q727121" url="?curid=406108" title="Mothers of Plaza de Mayo">
<text>The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo is an Argentine human rights association formed in response to abuses by the National Reorganization Process, the military dictatorship by Jorge Rafael Videla. Initially the association worked to find the &quot;desaparecidos&quot;, people who had disappeared without arrests, trials or judicial process; most were believed dead. Their mothers and supporters investigated to determine the culprits of what were considered crimes against humanity in order to bring them to trial and sentencing.

The Mothers began demonstrating in the Plaza de Mayo, the public square located in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace, in the city of Buenos Aires, on 30 April 1977. They petitioned to have their disappeared children, mostly young adults, returned alive. The women demonstrated in the square on a daily basis and held signs with their pleas, followed by carrying photos of their missing children, and wearing white scarves with their names. By declaring a state of emergency, police expelled them from the public square.

In September 1977, in order to make a larger opportunity to share their stories with other Argentinians, the mothers decided to join the annual pilgrimage to Our Lady of Luján, located outside Buenos Aires. To stand out among the crowds, the mothers wore children&#x27;s nappies (diapers) as headscarves. Following the pilgrimage, the mothers decided to continue wearing these headscarves during their meetings and weekly demonstrations at the Plaza. On them, they embroidered the names of their children and wrote their main demand: &quot;Aparición con Vida&quot; (Live appearance).

During the years of the Dirty War (the name used by the military junta in Argentina from 1976 to 1983 as a part of Operation Condor), military and security forces and right-wing death squads (the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, AAA, or Triple A) suppressed known and suspected political dissidents. They cast a new against anyone suspected to be associated with socialism, left-wing Peronism, or the Montoneros &quot;guerrillero&quot; movement. 

As the Mothers publicized the disappearances of thousands of victims, they opposed the &quot;de facto&quot; government and suffered persecution, including kidnappings and forced disappearances of their own members. Most notably founders Azucena Villaflor, Esther Ballestrino, and María Ponce de Bianco, and French nun supporters Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet, disappeared. They were later found to have been murdered, perpetrated by a group led by Alfredo Astiz, a former commander, intelligence officer, and naval commando who served in the Argentine Navy during the military dictatorship. 

The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, known for having found and identified the remains of Che Guevara, later find the bodies of these women and determined that they had been killed via death flights, when they were thrown out of planes to die in the sea. 

On the first days of December 1980, the first &quot;March of Resistance&quot; was held, consisting of mostly women marching around the public square for 24 hours.

Despite democracy being re-established in the 1983 general election, the Mothers movement continued to hold marches and demonstrations, demanding trials and sentences for the military personnel who had participated in the government that overthrew Isabel Perón in the 1976 coup d&#x27;état. This would eventually culminate in the Trial of the Juntas of 1985.

The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo have received widespread support and recognition from many international organizations. They were the first association to receive the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. They also helped other human rights groups throughout their history. The 1980 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Adolfo Pérez Esquivel was an active supporter of the association, for which he was harassed by the dictatorship.

Since 1986 the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo have been divided into two factions, the majority group &quot;Mothers of Plaza de Mayo Association&quot; (presided by Hebe de Bonafini) and . Ceremonially, every Thursday at 3:30 p.m, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo march around the May Pyramid at the central hub of Plaza de Mayo. At 4:00 p.m they give speeches from the Equestrian monument to General Manuel Belgrano, where they opine over the current national and global situation.

== Purpose ==
Women had organized to gather, holding a vigil, while also trying to learn what had happened to their adult children during the 1970s and 1980s. They began to gather for this in 1977 every Thursday at Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace, in public defiance of the government&#x27;s law against mass assemblies. Wearing white headscarves to symbolize the diapers (nappies) of their lost children, now young adults. These were embroidered with the children&#x27;s names and dates of birth. For months the government had refused to answer questions about the missing people; the mothers marched in twos in solidarity to protest the denials of their children&#x27;s existence or their mistreatment by the military regime. Despite personal risks, they wanted to hold the government accountable for its murders and other abuses committed in the Dirty War.

== Activism and reaction ==

The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo were the first major group to organize against the Argentina regime&#x27;s human rights violations. Together, the women created a dynamic and unexpected force, which overturned traditional constraints on women in Latin America. These mothers came together to push for information on their children. Their actions highlighted the human rights violations and the scale of the protest drew press attention, raising awareness on a local and global scale. Their persistence to publicly remember and try to find their children, the sustained group organisation, the use of symbols and slogans, and the silent weekly protests attracted reactive measures from those in power.

The military government considered these women to be politically subversive. After the founder, Azucena Villaflor De Vincenti, listed names of &#x27;the missing&#x27; in a newspaper in December 1977 (on International Human Rights Day), she was kidnapped, tortured and murdered. (She was later found to have been killed on a &#x27;death flight&#x27;, when she was thrown into the sea to die.) French nuns Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet, who also supported the movement, were also killed in this manner. Their deaths were ordered by Alfredo Astiz and Jorge Rafael Videla (who was a senior commander in the Argentine Army and dictator of Argentina from 1976 to 1981), both of whom were later convicted and sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the repression of dissidents during the Dirty War.

Esther Ballestrino and María Ponce de Bianco, two other founders of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, also were &quot;disappeared&quot;.

In 1983, former military officers began to reveal information about some of the regime&#x27;s human rights violations. Eventually, the military has admitted that more than 9,000 of those abducted are still unaccounted for. The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo say that the number of missing is closer to 30,000. Most are presumed dead. Many of these prisoners were high school students, and young adult professionals and union workers who were suspected of having opposed the government. Those &#x27;taken&#x27; were generally below the age of 35, as were the members of the regime who tortured and murdered them. 

Jewish activists comprised a disproportionate number of the &quot;disappeared&quot; as the military was anti-Semitic. This was documented in the article &quot;Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number&quot;, which provided testimony of Jacobo Timerman and his experience of torture and abuse during this time.

It was not until 2005 and the advanced use of DNA analysis that many human remains could be identified after mass graves were found and excavated. Families chose whether to have the remains cremated or buried; Azucena&#x27;s ashes were interred in the Plaza de Mayo.

Today, the Mothers are engaged in the struggle for human, political, and civil rights in Latin America and elsewhere.

== Origins of the movement ==
On 30 April 1977, Azucena Villaflor de De Vincenti and a dozen other mothers walked to the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina&#x27;s capital city.

The original founders of the group were Azucena Villaflor de De Vincenti, Berta Braverman, Haydée García Buelas; María Adela Gard de Antokoletz, Julia, María Mercedes and Cándida Gard (four sisters); Delicia González, Pepa Noia, Mirta Acuña de Baravalle, Kety Neuhaus, Raquel Arcushin, and Senora De Caimi.

When the disappearances began, each mother thought that their child&#x27;s disappearance was a single unique case. Initially, the lack of media coverage of the disappearances led the mothers to believe that they were alone in their plight. As each mother visited prisons, hospitals, and police stations searching for their missing children, they began to notice other mothers who were also searching for their children. The women began to realize that these disappearances were systematic, organized, and planned. 

While many of their adult children had become educated and politically active, most of the mothers came from traditional working-class backgrounds and had limited knowledge of political processes. But they banded together to confront the regime as a unified front of mothers seeking answers about their missing children.

Each of the women had at least one child who had &#x27;disappeared&#x27;, sometimes known to have been arrested or detained, &#x27;taken&#x27; the military government. The mothers declared that between 1970 and 1980, more than 8,500 individuals became &quot;Desaparecidos&quot; or &quot;the disappeared&quot;. These people were erased from public records; no level of government had notes of arrests or evidence of charges against them.

The women decided to risk a public protest, although gatherings of more than three people had been banned. They linked arms and walked in pairs, as if on a stroll just across the street from the presidential office building, the Casa Rosada (the Pink House). The mothers chose this site for its high visibility. They hoped to gain information on their children&#x27;s whereabouts to recover them from prison or to properly bury them if their deaths were acknowledged. 

The &quot;disappeared&quot; were believed to have been abducted by agents of the Argentine government during the years known as the Dirty War (1976–1983). Those who were found had often been disposed in rural areas or unmarked graves; their remains showed evidence of torture and executions.

== Becoming a movement ==
As growing numbers joined weekly marches on Thursdays, the day the first few met, the Mothers also began an international campaign to defy the propaganda put out by the military regime. This publicity campaign brought the attention of the world to Argentina.

One year after the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo was founded, hundreds of women were participating, gathering in Plaza for weekly demonstrations. They found strength with each other by marching in public, and attracting some press. They made signs with photos of their children and publicized their children&#x27;s names. They wore white headscarves embroidered with the names and dates of births of their lost children.

The government tried to trivialize their action calling them &quot;las locas&quot; (the madwomen).

As the number of disappeared grew, the movement grew, and the Mothers were getting international attention. They began to try to build pressure from outside governments against the Argentine dictatorship, by sharing the many stories of the &quot;disappeared&quot;.

On 10 December 1977, International Human Rights Day, the Mothers published a newspaper advertisement with the names of their missing children. That same night, Azucena Villaflor (one of the original founders) was kidnapped from her home in Avellaneda by a group of armed men. She is reported to have been taken to the infamous ESMA torture centre, and from there on a &quot;death flight&quot; over the ocean. In-flight, the abducted were drugged, stripped, and flung into the sea to die, or killed and thrown overboard.

An estimated 500 of the missing are the children who were born to pregnant &#x27;disappeared&#x27; women being held in concentration camps or prisons. Many of these babies were given in illegal adoptions to military families and others associated with the regime. Their birth mothers are generally believed to have been killed. The numbers of such children are hard to determine due to the secrecy surrounding the abductions.

== Global impact ==

In 1978, when Argentina hosted the World Cup, the Mothers&#x27; demonstrations at the Plaza were covered by the international press in town for the sporting event.

Later when Adolfo Scilingo spoke at the National Commission on Disappeared People, he described how many prisoners were drugged and thrown out of planes to their deaths in the Atlantic Ocean. From early 1978 onwards, residents who lived along the Río de la Plata have found human remains of those abducted, murdered and dumped at sea. Bodies continued to wash up in the years after the fall of the regime.

Some of the movement&#x27;s most prominent supporters&#x27; bodies were never found, such as that of French national Alice Domon. Domon and Léonie Duquet, both French nuns, were taken during the Dirty War. Their disappearance attracted international attention and outrage, with demands for a United Nations investigation of human rights abuses in the country. France demanded information on the women, but the Argentine government denied all responsibility for them.

In 2005, forensic anthropologists dug up some remains of bodies that had been buried in an unmarked grave after washing ashore (in late December 1977) near the beach resort of Santa Teresita, south of Buenos Aires. DNA testing identified among them Azucena Villaflor, Esther Careaga and María Eugenia Bianco, three pioneer Mothers of Plaza who had been &quot;disappeared&quot;, as well as Léonie Duquet. In December 2005, Azucena Villaflor&#x27;s ashes were buried in the Plaza de Mayo.

== Divisions and radicalization ==

Never giving up their pressure on the regime, after the military gave up its authority to a civilian government in 1983, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo rekindled hopes that they might learn the fates of their children, and pushed again for the information.

Beginning in 1984, teams assisted by the American geneticist Mary-Claire King began to use DNA testing to identify remains, when bodies of the &quot;disappeared&quot; were found.

The government conducted a national commission to collect testimony about the &quot;disappeared&quot;, during which they heard from hundreds of witnesses. In 1985, it began the prosecution of men indicted for crimes, beginning with the Trial of the Juntas. Several high-ranking military officers were convicted and sentenced as a result.

The military threatened a coup to prevent a widening of prosecutions. In 1986, Congress passed Ley de Punto Final, which stopped the prosecutions for some years.

But in 2003, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional. During the Kirchner administration, the prosecution of war crimes was re-opened. Former high-ranking military and security officers have been convicted and sentenced in new cases. Among the charges is the stealing of babies of the disappeared. The first major figure, Miguel Etchecolatz, was convicted and sentenced in 2006. Most of the members of the Junta were imprisoned for crimes against humanity.

With the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, a group set up in 1977, the Mothers have identified 256 missing children who were adopted soon after being born to mothers in prison or camps who later &quot;disappeared&quot;. Seven of the identified children have died. At the beginning of 2018, 137 of those children, now grown adults, were found and were offered the chance to meet their biological families. 

Some Mothers and Grandmothers suffered disappointments when the grandchildren, now adults, did not want to know their hidden history, or refused to have their DNA tested. Parents who were judged in court to be guilty of adopting – or &quot;appropriating&quot; – the children of the disappeared, while knowing the truth about their origins, were susceptible to imprisonment.

In 1986, the Mothers split into two factions. One group, called the , focused on legislation, the recovery of the remains of their children, and bringing ex-officials to justice. 

Hebe de Bonafini continued to lead a more radical faction under the name Mothers of Plaza de Mayo Association. These mothers felt responsible for carrying on their children&#x27;s political work and assumed the agenda that originally led to the disappearance of the dissidents. Unlike the Founding Line, the association refused government help or compensation. They pledged not to recognize the deaths of their children until the government would admit its fault.

A scholar of the movement, Marguerite Guzman Bouvard, wrote that the association faction wanted &quot;a complete transformation of Argentine political culture&quot; and &quot;envisions a socialist system free of the domination of special interests&quot;. The Mothers Association is now backed by younger militants who support socialism.

In the wake of the attacks on United States on 11 September 2001, Bonafini said &quot;I was happy when I first heard the news, that for once they were the ones attacked, I&#x27;m not going to lie.&quot; She said that &quot;the U.S.A [was] the most terrorist of all countries, throwing bombs everywhere around the world&quot; but &quot;felt bad for the innocent workers dead (because of the terrorist attack).&quot; Her remarks were criticised in mainstream media.

Speaking for the Mothers, Bonafini rejected the government&#x27;s investigations of alleged Iranian involvement in the 1994 AMIA Bombing (the terrorist attack on the AMIA Jewish community center), saying the CIA and Mossad were misleading the investigation. She said that they repudiate &quot;the tragic attack, but respect for the victims and their families requires to investigate and do justice,&quot; without being &quot;politically manipulated in the service of US interests.&quot;

==&#x27;Final&#x27; March of Resistance==
On 26 January 2006, members of the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo Association faction announced what they said was their final annual March of Resistance at Plaza de Mayo, saying &quot;the enemy isn&#x27;t in the Government House anymore.&quot; They acknowledged the significance of President Néstor Kirchner&#x27;s success in having the Full Stop Law (&quot;Ley de Punto Final&quot;) and the Law of Due Obedience repealed and declared unconstitutional. They said they would continue weekly Thursday marches in pursuit of action on other social causes.

The Founding Line faction announced that it would continue both the Thursday marches and the annual marches to commemorate the long struggle of resistance to the dictatorship.

In 2003 there were changes to the law that had ended prosecutions of persons for actions during the Dirty War. In 2006, following new trials, suspects were convicted and sentenced. Investigations and prosecutions have continued into the 2020s.

==Social involvement and political controversies==
The association faction remained close to Kirchnerism. They established a newspaper (&quot;La Voz de las Madres&quot;), a radio station, and a university ().

The association at one time managed a federally funded housing program, &quot;Sueños Compartidos&quot; (&quot;Shared Dreams&quot;), which it founded in 2008. By 2011, Sueños Compartidos had completed 5,600 housing units earmarked for slum residents, and numerous other facilities in six provinces and the city of Buenos Aires.

Its growing budgets, which totaled around US$300 million allocated between 2008 and 2011 (of which $190 million had been spent), came under scrutiny. There was controversy when the chief financial officer of Sueños Compartidos, , and his brother Pablo (the firm&#x27;s attorney) were alleged to have embezzled funds. 

(The Schoklender brothers had been convicted in 1981 for the murder of their parents and served 15 years in prison.) After gaining Bonafini&#x27;s confidence, they were managing the project&#x27;s finances with little oversight from the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo or the program&#x27;s licensor, the Secretary of Public Works. Their friendship with the association ended in June 2011 after Bonafini learned of irregularities in their handling of the group&#x27;s finances. Following an investigation ordered by Federal Judge Norberto Oyarbide, the Secretary of Public Works canceled the Sueños Compartidos contract in August 2011. The outstanding projects were transferred to the Undersecretary of Housing and Urban Development.

==Gender and motherhood==
Issues of gender and motherhood were embedded in this movement. From its inception, the Mothers has been a strictly women-only organization, as the mothers of the disappeared were asserting their existence in the embroidered scarves, posters and demands for restoration of their children. In the later political movement, the women felt it had to continue as women-only partly to ensure their voices and actions would not be lost in a male-dominated movement, and partly out of a belief that men would insist on a lengthy bureaucratic process rather than immediate action. They also believed that women were more tireless and had more emotional strength than men.

Gender separatism reaffirmed that the status of the two Mothers groups as a women&#x27;s movement. Some scholars questioned whether the movement truly challenged the notion of female passivity, and whether the message would have been more powerful if male family members had also been involved.

The Mothers movement raised questions of women in political space and the boundaries surrounding that space. The socially constructed gender roles prevalent in Argentine society restricted the arena of politics, political mobilisation, and confrontation to men. When the Mothers entered Plaza de Mayo, a public space with historical significance, they politicised their role as mothers in society and redefined the values associated with both politics and motherhood itself. Although they did not challenge the patriarchal structure of Argentine society, by crossing boundaries into the masculinised political sphere, they expanded spaces of representation for Argentine women and opened the way for new forms of civic participation.

The Mothers were committed to child-centred politics, symbolised by the white scarves they wore on their heads. The scarves were originally nappies, or were meant to represent diapers; they were embroidered with the names of their disappeared children or relatives. These headscarves identified the Mothers and symbolised children, and thus life, as well as hope and maternal care. The colour white also symbolised the women&#x27;s refusal to wear a black mantilla and go into mourning until they knew the fate of their children. The disappeared children were at the heart of the movement, as the Mothers fought for a system that would respect human life and honour its preservation.
The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo politicised and gave new value to the traditional role of mothers. They used motherhood to frame their protest, demanding the rights inherent to their role: to conserve life. They protested not only what had been done to their children, but also to themselves as mothers by taking them away. The heart of the movement was always &quot;women&#x27;s feelings, mother&#x27;s feelings&quot;, according to Hebe de Bonafini. She further stated that &quot;it was the strength of women, of mothers, that kept us going.&quot; The women&#x27;s identity as mothers did not restrict them from participating or making an impact in a masculinised political space.

Their public protests contradicted the traditional, &quot;private&quot; domain of motherhood. By mobilising, they politicised their consciousness as women. They performed a conservative representation of motherhood, which avoided some controversy and helped attract the support of international media. They refuted the concept that to be taken seriously or to be successful, a movement either has to be gender-neutral, or masculine: femininity and motherhood was integral to the Mothers&#x27; protest.

==Grandmothers==
The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo () is an organization which has the aim of finding the &quot;stolen&quot; babies, whose mothers were killed during the Junta&#x27;s dictatorship in 1977. Its president is Estela Barnes de Carlotto. As of June 2019, their efforts have resulted in finding 130 grandchildren most now young adults.

<doc id="406118" wikidata="Q3246646" url="?curid=406118" title="Bright's disease">
<text>Bright&#x27;s disease is a historical classification of kidney diseases that are described in modern medicine as acute or chronic nephritis. It was characterized by swelling and the presence of albumin in the urine, and was frequently accompanied by high blood pressure and heart disease.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms and signs of Bright&#x27;s disease were first described in 1827 by the English physician Richard Bright, after whom the disease was named. In his &quot;Reports of Medical Cases&quot;, he described 25 cases of dropsy (edema) which he attributed to kidney disease. Symptoms and signs included: inflammation of serous membranes, haemorrhages, apoplexy, convulsions, blindness and coma. Many of these cases were found to have albumin in their urine (detected by the spoon and candle-heat coagulation), and showed striking morbid changes of the kidneys at post-mortem. The triad of dropsy, albumin in the urine and kidney disease came to be regarded as characteristic of Bright&#x27;s disease.

Subsequent work by Bright and others indicated an association with cardiac hypertrophy, which Bright attributed to stimulation of the heart. Frederick Akbar Mahomed showed that a rise in blood pressure could precede the appearance of albumin in the urine, and the rise in blood pressure and increased resistance to flow was believed to explain the cardiac hypertrophy.

It is today known that Bright&#x27;s disease is caused by a wide and diverse range of kidney diseases; thus, the term &quot;Bright&#x27;s disease&quot; is retained for historical application but not in modern diagnosis. The disease was diagnosed frequently in diabetic patients; at least some of these cases would probably correspond to a modern diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.

==Treatment==
Bright&#x27;s disease was historically treated with warm baths, blood-letting, squill, digitalis, mercuric compounds, opium, diuretics, laxatives and dietary therapy, including abstinence from alcoholic drinks, cheese and red meat. Arnold Ehret was diagnosed with Bright&#x27;s disease and pronounced incurable by 24 of Europe&#x27;s most respected doctors; he designed &quot;The Mucusless Diet Healing System&quot;, which apparently cured his illness. William Howard Hay had the illness and, it is claimed, cured himself using the Hay diet.

<doc id="406119" wikidata="Q156567" url="?curid=406119" title="Henri Cartier-Bresson">
<text>Henri Cartier-Bresson (; 22 August 1908 – 3 August 2004) was a French artist and humanist photographer considered a master of candid photography, and an early user of 35mm film. He pioneered the genre of street photography, and viewed photography as capturing a &quot;decisive moment.&quot;

Cartier-Bresson was one of the founding members of Magnum Photos in 1947. In the 1970s, he largely discontinued his photographic work, instead opting to paint.

==Early life==
Henri Cartier-Bresson was born in Chanteloup-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, France. His father was a wealthy textile manufacturer, whose Cartier-Bresson thread was a staple of French sewing kits. His mother&#x27;s family were cotton merchants and landowners from Normandy, where Henri spent part of his childhood. His mother was descended from Charlotte Corday.

The Cartier-Bresson family lived in a bourgeois neighborhood in Paris, Rue de Lisbonne, near Place de l&#x27;Europe and Parc Monceau. Since his parents were providing financial support, Henri pursued photography more freely than his contemporaries. Henri also sketched.

Young Henri took holiday snapshots with a Box Brownie; he later experimented with a 3×4 inch view camera. He was raised in traditional French bourgeois fashion, and was required to address his parents with formal &quot;vous&quot; rather than &quot;tu.&quot; His father assumed that his son would take up the family business, but Henri was strong-willed and also feared this prospect.

Cartier-Bresson attended École Fénelon, a Catholic school that prepared students for the Lycée Condorcet. A governess called &quot;Miss Kitty&quot; who came from across the Channel, instilled in him the love of - and competence in - the English language. The proctor caught him reading a book by Rimbaud or Mallarmé, and reprimanded him, &quot;Let&#x27;s have no disorder in your studies!&quot;. Cartier-Bresson said, &quot;He used the informal &#x27;tu&#x27;, which usually meant you were about to get a good thrashing. But he went on, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to read in my office.&#x27; Well, that wasn&#x27;t an offer he had to repeat.&quot;

===Painting===
He studied painting when he was just 5 years old, taking an apprenticeship in his uncle Louis&#x27; studio. After trying to learn music, Cartier-Bresson was introduced to oil painting by his uncle Louis, a gifted painter and winner of the Prix de Rome in 1910. But his painting lessons were cut short when uncle Louis was killed in World War I.

In 1927, Cartier-Bresson entered a private art school and the Lhote Academy, the Parisian studio of the Cubist painter and sculptor André Lhote, alongside William Klein, Frédéric Menguy and Gerda Sutton. Lhote&#x27;s ambition was to integrate the Cubists&#x27; approach to reality with classical artistic forms; he wanted to link the French classical tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David to Modernism. Cartier-Bresson also studied painting with society portraitist Jacques Émile Blanche.

During that period, he read Dostoevsky, Schopenhauer, Rimbaud, Nietzsche, Mallarmé, Freud, Proust, Joyce, Hegel, Engels and Marx. Lhote took his pupils to the Louvre to study classical artists and to Paris galleries to study contemporary art. Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s interest in modern art was combined with an admiration for the works of the Renaissance masters: Jan van Eyck, Paolo Uccello, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca. Cartier-Bresson regarded Lhote as his teacher of &quot;photography without a camera.&quot;

===Surrealists photography influence===
Although Cartier-Bresson became frustrated with Lhote&#x27;s &quot;rule-laden&quot; approach to art, the rigorous theoretical training later helped him identify and resolve problems of artistic form and composition in photography. In the 1920s, schools of photographic realism were popping up throughout Europe but each had a different view on the direction photography should take. The Surrealist movement, founded in 1924, was a catalyst for this paradigm shift. Cartier-Bresson began socializing with the Surrealists at the Café Cyrano, in the Place Blanche. He met a number of the movement&#x27;s leading protagonists, and was drawn to the Surrealist movement&#x27;s technique of using the subconscious and the immediate to influence their work. The historian Peter Galassi explains:

Cartier-Bresson matured artistically in this stormy cultural and political atmosphere. But, although he knew the concepts, he couldn&#x27;t express them; dissatisfied with his experiments, he destroyed most of his early paintings.

===Cambridge and army===
From 1928 to 1929, Cartier-Bresson studied art, literature, and English at the University of Cambridge, where he became bilingual. In 1930, he was conscripted into the French Army and stationed at Le Bourget near Paris, a time about which he later remarked: &quot;And I had quite a hard time of it, too, because I was toting Joyce under my arm and a Lebel rifle on my shoulder.&quot;

===Receives first camera===
In 1929, Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s air squadron commandant placed him under house arrest for hunting without a licence. Cartier-Bresson met American expatriate Harry Crosby at Le Bourget, who persuaded the commandant to release Cartier-Bresson into his custody for a few days. The two men both had an interest in photography, and Harry presented Henri with his first camera. They spent their time together taking and printing pictures at Crosby&#x27;s home, &quot;Le Moulin du Soleil&quot; (The Sun Mill), near Paris in Ermenonville, France. Crosby later said Cartier-Bresson &quot;looked like a fledgling, shy and frail, and mild as whey.&quot; Embracing the open sexuality offered by Crosby and his wife Caresse, Cartier-Bresson fell into an intense sexual relationship with her that lasted until 1931.

===Escape to Africa===
Two years after Harry Crosby died by suicide, Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s affair with Caresse Crosby ended in 1931, leaving him broken-hearted. During conscription he read Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. This gave him the idea of escaping and finding adventure on the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in French colonial Africa. He survived by shooting game and selling it to local villagers. From hunting, he learned methods which he later used in photography. On the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, he contracted blackwater fever, which nearly killed him. While still feverish, he sent instructions to his grandfather for his own funeral, asking to be buried in Normandy, at the edge of the Eawy Forest while Debussy&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet&quot; was played. Although Cartier-Bresson took a portable camera (smaller than a Brownie Box) to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, only seven photographs survived the tropics.

===Photography===

Returning to France, Cartier-Bresson recuperated in Marseille in late 1931 and deepened his relationship with the Surrealists. He became inspired by a 1930 photograph by Hungarian photojournalist Martin Munkacsi showing three naked young African boys, caught in near-silhouette, running into the surf of Lake Tanganyika. Titled &quot;Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika&quot;, this captured the freedom, grace and spontaneity of their movement and their joy at being alive. That photograph inspired him to stop painting and to take up photography seriously. He explained, &quot;I suddenly understood that a photograph could fix eternity in an instant.&quot;

He acquired the Leica camera with 50 mm lens in Marseilles that would accompany him for many years. The anonymity that the small camera gave him in a crowd or during an intimate moment was essential in overcoming the formal and unnatural behavior of those who were aware of being photographed. He enhanced his anonymity by painting all shiny parts of the Leica with black paint. The Leica opened up new possibilities in photography—the ability to capture the world in its actual state of movement and transformation. Restless, he photographed in Berlin, Brussels, Warsaw, Prague, Budapest and Madrid. His photographs were first exhibited at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1933, and subsequently at the Ateneo Club in Madrid. In 1934 in Mexico, he shared an exhibition with Manuel Álvarez Bravo. In the beginning, he did not photograph much in his native France. It would be years before he photographed there extensively.

In 1934, Cartier-Bresson met a young Polish intellectual, a photographer named David Szymin who was called &quot;Chim&quot; because his name was difficult to pronounce. Szymin later changed his name to David Seymour. The two had much in common culturally. Through Chim, Cartier-Bresson met a Hungarian photographer named Endré Friedmann, who later changed his name to Robert Capa.

==United States exhibits==
Cartier-Bresson traveled to the United States in 1935 with an invitation to exhibit his work at New York&#x27;s Julien Levy Gallery. He shared display space with fellow photographers Walker Evans and Manuel Álvarez Bravo. Carmel Snow of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; gave him a fashion assignment, but he fared poorly since he had no idea how to direct or interact with the models. Nevertheless, Snow was the first American editor to publish Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s photographs in a magazine. While in New York, he met photographer Paul Strand, who did camerawork for the Depression-era documentary &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot;.

===Filmmaking===
When he returned to France, Cartier-Bresson applied for a job with renowned French film director Jean Renoir. He acted in Renoir&#x27;s 1936 film &quot;Partie de campagne&quot; and in the 1939 &quot;La Règle du jeu,&quot; for which he served as second assistant and played a butler. Renoir made Cartier-Bresson act so he could understand how it felt to be on the other side of the camera. Cartier-Bresson also helped Renoir make a film for the Communist party on the 200 families, including his own, who ran France. During the Spanish Civil War, Cartier-Bresson co-directed an anti-fascist film with Herbert Kline, to promote the Republican medical services.

===Photojournalism start===
Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s first photojournalist photos to be published came in 1937 when he covered the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, for the French weekly &quot;Regards.&quot; He focused on the new monarch&#x27;s adoring subjects lining the London streets, and took no pictures of the king. His photo credit read &quot;Cartier&quot;, as he was hesitant to use his full family name.
Between 1937 and 1939, Cartier-Bresson worked as a photographer for the French Communists&#x27; evening paper, &quot;Ce soir&quot;. With Chim and Capa, Cartier-Bresson was a leftist, but he did not join the French Communist party.

==Marriage==
In 1937, Cartier-Bresson married a Javanese dancer, Ratna Mohini. They lived in a fourth-floor servants&#x27; flat in Paris at 19, rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs (now rue Danielle Casanova), a large studio with a small bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom where Cartier-Bresson developed film.

===World War II service===
When World War II broke out in September 1939, Cartier-Bresson joined the French Army as a Corporal in the film and photo unit of the French Third Army. During the Battle of France, in June 1940 at St. Dié in the Vosges Mountains, he was captured by German soldiers and spent 35 months in prisoner-of-war camps doing forced labor under the Nazis. He twice tried and failed to escape from the prison camp, and was punished by solitary confinement. His third escape was successful and he hid on a farm in Touraine before getting false papers that allowed him to travel in France. In France, he worked for the underground, aiding other escapees and working secretly with other photographers to cover the occupation and then the liberation of France. In 1943, he dug up his beloved Leica camera, which he had buried in Vosges farmland .

At the end of the war he was asked by the American Office of War Information to make a documentary, &quot;Le Retour&quot; (The Return) about returning French prisoners and displaced persons. His film spurred a retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) , that would later tour the country. The show debuted in 1947 accompanied by the publication of his first book, &quot;The Photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson.&quot; Lincoln Kirstein and Beaumont Newhall wrote the book&#x27;s texts.

==Magnum Photos==
In early 1947, Cartier-Bresson, with Robert Capa, David Seymour, William Vandivert and George Rodger founded Magnum Photos. Capa&#x27;s brainchild, Magnum was a cooperative picture agency owned by its members. The team split photo assignments among the members. Rodger, who had quit &quot;Life&quot; in London after covering World War II, would cover Africa and the Middle East. Chim, who spoke a variety of European languages, would work in Europe. Cartier-Bresson would be assigned to India and China. Vandivert, who had also left &quot;Life,&quot; would work in America, and Capa would work anywhere that had an assignment. Maria Eisner managed the Paris office and Rita Vandivert, Vandivert&#x27;s wife, managed the New York office and became Magnum&#x27;s first president.

Cartier-Bresson achieved international recognition for his coverage of Gandhi&#x27;s funeral in India in 1948 and the last stage of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He covered the last six months of the Kuomintang administration and the first six months of the Maoist People&#x27;s Republic. He also photographed the last surviving Imperial eunuchs in Beijing, as the city was being liberated by the communists. In Shanghai, he often worked in the company of photojournalist Sam Tata, whom Cartier-Bresson had previously befriended in Bombay. From China, he went on to Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), where he documented the gaining of independence from the Dutch. In 1950, Cartier-Bresson had traveled to the South India. He had visited Tiruvannamalai, a town in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and photographed the last moments of Ramana Maharishi, Sri Ramana Ashram and its surroundings. A few days later he also visited and photographed Sri Aurobindo, Mother and Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry.

Magnum&#x27;s mission was to &quot;feel the pulse&quot; of the times and some of its first projects were &quot;People Live Everywhere&quot;, &quot;Youth of the World&quot;, &quot;Women of the World&quot; and &quot;The Child Generation&quot;. Magnum aimed to use photography in the service of humanity, and provided arresting, widely viewed images.

===&quot;The Decisive Moment&quot;===

In 1952, Cartier-Bresson published his book &quot;Images à la sauvette,&quot; whose English-language edition was titled &quot;The Decisive Moment,&quot; although the French language title actually translates as &quot;images on the sly&quot; or &quot;hastily taken images&quot;, Images à la sauvette included a portfolio of 126 of his photos from the East and the West. The book&#x27;s cover was drawn by Henri Matisse. For his 4,500-word philosophical preface, Cartier-Bresson took his keynote text from Volume 2 of the Memoirs of 17th century Cardinal de Retz, &quot;Il n&#x27;y a rien dans ce monde qui n&#x27;ait un moment decisif&quot; (&quot;There is nothing in this world that does not have a decisive moment&quot;). Cartier-Bresson applied this to his photographic style. He said: &quot;Photographier: c&#x27;est dans un même instant et en une fraction de seconde reconnaître un fait et l&#x27;organisation rigoureuse de formes perçues visuellement qui expriment et signifient ce fait&quot; (&quot;To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.&quot;).

Both titles came from Tériade, the Greek-born French publisher whom Cartier-Bresson admired. He gave the book its French title, &quot;Images à la Sauvette&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;images on the run&quot; or &quot;stolen images.&quot; Dick Simon of Simon &amp; Schuster came up with the English title &quot;The Decisive Moment&quot;. Margot Shore, Magnum&#x27;s Paris bureau chief, translated Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s French preface into English.

&quot;Photography is not like painting,&quot; Cartier-Bresson told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in 1957. &quot;There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. That is the moment the photographer is creative&quot;, he said. &quot;Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever.&quot;

The photo &quot;Rue Mouffetard, Paris&quot;, taken in 1954, has since become a classic example of Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s ability to capture a decisive moment. He held his first exhibition in France at the Pavillon de Marsan in 1955.

==Later career==
Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s photography took him to many places, including China, Mexico, Canada, the United States, India, Japan, Portugal and the Soviet Union. While traveling in China in 1958, Cartier-Bresson documented the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. He became the first Western photographer to photograph &quot;freely&quot; in the post-war Soviet Union.

In 1962, on behalf of &quot;Vogue&quot;, he went to Sardinia for about twenty days. There he visited Nuoro, Oliena, Orgosolo Mamoiada Desulo, Orosei, Cala Gonone, Orani (hosted by his friend Costantino Nivola), San Leonardo di Siete Fuentes, and Cagliari.

Cartier-Bresson withdrew as a principal of Magnum (which still distributes his photographs) in 1966 to concentrate on portraiture and landscapes.

He was also close friends with brothers Alberto Giacometti and Diego Giacometti in Paris.

In 1967, he was divorced from his first wife of 30 years, Ratna (known as &quot;Elie&quot;). In 1968, he began to turn away from photography and return to his passion for drawing and painting. He admitted that perhaps he had said all he could through photography. He married Magnum photographer Martine Franck, thirty years younger than himself, in 1970. The couple had a daughter, Mélanie, in May 1972. He held his first exhibition of drawings at the Carlton Gallery in New York in 1975.

==Death and legacy==
Cartier-Bresson died in Céreste (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France) on 3 August 2004, 19 days before his 96th birthday. No cause of death was announced. He was buried in the local cemetery nearby in Montjustin and was survived by his wife, Martine Franck, and daughter, Mélanie.

Cartier-Bresson spent more than three decades on assignment for &quot;Life&quot; and other journals. He traveled without bounds, documenting some of the great upheavals of the 20th century — the Spanish Civil War, the liberation of Paris in 1944, the fall of the Kuomintang in China to the communists, the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the May 1968 events in Paris, the Berlin Wall. And along the way he paused to document portraits of Camus, Picasso, Colette, Matisse, Pound and Giacometti. But many of his most renowned photographs, such as &quot;Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare&quot;, are of seemingly unimportant moments of ordinary daily life.

Cartier-Bresson did not like to be photographed and treasured his privacy. Photographs of Cartier-Bresson are scant. When he accepted an honorary degree from Oxford University in 1975, he held a paper in front of his face to avoid being photographed.
In a Charlie Rose interview in 2000, Cartier-Bresson noted that it wasn&#x27;t necessarily that he hated to be photographed, but it was that he was embarrassed by the notion of being photographed for being famous.

Cartier-Bresson believed that what went on beneath the surface was nobody&#x27;s business but his own. He did recall that he once confided his innermost secrets to a Paris taxi driver, certain that he would never meet the man again.

In 2003, he created the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation in Paris with his wife, the Belgian photographer Martine Franck and his daughter to preserve and share his legacy. In 2018, the foundation relocated from the Montparnasse district to Le Marais.

The highest price reached by one of his photographs was when &quot;Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s, on 17 November 2011, by $590,455.

===Cinéma vérité===
Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s photographs were also influential in the development of cinéma vérité film. In particular, he is credited as the inspiration for the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s early work in this genre with its 1958 &quot;Candid Eye&quot; series.

==Technique==
Cartier-Bresson almost always used a Leica 35 mm rangefinder camera fitted with a normal 50 mm lens, or occasionally a wide-angle lens for landscapes. He often wrapped black tape around the camera&#x27;s chrome body to make it less conspicuous. With fast black and white film and sharp lenses, he was able to photograph events unnoticed. No longer bound by a 4×5 press camera or a medium format twin-lens reflex camera, miniature-format cameras gave Cartier-Bresson what he called &quot;the velvet hand...the hawk&#x27;s eye.&quot;

He never photographed with flash, a practice he saw as &quot;impolite...like coming to a concert with a pistol in your hand.&quot;

He believed in composing his photographs in the viewfinder, not in the darkroom. He showcased this belief by having nearly all his photographs printed only at full-frame and completely free of any cropping or other darkroom manipulation. He insisted that his prints be left uncropped so as to include a few millimeters of the unexposed negative around the image area, resulting in a black frame around the developed picture.

Cartier-Bresson worked exclusively in black and white, other than a few experiments in color. He disliked developing or making his own prints and showed a considerable lack of interest in the process of photography in general, likening photography with the small camera to an &quot;instant drawing&quot;. Technical aspects of photography were valid for him only where they allowed him to express what he saw:

He started a tradition of testing new camera lenses by taking photographs of ducks in urban parks. He never published the images but referred to them as &#x27;my only superstition&#x27; as he considered it a &#x27;baptism&#x27; of the lens.

Cartier-Bresson is regarded as one of the art world&#x27;s most unassuming personalities. He disliked publicity and exhibited a ferocious shyness since his days of hiding from the Nazis during World War II. Although he took many famous portraits, his face was little known to the world at large. This, presumably, helped allow him to work on the street undisturbed. He denied that the term &quot;art&quot; applied to his photographs. Instead, he thought that they were merely his gut reactions to fleeting situations that he had happened upon.

<doc id="406134" wikidata="Q353137" url="?curid=406134" title="Tracy Hickman">
<text>Tracy Raye Hickman (born November 26, 1955) is an American fantasy author and designer of games and virtual reality (VR) experiences. He co-authored the original &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels with Margaret Weis as well as numerous other books. He also designed and created role playing game material while working for TSR and has cowritten novels with his wife, Laura Hickman. He is the author or co-author of over 60 books.

==Early life==
Tracy Hickman was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. His parents instilled in him a love of reading; he recalls visiting the local bookmobile with them. Hickman took a particular interest in the science fiction genre. He graduated from Provo High School in 1974. His major interests were drama, music, and Air Force JROTC. 

In 1975, Hickman began two years of service as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served in Hawaii for six months while awaiting visa approval for travel to Indonesia, where he served in Surabaya, Djakarta, and the mountain city of Bandung until 1977.

Within four months of his return to the United States, Hickman married his high school sweetheart, Laura Curtis. Laura first introduced him to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) shortly after they were married. She gave him the game that year for his birthday. Speaking on his discovery of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, Hickman said, &quot;I spent part of my student loan money to buy game materials. It turned out to be the best career investment any of that money was ever used for.&quot; Laura was also the inspiration for Tracy&#x27;s character Lauralanthalasa (Laurana) Kanan.
Hickman attended Brigham Young University. In an interview, he stated that he &quot;nearly failed [his] creative writing course&quot; in college.

==Career==
Hickman had many jobs before joining TSR, Inc. (the publisher of Dungeons &amp; Dragons) in 1982, including working as a supermarket stocker, a movie projectionist, a theater manager, a glass worker, a television assistant director, and a drill press operator in a genealogy center.

===TSR===
Together, Tracy and Laura wrote the original versions of the adventure modules &quot;Rahasia&quot; and &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, publishing them privately. &quot;Pharaoh&quot; was originally published by DayStar West Media in 1980. In 1981, Tracy entered into a business arrangement to produce an arcade immersion game, but his associate disappeared, leaving the Hickmans with $30,000 in debt. Tracy approached TSR with the modules &quot;Rahasia&quot; and &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, &quot;literally so that I could buy shoes for my children&quot;. TSR bought the modules, and wanted to hire Tracy as well. Tracy recalls, &quot;They said it would be easier to publish my adventures if I was part of the company. So, we made the move from Utah to Wisconsin. It was a terrifying experience. We had no money. My parents begged us not to venture into such foreign territory to pursue such a bizarre career. My father wrote that there was a secure job as a fry cook in Flagstaff (where my parents were living), and he pleaded with me to come take it.&quot;

When Tracy and Laura Hickman came to TSR, they brought &quot;Pharaoh&quot; with them. It was published as the first part of TSR&#x27;s &quot;Desert of Desolation&quot; series (1982–1983). &quot;Ravenloft&quot; (1983) was also written by Tracy and Laura Hickman. Hickman also wrote two supplements for TSR&#x27;s &quot;Gangbusters&quot; role-playing game. Tracy and Laura Hickman&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; module portfolio are credited with initiating a fundamental shift in the RPG module design sensibilities, away from pure dungeon crawl and towards more &quot;cerebral&quot; adventures centered on intriguing plots.

===Dragonlance===
As he was traveling from Utah to Wisconsin to join TSR, Hickman thought of the idea for a setting in which dragons would be fearsome once again. At TSR he found other creators who were interested in his project, which was dubbed &quot;Project Overlord&quot;. Harold Johnson was the first to join the project and brought it to upper management, and talked Hickman into expanding further upon his idea of only a trilogy of three adventures. Soon after, TSR management announced its intention to develop Hickman&#x27;s series of dragon-based role-playing adventures. Hickman&#x27;s proposal resulted in the &quot;Dragonlance Chronicles&quot;, which led to his association with Margaret Weis. Jean Black, the managing editor of TSR&#x27;s book department, assigned Hickman and Weis to write first the novel &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; and then continue with the rest of the &quot;Dragonlance Chronicles&quot; series. This was the first project TSR had undertaken that would include adult novels as well as games, calendars, and other spin-off products. It was also Hickman&#x27;s first novel writing experience. The original &quot;Dragonlance&quot; team was formed under Hickman&#x27;s leadership. The project began with a novel and three game modules. It eventually expanded a trilogy of books (written by Weis and Hickman) and 15 companion modules. After completing the &quot;Dragonlance Chronicles&quot;, Hickman and Weis next wrote the &quot;Dragonlance Legends&quot; trilogy, which was published in 1986. &quot;Dragonlance&quot; eventually expanded to include dozens of books, many written by other authors. By 1987, the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; project had sold two million books and half a million adventure modules. It garnered &quot;a large and engaged fan base&quot;. Hickman and Weis developed a system of co-writing in which Weis is the writer and Hickman is the &quot;storyteller and world builder&quot; for the project. The last &quot;Dragonlance&quot; books to be published were released in 2007.

In March 2019, Hickman and Weis were contracted by Wizards of the Coast, the new publisher of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons,&quot; to write another installment of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series. A new trilogy of books was planned to be published by Random House. Wizards of the Coast reportedly approved the first manuscript in the beginning of 2020, and Hickman and Weis had also finished the draft for the sequel. Wizards of the Coast then put a stop to the project, and Hickman and Weis responded by suing the publisher for breach of contract on October 16, 2020, requesting $10 million in compensation. The authors later dropped the lawsuit in December 2020 and announced that Del Rey Books would publish the new &quot;Dragonlance&quot; trilogy, with a publication date to be announced. Hickman and Weis see the new trilogy as &quot;the capstone to their life&#x27;s work&quot;. In December 2021, it was announced that the first novel of the new series, &quot;Dragonlance: Dragons of Deceit&quot;, is scheduled for release on August 9, 2022.

===Novelist===

====Gaming fiction====

Hickman left TSR in 1987. He has published more than 30 novels with Margaret Weis. Together they wrote the &quot;Darksword&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Death Gate Cycle&quot;, and collaborated on the &quot;Rose of the Prophet&quot; series (1988-1989). Weis and Hickman later returned to TSR to write more new fiction, although TSR turned their intended trilogy into a single novel, &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot;, published in 1995.

Tracy and Laura Hickman have been publishing game designs together for over 30 years, including the popular and innovative &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module in 1983. The Hickmans originally developed &quot;Ravenloft&quot; as a way to entertain their friends every Halloween. Says Hickman of the original module, and its 1986 sequel, &quot;Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill&quot;, &quot;I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them.&quot; &quot;Ravenloft&quot; was revived with the release of the Hickmans&#x27; &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; module in 2016.

For the Starshield Project, Hickman and Weis produced the Del Rey Books-published novels &quot;Sentinels&quot; (later retitled &quot;Mantle of Kendis-Dai&quot;) and &quot;Nightsword&quot;. Hickman also wrote a story set in the Starshield universe for &quot;Dragon&quot; #250 called &quot;Dedrak&#x27;s Quest&quot;. Of his and Weis&#x27;s fictional setting, he said, &quot;Starshield is a universe where a society of dragons can confront blaster-armed spacemen or wizards wielding magic staves with computer targeting&quot;, and that the Starshield Project &quot;grew out of [his] desire to share the creation process with all [their] fans.&quot; According to Hickman, Starshield&#x27;s ultimate purpose, and his biggest dream, was to finance a permanent colony on the planet Mars by 2010. Readers were able to freely download both the first novel in the series and the Starshield roleplaying game from Hickman&#x27;s website.

In the late 1990s, Larry Elmore asked Weis and Hickman to write novels for his fantasy world of Loerem, and they agreed to produce the &quot;Sovereign Stone&quot; trilogy. With encouragement from Peter Adkison, Wizards of the Coast published a new trilogy of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels by Weis and Hickman called &quot;War of Souls&quot;, beginning with &quot;Dragons of a Fallen Sun&quot; (2000).

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named Tracy Hickman one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons&quot;, &quot;at least in the realm of adventure gaming&quot;. The magazine stated that Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis were &quot;basically responsible for the entire gaming fiction genre&quot;. Hickman was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame in 2002, recognized in part for &quot;one game line turned literary sensation: &quot;Dragonlance&quot;&quot;. Tracy and Laura Hickman wrote the adventure &quot;Out in the Black&quot; (2006) for the &quot;Serenity Role Playing Game&quot; for Margaret Weis Productions.

In 2009, Hickman released &quot;XDM: X-Treme Dungeon Mastery&quot;, a guide for DMs based on his years of experience in the trade. Written with his son Curtis Hickman and illustrated by online comic artist Howard Tayler, the book calls itself &quot;the cure for the common game&quot;. The Hickmans have hosted &quot;Killer Breakfasts&quot;, popular role-playing game experiences, at Gen Con conventions in various locations.

====Miscellaneous writing====
In spring 1996, Hickman&#x27;s first two solo novels, &quot;Requiem of Stars&quot; and &quot;The Immortals&quot;, were published. &quot;The Immortals&quot; is a science fiction novel about &quot;AIDS concentration camps in Utah&quot;. Of the novel, Hickman said: &quot;I was absolutely driven to write that book. I was able to say many things that I felt strongly about and still do. It is perhaps my finest work.&quot; Tracy and Laura Hickman published their first joint novel, &quot;Mystic Warrior&quot;, in 2004.

Hickman then released two new fantasy series: the four-book &quot;Dragonships of Vindras&quot; series (co-written with his longtime writing partner Margaret Weis), and the three-book &quot;Annals of Drakis&quot; series (co-written with his wife, Laura).

In 2010, Tracy and Laura Hickman launched a direct-to-internet serialized fantasy series, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Bard&quot;, which merged serial publishing techniques (such as those employed with Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;) with modern internet distribution. &quot;Eventide&quot;, the first book in the Tales of the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Bard&quot; series, was subsequently published by Shadow Mountain Publishing in 2012. Hickman has said that &quot;Eventide&quot; was his favorite project to work on.

While primarily known for his work in epic fantasy, Hickman once wrote a Batman novel for DC Comics titled &quot;Wayne of Gotham&quot; (June 2012). The book explores the characters of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s parents.

===Other work===
Tracy and Laura Hickman produced their DragonHearth podcast until about December 2010. Hickman founded the Parsec Awards alongside Mur Lafferty and Michael Mennenga in 2006.

Hickman wrote the screenplay for, produced, and edited the first science-fiction film shot completely in space, &quot;Apogee of Fear&quot;. In August 2008, it was announced that Hickman would travel to the International Space Station, where his digitized DNA and samples of his writing would be stored in a capsule as part of &quot;Operation Immortality&quot;, sponsored by NCSoft. Game developer Richard Garriott gathered information from people around the world (contributed through a website) to store in the capsule. On the topic of the project, Hickman said, &quot;I have lived my entire life dreaming of space. &#x27;Operation Immortality&#x27; is essentially a celebration of that same adventuring spirit and an offering of hope for the future. I am deeply honored to participate.&quot;

On March 15, 2013, Hickman joined Richard Garriott&#x27;s team as lead story designer for &quot;Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues&quot;. &quot;Shroud of the Avatar&quot; is the &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to Garriott&#x27;s previous work in the fantasy role-playing genre, the &quot;Ultima&quot; series of video games.

On March 16, 2016, Hickman announced that he had become the Director of Story Development at The Void, a virtual reality gaming experience franchise, working with his son Curtis in designing interactive adventures.

==Personal life==
Hickman married Laura Curtis in 1977, and together they have four children. In addition to the books he has co-written with his wife, Hickman has collaborated with her on ideas for his works since the beginning of his career. The two have worked closely together on numerous projects. Tracy and Laura Hickman have appeared together at multiple conferences and conventions, including the Writing and Illustrating for Young Readers conference.

On his website Hickman states that he is a devout member of the LDS Church. He has stated that he likes writing in the fantasy genre because it &quot;is about ethical and moral choices—the questions of good and evil&quot; and because it reflects &quot;the story of all of us on our journey through mortality and our seeking to return home to Christ&quot;. Hickman has said that his faith often inspires his work. As of 1998, the family resides in St. George, Utah.

<text>Charles Yorke PC (30 December 172220 January 1770) was a British politician who briefly served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. His father was also Lord Chancellor, and he began his career as a Member of Parliament. He served successively as Solicitor-General and Attorney-General for several governments, during which he was best known for writing what became the Quebec Act. He was appointed Lord Chancellor over his objections, but he committed suicide only three days after taking the post.

==Life==
The second son of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, he was born in London, and was educated at Newcome&#x27;s School in Hackney and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. His literary abilities were shown at an early age by his collaboration with his brother Philip in the &quot;Athenian Letters&quot;. In 1745 he published an able treatise on the law of forfeiture for high treason, in defence of the severe sentences his father had given to the Scottish Jacobite peers following the Battle of Culloden. In the following year he was called to the bar.

His father being at this time Lord Chancellor, Yorke obtained a sinecure appointment in the Court of Chancery in 1747, and entered Parliament as member for Reigate, a seat which he afterwards exchanged for that for the University of Cambridge. He quickly made his mark in the House of Commons, one of his earliest speeches being in favour of his father&#x27;s reform of the marriage law that led to the Marriage Act 1753. In 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1751 he became counsel to the East India Company, and in 1756 he was appointed Solicitor-General, a place which he retained in the administration of the elder Pitt, of whose foreign policy he was a powerful defender.

He resigned with Pitt in 1761, but in 1762 became Attorney-General under Lord Bute. He continued to hold this office when George Grenville became Prime Minister (April 1763), and advised the government on the question raised by John Wilkes&#x27;s &quot;The North Briton&quot;. Yorke refused to describe the libel as treasonable, while pronouncing it a high misdemeanour. In the following November he resigned office. Resisting Pitt&#x27;s attempt to draw him into alliance against the ministry he had quit, Yorke maintained, in a speech that prompted the highest eulogy from Horace Walpole, that parliamentary privilege did not extend to cases of libel; though he agreed with Pitt in condemning the principle of general warrants. Yorke, henceforward a member of the Rockingham party, was elected recorder of Dover in 1764, and in 1765 he again became Attorney-General in the Rockingham administration, whose policy he did much to shape. He supported the repeal of the Stamp Act 1765, while urging the simultaneous passing of the Declaratory Act. His most important measure was the constitution which he drew up for the province of Quebec, and which after his resignation of office became the Quebec Act 1774.

On the accession to power of Chatham and Grafton in 1766, Yorke resigned office, and took little part in the debates in Parliament during the next four years. In 1770 he was invited by the Duke of Grafton, when Camden was dismissed from the Chancellorship, to take his seat on the woolsack. He had, however, explicitly pledged himself to Rockingham and his party not to take office with Grafton. The king exerted all his personal influence to overcome Yorke&#x27;s scruples, warning him finally that the Great Seal if now refused would never again be within his grasp. Yorke yielded to the king&#x27;s entreaty, and he was appointed Lord Chancellor and sworn of the Privy Council on 17 January 1770. The story has been told that he went to his brother&#x27;s house, where he met the leaders of the Opposition, and feeling at once overwhelmed with shame, fled to his own house, where three days later he committed suicide (20 January 1770). The patent raising him to the peerage as Baron Morden had been made out, but his last act was to refuse his sanction to the sealing of the document. More recent scholarship questions this account, noting that he had been in poor health for some time and recently written to his brother of his fatigue. On his wife&#x27;s account he ate excessively, as he had been doing of late, and complaining of sickness and indigestion was heard retching until his family became concerned and had him carried to bed having broken a blood vessel in his sickness. On this account neither was his death a suicide, nor did he refuse to seal the patent for his peerage. Though remaining unsealed, the patent expired with its peer-designate.

==Family==

Charles Yorke was twice married:

First, on 19 May 1755 to Katherine Blount Freeman, with one son:
*Philip Yorke, (31 May 175718 November 1834) became 3rd Earl of Hardwicke

Second, on 30 December 1762 to Agneta Johnson, with children:

*Charles Philip Yorke (12 March 176413 March 1834) was later to be prominent in government.
*Caroline Yorke (29 August 176526 July 1818), who married John Eliot, 1st Earl of St Germans.
*Joseph Sydney Yorke (6 June 17685 May 1831), who became an Admiral in the Royal Navy.

His wife was heiress to Tyttenhanger House, near St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Agneta (1740 – 30 December 1820) exhibited works in pastels at the Society of Artists between 1771 and 1775. She corresponded with William Gilpin, who instructed her and her three children in their art, and she also rendered some of Gilpin&#x27;s works, including a view of Netley Abbey, as etchings.

She died in 1820. There is a monument to her at St Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church, Wimpole, Cambridgeshire.

He made himself exceedingly unpopular in 1810 by bringing about the exclusion of strangers, including reporters for the press, from the House of Commons under the standing order, which led to the imprisonment of Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet in the Tower and to riots in London. In the same year, Yorke joined Spencer Perceval&#x27;s government as First Lord of the Admiralty. He retired from public life in 1818.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1801.

<text>The Apgar score is a quick way for health professionals to evaluate the health of all newborns at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and in response to resuscitation. It was originally developed in 1952 by an anesthesiologist at Columbia University, Virginia Apgar, to address the need for a standardized way to evaluate infants shortly after birth.

Today, the categories developed by Apgar used to assess the health of a newborn remain largely the same as in 1952, though the way they are implemented and used has evolved over the years. The score is determined through the evaluation of the newborn in five criteria: activity (tone), pulse, grimace, appearance, and respiration. For each criterion, newborns can receive a score from 0 to 2. The list of criteria is a backronym of Apgar&#x27;s surname.

==Criteria==
===Interpretation===

Various members of the healthcare team, including midwives, nurses, or physicians, may be involved in the Apgar scoring of a neonate. The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores of seven and above are generally normal; four to six, fairly low; and three and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts.

A low score on the one-minute mark may show that the neonate requires medical attention, but does not necessarily indicate a long-term problem, particularly if the score improves at the five-minute mark. A constellation of factors may contribute to a low Apgar score value. An Apgar score that remains below three at five minutes and later times, such as 10, 15, or 30 minutes, does not provide supporting evidence for a specific illness but can sometimes be among the first indicators of neonatal encephalopathy. However, the Apgar test&#x27;s purpose is to determine quickly whether or not a newborn needs immediate medical care. It is not designed to predict long-term health issues.

A score of 10 is uncommon, due to the prevalence of transient cyanosis, and does not substantially differ from a score of nine. Transient cyanosis is common, particularly in babies born at high altitude.

=== Implementation ===

In cases where a newborn needs resuscitation, it should be initiated before the Apgar score is assigned at the one-minute mark. Therefore, the Apgar score is not used to determine if initial resuscitation is needed, rather it is used to determine if resuscitation efforts should be continued. Variation between the one-minute and five-minute Apgar scores can be used to assess an infant&#x27;s response to resuscitation. If the score is below seven at the five-minute mark, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines specify that the infant&#x27;s Apgar score should be reassessed at five-minute intervals for up to 20 minutes.

Exceedingly few infants who have an Apgar score of 0 at 10 minutes of age survive with intact neurological function. As a result, the 2011 Neonatal Resuscitation Program suggests that if no pulse is appreciable at 10 minutes of life, &quot;discontinuation of resuscitative efforts may be appropriate.&quot; However, in a recent retrospective study including 17 infants with an Apgar score of 0 at 10 minutes who received therapeutic hypothermia, 4 of the 8 surviving babies had no neurological abnormalities and only 1 infant had severe abnormalities, as assessed through brain MRI. 

During neonatal resuscitation, Apgar scores may not accurately represent the condition of the neonate as resuscitation measures (i.e. positive pressure ventilation and chest compressions) may artificially elevate scores. As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourage the use of an expanded Apgar score report, which records resuscitation efforts utilized at each time point.

A systematic review that analyzed the relationship between umbilical cord pH and neonatal outcomes found that low cord pH is strongly correlated with mortality, morbidity and cerebral palsy in childhood. To reduce the risk of negative outcomes, it is recommended to obtain a sample of the umbilical artery blood gas when a newborn has an Apgar score of five or less at the five-minute mark.

Recognizing the importance of skin to skin contact (SSC), the World Health Organization (WHO), as part of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, recommends that the Apgar score should be done while SSC is underway whenever possible. This recommendation was adopted by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2009.

=== Limitations ===
There are numerous factors that contribute to the Apgar score, several of which are subjective. Examples of subjective factors include but are not limited to color, tone, and reflex irritability. Preterm infants may receive a lower score in these categories due to lack of maturity rather than asphyxia. Other factors that may contribute to variability among infants are birth defects, sedation of the mother during labor, gestational age or trauma. Inappropriately using the Apgar score has led to errors in diagnosing asphyxia.

Various studies have shown that the Apgar score has variability between individual medical providers. One study was done in which several health care providers were assigned to give Apgar scores to the same infants. Results showed an Apgar score consistency of 55% to 82% between health care providers. Ideally, to limit variability and bolster consistency, it is preferred that the same individual determine the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores.

A 2023 paper of nine million babies, found that non-white babies were given lower Apgar scores than white babies, as their darker skin color often results in lower scores on the appearance measure, making them more likely to receive medical care that might not be needed.

== History ==
Apgar originally developed the criteria as a way to address the lack of a standardized way to assess the need for assistive breathing procedures for newborns. In 1952, after some refinement of her initial system, Apgar presented the Apgar score at a joint meeting between the International Anesthesia Research Society and the International College of Anesthetists, and it was then published in &quot;Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia&quot; in 1953.

In 1955, efforts to establish a scientific basis to the score increased. Alongside Duncan Holaday and Stanley James, Apgar published a research paper using the scores of 15,348 infants to establish the association between a low Apgar score (0-2) and laboratory findings characteristics of asphyxia.

The Apgar score is no longer used as a way to determine the need for newborn resuscitation because supportive measures must be implemented prior to 1 minute after birth, the first time-point at which the Apgar score is determined. However, the Apgar score is a method of assessment endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

==Acronym==
Some ten years after initial publication, a backronym for APGAR was coined in the United States as a mnemonic learning aid: Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex irritability), Activity (muscle tone), and Respiration.

* Spanish: &quot;Apariencia, Pulso, Gesticulación, Actividad, Respiración&quot;;
* Portuguese: &quot;Aparência, Pulso, Gesticulação, Atividade, Respiração&quot;;
* French: &quot;Apparence, Pouls, Grimace, Activité, Respiration&quot;;
* German: &quot;Atmung, Puls, Grundtonus, Aussehen, Reflexe&quot;, representing the same tests but in a different order (respiration, pulse, muscle tone, appearance, reflex).
* Czech: &quot;Adaptace kůže, Pulz, Grimasy, Aktivita svalů, Respirace&quot;;

Another eponymous backronym from Virginia Apgar&#x27;s name is American Pediatric Gross Assessment Record.

Another mnemonic for the test is &quot;How Ready Is This Child?&quot;, which summarizes the test criteria as Heart rate, Respiratory effort, Irritability, Tone, and Color.

<doc id="406154" wikidata="Q61361" url="?curid=406154" title="Gustave Whitehead">
<text>Gustave Albin Whitehead (born Gustav Albin Weisskopf; 1 January 1874 – 10 October 1927) was a German–American aviation pioneer. Between 1897 and 1915, he designed and built gliders, flying machines, and engines. Controversy surrounds published accounts and Whitehead&#x27;s own claims that he flew a powered machine successfully several times in 1901 and 1902, predating the first flights by the Wright brothers in 1903.

Much of Whitehead&#x27;s reputation rests on a newspaper article which was written as an eyewitness report and describes his powered and sustained flight in Connecticut on 14 August 1901. Over a hundred newspapers in the U.S. and around the world soon repeated information from the article. Several local newspapers also reported on other flight experiments that Whitehead made in 1901 and subsequent years. Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft designs and experiments were described or mentioned in &quot;Scientific American&quot; articles and a 1904 book about industrial progress. His public profile faded after about 1915, however, and he died in relative obscurity in 1927.

In the 1930s, a magazine article and book asserted that Whitehead had made powered flights in 1901–02, and the book includes statements from people who said that they had seen various Whitehead flights decades earlier. These published accounts triggered debate among scholars, researchers, and aviation enthusiasts. Mainstream historians have consistently dismissed the Whitehead flight claims, which Orville Wright later described as &#x27;mythical&#x27;.

Researchers have studied and attempted to copy Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft. Since the 1980s, enthusiasts in the U.S. and Germany have built and flown replicas of Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Number 21&quot; machine using modern engines and modern propellers, and with fundamental changes to the aircraft structure and control systems.

== Early life and career ==
Whitehead was born in Leutershausen, Bavaria, the second child of Karl Weisskopf and his wife Babetta. As a boy he showed an interest in flight, experimenting with kites and earning the nickname &quot;the flyer&quot;. He and a friend caught and tethered birds in an attempt to learn how they flew, an activity which the police soon stopped.

His parents died in 1886 and 1887, when he was a boy. He then trained as a mechanic and traveled to Hamburg, where in 1888 he was forced to join the crew of a sailing ship. A year later he returned to Germany, then journeyed with a family to Brazil. He went to sea again for several years, learning more about wind, weather and bird flight.

Weisskopf arrived in the U.S. in 1893. He soon anglicized his name to Gustave Whitehead. The New York toy manufacturer E. J. Horsman hired Whitehead to build and operate advertising kites and model gliders. Whitehead also made plans to add a motor to propel one of his gliders. In 1893, Whitehead was in Boston where he experimented with gliders, kites, and models, and where he worked at Harvard&#x27;s kite-flying meteorological station.

In 1896, Whitehead was hired as a mechanic for the Boston Aeronautical Society. He and mechanic Albert B. C. Horn built a Lilienthal-type glider and an ornithopter. Whitehead made a few short and low flights in the glider, but did not succeed in flying the ornithopter. Also in 1896, founding Society member Samuel Cabot employed Whitehead and carpenter James Crowell to build a Lilienthal glider. Cabot reported to the Society that tests with this glider were unsuccessful.

== Claims to powered flight ==
=== 1899 ===
According to an affidavit given in 1934 by Louis Darvarich, a friend of Whitehead, the two men made a motorized flight of about half a mile in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Schenley Park in April or May 1899. Darvarich said they flew at a height of in a steam-powered monoplane aircraft and crashed into a brick building. Darvarich said he was stoking the aircraft&#x27;s boiler aboard the craft and was badly scalded in the accident, requiring several weeks in a hospital. Because of this incident, Whitehead was forbidden by the police to perform any more experiments in Pittsburgh. Aviation historian William F. Trimble, pointing to a lack of contemporary proof, dismissed this story in 1982 as a case of &quot;overactive imaginations.&quot; Whitehead&#x27;s stated control method – a shifting of body weight – was said by Trimble to be insufficient to control a powered aircraft, and the supposed charcoal-fired steam powerplant could not have been powerful enough to lift itself off the ground. Whitehead was quoted in Pittsburgh newspapers in December 1899 as still constructing an aircraft, although he did say that he had flown it in Boston. A local historian claimed in 2015 that his research has uncovered evidence of the purported 1899 flight.

Whitehead and Darvarich traveled to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to find factory jobs.

=== 1901 ===
A description and photographs of Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft appeared in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in June 1901, stating that the &quot;novel flying machine&quot; had just been completed, and was &quot;now ready for preliminary trials.&quot;

Whitehead said he tested his unmanned machine on 3 May, according to a newspaper report.
He said in the first test the machine carried 220 pounds of sand ballast and flew to an altitude of 40 to 50 feet for 1/8 of a mile (). On the second test Whitehead said the machine flew a distance of 1/2 mile () for one and a half minutes before crashing into a tree. The report said Andrew Cellie and Daniel Varovi were Whitehead&#x27;s financial backers and assistants. Whitehead expressed his desire to keep the location of any future experiments hidden to avoid drawing a crowd that might make a &quot;snap-shot verdict of failure&quot;.

The aviation event for which Whitehead is now best known reportedly took place in Fairfield, Connecticut, on 14 August 1901 and was described at length in an article in the edition of 18 August 1901 of the weekly &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; newspaper. The article, written as an eyewitness report, stated that Whitehead piloted his Number 21 aircraft in a controlled powered flight for about half a mile, reaching a height of and landing safely. The unsigned article is widely attributed to journalist Richard Howell, later the newspaper&#x27;s editor. The flight, if it actually took place, preceded the Wright brothers&#x27; first powered flights near Kitty Hawk in 1903 by more than two years, and exceeded the best one, which covered at a height of about .

The article was accompanied by a drawing, also credited by some Whitehead researchers to Howell, which depicted the aircraft in flight. The drawing was purportedly based on a photograph, which is believed not to exist. Information from the article was reprinted in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, which ran it on 23 August 1901. In the following months, dozens of other newspapers around the world published articles mentioning the reported flight or other aviation activity by Whitehead.

The &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; reported that Whitehead and another man drove to the testing area in the machine, which, when the wings were folded along its sides, functioned as a car. Two other people, including the newspaper reporter, followed on bicycles. For short distances, the Number 21&#x27;s speed was close to thirty miles an hour on the uneven road, and the article said, &quot;there seems no doubt that the machine can reel off forty miles an hour and not exert the engine to its fullest capacity.&quot;.

The newspaper reported that before attempting to pilot the aircraft, Whitehead successfully test flew it unmanned, using tether ropes and sandbag ballast. When Whitehead was ready to make a manned flight, the article said: &quot;By this time the light was good. Faint traces of the rising sun began to suggest themselves in the east.&quot;

According to the newspaper article, trees blocked the way after the flight had started. Whitehead was quoted as saying, &quot;I knew that I could not clear them by rising higher, and also that I had no means of steering around them by using the machinery.&quot; The article said Whitehead quickly thought of a solution to steer around the trees:

He simply shifted his weight more to one side than the other. This careened the ship to one side. She turned her nose away from the clump of sprouts when within fifty yards of them and took her course around them as prettily as a yacht on the sea avoids a bar. The ability to control the air ship in this manner appeared to give Whitehead confidence, for he was seen to take time to look at the landscape about him. He looked back and waved his hand exclaiming, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got it at last.&#x27;

When Whitehead neared the end of a field, the article said he turned off the motor and the aircraft landed &quot;so lightly that Whitehead was not jarred in the least.&quot;

Junius Harworth, who as a boy was one of Whitehead&#x27;s helpers, said Whitehead flew the airplane at another time in mid-1901 from Howard Avenue East to Wordin Avenue, along the edge of property belonging to the local gas company. Upon landing, Harworth said, the machine was turned around and another hop was made back to the starting point.

On 21 September 1901, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; ran a picture of Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;latest flying machine&quot; and said that he &quot;recently made a successful flight of half a mile&quot;. On 19 November 1901, &quot;The Evening World&quot; (New York) ran a story about Whitehead&#x27;s achievements and included a photograph of him sitting on his new flying machine. The article quotes him saying, &quot;within a year people will be buying airships as freely as they are buying automobiles today and the sky will be dotted with figures skimming the air&quot;. On 7 December 1901, the &quot;Coconino Sun&quot; ran a story that stated Gustave Whitehead was the &quot;inventor of the flying machine&quot; and was planning a flight to New York.

During this period of activity, Whitehead also reportedly tested an unmanned and unpowered flying machine, towed by men pulling ropes. A witness said the craft rose above telephone lines, flew across a road and landed undamaged. The distance covered was later measured at approximately 1,000 ft (305 m).

=== 1902 ===
Whitehead claimed two spectacular flights on 17 January 1902 in his improved Number 22, with a 40 hp (30 kW) motor instead of the 20 hp (15 kW) used in the Number 21, and aluminum instead of bamboo for structural components. In two published letters he wrote to &quot;American Inventor&quot; magazine,
Whitehead said the flights took place over Long Island Sound. He said the distance of the first flight was about two miles (3.2 km) and the second was seven miles (11 km) in a circle at heights up to 200 ft (61 m). He said the airplane, which had a boat-like fuselage, landed safely in the water near the shore.

For steering, Whitehead said he varied the speed of the two propellers and also used the aircraft rudder. He said the techniques worked well on his second flight and enabled him to fly a big circle back to the shore where his helpers waited. In his first letter, he expressed pride in the accomplishment: &quot;... as I successfully returned to my starting place with a machine hitherto untried and heavier than air, I consider the trip quite a success. To my knowledge it is the first of its kind. This matter has so far never been published.&quot;

In his second letter he wrote, &quot;This coming Spring I will have photographs made of Machine No. 22 in the air.&quot; He said snapshots, apparently taken during his claimed flights of 17 January 1902, &quot;did not come out right&quot; because of cloudy and rainy weather. The magazine editor replied that he and readers would &quot;await with interest the promised photographs of the machine in the air,&quot; but there were no further letters nor any photographs from Whitehead.

Anton Pruckner, a mechanic and assistant to Whitehead, signed an affidavit concerning the claimed 17 January 1902 flight: &quot;... I knew that the flight took place because of talk by those who had seen it and because Whitehead himself had told me he made it ... I believe Whitehead made that flight, as his aircraft did fly well and with the bigger engine we had built, the plane was capable of such a flight. Whitehead was of fine moral character and never in all the long time I was associated with him or knew him did he ever appear to exaggerate. I never knew him to lie; he was a very truthful man ... I saw his aircraft fly on many occasions.&quot;

Gustave Whitehead&#x27;s brother John arrived in Connecticut from California in April 1902, intending to offer help. He saw his brother&#x27;s aircraft only on the ground, not in powered flight.
He gave a description 33 years later of the engine and aircraft, including details of the steering apparatus:

Rudder was a combination of horizontal and vertical fin-like affair, the principle the same as in the up-to-date airplanes. For steering there was a rope from one of the foremost wing tip ribs to the opposite, running over a pulley. In front of the operator was a lever connected to a pulley: the same pulley also controlled the tail rudder at the same time.

A 1935 article in &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; magazine, which renewed interest in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected in his yard following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not have money to build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903, Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted on testing the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom.

=== 1903 ===
On 19 September 1903, &quot;Scientific American&quot; reported Whitehead made powered glider flights in a triplane machine towed by an assistant pulling a rope: &quot;By running with the machine against the wind after the motor had been started, the aeroplane was made to skim along above the ground at heights of from 3 to 16 feet for a distance, without the operator touching, of about 350 yards. It was possible to have traveled a much longer distance, without the operator touching terra firma, but for the operator&#x27;s desire not to get too far above it. Although the motor was not developing its full power, owing to the speed not exceeding 1,000 R.P.M., it developed sufficient to move the machine against the wind.&quot; The article said a two-cycle motor powered a two-bladed diameter tractor propeller. The engine shown in the article was exhibited by Whitehead at the Second Annual Exhibit of the Aero Club of America in December 1906.

== Aerial machines ==

Whitehead did not give identifiers to his first aircraft, but according to Randolph and Harvey to the end of 1901 he had built &quot;fifty-six airplanes&quot;.

Whitehead&#x27;s Number 21 monoplane had a wingspan of 36 ft (11 m). The fabric-covered wings were ribbed with bamboo, supported by steel wires and were very similar to the shape of the Lilienthal glider&#x27;s wings. The arrangement for folding the wings also closely followed the Lilienthal design. The craft was powered by two engines: a ground engine of 10 hp (7.5 kW), intended to propel the front wheels to reach takeoff speed, and a 20 hp (15 kW) acetylene engine powering two propellers, which were designed to counter-rotate for stability.

Whitehead described his No. 22 aircraft and compared some of its features to the No. 21 in a letter he wrote to the editor of &quot;American Inventor&quot; magazine, published 1 April 1902. He said the No. 22 had a five-cylinder 40 hp kerosene motor of his own design, weighing 120 lbs. He said ignition was &quot;accomplished by its own heat and compression.&quot; He described the aircraft as long, made mostly of steel and aluminum with wing ribs made of steel tubing, rather than bamboo, which was used in the Number 21 aircraft. He explained that the two front wheels were connected to the kerosene motor, and the rear wheels were used for steering while on the ground. He said the wing area was , and the covering was &quot;the best silk obtainable.&quot; The propellers were &quot;6 feet in diameter ... made of wood ... covered with very thin aluminum sheeting.&quot; He said the tail and wings could all be &quot;folded up ... and laid against the sides of the body.&quot;

In 1905, he and Stanley Beach jointly filed for a patent – issued 1908 – for an &quot;improved aeroplane&quot; with a V-shaped trough body and fixed bird-like wings, the pilot hanging below supported by a swing seat. A jointly-designed biplane was built by Whitehead and fitted with a Whitehead 5-cylinder, water-cooled 50 hp motor. The pointed bow of the craft comprised a metal water tank, with hot water being sprayed against the sides inside for cooling.

Whitehead also built gliders until about 1906 and was photographed flying them.

== Later career ==
In addition to his work on flying machines, Whitehead built engines. In 1904, he attended the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair and displayed an aeronautical motor. &quot;Air Enthusiast&quot; wrote: &quot;Weisskopf&#x27;s ability and mechanical skill could have made him a wealthy man at a time when there was an ever-increasing demand for lightweight engines, but he was far more interested in flying.&quot; Instead, Whitehead only accepted enough engine orders to sustain aviation experiments.

His aeronautical work was described in a chapter titled &quot;The Conquest of the Air&quot; in a 1904 book, &quot;Modern Industrial Progress&quot;, by Charles Henry Cochrane. The book said Whitehead had experimented with a &quot;three-deck machine&quot; and attached a 12 hp motor driving a tractor propeller after tests showed the craft could carry more than his weight. Test of the machine were described as &quot;sufficiently satisfactory that another is being built.&quot;

In 1908, Whitehead designed and built a 75 hp lightweight two-cycle motor at the suggestion of aviation pioneer George A. Lawrence, who was having difficulty obtaining an aeronautic engine. The water-cooled machine was designed so that functional cylinders continued to work if others failed, a safety factor to help avoid accidents due to engine failure. The men formed Whitehead Motor Works with an office in New York City and a factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that built motors in three sizes: 25, 40 and 75 hp, weighing 95, 145 and 200 pounds respectively.

Whitehead&#x27;s business practices were unsophisticated and he was sued by a customer, resulting in a threat that his tools and equipment would be seized. He hid his engines and most of his tools in a neighbor&#x27;s cellar and continued his aviation work. One of his engines was installed by aviation pioneer Charles Wittemann in a helicopter built by Lee Burridge of the Aero Club of America, but the craft failed to fly.

Whitehead&#x27;s own 1911 studies of the vertical flight problem resulted in a 60-bladed helicopter, which, unmanned, lifted itself off the ground.

He lost an eye in a factory accident and also suffered a severe blow to the chest from a piece of factory equipment, an injury that may have led to increasing attacks of angina. Despite these setbacks, he exhibited an aircraft at Hempstead, New York, as late as 1915. He continued to work and invent. He designed a braking safety device, hoping to win a prize offered by a railroad. He demonstrated it as a scale model but won nothing. He constructed an &quot;automatic&quot; concrete-laying machine, which he used to help build a road north of Bridgeport. These inventions brought him no more profit than did his airplanes and engines. Around 1915 Whitehead worked in a factory as a laborer and repaired motors to support his family.

He died of a heart attack, on 10 October 1927, after attempting to lift an engine out of a car he was repairing. He stumbled onto his front porch and into his home, then collapsed dead in the house.

== Rediscovery ==
Whitehead&#x27;s work remained mostly unknown to the public and aeronautical community after 1911 until a 1935 article was published in &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; magazine, co-authored by educator and journalist Stella Randolph and aviation history buff Harvey Phillips. Randolph expanded the article into the book &quot;Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead&quot;, published in 1937. She sought out people who had known Whitehead and had seen his flying machines and engines, and she obtained 16 affidavits from 14 people and included the text of their statements in the book. Four people said that they did not see flights, while the others said that they saw flights of various types, ranging from a few feet to hundreds of feet to more than a mile.

Harvard University economics professor John B. Crane wrote an article for &quot;National Aeronautic Magazine&quot; in December 1936 disputing claims and reports that Whitehead flew, but he adopted a different tone the following year, after further research. He told reporters, &quot;There are several people still living in Bridgeport who testified to me under oath, they had seen Whitehead make flights along the streets of Bridgeport in the early 1900s.&quot; Crane reported Harworth&#x27;s claim of having witnessed a 1½- mile airplane flight made by Whitehead on 14 August 1901, and he suggested that a Congressional investigation should consider the claims. In 1949, Crane published a new article in &quot;Air Affairs&quot; magazine which supported claims that Whitehead flew, but he made no reference to his first article, nor did he refute his previous evidence.

In 1963, reserve Air Force major William O&#x27;Dwyer discovered photographs in the attic of a Connecticut house showing a 1910 Whitehead &quot;Large Albatross&quot;-type biplane aircraft at rest on the ground. The Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) asked him and his 9315th U.S. Air Force Reserve Squadron to investigate whether Whitehead had made powered flights. O&#x27;Dwyer continued his research for years and became convinced that Whitehead did fly before the Wright brothers. Former CAHA president Harvey Lippincott said in 1981 that Whitehead &quot;may have flown 100 to 200 feet, 10 to 15 feet off the ground. This is confirmed by the witnesses that we have interviewed and talked with, and this seems reasonable for the state of the art in aviation at that time.&quot; O&#x27;Dwyer later contributed interviews of reputed flight witnesses to a second book by Stella Randolph &quot;The Story of Gustave Whitehead, Before the Wrights Flew&quot;, published in 1966. O&#x27;Dwyer and Randolph also co-authored &quot;History by Contract&quot;, published in 1978, which criticized the Smithsonian Institution for signing an agreement with the estate of Orville Wright, requiring the Smithsonian to credit only the 1903 Wright Flyer for the first powered controlled flight.

In 1968, Connecticut officially recognized Whitehead as &quot;Father of Connecticut Aviation&quot;. The North Carolina General Assembly passed a resolution in 1985 which repudiated the Connecticut statement and gave &quot;no credence&quot; to the assertion that Whitehead was first to fly, citing &quot;leading aviation historians and the world&#x27;s largest aviation museum&quot; who determined that there was &quot;no historic fact, documentation, record or research to support the claim&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot; published an editorial which asserted that Whitehead was first to make a powered controlled flight. The editorial reignited debate over who flew first and motivated Connecticut to establish &quot;Powered Flight Day&quot; to honor Gustave Whitehead, rather than the Wright Brothers. The editorial relied heavily on researcher John Brown, whose claim that a vintage photo showed Whitehead&#x27;s machine in powered flight was disproved by another researcher, Carroll F. Gray. &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; corporate owner later issued a disclaimer concerning the editorial, stating that it contained the views of the editor but not necessarily the publisher.

The Royal Aeronautical Society noted that: “All available evidence fails to support the claim that Gustave Whitehead made sustained, powered, controlled flights predating those of the Wright brothers.” The editors of Scientific American agree: &quot;The data show that not only was Whitehead not first in flight, but that he may never have made a controlled, powered flight at any time.”

== Evidence ==
=== Claimed witnesses ===
Andrew Cellie and James Dickie were named in the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; article as two witnesses to Whitehead&#x27;s early-morning flight. The article was published without a byline, but researchers and scholars on both sides of the controversy attribute it to Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Howell, the sports editor. James Dickie denied seeing a flight in a 1937 affidavit, taken during Stella Randolph&#x27;s research. He said that he was not present at the flight on 14 August 1901, and that he thought that the newspaper story was &quot;imaginary&quot;. He said that he did not know Andrew Cellie, the other associate of Whitehead who was supposed to be there, and that none of Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft ever flew, as far as he knew. An article in &quot;Air Enthusiast&quot;, however, pointed out that Dickie&#x27;s description of the airplane did not match Whitehead&#x27;s Number 21.

O&#x27;Dwyer had known Dickie since childhood and wrote that he spoke to him by telephone, and that Dickie had a grudge against Whitehead:

His mood changed to anger when I asked him about Gustave Whitehead. He flatly refused to talk about Whitehead, and when I asked him why, he said: &quot;That SOB never paid me what he owed me. My father had a hauling business and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to where he wanted to go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime.

O&#x27;Dwyer wrote that Dickie&#x27;s 1937 affidavit had &quot;little value&quot; and that there were inconsistencies between the affidavit and his interview with Dickie. There is no known transcript or recording of his interview.

Andrew Cellie was the other eyewitness to the flight on 14 August 1901 named by the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot;, but Randolph could not locate him for an interview in the 1930s. O&#x27;Dwyer searched through old Bridgeport city directories in the 1970s and concluded that the newspaper likely misspelled the man&#x27;s name. He surmised that it was Andrew Suelli, a Swiss or German immigrant also known as Zulli and Whitehead&#x27;s nextdoor neighbor before moving to the Pittsburgh area in 1902. Suelli&#x27;s former neighbors in Fairfield told O&#x27;Dwyer that Suelli had &quot;always claimed he was present when Whitehead flew in 1901.&quot;

Junius Harworth and Anton Pruckner sometimes worked for Whitehead, and they gave statements to Stella Randolph that they saw him fly on 14 August 1901. Anton Pruckner was a tool maker who worked for a few years with Whitehead, and he attested in 1934 to the flight. He also attested to a January 1902 flight by Whitehead over Long Island Sound; the 1988 &quot;Air Enthusiast&quot; article, however, said that &quot;Pruckner was not present on the occasion, though he was told of the events by Weisskopf himself.&quot;

Whitehead claimed in his first letter to &quot;American Inventor&quot; that he made four trips in the airplane on 14 August 1901, and that the longest was 1½ miles. Witnesses reported seeing several different flights on 14 August 1901. The &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; reported that a half-mile flight occurred early in the morning on 14 August, and Whitehead and Harworth said that a one and a half-mile flight was made later that day. In all, witnesses reported that four flights took place on 14 August 1901.

The following are from the affidavits that Stella Randolph collected in the 1930s, quoted in part:

:Affidavit: Joe Ratzenberger – 28 January 1936:

I recall a time, which I think was probably July or August 1901 or 1902, when this plane was started in flight on the lot between Pine and Cherry Streets. The plane flew at a height of about twelve feet from the ground, I should judge, and traveled the distance to Bostwick Avenue before it came to the ground.

:Affidavit: Thomas Schweibert – 15 June 1936:

I ... recall seeing an airplane flight made by the late Gustave Whitehead approximately thirty-five years ago. I was a boy at the time, playing on a lot near the Whitehead shop on Cherry Street, and recall the incident well as we were surprised to see the plane leave the ground. It traveled a distance of approximately three hundred feet, and at a height of approximately fifteen feet in the air, to the best of my recollection.

:Affidavit by Junius Harworth – 21 August 1934:

On August, fourteenth, Nineteen Hundred and One I was present and assisted on the occasion when Mr. Whitehead succeeded in flying his machine, propelled by a motor, to a height of two hundred feet off the ground or sea beach at Lordship Manor, Connecticut. The distance flown was approximately one mile and a half.

Other witnesses signed affidavits reporting additional powered flights in 1902. Elizabeth Koteles stated that she had witnessed a flight at Gypsy Spring which was 5 feet off the ground for a distance of 150 to 250 feet, and John Lesko also stated that he had witnessed a flight in Gypsy Spring. Other people signed affidavits saying that they saw short flights of varying altitudes and distances in the 1901–02 time period.

O&#x27;Dwyer organized a survey of surviving witnesses to the flights. Members of the Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) and the 9315th Squadron (O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s Air Force Reserve unit) went door-to-door in Bridgeport, Fairfield, Stratford, and Milford, Connecticut to track down Whitehead&#x27;s long-ago neighbors and helpers, and they also traced some who had moved away. Of an estimated 30 persons interviewed for affidavits or on tape, 20 said that they had seen flights, eight indicated that they had heard of the flights, and two said that Whitehead did not fly.

=== Photos ===
No photograph has been found conclusively showing any manned Whitehead machine in powered flight, although such photographs have been reported to exist. The &quot;Bridgeport Daily Standard&quot; reported on 1 October 1904 that pictures were exhibited in the window of Lyon and Grumman&#x27;s hardware store on Main Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut &quot;showing Whitehead in his aeroplane about 20 feet from the ground and sailing along&quot;. The article said: &quot;Of course he has not perfected his invention but says that he has frequently flown over half a mile. There are people who believe Whitehead is all that the newspapers have represented him to be. The photographs show that he has the ability to make short flights&quot;.

A photo was displayed in the 1906 First Annual Exhibit of the Aero Club of America at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York City which showed an unpiloted Whitehead aircraft in flight. The photo was mentioned in a 27 January 1906 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article which stated that the walls of the exhibit were covered with a large collection of photographs showing the machines of various inventors. The report said, &quot;No photographs of ... man-carrying machines in flight were shown, nor has any trustworthy account of their reported achievements ever been published. A single blurred photograph of a large birdlike machine propelled by compressed air constructed by Whitehead in 1901 was the only other photograph besides that of Samuel Pierpont Langley&#x27;s scale model machines of a motor-driven aeroplane in successful flight.&quot; Peter L. Jakab, National Air and Space Museum (NASM) Associate Director and Curator of Early Flight, suggested that the image &quot;may very well have been an in-flight photograph&quot; of one of Whitehead&#x27;s gliders.

In 2013, Australian researcher John Brown analyzed a panoramic photograph from the 1906 Aero Club Exhibit room which shows photographic images on the wall in the background. Brown concluded that one of the images, which he examined by greatly enlarging it, was &quot;the long lost photo of Whitehead&#x27;s No. 21 in powered flight&quot;. He said that the image also correlated with the drawing that was published in the 1901 &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; article which reported a Whitehead flight. Brown&#x27;s conclusion was disputed by aviation historian Carroll Gray, who said that a clear archival photograph is virtually identical to the enlarged image and proved &quot;beyond any reasonable doubt&quot; that the wall image from the 1906 exhibit showed the glider &quot;The California&quot;, built by aviation pioneer John Joseph Montgomery, on display suspended between trees at an exhibit in a California park in 1905.

== Controversy ==
=== &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; article and drawing ===
Stella Randolph stated in &quot;Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead&quot; (1937) that Richard Howell wrote the article about a Whitehead flight in the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot;, although the article carried no byline. O&#x27;Dwyer wrote that Howell made the drawing of the No. 21 in flight which accompanied the newspaper article, saying that Howell was &quot;an artist before he became a reporter.&quot; O&#x27;Dwyer spent hours in the Bridgeport Library studying virtually everything that Howell wrote, and he concluded: &quot;Howell was always a very serious writer. He always used sketches rather than photographs with his features on inventions. He was highly regarded by his peers on other local newspapers. He used the florid style of the day, but was not one to exaggerate.&quot;

Andy Kosch, who built and flew a replica of No. 21, said, &quot;If you look at the reputation of the editor of the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; in those days, you find that he was a reputable man. He wouldn&#x27;t make this stuff up.&quot; Howell died before the controversy began concerning Whitehead.

Gibbs-Smith doubted the veracity of the account and complained that the newspaper article &quot;reads like a work of juvenile fiction.&quot; Aviation historian Carroll Gray asserts that similarities in the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; newspaper story show that it is a broad rewrite of an article published in the New York &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper on 9 June 1901. Gray points out that the &quot;Sun&quot; article described an unmanned test of a Whitehead flying machine on 3 May 1901, but the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; changed this to a manned flight.

=== Mrs. Whitehead and skeptics ===
An early source of ammunition for both sides of the debate was a 1940 interview with Whitehead&#x27;s wife Louise. In the &quot;Bridgeport Sunday Post&quot;, she quoted her husband&#x27;s excited first words upon returning from Fairfield on 14 August 1901: &quot;Mama, we went up!&quot; She said that her husband was always busy with motors and flying machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories, but she never saw any of her husband&#x27;s reported flights.

Smithsonian Institution Curator of Aeronautics Peter L. Jakab said that Whitehead&#x27;s wife and family did not know about his August 1901 flights. Louise Whitehead told Randolph that she sewed the material for the wings on the plane and took care of the household, but did not watch any experiments. Whitehead&#x27;s daughter Rose was three years old at the time of the controversial 1901 powered flight, and the other children had not yet been born.

=== Stanley Yale Beach ===
Stanley Yale Beach was the son of &quot;Scientific American&quot;&#x27;s editor (he became editor himself), and he had a long personal association with Whitehead. His father Frederick Converse Beach contributed thousands of dollars to support Whitehead&#x27;s work on Stanley Beach&#x27;s airplane designs from 1903–1910. Beach also claimed to have taken most of the photos that appeared in Randolph&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead&quot;. In 1908, Beach and Whitehead received a patent for a monoplane glider.

There were multiple articles published in &quot;Scientific American&quot; under Beach&#x27;s editorship in 1903, 1906, and 1908 which stated that Whitehead had conducted &quot;short flights&quot; and flew &quot;short distances&quot; in 1901, similar to the hops made by Maxim and Herring. Beach gave an extensive description of a &quot;novel flying machine&quot; in the 8 June 1901 issue and included two photographs of a &quot;batlike craft&quot; on the ground, not flying.

Beach drafted a statement in 1939 concerning his relationship with Whitehead, at the request of Major Lester D. Gardner, Secretary of the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences in New York. It was not published, but Beach gave permission for changes to be made in the statement, and it was edited by Gardner and aviation publisher Earl Findley, a close friend of Orville Wright. Researcher Susan O&#x27;Dwyer Brinchman suggests that Findley and Gardner hoped that the statement would help to defend the Wright brothers&#x27; primacy in flight against the recent challenge in Randolph&#x27;s article and book. Beach&#x27;s edited statement was sent to Wright, who relied on it in 1945 to rebut renewed publicity about Whitehead. The edited statement said: &quot;I do not believe that any of his machines ever left the ground under their own power in spite of the assertions of many persons who think they saw him fly.&quot; It also said that Whitehead never told Beach that he had flown. The statement offered some words of praise, saying that Whitehead &quot;deserves a place in early aviation, due to his having gone ahead and built extremely light engines and aeroplanes. The five-cylinder kerosene one, with which he claims to have flown over Long Island Sound on 17 January 1902 was, I believe, the first aviation Diesel.&quot;

O&#x27;Dwyer believed that Beach had &quot;recanted&quot; his earlier view that Whitehead had flown, as indicated by the &quot;Scientific American&quot; articles. He asserted that Beach became a &quot;politician&quot;, &quot;rarely missing an opportunity to mingle with the Wright tide that had turned against Whitehead, notably after Whitehead&#x27;s death in 1927.&quot; O&#x27;Dwyer argued in &quot;History by Contract&quot; that Beach&#x27;s statement was self-contradictory. In one part, it claims that Whitehead did not fly, and in another it describes how Whitehead&#x27;s machine always landed safely in &quot;pancaking&quot; fashion.

=== Smithsonian Institution ===
Reports that Whitehead made a flight in Connecticut were noticed by the Smithsonian Institution. Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley was at the time building his manned aircraft, the Langley Aerodrome &quot;A&quot;. Langley&#x27;s chief engineer, Charles M. Manly, suspected claims for the Whitehead machine were &quot;fraudulent&quot;. He asked Smithsonian employee F.W. Hodge to inspect the Number 21 aircraft, which Whitehead had put on display in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Hodge reported the machine did not appear to be airworthy.

For many years the Smithsonian Institution did not formally recognize the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; as the first successful aircraft. Instead, it proclaimed the Langley Aerodrome as first to be capable of manned powered flight. This policy offended the surviving Wright brother, Orville, who sent the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; to the Science Museum in London on long-term loan, rather than donate it to the Smithsonian. In 1942 the Smithsonian publicly recanted its position, and Orville agreed to bring back the &quot;Flyer&quot;.

As a condition for receiving the airplane, the Smithsonian signed an agreement in 1948 with executors of Orville Wright&#x27;s estate. Popularly called a &quot;contract,&quot; the agreement required the Smithsonian to recognize only the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, and no other aircraft, as first to make a manned, powered, controlled flight. The agreement, which was not made public, allowed the Wright family to reclaim the &quot;Flyer&quot; if the Smithsonian failed to comply.

In 1975, O&#x27;Dwyer learned about the agreement from Harold S. Miller, an executor of the Orville Wright estate. O&#x27;Dwyer obtained release of the document with help from Connecticut U.S. Senator Lowell Weicker and the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. O&#x27;Dwyer said that during an earlier 1969 conversation with Paul E. Garber, a Smithsonian curator of early aircraft, Garber denied that a contract existed and said he &quot;could never agree to such a thing.&quot;

The 1978 book co-authored by O&#x27;Dwyer and Randolph, &quot;History by Contract&quot; argued that the Smithsonian compromised its objectivity when it signed a 1948 agreement with the estate of Orville Wright requiring the Institution to recognize the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; as the first aircraft to make a manned, powered, controlled flight or forfeit possession of the aircraft. The book published correspondence between O&#x27;Dwyer and the Smithsonian in which he asked the Institution to look at the evidence and to attend interviews of people who said they saw Whitehead fly. The book called for nullification of the agreement.

George Gunther, a Connecticut state senator, said &quot;History by Contract&quot; was too heavy-handed. Gunther said he had been having &quot;cordial&quot; conversations with the Smithsonian about giving some credit to Whitehead, &quot;but after O&#x27;Dwyer blasted them in his book, well, that totally turned them off.&quot;

According to the Smithsonian, the agreement was implemented to close the long-running feud with the Wright family over the Institution&#x27;s false claims for the Aerodrome. Brinchman documented that Gardner and Findley, who helped Orville rebut the Whitehead claims, also participated in crafting text in the agreement that the Institution is required to use in its labeling of the Wright Flyer.

The agreement remains in effect to the present day. In 2005, Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum (NASM) said the agreement would not stop the Smithsonian from recognizing anyone as inventor of the first airplane if indisputable evidence were found: &quot;We would present as accurate a presentation of the history of the invention of the airplane as possible, regardless of the consequences this might incur involving the agreement. Having said that, however, at this time, as in 1948, there is no compelling evidence that Whitehead or anyone else flew before the Wright brothers.&quot; In 2013 senior aeronautics curator Tom Crouch of NASM said, &quot;I can only hope that, should persuasive evidence for a prior flight be presented, my colleagues and I would have the courage and the honesty to admit the new evidence and risk the loss of the Wright Flyer.&quot;

=== Purported meeting with the Wright brothers ===
In the 1930s, Whitehead was said by three witnesses to have helped the Wright brothers by revealing his secrets perhaps two years prior to their first powered flights.

Statements obtained by Stella Randolph in the 1930s from two of Whitehead&#x27;s workers, Cecil Steeves and Anton Pruckner, claimed that the Wright brothers visited Whitehead&#x27;s shop a year or two before their 1903 flights. The January 1988 &quot;Air Enthusiast&quot; magazine states: &quot;Both Cecil Steeves and Junius Harworth remember the Wrights; Steeves described them and recalled their telling Weisskopf that they had received his letter indicating an exchange of correspondence.&quot; Steeves said that the Wright brothers, &quot;under the guise of offering to help finance his inventions, actually received inside information that aided them materially in completing their own plane.&quot; Steeves related that Whitehead said to him, &quot;Now since I have given them the secrets of my invention they will probably never do anything in the way of financing me.&quot;

Orville Wright denied that he or his brother ever visited Whitehead at his shop and stated that the first time they were in Bridgeport was 1909 &quot;and then only in passing through on the train.&quot; This position is supported by Library of Congress historian Fred Howard, co-editor of the Wright brothers&#x27; papers, and by aviation writers Martin Caidin and Harry B. Combs.

O&#x27;Dwyer said Octave Chanute &quot;encouraged&quot; the Wrights to look into engines built by Whitehead. In a letter to Wilbur Wright on 3 July 1901, Chanute made a single reference to Whitehead, saying: &quot;I have a letter from Carl E. Myers, the balloon maker, stating that a Mr. Whitehead has invented a light weight motor, and has engaged to build for Mr. Arnot of Elmira &#x27;a motor of 10 I.H.P. ... &#x27;&quot;

=== Orville&#x27;s rebuttal ===
In 1945, Whitehead&#x27;s son Charles was interviewed on Joseph Nathan Kane&#x27;s national radio program &quot;Famous Firsts&quot; as the son of the first man to fly. That claim was repeated in a &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine article, which was condensed in a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article that reached a very large audience. Orville Wright, then in his seventies, countered the magazine articles by writing &quot;The Mythical Whitehead Flight&quot;, which appeared in the August 1945 issue of &quot;U.S. Air Services,&quot; a publication with a far smaller but very influential readership.

Orville began by questioning why the &quot;Bridgeport Herald&quot; &quot;withheld&quot; such important aeronautical news for four days and suggested the story thus must not be true. Whitehead researchers have pointed out that the &quot;Herald&quot; was not a daily newspaper but a weekly, published only on Sundays. Orville noted that James Dickie, named as a witness by the &quot;Herald&quot;, had declared in an affidavit that he was not present at the event, did not know the other named witness and never saw a Whitehead aircraft fly. Orville discussed John J. Dvorak, a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who had designed an engine and hired Whitehead to build it after praising him publicly. Dvorak became dissatisfied with Whitehead&#x27;s progress on the engine and severed the business relationship. Orville quoted Dvorak&#x27;s 1936 affidavit: &quot;I personally do not believe that Whitehead ever succeeded in making any airplane flights.&quot; Dvorak&#x27;s negative comments that Orville quoted included the phrases: &quot;Whitehead did not possess sufficient mechanical skill ... was given to gross exaggeration ... He had delusions.&quot;

Orville also relied on the unpublished statement by Stanley Beach. Orville wrote that Whitehead never told Beach he had flown, and that Beach believed none of Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft ever left the ground under their own power. Orville asserted that if Whitehead had flown, Beach would surely have known about it after associating frequently with Whitehead for nine years and helping him financially.

Orville&#x27;s critical comments were later quoted by both the Smithsonian Institution and British aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith.

== Replica aircraft ==
To show that the No. 21 aircraft might have flown, Connecticut high school science teacher Andy Kosch, a pilot, built a replica of the craft, using existing photos and blueprints created by experts working with O&#x27;Dwyer in a project called &quot;Hangar 21&quot;. The replica used modern ultralight engines and included other substantive changes. On December 29, 1986, Kosch flew the replica and claimed a distance of about 330 feet at six feet above the ground.

On 18 February 1998, another reproduction of No. 21 was flown in Germany. The director of the aerospace department at Deutsches Museum noted that such a replica was not proof that the original did actually fly. The 1998 reproduction used modern research and materials such as fiberglass, and had modern engines, along with other changes.

== Honors ==

Connecticut Governor John N. Dempsey designated 14 August as &quot;Gustave Whitehead Day&quot; in 1964 and 1968. A large headstone replaced the bronze marker of his grave at a formal dedication ceremony on 15 August 1964 attended by elected officials, members of every branch of the armed services, Clarence Chamberlain – famed aviator, CAHA, the 9315th Air Force Reserves Squadron, and surviving members of his family, his three daughters, and his assistant Anton Pruckner, commemorating Whitehead as &quot;Father of Connecticut Aviation&quot;.

The &quot;Aviation Pioneer Gustav Weißkopf Museum&quot; was established in Leutershausen, Germany, in 1974.

A memorial fountain and sculpture commemorating Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;aviation first&quot; was dedicated in May 2012 and was located on a traffic island at the intersection of Fairfield Avenue and State Street in Bridgeport It was removed around 2023.

On 25 June 2013, Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy signed into state law House Bill 6671 recognizing Gustave Whitehead as the first person to achieve powered flight.

<doc id="406159" wikidata="Q4376484" url="?curid=406159" title="Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden">
<text>Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, PC (baptised 21 March 1714 – 18 April 1794) was an English lawyer, judge and Whig politician who was first to hold the title of Earl Camden. As a lawyer and judge he was a leading proponent of civil liberties, championing the rights of the jury, and limiting the powers of the State in leading cases such as &quot;Entick v Carrington&quot;.

He held the offices of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Attorney-General and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, and was a confidant of Pitt the Elder, supporting Pitt in the controversies over John Wilkes and American independence. However, he clung to office himself, even when Pitt was out of power, serving in the cabinet for fifteen years and under five different prime ministers.

During his life, Pratt played a leading role in opposing perpetual copyright, resolving the regency crisis of 1788 and championing Fox&#x27;s Libel Bill. He started the development of the settlement that was later to become Camden Town in London.

==Early life==
Born in Kensington in 1714, he was a descendant of an old Devon family of high standing, the third son of Sir John Pratt, Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench in the reign of George I. Charles&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Rev. Hugh Wilson of Trefeglwys, and the aunt of landscape painter Richard Wilson. He received his early education at Eton, where he became acquainted with William Pitt, and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He had already developed an interest in constitutional law and civil liberties. In 1734 he became a fellow of his college, and in the following year obtained his degree of BA. Having adopted his father&#x27;s profession, he had entered the Middle Temple in 1728, and ten years later he was called to the Bar.

==Early years at the Bar==
He practised at first in the courts of common law, travelling also the western circuit. For some years his practice was so limited, and he became so much discouraged that he seriously thought of turning his back on the law and entering the church. He listened, however, to the advice of his friend Sir Robert Henley, a brother barrister, and persevered, working on and waiting for success. Reputedly, once instructed as Henley&#x27;s junior, Henley feigned illness so that Pratt could lead and earn the credit.

He was further aided by an advantageous marriage on 5 October 1749 to Elizabeth, daughter of Nicholas Jeffreys of the Priory, Brecknock, by whom he had a son John Jeffreys, his successor in title and estates, and four daughters, of whom the eldest, Frances, married Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry on 7 June 1775.

The first case which brought him prominently into notice and gave him assurance of ultimate success was the government prosecution, in 1752, of a bookseller, William Owen. Owen had published a book &quot;The Case of Alexander Murray, Esq; in an Appeal to the people of Great Britain&quot; which the House of Commons had, by resolution of the House, condemned as &quot;an impudent, malicious, scandalous and seditious libel&quot;. The author had left the country so the weight of the government&#x27;s censure fell on Owen. Pratt appeared in Owen&#x27;s defence and his novel argument was that it was not the sole role of the jury to determine the fact of publication but that it was further their right to assess the intent of a libel. In his summing up, the judge, Lord Chief Justice Sir William Lee directed the jury to find Owen guilty as publication was proved and the intent of the contents was a question of law for the judge, not a question of fact for the jury. The jury disagreed and acquitted Owen. Pratt was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel in 1755, and knighted in December 1761.

==Political career==

Since their youthful meeting at Eton, Pitt had continued to consult Pratt on legal and constitutional matters and Pratt became involved in the group that met at the Leicester House home of George Prince of Wales and who were opposed to the government of Prime Minister the Duke of Newcastle. In 1756, Newcastle offered Pratt a judgeship but Pratt preferred to take the role of Attorney General to the Prince of Wales.

In July 1757, Pitt formed a coalition government with Newcastle and insisted on Pratt&#x27;s appointment as Attorney-General. Pratt was preferred over Solicitor General Charles Yorke. Yorke was the son of Lord Hardwicke, a political ally of Newcastle who, as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain had obstructed Pratt&#x27;s career in favour of his own son. Though this led to an uncomfortable relationship between the two law officers of the Crown, it led to the landmark Pratt-Yorke opinion of 24 December 1757 whereby the pair distinguished overseas territories acquired by conquest from those acquired by private treaty. They asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown. Though the original opinion related to the British East India Company, it came to be applied elsewhere in the developing British Empire.

The same year he entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Downton in Wiltshire. He sat in Parliament for four years, but did not distinguish himself as a debater. He introduced the Habeas corpus Amendment Bill of 1758, which was intended to extend the writ of &quot;Habeas corpus&quot; from criminal law to civil and political cases. Despite Pitt&#x27;s support, the Bill fell in the House of Lords. At the same time, his professional practice increased, particularly his Chancery practice which made him financially secure and enabled him to purchase the Camden Place estate in Kent.

As Attorney-General, Pratt prosecuted Florence Hensey, an Irishman who had spied for France, and John Shebbeare, a violent party writer of the day. Shebbeare had published a libel against the government contained in his &quot;Letters to the People of England&quot;, which were published in 1756–58. As evidence of Pratt&#x27;s moderation in a period of passionate party warfare and frequent state trials, it is notable that this was the only official prosecution for libel that he started and that he maintained his earlier insistence that the decision lay with the jury. He led for the Crown in the prosecution of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers for the murder of a servant, a case that shocked European society.

==Wilkes and Entick==

Pratt lost his patron when Pitt left office in October 1761 but in January 1762, he resigned from the Commons, was raised to the bench as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, received the customary knighthood and was sworn into the Privy Council.

The Common Pleas was not an obvious forum for a jurist with constitutional interest, dealing as it did principally with disputes between private parties. However, on 30 April 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested under a general warrant for alleged seditious libel in issue No.45 of &quot;The North Briton&quot;. Pratt freed Wilkes holding that parliamentary privilege gave him immunity from arrest on such a charge. The decision earned Pratt some favour with the radical faction in London and seems to have spurred him, over the summer of that year to encourage juries to award disproportionate and excessive damages to printers unlawfully arrested over the same matter. Wilkes was awarded £1,000 (£127,000 at 2003 prices) and Pratt condemned the use of general warrants for entry and search. Pratt pronounced with decisive and almost passionate energy against their legality, thus giving voice to the strong feeling of the nation and winning for himself an extraordinary degree of popularity as one of the maintainers of English civil liberties. Honours fell thick upon him in the form of addresses from the City of London and many large towns, and of presentations of freedom from various corporate bodies.

In 1762, the home of John Entick had been raided by officers of the Crown, searching for evidence of sedition. In the case of &quot;Entick v Carrington&quot; (1765), Pratt held that the raids were unlawful as they were without authority in statute or in common law.

==The American Stamp Act crisis==

On 17 July 1765 Pratt was created Baron Camden, of Camden Place, in Chislehurst, Kent, becoming a member of the House of Lords. Prime Minister Lord Rockingham had unsuccessfully made this, and other appointments, to curry favour with Pitt but Camden was not over-eager to get involved in the crisis surrounding the Stamp Act 1765. Camden did attend the Commons on 14 January 1766 and his subsequent speeches on the matter in the Lords are so similar to Pitt&#x27;s that he had clearly adopted the party line. He was one of only five Lords who voted against the Declaratory Act 1766, a resolution of the House insisting on Parliament&#x27;s right to tax colonies overseas. Camden insisted that taxation was predicated on consent and that consent needed representation. However, when he came to support the government over the act&#x27;s repeal, he rather unconvincingly purported to base his opinion on the actual hardship caused by the act rather than its constitutional basis.

==Lord Chancellor==
In May 1766, Pitt again became prime minister and advanced Camden from the court of common pleas to take his seat as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain on 30 July. Camden managed to negotiate an additional allowance of £1500 and a position for his son John. Camden carried out the role in an efficient manner, without any great legal innovation. He presided over the Court of Chancery from which only one of his decisions was overturned on appeal. He also presided over the judicial functions of the House of Lords where in 1767 he approved Lord Mansfield&#x27;s ruling that the City of London could not fine dissenters who refused to serve the corporation. Dissenters were in any case prohibited from serving under the Corporation Act 1661. In 1768 in the House of Lords he again sat in a case involving John Wilkes, this time rejecting his appeal and finding that his consecutive, rather than concurrent sentences were lawful. He gave a controversial judgment in the Douglas Peerage case.

===&quot;A forty days tyranny&quot;===
However, Camden the politician was less of a champion of civil rights than Pratt the judge. The poor harvest of 1766 led to fears of high grain prices and starvation but parliament was prorogued and could not renew the export ban that expired on 26 August. Pitt, with Camden&#x27;s support, called the Privy Council to issue a royal proclamation on 26 September to prohibit grain exports until parliament met. However, despite Camden&#x27;s record on civil liberties, this proclamation was unlawful, contrary to art.2 of the Bill of Rights 1689 and both houses of parliament ultimately accused Pitt and Camden of tyranny. Camden pleaded necessity, a justification he had rejected in the Wilkes and Carrington trials, and styled it &quot;a forty days tyranny&quot;. Ultimately the government was forced to suppress the parliamentary attacks by an act indemnifying those involved from legal action.

===America===
In 1767, the cabinet, of which Camden was a member, approved Charles Townshend&#x27;s attempt to settle the American protest and revolt over taxation. Benjamin Franklin reportedly observed that it was &quot;internal&quot; taxes that the colonists objected to and Townshend took this to suggest that there would be little opposition to import duties imposed at the ports. Camden&#x27;s support for the tax proposals would return to embarrass him.

Pitt and his followers had, after their initial opposition, come to support the Declaratory Act 1766 which asserted Great Britain&#x27;s sovereignty over the American colonies. Further, continued unrest in America, stemming from Townshend&#x27;s 1767 taxation scheme, brought a robust response from Pitt and Camden was his spokesman in the Lords. However, towards the end of 1767, Pitt, now raised to the Lords as Earl Chatham, fell ill and the Duke of Grafton stepped in as caretaker. Camden became indecisive in his own political role, writing to Grafton on 4 October 1768: 

Pitt resigned on 14 October and Camden, who continued to sit in the cabinet as Lord Chancellor, now took up a position of uncompromising hostility to the governments of Grafton and Lord North on America and on Wilkes. Camden opposed Lord Hillsborough&#x27;s confrontational approach to the Americas, favouring conciliation and working on the development of reformed tax proposals. Camden personally promised the colonies that no further taxes would be levied, and voted in the cabinet minority who sought to repeal the tea duty.

===John Wilkes MP===

On 28 March 1768, Wilkes was surprisingly elected as member for Middlesex, much to Grafton&#x27;s distaste. Grafton canvassed Camden on whether Wilkes could be removed from parliament and Camden responded that, under the parliamentary privilege of the House to regulate its own membership, Wilkes could, though lawfully elected, be lawfully expelled. However, Camden saw that this was only likely to lead to Wilkes&#x27;s re-election and an escalating crisis. The cabinet decided to seek Wilkes&#x27;s expulsion but Camden was not content with the policy. By the end of 1769, he was in open opposition to the government and was making little contribution to discussions in cabinet. Only Royal pressure kept him in post. However, by the beginning of 1770, Chatham had returned to the fray, opposing government policies on Wilkes and America. On 9 January 1770, Chatham moved a motion opposing the government&#x27;s policies and Camden stepped down from the woolsack to give a speech in support of the motion. However, he did not resign as Lord Chancellor until King George III, outraged by his conduct, demanded his dismissal on 17 January. He seems also to have resigned as a Chancery judge in late 1769.

==Working Lord==

===Into opposition===
Chatham, Rockingham and Grenville were expected to combine to bring down Grafton, when it was expected that Lord Camden would return to the woolsack. However, though Grafton resigned, Lord North managed to form a successor administration and Camden was left to the opposition, continuing to sit in the Lords. From 1770 onwards, Chatham neglected parliamentary attendance and left leadership of the house to Lord Shelburne with whom Camden could manage only the coolest of relationships.

During 1770–71, Camden tussled with Lord Mansfield over the law of libel, Camden maintaining that the jury should not only decide whether the work in question was published but also whether the words themselves were defamatory or innocent. He opposed the extension of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 to all descendants of King George II, believing it to be impractical. In 1774, in the House of Lords appeal in the case of &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot;, Camden spoke against the concept of perpetual copyright for fear of inhibiting the advancement of learning. This was a key influence on the ultimate rejection of that year&#x27;s Booksellers&#x27; Bill.

===The American crisis of 1774===
The year 1774 brought a renewed crisis over America. The Boston Tea Party in 1773 led Lord North to seek a blockade of the city through the Boston Port Bill. Camden roundly criticised the taxes that had led to the American protests, as he had opposed them in Cabinet from 1767 to 1769, but was reminded that he was Lord Chancellor when they were imposed. The Chathamite faction went on to support the Bill and further to support the Massachusetts Government Act, Camden&#x27;s inherent patriotism bringing him into line. However, by May, fears that the Bill would focus and strengthen American resistance led Camden to oppose the measure.

On 16 February 1775, Camden made his major speech on the crisis, opposing public opinion and the New England Trade and Fishery Bill, a speech often believed to have been drafted in collaboration with Benjamin Franklin for an American audience. Camden invoked John Locke&#x27;s dictum that resistance to tyranny was justified and called the Bill:
Thomas Hutchinson observed:
How Camden voted on the Quebec Act is unknown but in May 1775, and in response to a petition from a small number of settlers, he unsuccessfully moved its repeal. However, he seems to have been in the grip of a conspiracy theory that the Act&#x27;s ulterior objective was to create an army of militant Roman Catholics in Canada to suppress the Protestant British colonists.

===American War of Independence===
The American War of Independence broke out in 1775 and Chatham&#x27;s faction were dismayed. Their official line was to advocate mediation, refusing to think of either American independence or continued English hegemony. Camden continued to speak on the dilemma in parliament. He continued steadfastly to oppose the taxation of the American colonists, and signed, in 1778, the protest of the Lords in favour of an address to the King on the subject of the manifesto of the commissioners to America. In 1782 he was appointed Lord President of the Council under the Rockingham-Shelburne administration, supporting the government economic programme and anti-corruption drive, and championing repeal of the Declaratory Act 1720 in Ireland. Once Rockingham died in July, the Chathamite residue could only lose the Commons vote over the American peace terms the following February. Camden resigned and persuaded Shelburne to do the same.

===The Younger Pitt===

Camden was a leading opponent of the ensuing Fox-North Coalition, denouncing it for patronage and leading the opposition to Fox&#x27;s East India Bill that brought down the administration on 9 December 1783. William Pitt the Younger, the son of his former patron, came to power and within a few months, Camden was reinstated as Lord President, holding the post until his death. He was created Earl Camden on 13 May 1786 and granted a further peerage as Viscount Bayham to lend his son a courtesy title.

Camden took an animated part in the debates on important public matters until within two years of his death, in particular supporting Pitt&#x27;s 1785 Parliamentary Reform Bill and the Irish trade proposals that same year. Camden continued to attend cabinet meetings and, after he moved to Hill Street, Berkeley Square on account of his ill health, cabinet meetings were sometimes held at his home.

===Regency crisis of 1788===
In November 1788, King George III fell ill and insanity was feared. Lord Chancellor Thurlow hesitated over what action to take, thereby precipitating the regency crisis of 1788. As Lord President, Camden led the Privy Council examination of the King&#x27;s doctors&#x27; opinions. With Thurlow unwilling to lead the legislature, Camden grasped the challenge of inviting parliament to appoint a regent, in the face of the opposition&#x27;s support for the automatic appointment of their ally the Prince of Wales. Camden&#x27;s resolution that appointment rested with parliament was carried in the Lords by 99 votes to 66 on 23 December 1788. Moreover, on 22 January 1789, Camden&#x27;s motion to appoint the Prince of Wales, but with restrictions in case of the King&#x27;s recovery, was carried by 94 to 68 votes. The King recovered the following month before the Regency Bill contained the force of law.

===Fox&#x27;s Libel Act===
To the last, Camden zealously defended his early views on the functions of juries, especially of their right to decide on all questions of libel. In the Lords debate on the second reading of the Libel Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 60) on 16 May, Camden contended that intention was an essential element of libel and should be decided by the jury as in murder cases. Broadening the legal argument to the constitutional and political Camden charged press freedom to the hands of the jury as the representatives of the people. The judges he held were too prone to government pressure to guarantee essential freedoms. Despite the unanimous opposition of the Law Lords, Camden&#x27;s speech helped secure a majority of 57 to 32.

==Reputation and legacy==
Camden was short in stature but of a fine physique. For recreation he enjoyed music, theatre, romantic fiction, conversation and food. His vices were sloth and gluttony rather than womanising or gambling. The Earl Camden died in London on 18 April 1794. His remains were interred in Seal church in Kent. Camden died a wealthy man, much of his wealth deriving from his wife.
Both Lord Campbell and Sir William Holdsworth held Camden a great Lord Chancellor.

By the 20th century, Camden&#x27;s legal opinions were seen as subservient to Chatham&#x27;s politics and Camden certainly followed the party line on Wilkes and America. However, his party loyalty was tempered by a self-serving interest in power. He served under five prime ministers and on two occasions clung to office after Chatham had resigned.

In his last years, he took a great interest in the career of Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry, his daughter&#x27;s stepson. Camden, whose own son was not to prove much of a statesman, recognised young Robert&#x27;s potential and treated him very much as though he was his actual grandson.

In 1788 he obtained an Act of Parliament granting permission to develop some fields he owned just to the north of London. In 1791 he laid out the land in plots and leased them for the construction of 1,400 houses, the beginnings of Camden Town.

The town of Camden, Maine in the United States, was named for him in 1791. This is one of several cities, towns, and counties bearing his name, including Camden, South Carolina, Camden, North Carolina, and Camden, New Jersey, as well as Camden Counties in New Jersey (of which the eponymous city is the seat and largest city), Missouri and Georgia. In turn, Camden, South Carolina gave its name both to the Battle of Camden and Camden, Alabama. Camden, Tennessee was named for the battle, and Camden, Arkansas took its name from the town in Alabama. Furthermore, Pratt Street, a major thoroughfare in Baltimore, is also named partially after him.

<text>Old Spice is an American brand offering male grooming products including aftershaves, deodorants and antiperspirants, shampoos, body washes, shaving cream, and soaps. It is manufactured by Procter &amp; Gamble.

Old Spice was launched as Early American Old Spice by William Lightfoot Schultz&#x27;s soap and toiletries company, Shulton Inc., in 1937. It was first targeted to women, with the men&#x27;s product being released before Christmas at the end of 1937.

==History==
Old Spice products were originally manufactured by the Shulton Company, founded in 1934 by William Lightfoot Schultz. A buyer at Bullock&#x27;s in Los Angeles made Schultz aware of the emerging popularity of colonial American–style furniture, a trend spurred by the then-recent opening of Colonial Williamsburg. Shultz reasoned that an Early Americana–themed cosmetics line might also find favor. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York collection of early American objects provided a source of inspiration for packaging design; for the fragrance, Schultz was inspired by his mother&#x27;s potpourri, and as a result, the first Old Spice product in 1937 was a woman&#x27;s scent called Early American Old Spice. The product was received well and therefore was followed by Old Spice for men in 1938.

The men&#x27;s products included shaving soap and aftershave lotion, marketed with a nautical theme. Sailing ships in particular were used for the brand&#x27;s packaging. The original ships used on the packaging were the &quot;Grand Turk&quot; and the &quot;Friendship&quot;. Other ships used on Old Spice packaging include the &quot;John Wesley&quot;, &quot;Salem&quot;, &quot;Birmingham&quot;, &quot;Maria Teresa&quot;, &quot;Propontis&quot;, &quot;Recovery&quot;, &quot;Sooloo&quot;, &quot;Star of the West&quot;, &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;, and &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

In the 1970s, Old Spice shifted from being a shaving brand to a fragrance brand by introducing signature scents like Old Spice Burley.

In June 1990, Procter &amp; Gamble purchased the Old Spice fragrances, skincare and antiperspirant &amp; deodorant brands from the Shulton Company. The sailing ship was replaced by a sailboat. The glass bottles of eau de toilette and after shave had a plastic button as a cap. Its color was changed from light gray to white in 1992. 

Throughout the 2000s, Procter &amp; Gamble introduced many forms of deodorant, body washes, and body sprays in several scents under the Old Spice name.

In early 2008, the original Old Spice scent was repackaged as &quot;Classic Scent&quot;, both in the aftershave and cologne versions. The white glass bottles gave way to plastic and the gray stoppers to red. Old Spice Classic shower gel was sold using the slogan &quot;The original. If your grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it, you wouldn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

In January 2016, Procter &amp; Gamble changed the scent of its Old Spice Classic After Shave.

==Products==
Old Spice&#x27;s buoy-shaped bottle cologne is available in its original scent as well as Pure Sport. In 2006, Old Spice introduced a fragrance, OS Signature, which won magazine &quot;FHM&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 Grooming Award for Best Sporty Fragrance. Old Spice Red Zone products include a &quot;Scratch-and-Sniff&quot; version of the signature fragrance.

In 2014, Old Spice expanded its product line-up to men&#x27;s haircare by introducing shampoos, two-in-one shampoo and conditioners, and styling products.

== Advertising ==

In the 1970s and 1980s, Old Spice ad campaigns in the United Kingdom and Ireland featured a man on a surfboard accompanied by Carl Orff&#x27;s O Fortuna from &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, with the tagline &quot;Old Spice – The Mark Of A Man&quot;.

An advertising campaign developed by Wieden + Kennedy in 2010 featuring Isaiah Mustafa became popular after the first advertisement, titled &quot;The Man Your Man Could Smell Like&quot;. Following this campaign, Old Spice introduced Fabio Lanzoni to challenge Isaiah Mustafa for the Old Spice Guy title in an online advertising campaign.

After the success of &quot;The Man Your Man Could Smell Like&quot;, Old Spice released &quot;The Response Campaign&quot;. Over the course of two and a half days, the brand filmed 186 videos featuring Mustafa engaging in conversation with fans and celebrities. The campaign earned over 40 million views after the first week and led to Old Spice securing the spot of #1 all-time most viewed branded channel on YouTube.

Old Spice has partnered with the NFL and featured football stars including Ray Lewis, Greg Jennings, and Wes Welker in various TV and digital campaigns. In 2012, former NFL player Terry Crews was featured in the brand&#x27;s viral hit &quot;Muscle Music&quot;. The interactive video allowed people to make music through different musical instruments rigged to corresponding muscles on Crews&#x27;s body.

In 2013, Old Spice launched a series of TV commercials in India titled &quot;Mantastic Man&quot; starring supermodel and actor Milind Soman.

The commercial &quot;Momsong&quot; became popular in 2014 as a part of the brand&#x27;s &quot;Smellcome to Manhood&quot; campaign.

The &quot;Make a Smellmitment&quot; commercials with Mustafa and Crews debuted in 2015, promoting Timber (or Swagger) and Bearglove.

In early 2016, Old Spice introduced a new brand character, the Legendary Man, with two TV commercials, &quot;Rocket Car&quot; and &quot;Whale&quot;, to launch the Hardest Working Collection. Old Spice also launched a series of digital infomercials with Canadian actor Steven Ogg. Later in 2016, the brand introduced two additional Old Spice characters, actors Thomas Beaudoin and Alberto Cardenas, in an advertising campaign for the Red Zone product collection.

Old Spice has sponsored many cars throughout the NASCAR world from 2004 to 2010. They first sponsored Ricky Craven at Talladega in 2004, then moved to Tony Stewart in Busch Races with Joe Gibbs Racing and Kevin Harvick Incorporated. In 2009, they followed Stewart when he formed his own team and car number 14 car for 2009 and 2010 with a win at Watkins Glen. Old Spice returned to NASCAR in 2019 to sponsor Corey LaJoie and Go Fas Racing&#x27;s 32 car for the 2019 Daytona 500. The car had a unique design in which Corey LaJoie&#x27;s face was designed on the hood of the car. The team finished 18th in that race. Old Spice was also featured as the sponsor of John C. Reilly&#x27;s character, Cal Naughton Jr., in the 2006 comedy &quot;Talladega Nights&quot;. The brand returned to the sport for a one-off appearance in 2023, sponsoring Chase Briscoe and Stewart-Haas Racing&#x27;s 14 car for the 2023 YellaWood 500.

In 2019, Old Spice named actor, comedian, and writer Deon Cole as its global brand ambassador for its five-piece line.

In January 2020, Old Spice brought back their viral 2010 campaign &quot;Smell Like a Man, Man&quot; to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original commercial, and worked with Wieden + Kennedy once again for the reboot.

== Awards ==

Old Spice has accumulated 37 awards as of 2016 at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Most notably, the brand was awarded two Gold Cannes Lions for Creative Effectiveness for &quot;The Man Your Man Could Smell Like&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Smellcome to Manhood&quot; in 2016. The former also won the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial in 2010.

<doc id="406168" wikidata="Q1439722" url="?curid=406168" title="My Life on Ice">
<text>My Life on Ice () is a 2002 French teen drama film directed by Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau, which tracks a year in the life of a teenage figure skater in a quasi-documentary, video diary style.

==Plot==
The film centers on Étienne, who lives in Rouen with his mother and grandmother and intends to take part in the national figure skating championship. For his 16th birthday, his grandmother gives him a digital camcorder as a present, which he starts to use immediately (supplying the introductory scenes of the film).

Étienne films anything and everything around him – his family, his teacher Laurent, Ludovic, his best friend, himself figure skating, the sea, steep cliffs. As for Ludovic and his geography teacher, it soon becomes apparent that his obsession with them is grounded in more than just artistic pursuits. Étienne&#x27;s homosexuality becomes more and more clear both to him and the audience over the course of the film.

Even though Étienne is determined to make this year &quot;the year of love&quot;, the year when everything turns around for him, things do not go as well as anticipated. He makes a blunder in his figure skating performance and only achieves second place. After a night of drinking, during which Laurent, who is in a relationship with Etienne&#x27;s mother, seems to show Etienne an ambiguous mutual attraction, Etienne witnesses Laurent&#x27;s fall from a cliff; a fall that the viewer, like Etienne, will understand as deliberate, probably due to the young boy&#x27;s frustration. And when he starts, very carefully, to talk to Ludovic about the possibility of two men being in love, Ludovic runs away.

In the final minutes of the film, the purpose of Étienne&#x27;s video diary gets clear: Feeling he has failed in what he set out to do and being deeply hurt by Ludovic&#x27;s resentment, Étienne decides to jump from the cliff and leave the camcorder (which he sets up to film his suicide) behind to explain to his family what he went through.

Luckily, a stranger walks by at that moment and notices the boy close to the cliff and his camera nearby. The final scene shows the stranger and Étienne in bed after sex, with Étienne seeming truly happy for the first time.

<doc id="406170" wikidata="Q528846" url="?curid=406170" title="Further Seems Forever">
<text>Further Seems Forever is an American rock band formed in 1998 in Pompano Beach, Florida. Over its initial eight-year run the band experienced several lineup changes, resulting in a different lead vocalist performing on each of their first three studio albums. Original singer Chris Carrabba recorded &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; (2001) with the group before leaving to focus on Dashboard Confessional. He was replaced by Jason Gleason, who performed on &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; (2003) but left the band the following year. Former Sense Field vocalist Jon Bunch joined Further Seems Forever for &quot;Hide Nothing&quot; (2004). The band broke up in 2006 but reunited four years later with Carrabba on vocals. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Penny Black&quot;, was released in 2012.

The band&#x27;s music is often classified as indie rock and is frequently associated with the emo genre. They have also been classified as a Christian rock act due to the individual band members&#x27; religious beliefs, frequent themes of Christianity in their lyrics, their association with the predominantly Christian Tooth &amp; Nail Records label, and their performances at Christian-themed festivals such as Cornerstone and Furnace Fest. Despite these associations, the group has claimed not to be an explicitly Christian band, but rather a rock band with Christian members.

==History==
=== 1998–2001: Formation, Chris Carrabba, and &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; ===
The band formed in 1998 in Pompano Beach, Florida after the breakup of the Christian hardcore band Strongarm. Strongarm guitarists Josh Colbert and Nick Dominguez, bassist Chad Neptune, and drummer Steve Kleisath recruited former Vacant Andys and Red Letter Day vocalist Chris Carrabba to form Further Seems Forever. The first song the new band released was &quot;Vengeance Factor&quot; on the Deep Elm Records compilation &quot;An Ocean of Doubt: The Emo Diaries, Chapter Four&quot;, which contributed to the band&#x27;s association with the emo genre. Their first release was a split EP with fellow Floridians Recess Theory entitled &quot;From the 27th State&quot;, released by Takehold Records, and soon the band had signed a recording contract with Seattle-based Christian label Tooth and Nail Records. By 2000, however, Carrabba had begun working on his own project Dashboard Confessional and recorded the album &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot;, essentially a solo release which he considered too personal for Further Seems Forever. At this time the band struggled with interpersonal squabbles and difficulties touring, as Dominguez had a young family and was reluctant to tour outside the state. This forced the group to search for several fill-in guitarists to replace him on tour. After returning from a solo tour in August 2000 Carrabba announced that he was leaving the group in order to focus on Dashboard Confessional full-time:

&quot;I knew the only chance I had to make it in the music scene was go out there and do all the legwork to push yourself and make yourself known...I was willing to do that and they weren&#x27;t. They were playing music around their jobs, not as their jobs. It was like, if we&#x27;re gonna be a band, let&#x27;s be a band. This isn&#x27;t going to happen by itself.&quot;

Despite this decision, Carrabba joined the band the following month to record their debut album &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot;, released in 2001 by Tooth &amp; Nail. Relations between him and the other band members remained amicable, and Further Seems Forever would later open for Dashboard Confessional on several occasions.

=== 2001–2004: Jason Gleason and &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; ===
After Carrabba&#x27;s departure the band recruited Jason Gleason of Affinity as their new vocalist. With Gleason they re-recorded their cover version of &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot; for the compilation &quot;Rock Music: A Tribute to Weezer&quot; with Gleason&#x27;s version appearing on the CD and Carraba&#x27;s version appearing as a vinyl only bonus track. They also recorded a cover of &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; for the compilation &quot;Punk Goes Pop&quot;.

In August 2001, the band played Furnace Fest, and next embarked on a tour of the United States&#x27; East Coast and Midwest with Ultimate Fakebook, As Friends Rust and Keepsake in August and September 2001. The tour was cut short, however, following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City. Further Seems Forever and As Friends Rust cancelled the last five dates of the tour as a result, since they were playing in the vicinity of New York, culminating in New York City itself on September 14, 2001. In December 2001, they toured around Florida with Dashboard Confessional, The Rocking Horse Winner, Fairweather and Seville as part of the &quot;Pompano on the Go Tour&quot;.

In 2003, Dominguez then left the group to pursue a record label venture, Pop Up Record. He ran the label with Derick Cordoba, who replaced him in Further Seems Forever. This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s second album &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot;, released in 2003, and supported it with a national touring schedule. In February 2003, the band toured with Elliott, The Early November and Salem. In 2003, Further Seems Forever signed with Undecided Records to finance their own imprint record label Pompano Basic, with plans to release a compilation of rare and unreleased material. The release took much longer to complete and was ultimately released bundled with a live DVD as &quot;The Final Curtain&quot; in April 2007, by which time Undecided Records had changed name to 567 Records.

In early 2004, as work on a third album was beginning, the group had a falling out with Gleason which resulted in his departure. In a 2006 interview he blamed the split on &quot;completely irrational behavior on a daily basis. Mistrust. Fights. Anger. Jealousy. A very unhealthy relationship.&quot; Gleason went on to form ActionReaction in 2005 with his wife Crissie &quot;Bella&quot; Verhagen and released the album &quot;Three is the Magic Number&quot; in 2006.

=== 2004–2006: Jon Bunch, &quot;Hide Nothing&quot;, and breakup ===
To replace Gleason the band recruited vocalist Jon Bunch of the recently disbanded Sense Field. With Bunch, they released the album &quot;Hide Nothing&quot; (2004) and continued to tour internationally. The band teamed up with Brandtson, The Kicks, Moments in Grace and Salem for the &quot;Hide Nothing Tour&quot;, which spanned from August 22 to October 4, 2004. The tour took the bands through the United States&#x27; West Coast (including a date in Western Canada), the Midwest and the East Coast. The band next partnered with Sparta, Copeland and Sunshine for another American and Canadian tour which spanned from November 5 to December 6, 2004.

From February 15 to March 14, 2005, the band toured the United States with The Starting Line, Days Away and JamisonParker. On April 5, 2005, the band released the acoustic EP &quot;Hope Against Hope&quot;. On April 30, 2005, the band played a reunion show with the original members, including Carrabba and Dominguez, at The Bamboozle, at which they performed &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; in its entirety. With Bunch back on vocals, Further Seems Forever toured Europe during May and June 2005, joined by bass guitarist Thomas Rankine (formerly of As Friends Rust and Salem).

In November 2005, they announced a hiatus, which was followed by an announcement in January 2006 that their upcoming tour of the United States and Canada with Bunch would be their final performances, as the members&#x27; families and other commitments had eclipsed their interests in the band. As Neptune stated:

&quot;As I sit here reflecting back on my time with FSF, saying to myself &#x27;what happens when your dreams have come true already?&#x27; Well my answer is &#x27;it probably wasn&#x27;t my dream all along.&#x27; Sure maybe it was part of my calling but the truth is that making a family has been the goal ever since I can remember. My family is what I live for now and I am very glad to do so.&quot;

Tooth &amp; Nail released a &quot;best of&quot; retrospective album that April entitled &quot;Hope This Finds You Well&quot;, and the band&#x27;s farewell performance occurred June 17, 2006 at The Masquerade in Atlanta, Georgia. This performance was recorded and released as a live album and DVD by 567 Records in April 2007, entitled &quot;The Final Curtain&quot;.

=== 2007–2010: Post-breakup activity ===
Following the band&#x27;s breakup, Bunch and Cordoba formed Fields Forever, a duo project performing acoustic renditions of Further Seems Forever and Sense Field songs which toured across Europe. Other members went on to other projects, with Kleisath joined a group called En Masse in early 2006 and Cordoba joining Kicked Out Heel Drag in early 2007.

=== 2010–present: Reunion with Carrabba ===
Further Seems Forever reunited with original singer Chris Carrabba in August 2010. Further Seems Forever and Dashboard Confessional both played the Groezrock festival in April 2011. The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Penny Black&quot;, was released in October 2012 through Rise Records.

In August 2015, it was announced that Gleason had rejoined the band.

Former frontman Jon Bunch died on January 31, 2016, in Irvine, California at the age of 45.

In the fall of 2021, the band played the Furnace Festival with the Gleason-era lineup.

On February 2, 2022, it was announced that Further Seems Forever would reunite with the original lineup to celebrate 20 years of &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; at the Breakfast in Franklin, Tennessee.

In February 2024, the band signed with Iodine Recordings.

<doc id="406174" wikidata="Q333418" url="?curid=406174" title="John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden">
<text>John Jeffreys Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden (11 February 17598 October 1840), styled Viscount Bayham from 1786 to 1794 and known as the 2nd Earl Camden from 1794 to 1812, was a British politician. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the revolutionary years 1795 to 1798 and as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies between 1804 and 1805.

==Background and education==
John Jeffreys Pratt was born at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, London, the only son of the barrister Charles Pratt, KC (a son of Sir John Pratt, a former Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench), and Elizabeth, daughter of Nicholas Jeffreys, of The Priory, Brecknockshire. He was baptised on the day Halley&#x27;s Comet appeared. In 1765, his father (by then Sir Charles Pratt, having been appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1762) was created Baron Camden, at which point he became The Hon. John Pratt. He was educated at the University of Cambridge (Trinity College).

==Political career==

In 1780, Pratt was elected Member of Parliament for Bath and obtained the position of Teller of the Exchequer the same year, a lucrative office which he kept until his death, although after 1812 he refused to receive the large income arising from it.} He served under Lord Shelburne as Lord of the Admiralty between 1782 and 1783 and in the same post under William Pitt the Younger between 1783 and 1789, as well as a Lord of the Treasury between 1789 and 1792.

In 1786, his father was created Earl Camden, at which point he became known by one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles as Viscount Bayham.

In 1793, Bayham was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1794 he succeeded his father as 2nd Earl Camden, and the following year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Pitt.

As an opponent of parliamentary reform and of Catholic emancipation, Camden&#x27;s term of office was one of turbulence, culminating in the rebellion of 1798. His refusal in 1797 to reprieve the United Irishman William Orr, convicted of treason on the word of one witness of dubious credit (and for which his own sister Frances, Lady Londonderry, petitioned him), aroused great public indignation. To break the United Irish conspiracy, he suspended &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and unleashed a ruthless martial-law campaign to disarm and break up the republican organization.

He resigned from office in June 1798, to be replaced with Lord Cornwallis, who oversaw the military defeat of the rebellion. In 1804, Camden became Secretary of State for War and the Colonies under Pitt, and in 1805 Lord President of the Council, an office he retained until 1806. He was again Lord President from 1807 to 1812,after which date he remained for some time in the cabinet without office. In 1812 he was created Earl of Brecknock and Marquess Camden.

The enforced resignation from the Cabinet of Lord Castlereagh, the stepson of his sister Frances (Lady Londonderry), to whom he had always been personally close, in September 1809, led to a series of bitter family quarrels, when it became clear that Camden had known for months of the plan to dismiss Castlereagh, but had given him no warning. Castlereagh himself regarded Camden as &quot;a weak friend&quot;, not an enemy, and they were eventually reconciled. Other members of the Stewart family, however, never forgave Camden for what they regarded as his disloyalty.

Camden was also Lord Lieutenant of Kent between 1808 and 1840 and appointed himself Colonel of the Cranbrook and Woodsgate Regiment of Local Militia in 1809. He was Chancellor of Cambridge University between 1834 and 1840. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1799 and elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1802.

==Family==

Lord Camden married Frances, daughter of William Molesworth, in 1785. She died at Bayham Abbey, Sussex, in July 1829. Lord Camden survived her by eleven years and died at Seale, Surrey, on 8 October 1840, aged 81. He was succeeded by his only son, George.

The family owned and lived in a house located at 22 Arlington Street in St. James&#x27;s, a district of the City of Westminster in central London, which is adjoining the Ritz Hotel. In the year of his death, he sold the house to The 7th Duke of Beaufort.

<text>Thomas Cullen Davis (born September 22, 1933) is an American former oil tycoon who is best known for being acquitted of murder and attempted murder in two high-profile trials during the 1970s. At the time of his first trial, Davis was believed to be the wealthiest man to have stood trial for murder in the United States.

First he was accused of murdering his 12-year-old stepdaughter on August 2, 1976, during a contentious divorce from his second wife, Priscilla Davis. He was found not guilty. The second trial, two years later, involved allegations that Davis attempted to hire a hitman to kill both Priscilla and the judge overseeing his divorce from Priscilla. Again, Davis was acquitted.

== Early life and first trial ==
Thomas Cullen Davis was the middle of three sons born to legendary Fort Worth, Texas oilman Kenneth W. &quot;Stinky&quot; Davis. His father founded KenDavis Industries International, Inc., which manufactured goods used in the petroleum industry. Davis and his brothers received equal shares of their father&#x27;s estate upon his death in 1968, and all three were described as possessing keen business instincts.

Cullen Davis had a reputation in Fort Worth society circles for displays of bad temper and general &quot;creepiness&quot;, according to female associates.

Cullen Davis&#x27; first marriage was to Sandra Masters on August 29, 1962. They had two sons, Cullen Jr. and Brian Davis.

Davis&#x27; second marriage was to Priscilla Lee Childers. They were married on August 29, 1968, only hours after the death of his father. It was her third marriage. Priscilla had one daughter from her first marriage, and two children from her second marriage, including Andrea Wilborn.

In 1972, Davis spent $6 million ($ million today) to build Stonegate Mansion, a five-bedroom, 11-bath mansion with an indoor pool and a master bedroom. In its prime, the luxurious, contemporary home of courtyards, tunnels and balconies at 4100 Stonegate Blvd. was decorated with more than 100 oil paintings.

Davis and Childers separated in 1974 and both began dating other people openly. A judge granted Priscilla the right to live in the Stonegate property during the divorce proceedings and further authorized substantial spousal and child support payments from Davis to Childers. Her live-in boyfriend was Stan Farr, a former basketball star at nearby Texas Christian University.

On August 2, 1976, an intruder entered Stonegate Mansion and killed 12-year-old Andrea Wilborn, who was home alone after returning from a Bible study. The body of Andrea would later be found in the basement, apparently shot execution-style. When Childers and her then-boyfriend Stan Farr returned home, both were shot. Farr died at the scene. Childers staggered from the house being pursued by the killer as family friends Beverly Bass and Gus Gavrel Jr. (who later married), drove up to the mansion. The killer shot Gavrel, paralyzing him for life.

Childers identified Davis to police, saying he had shot her and Farr, wearing no disguise except a wig. Gavrel (who died on December 6, 2018, of pancreatic cancer, aged 64) said he was shot after Bass recognized the gunman as Davis and called him by name. Police arrested Davis that same night, at the home he shared with Karen Master, his then-girlfriend who would become his third wife. At the first trial, Davis&#x27;s wealth was estimated at over $100 million ($ million today).

Davis was only tried for the murder of Andrea. He was defended by famous Texas defense attorney Richard &quot;Racehorse&quot; Haynes. The prosecution case relied almost entirely on eyewitness testimony. Earlier in the day of the shooting, a judge had ordered Davis&#x27;s monthly support to Priscilla increased from $3500 to $5000 ($ to $ today) and to pay her legal fees of $25,000 ($ today) and household expenses of $24,000 ($ today). This change was proposed as a motive for the crimes.

Davis did not testify in his own defense. Haynes&#x27;s defense concentrated on two main points. First, the complete lack of physical evidence linking Davis to the crime (no fingerprints, no firearm linked to the murder, etc.). Second, Haynes focused on the eyewitness testimony, particularly Priscilla. Haynes depicted her as living in two worlds: Fort Worth high society, and a milieu of drug dealers, criminals, and sleazy sex. Haynes proposed that Priscilla&#x27;s admitted heavy use of prescription painkillers made her an unreliable witness who might have been confused about the identity of her attacker.

Journalist Gary Cartwright wrote: &quot;most observers agreed later that the case was won as soon as Haynes completed his cross-examination of Priscilla&quot;; this occurred only two weeks into a three-month trial. Davis was found not guilty. Of the trial, prosecutor Tim Curry said, &quot;We were out-bought and out-thought&quot;.

==Other trials==
In related civil litigation concerning Wilborn&#x27;s death following the murder trial, Davis prevailed and was held not liable for her death. The children of Stan Farr later sued Davis for wrongful death and received a $250,000 out of court settlement.

In 1978, Davis was arrested again, this time for allegedly hiring a hitman to murder both Priscilla Davis and the judge overseeing their ongoing divorce litigation. The case largely hinged on a tape-recorded conversation between Davis and David McCrory, an undercover employee posing as a hitman for hire, which was recorded in the parking lot of the Coco&#x27;s Famous Hamburgers restaurant where Davis was arrested. In the recording, Davis was alleged to have asked the undercover employee to murder his wife and the judge. The trial of &quot;Texas v. Cullen T. Davis&quot; was one of the first uses of forensic discourse analysis on tape-recorded evidence in a legal setting in the United States.

A discourse analyst testified that Davis&#x27; words in the tape did not constitute solicitation of murder. Haynes again defended Davis. He again attacked the prosecution&#x27;s physical evidence: Davis&#x27;s fingerprints were not found on critical pieces of evidence, such as the cash he allegedly paid to McCrory. Unlike the first trial, Davis testified in his own defense. He stated that he had not solicited McCrory&#x27;s offer to kill Priscilla and the judge, and claimed it was a plot orchestrated by her to frame him. Davis claimed he merely played along with the plot in an attempt to eventually convince McCrory to admit that Priscilla was to blame for the entire scheme.

Unlike the first trial where observers were convinced that Davis would likely be acquitted, opinion was split in the second trial with the general consensus being that Davis&#x27;s best hope was a hung jury. After a lengthy trial Davis was acquitted a second time.

Due to the prominence of the case, in 2015 Tarrant County authorities chose to keep the paper court documents of the case as historical documents even though they have been digitized.

==Later life==
Davis married Karen Master on June 5, 1979, in Fort Worth. He adopted her two sons Trey Master and Chelsey Master. Davis lost most of his oil fortune in the recession of the 1980s, and eventually declared bankruptcy. Cullen and Karen Davis sold their home and property to a real estate developer in 1984. Davis continues to live in the Fort Worth area. Karen Davis died of organ failure on September 22, 2016. Davis, in later life, became a born-again Christian, and at one point worked with televangelist James Robison.

Priscilla Lee Childers died of breast cancer at the age of 59 on February 19, 2001, still adamantly insisting on Davis&#x27; guilt.

<doc id="406186" wikidata="Q335667" url="?curid=406186" title="Henry Bathurst, 2nd Earl Bathurst">
<text>Henry Bathurst, 2nd Earl Bathurst (20 May 17146 August 1794), known as The Lord Apsley from 1771 to 1775, was a British lawyer and politician. He was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1771 to 1778.

==Background and education==
Bathurst was the eldest son of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst, and his wife Catherine (née Apsley). Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he was called to the bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1736. He practised on the Oxford circuit and became a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1745 after several years sitting in King&#x27;s Bench.

==Political and judicial career==
In April 1735 he was elected member of parliament for Cirencester, and was rewarded for his opposition to the government by being made solicitor-general in 1745 and, then attorney-general to Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1748. Frederick died in 1751, but Bathurst was asked to carry on in the same office for Prince George.

Resigning his seat in parliament in April 1754 he was made a judge and bencher of the Court of Common Pleas in the following month. Bathurst remained opposed to the Whigs, despite the ill-fated attempt by the Tories to capitalise from Walpole&#x27;s fall.

He was admitted to the Privy Council when the death of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s death left the post vacant with no candidate. Appointed one of the three commissioners of the Great Seal of England he was favourite for the post and, later allowed as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in January 1771; he was on the occasion raised to the peerage as Baron Apsley, in the County of Sussex. He was roundly abused in rhyme and doggerel by satirical writings of Whigs Lord Brougham and Lord Lyndhurst. The best they could say about him was that he was &quot;not disagreeable&quot;, but ridiculed his ability at the bar, and mocked a Tory as incompetent. In January 1774 he was instrumental in writing the Intolerable Acts which he supported in parliament and the courts, most notably the Boston Port Act which gave rise to the Boston Tea Party and revolution. The judge was not a war-monger nor had he any experience of soldiering, but the perception was political. In 1777 after the American Frigates had defeated once or twice, Bathurst worried that Great Britain might lose her control of the coastline urged peace preliminaries in order to save the colonies in the West Indies. He was a personal friend of Admiral William Howe, who was known to him since boyhood. Having succeeded his father as second Earl Bathurst in September 1775, he resigned his office somewhat unwillingly in July 1778 to enable Lord Thurlow to join the cabinet of Lord North. In November 1779 he was appointed Lord President of the Council, and left office with North in March 1782.

In 1771 the construction of Apsley House was started. A neo-classical facade made of brick with five bays. It had large light and airy sash windows and in the centre of the house a large sweeping circular staircase of exquisite design. The house was remodelled by the Duke of Wellington when he was prime minister between 1828 and 1830, when it was encased in Bath stone. But Lord Bathurst sold the house to the south of Hyde Park, also known as no.1 London removing his estates to the country as befitted a fox-hunting Tory. Lord Bathurst used the proceeds to invest in more acreage at Cirencester Park which was planted with trees for landscaping and hunting.

King George III held faith with Bathurst as the Speaker of the House of Lords. A former treasury commissioner he had the sinecure of a tellership of the Exchequer. It entailed some duties but the job was worth £1,200 per annum. More importantly for the succession to the estates, he was able to secure a tellership for his son by 1790. He continued to plant a new garden into his retirement. Then in 1788, a sick King George decided he would take the waters at Cheltenham with Queen Charlotte. En route, the royal family stopped during July at Cirencester Park. Lord Bathurst developed the Sapperton tunnel the following year for a new canal dug to connect the Severn with the Thames. During the reign, hundreds of local acts of Parliament authorised the construction of roads, bridges, tunnels, and infrastructures.

Lord Bathurst&#x27;s letters show he was a kindly man with a reserved temperament. He was a good patrician master taking care of his workers, he paid more than most employers, and ensured they saw a doctor if necessary. But Bathurst&#x27;s moral philosophy earned enemies among the whigs, particularly Horatio Walpole, the journalist of Strawberry Hill, who bore a grudge for the attacks on the Walpole ministry.

==Family==
Lord Bathurst married firstly Anne James in 1754, but she died in 1758 without issue. He married secondly Tryphena, daughter of Thomas Scawen, in 1759. He died at Oakley Grove near Cirencester on 6 August 1794, aged 80, and was succeeded in the earldom by his son from his second marriage, Henry. Lady Bathurst died in 1807. Apsley House, in Hyde Park, known as &quot;Number One London&quot;, was built for him by Robert Adam. It was sold in 1807 to the first Marquess of Wellesley, who sold it in 1817 to his younger brother, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

<text>Richard Bright (28 September 1789 – 16 December 1858) was an English physician and early pioneer in the research of kidney disease. He is particularly known for his description of Bright&#x27;s disease.

==Biography==
He was born in Bristol, Gloucestershire, the third son of Sarah and Richard Bright Sr., a wealthy merchant and banker. Bright Sr. shared his interest in science with his son,
encouraging him to consider it as a career. In 1808, Bright Jr. joined the University of Edinburgh to study philosophy, economics and mathematics, but switched to medicine the following year. In 1810, he accompanied Sir George Mackenzie on a summer expedition to Iceland where he conducted naturalist studies. Bright then continued his medical studies at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London and in September 1813 returned to Edinburgh to be granted his medical doctorate. His thesis was &quot;De erysipelate contagioso&quot; (&quot;On contagious erysipelas&quot;).

During the 1820s and 1830s Bright again worked at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, teaching, practising and researching medicine. There he worked alongside two other celebrated medical pioneers, Thomas Addison and Thomas Hodgkin. His research into the causes and symptoms of kidney disease led to his identifying what became known as Bright&#x27;s disease. For this, he is considered the &quot;father of nephrology&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821. He was President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1837.

Bright had a special affection for Hungary and in 1815 he lived in Festetics Castle in Keszthely, where there is a large plaque: &quot;To the memory of the English physician scientist and traveller who was one of the pioneers in the accurate description of Lake Balaton.”

He delivered the Lumleian Lectures in 1837 on &quot;Disorders of the Brain&quot; and the Gulstonian lectures in 1833 on the &quot;Function of the Abdominal Viscera&quot; at the Royal College of Physicians.

===Death===
On 11 December 1858, Bright became severely ill due to complications of heart disease and was unable to recover. He died in London aged 69 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. A memorial to him lies within St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly.
Bright had two sons. The younger also became a physician; the elder, James Franck Bright, a historian.

==Cultural references==
When asked if he had ever been seriously ill, S.J. Perelman quipped, &quot;Why, yes. I had Bright&#x27;s disease. And he had mine.&quot;

He lived at 11 Saville Row, London, which is now commemorated by a blue plaque. This address was the filming location of the tailor&#x27;s shop in the &quot;Kingsman&quot; films and the plaque can be seen outside.

==Artistic recognition==

A bust of Bright is held at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.

<doc id="406192" wikidata="Q458372" url="?curid=406192" title="John Greenleaf Whittier">
<text>John Greenleaf Whittier (December 17, 1807 – September 7, 1892) was an American Quaker poet and advocate of the abolition of slavery in the United States. Frequently listed as one of the fireside poets, he was influenced by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Whittier is remembered particularly for his anti-slavery writings, as well as his 1866 book &quot;Snow-Bound&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Whittier was born to John and Abigail ( Hussey) Whittier at their rural homestead in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on December 17, 1807. His middle name is thought to mean &quot;feuillevert&quot;, after his Huguenot forebears. He grew up on the farm in a household with his parents, a brother and two sisters, a maternal aunt and paternal uncle, and a constant flow of visitors and hired hands for the farm. As a boy, it was discovered that Whittier was color-blind when he was unable to see a difference between ripe and unripe strawberries.

The farm was not very profitable, and there was only enough money to get by. Whittier himself was not cut out for hard farm labor and suffered from bad health and physical frailty his whole life. Although he received little formal education, he was an avid reader who studied his father&#x27;s six books on Quakerism until their teachings became the foundation of his ideology. Whittier was heavily influenced by the doctrines of his religion, particularly its stress on humanitarianism, compassion, and social responsibility.

==Career==
Whittier was first introduced to poetry by a teacher. His sister Mary Whittier sent his first poem, &quot;The Deity&quot;, to the Newburyport &quot;Free Press&quot; without his permission, and its editor, William Lloyd Garrison, published it on June 8, 1826. Garrison, as well as another local editor, encouraged Whittier to attend the recently opened Haverhill Academy. To raise money to attend the school, Whittier became a shoemaker for a time, and a deal was made to pay part of his tuition with food from the family farm. Before his second term, he earned money to cover tuition by serving as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in what is now Merrimac, Massachusetts. He attended Haverhill Academy from 1827 to 1828 and completed a high school education in only two terms.

Whittier received the first substantial public praise for his work from critic John Neal via Neal&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Yankee&quot; in 1828. Whittier valued the opinion of the older and more established writer, pledging that if Neal did not like his writing, &quot;&quot;I will quit poetry, and everything also of a literary nature&quot;, for I am sick at heart of the business.&quot; In an 1829 letter, Neal told Whittier to &quot;Persevere, and I am sure you will have your reward in every way.&quot; Reading Neal&#x27;s 1828 novel &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; inspired Whittier to weave New England witchcraft lore into his own stories and poems.

Garrison gave Whittier the job of editor of the &quot;National Philanthropist&quot;, a Boston-based temperance weekly. Shortly after a change in management, Garrison reassigned him as editor of the weekly &quot;American Manufacturer&quot; in Boston. Whittier became an outspoken critic of President Andrew Jackson, and by 1830 was editor of the prominent &quot;New England Weekly Review&quot; in Hartford, Connecticut, the most influential Whig journal in New England. He published &quot;The Song of the Vermonters, 1779&quot; anonymously in &quot;The New-England Magazine&quot; in 1838. The poem was mistakenly attributed to Ethan Allen for nearly sixty years. Whittier acknowledged his authorship in 1858.
===Abolitionist activity===

During the 1830s, Whittier became interested in politics, but after losing a congressional election at age 25, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned home. The year 1833 was a turning point for Whittier; he resurrected his correspondence with Garrison, and the passionate abolitionist began to encourage the young Quaker to join his cause.

In 1833, Whittier published the antislavery pamphlet &quot;Justice and Expediency&quot;, and from there dedicated the next twenty years of his life to the abolitionist cause. The controversial pamphlet destroyed all of his political hopes, as his demand for immediate emancipation alienated both Northern businessmen and Southern slaveholders, but it also sealed his commitment to a cause that he deemed morally correct and socially necessary. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society and signed the Anti-Slavery Declaration of 1833, which he often considered the most significant action of his life.

Whittier&#x27;s political skill made him useful as a lobbyist, and his willingness to badger anti-slavery congressional leaders into joining the abolitionist cause was invaluable. From 1835 to 1838, he traveled widely in the North, attending conventions, securing votes, speaking to the public, and lobbying politicians. As he did so, Whittier received his fair share of violent responses, being several times mobbed, stoned, and run out of town.

From 1838 to 1840, he was editor of the &quot;Pennsylvania Freeman&quot; in Philadelphia, one of the leading antislavery papers in the North, formerly known as the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. In May 1838, the publication moved its offices to the newly opened Pennsylvania Hall on North Sixth Street, which was shortly after burned by a pro-slavery mob. Whittier continued to write poetry, and nearly all of his poems then dealt with the problem of slavery.

In 1838, Charles G. Atherton of New Hampshire presented five resolutions that were adopted and created a new resolution that barred Congress from discussing petitions that mentioned bringing slavery to an end. Congress approved them on December 12, 1838, which became known as the &quot;Atherton Gag&quot;; Whittier referred to Atherton in one of his many abolition poems as &quot;vile&quot; by having allied himself so closely with his fellow Democrats from pro-slavery South. It was not until 1844 the House rescinded that gag rule on a motion made by John Quincy Adams.

By the end of the 1830s, the unity of the abolitionist movement had begun to fracture. Whittier stuck to his belief that moral action apart from political effort was futile. He knew that success required legislative change, not merely moral suasion. That opinion alone engendered a bitter split from Garrison, and Whittier went on to become a founding member of the Liberty Party in 1839. In 1840, he attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. By 1843, he was announcing the triumph of the fledgling party: &quot;Liberty party is no longer an experiment. It is vigorous reality, exerting... a powerful influence.&quot; Whittier unsuccessfully encouraged Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to join the party. He took editing jobs with the &quot;Middlesex Standard&quot; in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the &quot;Essex Transcript&quot; in Amesbury until 1844. While in Lowell, he met Lucy Larcom, who became a lifelong friend.

In 1845, he began writing his essay &quot;The Black Man&quot; which included an anecdote about John Fountain, a free black who was jailed in Virginia for helping slaves to escape. After his release, Fountain went on a speaking tour and thanked Whittier for writing his story.

Around then, the stresses of editorial duties, worsening health, and dangerous mob violence caused Whittier to have a physical breakdown. He went home to Amesbury and remained there for the rest of his life, ending his active participation in abolition. Even so, he continued to believe that the best way to gain abolitionist support was to broaden the Liberty Party&#x27;s political appeal, and Whittier persisted in advocating the addition of other issues to its platform. He eventually participated in the evolution of the Liberty Party into the Free Soil Party, and some say his greatest political feat was convincing Charles Sumner to run on the Free-Soil ticket for the U.S. Senate in 1850.

Beginning in 1847, Whittier was the editor of Gamaliel Bailey&#x27;s &quot;The National Era&quot;, one of the most influential abolitionist newspapers in the North. For the next ten years, it featured the best of his writing, both as prose and poetry. Being confined to his home and away from the action offered Whittier a chance to write better abolitionist poetry, and he was even poet laureate for his party. Whittier&#x27;s poems often used slavery to represent all kinds of oppression (physical, spiritual, economic), and his poems stirred up popular response because they appealed to feelings, rather than logic.

Whittier produced two collections of antislavery poetry: &quot;Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838&quot; and &quot;Voices of Freedom&quot; (1846).

===Civil War years===

He was an elector in the presidential election of 1860 and of 1864 for Abraham Lincoln both times. In the months leading up to the American Civil War, Whittier built a strong national audience. In January 1861, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, which had previous spurned his poetry, praised him for his &quot;keen and discriminating love of right&quot; and his &quot;love of freedom&quot;.

In 1864, the &quot;North American Review&quot; responded to Whittier&#x27;s collection &quot;In War Time, and Other Poems&quot;, by calling him &quot;on the whole, the most American of all our poets, and there is a fire of warlike patriotism in him that burns all the more intensely that is smothered by his [Quaker] creed&quot;.

The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 ended both slavery and his public cause, and so Whittier turned to other forms of poetry for the remainder of his life.

===Later life===

One of his most enduring works, &quot;Snow-Bound&quot;, was first published in 1866. Whittier was surprised by its financial success; he earned $10,000 from the first edition. In 1867, Whittier asked James T. Fields to get him a ticket to a reading by Charles Dickens during the British author&#x27;s visit to the United States. After the event, Whittier wrote a letter describing his experience:

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1870.

Whittier spent the last winters of his life, from 1876 to 1892, at Oak Knoll, the home of his cousins in Danvers, Massachusetts.

Whittier spent the summer of 1892 at the home of a cousin in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, where he wrote his last poem (a tribute to Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.) and where he was captured in a final photograph. He died at this home on September 7, 1892, and was buried in Amesbury, Massachusetts.

==Poetry==
Whittier&#x27;s first two published books were &quot;Legends of New England&quot; (1831) and the poem &quot;Moll Pitcher&quot; (1832). In 1833 he published &quot;The Song of the Vermonters, 1779,&quot; which he had anonymously inserted in &quot;The New England Magazine.&quot; The poem was erroneously attributed to Ethan Allen for nearly sixty years. This use of poetry in the service of his political beliefs is illustrated by his book &quot;Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question&quot;.

Highly regarded in his lifetime and for a period thereafter, he is now largely remembered for his anti-slavery writings and his poems &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Barefoot Boy&quot;, &quot;Maud Muller&quot; and &quot;Snow-Bound&quot;.

A number of his poems have been turned into hymns, including &quot;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&quot;, taken from his poem &quot;The Brewing of Soma&quot;. The latter part of the poem was set in 1924 by Dr. George Gilbert Stocks to the tune of &quot;Repton&quot; by English composer Hubert Parry from the 1888 oratorio &quot;Judith&quot;. It is also sung as the hymn &quot;Rest&quot; by Frederick Maker, and Charles Ives also set a part of it to music in his song &quot;Serenity&quot;.

Whittier&#x27;s Quakerism is better illustrated, however, by the hymn that begins:

His sometimes contrasting sense of the need for strong action against injustice can be seen in his poem &quot;To Rönge&quot; in honor of Johannes Ronge, the German religious figure and rebel leader of the 1848 rebellion in Germany:
Whittier&#x27;s &quot;At Port Royal 1861&quot; describes the experience of Northern abolitionists arriving at Port Royal, South Carolina, as teachers and missionaries for the slaves who had been left behind when their owners fled because the Union Navy would arrive to blockade the coast. The poem includes the &quot;Song of the Negro Boatmen,&quot; written in dialect:
Of all the poetry inspired by the Civil War, the &quot;Song of the Negro Boatmen&quot; was one of the most widely printed, and, although Whittier never actually visited Port Royal, an abolitionist working there described his &quot;Song of the Negro Boatmen&quot; as &quot;wonderfully applicable as we were being rowed across Hilton Head Harbor among United States gunboats.&quot;

==Criticism==
Nathaniel Hawthorne dismissed Whittier&#x27;s &quot;Literary Recreations and Miscellanies&quot; (1854): &quot;Whittier&#x27;s book is poor stuff! I like the man, but have no high opinion either of his poetry or his prose.&quot; Editor George Ripley, however, found Whittier&#x27;s poetry refreshing and said it had a &quot;stately movement of versification, grandeur of imagery, a vein of tender and solemn pathos, cheerful trust&quot; and a &quot;pure and ennobling character&quot;. Boston critic Edwin Percy Whipple noted Whittier&#x27;s moral and ethical tone mingled with sincere emotion. He wrote, &quot;In reading this last volume, I feel as if my soul had taken a bath in holy water.&quot; Later scholars and critics questioned the depth of Whittier&#x27;s poetry. One was Karl Keller, who noted, &quot;Whittier has been a writer to love, not to belabor.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==

Whittier was particularly supportive of women writers, including Alice Cary, Phoebe Cary, Sarah Orne Jewett, Lucy Larcom, and Celia Thaxter. He was especially influential on prose writings by Jewett, with whom he shared a belief in the moral quality of literature and an interest in New England folklore. Jewett dedicated one of her books to him and modeled several of her characters after people in Whittier&#x27;s life.
Whittier&#x27;s family farm, known as the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead or simply &quot;Whittier&#x27;s Birthplace&quot;, is now a historic site open to the public. His later residence in Amesbury, where he lived for 56 years, is also open to the public, and is now known as the John Greenleaf Whittier Home. Whittier&#x27;s hometown of Haverhill has named many buildings and landmarks in his honor including J.G. Whittier Middle School, Greenleaf Elementary, and Whittier Regional Vocational Technical High School. Numerous other schools around the country also bear his name.

The John Greenleaf Whittier Bridge, built in the style of the Sagamore and Bourne bridges, carries Interstate 95 from Amesbury to Newburyport over the Merrimack River. A covered bridge spanning the Bearcamp River in Ossipee, New Hampshire, is also named for Whittier.

The city of Whittier, California, is named after the poet, as are the communities of Whittier, Alaska, Greenleaf, Idaho, and Whittier, Iowa; the Minneapolis neighborhood of Whittier; the Whittier neighborhoods of Denver and Boulder, Colorado, as well as a school and a park there. Both Whittier College and Whittier Law School are named after him. A park in the Saint Boniface area of Winnipeg is named after the poet in recognition of his poem &quot;The Red River Voyageur&quot;. Whittier Education Campus in Washington, DC, is named in his honor. SS &quot;Whittier Victory&quot; a World War II ship named after Whittier College. Whittier Peak and Mount Whittier in Washington and Mount Whittier in New Hampshire are mountains named after him.

The alternate history story &quot;P.&#x27;s Correspondence&quot; (1846) by Nathaniel Hawthorne, considered the first such story ever published in English, includes the notice &quot;Whittier, a fiery Quaker youth, to whom the muse had perversely assigned a battle-trumpet, got himself lynched, in South Carolina&quot;. The date of that event in Hawthorne&#x27;s invented timeline was 1835.

Whittier was one of thirteen writers in the 1897 card game &quot;Authors&quot;, which referenced his writings &quot;Laus Deo&quot;, &quot;Among the Hills&quot;, &quot;Snow-bound&quot;, and &quot;The Eternal Goodness&quot;. He was removed from the card game when it was reissued in 1987.

Whitter&#x27;s poem &quot;Twilight&quot; was set to music in 1932 by Edwin Fowles.

In 2020, a statue previously erected in his honor in Whittier, California, was defaced with antislavery and Black Lives Matter slogans by vandals. He had never owned slaves.

<text>The Battle of [[Spartolos]] took place in 429 BC between Athens and the Chalcidian League and their allies, in the early part of the Peloponnesian War.

The fall of Potidaea had not succeeded in quelling the rebellion against Athens in Chalcidice. To ensure a steady stream of imperial revenue and suppress additional local uprisings, the Athenians dispatched Xenophon (son of Euripides) with 2,000 hoplites and 200 cavalry to launch an attack on Spartolos. They destroyed the crops outside the city and began negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcidice, but the anti-Athenian factions asked for help from Olynthus. An army from Chalcidice, Spartolos, and Olynthus met the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites were defeated and they retreated to Spartolos. Their cavalry and peltasts, however, gained the advantage over the Athenian troops. Reinforcements soon arrived from Olynthus, and they launched a second attack on the Athenians. The Athenian hoplites could not come to grips with the enemy light troops or horsemen. Eventually the Athenians panicked and were routed, with all of their generals and 430 other men killed.

In the Athenian tribute list of 429/8 BC the only cities of Chalcidice are: Mende, Aphytis, Scione, Stageira and Acanthus (Athos). Acanthus and Mende had not even joined the Chalcidian League.

==Early stage==

When the phalanxes of the Chalcidians clashed with those of the Athenians, it was clear that the Athenians had a great advantage. The local Chalcidian hoplites made up the centre and right hand portions of the army while hired Peloponnesian forces made up the left side. The locals on the Chalcidian side gave way first, forcing the mercenaries to fall back as well. This left the Chalcidian army worn and strained, and the battle looked very promising for the Athenians.

==Later stage==

After the Chalcidian side was worn down by the Athenians, the Chalcidians were reinforced by troops sent from Olynthus. With the help of the troops from Olynthus, the Chalcidians rallied back against the Athenians much stronger than before. They had learned that the Athenians did not have the experience or equipment to defend against large numbers of javelins, so when they came back strengthened by their allies and with a new tactic, the Chalcidians forced the Athenians to retreat. As the Athenians retreated, Chalcidian cavalry and light infantry chased down the Athenians to inflict further damage upon them. The Athenians tried multiple counter-attacks to defend themselves from further harm, but each time the Chalcidians were able to evade the attacks. The back ranks of Athenian troops began to abandon those at the front, allowing them to be overwhelmed, surrounded, and killed, including their general, Xenophon.

==Statistics==

On the Athenian side of the battle were 2,000 hoplites, 200 cavalry, and around 500 light troops.

==Aftermath==
Between a fifth and a fourth of the Athenian troops were killed in this battle- twice as much as was expected prior to the battle. This brutal defeat showed Athens what would be required of them to win the war.

<doc id="406194" wikidata="Q285868" url="?curid=406194" title="William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley">
<text>William Page Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley, PC (29 November 1801 – 10 July 1881) was a British lawyer and statesman who served as a Liberal Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain between 1868 and 1872 in William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s first ministry.

==Background and education==
Wood was born in London, the second son of Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet, an alderman and Lord Mayor of London who became famous for befriending Queen Caroline and braving George IV. Sir Evelyn Wood and Katharine O&#x27;Shea were his nephew and niece respectively.

He was educated at Winchester College, from which he was expelled after a revolt against the headmaster, Woodbridge School, Geneva University, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow after being 24th wrangler in 1824.

==Legal and political career==
Wood entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and was called to the Bar in 1824, studying conveyancing in John Tyrrell&#x27;s chambers. He soon obtained a good practice as an equity draughtsman and before parliamentary committees. In 1845 he became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and in 1847 was elected to parliament for the city of Oxford as a Liberal. In 1849 he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster, and in 1851 was made Solicitor General for England and Wales and knighted, vacating the former position in 1852. When his party returned to power in 1853, he was raised to the bench as a Vice-Chancellor.

In 1854, Wood was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

In 1868 he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal, but before the end of the year was selected by Gladstone to be Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and was raised to the peerage as Baron Hatherley, of Down Hatherley in the County of Gloucester. He retired in 1872 owing to failing eyesight, but sat occasionally as a law lord.

==Family==
Wood married Charlotte, daughter of Edward Moor, in 1830. They had no children. Charlotte&#x27;s death in 1878 was a great blow to Wood, from which he never recovered, and he died in London on 10 July 1881, aged 79. Both are buried in the churchyard in Great Bealings, Suffolk, where Charlotte&#x27;s brother was rector. The title became extinct on his death.

<doc id="406196" wikidata="Q1351036" url="?curid=406196" title="Keith Godchaux">
<text>Keith Richard Godchaux (July 19, 1948 – July 23, 1980) was an American pianist best known for his tenure in the rock group the Grateful Dead from 1971 to 1979. Following their departure from the Dead, he and his wife Donna formed the Heart of Gold Band in 1980, but Godchaux died from injuries sustained in a car accident shortly after their first concert.

==Biography==
Godchaux was born in Seattle, Washington, and grew up in Concord, California, a regional suburban center within the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. He began piano lessons at age five at the instigation of his father (a semi-professional musician) and subsequently played Dixieland and cocktail jazz in professional ensembles as a teenager. According to Godchaux, &quot;I spent two years wearing dinner jackets and playing acoustic piano in country club bands and Dixieland groups...I also did piano bar gigs and put trios together to back singers in various places around the Bay Area...[playing] cocktail standards like &#x27;Misty&#x27; the way jazz musicians resentfully play a song that&#x27;s popular – that frustrated space... I just wasn&#x27;t into it... I was looking for something real to get involved with – which wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be music&quot;. He met and married former FAME Studios session vocalist Donna Jean Thatcher in November 1970; their son Zion, of the band BoomBox, was born in 1974.

The couple introduced themselves to Jerry Garcia at a concert in August 1971; coincidentally, ailing keyboardist/vocalist Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan (who would go on to play alongside Godchaux from December 1971 to June 1972) was unable to handle the rigors of the band&#x27;s next tour. At the time, Godchaux was largely supported by his wife and irregularly employed as a lounge pianist in Walnut Creek, California. While he was largely uninterested in the popular music of the era and eschewed au courant jazz rock in favor of modal jazz, bebop, and swing, several sources claim that he collaborated with such rock acts as Dave Mason and James and the Good Brothers, a Canadian trio acquainted with the Grateful Dead.

According to Godchaux, &quot;I first saw [the Grateful Dead] play with a bunch of my old lady&#x27;s friends, who were real Grateful Dead freaks. I went to a concert with them and saw something I didn&#x27;t know could be really happening... It was not like a mind-blowing far out, just a beautiful far out. Not exactly a choir of angels but some incredibly holy, pure and beautiful spiritual light. From then on, I was super turned-on that such a thing existed. This was about a year and a half ago, when I first met Donna... I knew I was related to them.&quot; He was also known to Betty Cantor-Jackson, a Grateful Dead sound engineer, who produced James and the Good Brothers&#x27; debut album in 1970.

Remembering their initial meeting, drummer Bill Kreutzmann writes, &quot;Then, around the same time that Pigpen entered the hospital, Jerry gave me a call telling me to get my ass down to the rehearsal space. He said there was a guy down there with him that I simply had to hear. Nobody else from the band was around, but almost immediately after I arrived, I knew that Jerry was right—this guy could really play piano.&quot;

Although the band had employed several other keyboardists (including Howard Wales, Merl Saunders and Ned Lagin) as session musicians to augment McKernan&#x27;s limited instrumental contributions following the departure of Tom Constanten in January 1970, Godchaux was invited to join the group as a permanent member in September 1971. He first performed publicly with the Dead on October 19, 1971, at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Northrup Auditorium.

After playing an upright piano and increasingly sporadic Hammond organ on the fall 1971 tour, Godchaux primarily played acoustic grand piano (including nine-foot Yamaha and Steinway instruments) at concerts from 1972 to 1974. Throughout this period, Godchaux&#x27;s rented pianos were outfitted with a state-of-the-art pickup system designed by Carl Countryman. According to sound engineer Owsley Stanley, &quot;The Countryman pickup worked by an electrostatic principle similar to the way a condenser mic works. It was charged with a very high voltage, and thus was very cantankerous to set up and use. It had a way of crackling in humid conditions and making other rather unmusical sounds if not set up just right, but when it worked it was truly brilliant.&quot; The control box also enabled Godchaux to use a wah-wah pedal with the instrument. He added a Fender Rhodes electric piano in mid-1973 and briefly experimented with the Hammond organ again on the band&#x27;s fall 1973 tour; the Rhodes piano would remain in his setup through 1976. Following the group&#x27;s extended touring hiatus, he continued to use contractually-stipulated nine-foot Steinways furnished by the band&#x27;s venues in 1976 and early 1977 before switching exclusively to the Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano in September 1977. The instrument&#x27;s unwieldy tuning partially contributed to the shelving of the band&#x27;s recordings of their 1978 engagement at the Giza Plateau for a planned live album.

Initially, Godchaux incorporated a richly melodic, fluid and boogie-woogie-influenced style that intuitively complemented the band&#x27;s improvisational approach to rock music; critic Robert Christgau characterized his playing as &quot;a cross between Chick Corea and Little Richard.&quot; According to Garcia in a 1980 interview with Mark Rowland conducted shortly before Godchaux&#x27;s death, &quot;Keith is one of those guys who is sort of an idiot savant of the piano. He’s an excellent pianist but he didn’t really have a concept of music, of how the piano fit in with the rest of the band. We were constantly playing records for him and so forth but that wasn’t his gift. His gift was the keyboard, the piano itself.&quot; Bassist Phil Lesh lauded his ability to &quot;fit perfectly in the spaces between [our] parts,&quot; while Bill Kreutzmann was inspired by his &quot;heart of music.&quot;

Increasingly frayed from the vicissitudes of the rock and roll lifestyle, Godchaux gradually became dependent upon various drugs, most notably alcohol and heroin. Throughout the late 1970s, he was frequently embroiled in violent domestic conflicts with Donna, who also developed an alcohol use disorder. Following the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1975 hiatus, he largely yielded to a simpler comping-based approach with the group that eschewed his previously contrapuntal style in favor of emulating or ballasting Garcia&#x27;s guitar parts. Despite occasional flirtations with synthesizers (most notably a Polymoog during the group&#x27;s spring 1977 tour), this tendency was foregrounded by the reintegration of second drummer Mickey Hart, resulting in a heavily percussive sound with little sustain beyond Garcia&#x27;s leads. However, Godchaux&#x27;s playing in the Jerry Garcia Band – which had fewer instrumentalists and hence a more &quot;open&quot; sound – retained more elements of his earlier work with the Grateful Dead during this period.

In early 1978, rhythm guitarist Bob Weir began to perform slide guitar parts with an eye toward variegating the group&#x27;s sound palette, with Weir concluding that &quot;desperation is the mother of invention.&quot; Garcia biographer Blair Jackson has also asserted that &quot;the quality of Keith’s playing in the Dead fell off in ’78 and early ’79. It no longer had that sparkle and imagination that marked his best work (’72–’74). Much of what he played in his last year was basic, blocky, chordal stuff. I don’t hear many wrong notes but he’s not exactly out there on the edge taking chances and pushing the others, as he frequently did, in his own quiet way, in his peak Grateful Dead years. I guess the worst thing you could say about later-period Keith is that he was just taking up sonic space in the Dead’s overall sound. Did this affect the others? No doubt, though it can’t be measured.&quot;

Eventually, according to Donna Jean Godchaux, &quot;Keith and I decided we wanted to get out and start our own group or something else – anything else. So we played that benefit concert at Oakland [2/17/79] and then a few days later there was a meeting at our house and it was brought up whether we should stay in the band anymore...and we mutually decided we&#x27;d leave.&quot; Keyboardist/vocalist Brent Mydland (who shared Godchaux&#x27;s suburban East Bay background) had been groomed as their replacement for nearly a year in the Bob Weir Band and made his Grateful Dead debut at San Jose State University&#x27;s Spartan Stadium on April 22, 1979.

During his tenure with the Dead, his only lead vocal and wholly original composition was &quot;Let Me Sing Your Blues Away,&quot; a collaboration with lyricist Robert Hunter released on &quot;Wake of the Flood&quot; (1973). It was performed live six times, all in 1973. He also contributed to two group compositions on &quot;Blues for Allah&quot; (1975). Keith and Donna Godchaux issued the mostly self-written &quot;Keith &amp; Donna&quot; album in 1975 with a core band including Garcia, Spooky Tooth bassist Chrissy Stewart and Wings drummer Denny Seiwell. The album was recorded at their home in Stinson Beach, California, where they lived in the 1970s. A touring iteration of the Keith &amp; Donna Band with Kreutzmann on drums and former Quicksilver Messenger Service equipment manager Stephen Schuster on saxophone frequently opened for Grateful Dead–related groups in 1975, allowing Garcia to sit in on several occasions. Following the dissolution of this ensemble, the Godchauxs performed as part of the Jerry Garcia Band from 1976 to 1978. &quot;Six Feet of Snow&quot;, a collaboration with Lowell George of Little Feat, was featured on the latter group&#x27;s &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; (1979); George had recently produced the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Shakedown Street&quot; (1978).

Following their departure from the Grateful Dead, the Godchauxs enjoyed an extended period of recuperation with their family in Alabama. He maintained a presence in the band&#x27;s extended orbit, returning intermittently to California to perform alongside Kreutzmann in the Healy-Treece Band (a venture for Dan Healy, the band&#x27;s longtime live audio engineer) and on at least one occasion with Hunter. He also formed The Ghosts (later rechristened The Heart of Gold Band) with his wife; this Bay Area-based aggregation eventually came to include a young Steve Kimock on guitar.

Godchaux sustained massive head injuries in an auto accident while being driven home on his birthday by noted tie-dye artist Courtenay Pollock (who was hosting the Godchauxs at his home in San Geronimo, California as they worked with their new band) in July 1980. Shortly before the accident, he professed to Pollock that he was &quot;the happiest I&#x27;ve ever felt in my life.&quot; He died at the age of 32 on July 23, 1980, four days after his birthday.

In 1994, he was inducted, posthumously, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.

== Legacy ==
According to Phil Lesh, some fans consider the years that Keith joined through the touring hiatus in 1974 to be the best years of the Grateful Dead. In his book he writes, &quot;Keith turned into a fire-breathing demon about halfway through the fall [1971] tour—not only following the band effortlessly through all our endlessly bifurcating highways and byways, but grabbing the ball and running with it, leading us into unknown regions and setting the stage for what many heads consider the peak years of the Grateful Dead. With Keith, we became the turbocharged turn-on-a-dime Grateful Dead that had only been hinted at before, but the music also became warmer and more organic, almost but not quite filling the hole Pig&#x27;s absence had left.&quot; Lesh has further clarified that, to him, the band was &quot;never quite the same&quot; after coming back from their touring hiatus in 1975.

Bill Kreutzmann writes about Keith, &quot;He was one of the best, if not the best, keyboardist that I’ve had the honor of playing with. The Grateful Dead have played with some really good ones over the years, like Bruce Hornsby and Brent Mydland, but this guy was just outrageous. He was really competent too, in that he could pick up whatever Jerry and I started playing that day, and just run with it. He didn’t need to know the material first. He could learn songs before he was even done hearing them for the first time. And he could play just about anything.&quot;

<doc id="406199" wikidata="Q259767" url="?curid=406199" title="Arthur M. Sackler Gallery">
<text>The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery is an art museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., focusing on Asian art. The Sackler Gallery and the Freer Gallery of Art together form the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States. The Freer and Sackler galleries house the largest Asian art research library in the country.

Founded in 1982, the Gallery is named after Arthur M. Sackler, who donated approximately 1,000 objects and $4 million to the building of the museum. Located on the south side of the National Mall, and being physically connected to the Freer Gallery of Art, 96% of the museum is located underground below the Enid A. Haupt Garden.

In 2018 the gallery was the target of protesters accusing the Sackler family of being a key contributor to the opioid epidemic in the United States.

==History==

Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ōhira visited the Freer Gallery of Art in 1979. During his visit, he announced that Japan would donate $1 million to the Smithsonian in order to assist in the building of an annex to the Freer to display Asian art. That same year, the United States Senate approved the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s request for $500,000 to build museums for Asian and African art on June 6. In June, 1980, the Smithsonian removed the South Quadrangle Project from their fiscal plan. The project resurfaced in 1981, and on December 23 Congress approved $960,000 for the new complex. It was the first time that federal funds were contributed to a project as unrestricted.

In 1982, Arthur M. Sackler donated around 1,000 Asian artworks and objects to the Smithsonian Institution. The collection was valued at $50 million. Along with the object donation, Sackler also provided $4 million to build a facility to house the objects, thus founding the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. The quadrangle construction began on June 22, 1982. An additional $36.5 million of federal money was appropriated to continue the project in October. Groundbreaking took place on June 21, 1983, with participation by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, then Vice President George H. W. Bush and Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley. On February 21, 1984, Milo C. Beach was declared scholarly director of the Sackler Gallery.

The gallery opened on September 28, 1987. Arthur Sackler died four months before the opening. In honor of the quadrangle complex&#x27;s opening, Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry declared the day &quot;Smithsonian Institution Day.&quot; Starting in October, Milo C. Beach served as acting director of both the Sackler and the Freer. In November 1988, he became director of both.

In March 2002, scholar in Islamic art Julian Raby was appointed director of the combined galleries. In 2006, J. Keith Wilson became the assistant director and curator of Chinese art.

In January, 2012, the Sackler celebrated the 30th anniversary of its founding with a gift of $5 million from Sackler&#x27;s widow.

==Architecture==

The Gallery is located in the Quadrangle Complex behind the Smithsonian Institution Castle. It shares the complex with the National Museum of African Art and the S. Dillon Ripley Center. The complex, which is 96% underground and covers , was designed by Jean Paul Carlhian, with the goal of connecting various underground buildings. Geometric forms, influenced by the Smithsonian Castle, the Arts and Industries Building and the Freer Gallery of Art, were used in the design, as was pink and gray granite representative of the color of those buildings. The Sackler Gallery is next to the Freer Gallery of Art. It is decorated with designs inspired by Islamic art. A granite pavilion was built in the Enid A. Haupt Victorian Garden to serve as an entrance to the facility. A fountain, shaped like a diamond, is located on the third and lowest floor, which can be viewed from the two upper levels. Construction of a tunnel between the Freer and Sackler was begun in early 1987 and completed in 1989. The sections of the Gallery open to the public cover .

==Exhibitions==

Exhibitions at the Gallery focus around Asian art and culture. In 1992, two exhibitions opened showcasing loaned and permanent collection objects: &quot;Metalwork and Ceramics from Ancient Iran&quot; and &quot;Buddhist and Jain Sculpture from South Asia.&quot; Both exhibitions followed renovations. The following year, &quot;Contemporary Porcelain from Japan,&quot; showcased 30 works by 30 Japanese artists, donated by the Japan Foundation. The first exhibition on Korean art took place in 1994, &quot;Korean Arts of the Eighteenth Century: Splendor and Simplicity.&quot; An exhibition about scholarly research and provenance called &quot;A Mughal Hunt&quot; was held in 1994. It showcased the research behind newly acquired Mughal Empire paintings. That same year, &quot;A Basketmaker of Rural Japan,&quot; was held. The exhibition showcased the work of Hiroshima Kazou and included works primarily on loan from the National Museum of Natural History.

In 1996, the Sackler hosted the oldest sculptures to be found in Western Asia. The sculptures, found in 1974 outside of Amman, Jordan, were sent to Washington, D.C., for research and conservation. The exhibition, &quot;Preserving Ancient Statues From Jordan,&quot; exhibited eight pieces dating from 6500 to 7000 B.C. &quot;King of the World: A Mughal Manuscript from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle&quot;, in 1997, exhibited the &quot;Padshahnama&quot; Mughal manuscript owned by the British Royal Family.

The Shahnama was on display in early 2011 in an exhibition curated by Islamic curator Massumeh Farhad, titled &quot;Shahnama: 1000 Years of the Persian Book of Kings.&quot; Photography was the focus of a fall 2011 exhibition focusing on a collection of photographs of Empress Dowager Cixi, taken by a diplomat&#x27;s son, Yu Xunling. The photographs were acquired by the Smithsonian after Xunling&#x27;s sister, Der Ling died in 1944 and a dealer sold the collection of 36 photographic plates. The Sackler exhibited only six objects in its December, 2011 exhibition &quot;Ancient Iranian Ceramics.&quot; The exhibit showcased pieces that are some 3,000 years old.

In 2011, the Sackler indefinitely postponed an exhibition of artifacts from the Belitung shipwreck owing to possible collecting violations by the commercial organization which acquired the objects. The exhibition was originally planned by the government of Singapore, which bought the objects for $32 million from a treasure hunting company.

The Gallery has also curated and hosted exhibitions about the Mesopotamian art collection of the Louvre, the paintings of Chang Dai-chien, and photographs of orientalism and colonialism in India. Contemporary artists exhibited have included Hai Bo and Ai Weiwei.

The Gallery also has a number rotating/temporary exhibits, which include:
* &quot;Yoga: The Art of Transformation&quot; (ending January 26, 2014)
* &quot;Chigusa and the Art of Tea&quot; (opening February 22, 2014)
* &quot;Kiyochika: Master of the Night&quot;, an exhibition showcasing Japanese artist Kobayashi Kiyochika (opening March 29, 2014)
* &quot;An American in London: Whistler and the Thames&quot;, an exhibition showcasing the work of American artist James McNeill Whistler (opening May 3, 2014)

A full list of all past, current, and future exhibitions can be found on the Freer|Sackler exhibitions page.

===Collections===

Aside from Sackler&#x27;s original donation of objects, the Gallery also holds other collections. General holdings at the Gallery include Chinese, Indian, Korean and Japanese paintings, photography, contemporary ceramics from China, 19th- and 20th-century Japanese prints, contemporary Japanese pottery, and other related Asian arts.

====Sackler Collection====

The founding collection, consisting of approximately 1,000 objects, was donated by gallery namesake, Arthur M. Sackler in 1987. The Sackler collection consists of ancient and contemporary pieces, ranging from Near Eastern metalware and ceramics, South and Southeast Asian sculpture, Chinese jade and bronze pieces, and Chinese lacquerware and paintings.

====Vever Collection====

In 1986 the Sackler acquired the Vever Collection, a collection of Persian and Islamic paintings and manuscripts collected by jeweler Henri Vever. Collected between 1900 and 1943, the Vever Collection features one of the finest groupings of Persian books. Upon acquisition, Glenn Lowry and Milo Beach were the first scholars in forty years to see the objects.

==Conservation==
The Department of Conservation and Scientific Research for both the Freer and Sackler Galleries was established as the first Smithsonian facility devoted to the use of scientific methods for the study of works of art and remains one of the few facilities in the United States that specializes in the conservation of Asian paintings.

Care of the collections began before the museums came into existence as Charles Lang Freer, the founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, hired Japanese painting restorers to care for his works and to prepare them for their eventual home as part of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1932, the Freer Gallery of Art hired a full-time Japanese restorer and established the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio. The Technical Laboratory, and the first use of scientific methods for the study of art at the Smithsonian Institution, started in 1951 when the chemist Rutherford J. Gettens moved from the Fogg Museum at Harvard University to the Freer. The East Asian Painting Conservation Studio and the Technical Laboratory merged in 1990 to form the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research.

Among the conservation projects that the Sackler Gallery has undertaken was a 2009 project where conservators used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to explore the &quot;fingerprints&quot; of ancient Chinese gold objects from the Gallery.

===Scholarship===
The Sackler presents lectures and symposia to the public with the Freer has copublished the art historical journal Artibus Asiae with the Museum Rietberg in Zürich since 1991.

The Freer and Sackler, along with the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan, presents the Shimada Prize for distinguished scholarship in the history of East Asian art. The award was established in 1992 in honor of Professor Shimada Shujiro, by the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and by The Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan. In addition, the Sackler is able to exchange objects with other institutions (which the adjacent Freer Gallery of Art is prohibited from). Several fellowships are also available to support graduate students and visiting scholars, including the Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship, Anne Van Biema Fellowship (Japanese Visual Arts), Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) Fellowship (Persian art), Lunder Fellowship, J. S. Lee Memorial Fellowship (Chinese Art), Smithsonian Institution Fellowship, and the Freer Fellowship.

===Outreach===

The Sackler has hosted a variety of celebrations and ongoing events revolving around Asian art and culture. In 1989, the Gallery hosted its first series of events, a two-month-long celebration of Persian art and culture sponsored in collaboration with the Foundation for Iranian Studies. Musician Dariush Dolat-shahi performed and workshops, lectures and other performances took place. Events often coincide with the theme of exhibitions. In 2011, Azar Nafisi and Dick Davis discussed the role of women in the Shahnameh in conjunction with an exhibition on the 1,000-year-old Persian poem.

===Initiatives===

Together, alongside the Freer and the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Studies of Kyoto, the Sackler created the Shimada Prize. The biannual $10,000 prize awards scholars of East Asian art. In 2011, the Sackler and the Freer received a major gift from donor Jahangir Amuzegar. The gift created two endowments, one for a yearly celebration of the Persian holiday of Nowruz and another to build a collection of and celebrate contemporary Iranian art. It was the largest Persian focused gift to be given to the Sackler and Freer and one of the largest Asian art donations ever given to the Smithsonian.

<text>Louis Lartet (1840 – 1899) was a French geologist and paleontologist. He discovered the original Cro-Magnon skeletons.

Louis Lartet was born in Castelnau-Magnoac, in Seissan in the &quot;département&quot; of Gers. His father, Édouard Lartet was a prominent geologist and prehistorian who played a key role in the 1860s and 1870s in finding evidence that humans had lived during the Quaternary period and Louis continued his father&#x27;s researches into human prehistory. He became a member of the Société géologique de France (Geological Society of France) in 1863 and joined the expedition organized by the Duke of Luynes to explore Palestine. This resulted in his publication of Exploration géologique de la mer Morte (1876-7), which formed his doctoral thesis. In 1868, Lartet was asked to conduct excavations in a rock shelter near the French village of Les Eyzies after workmen stumbled upon extinct animal bones, flint tools, and human skulls. Lartet discovered the partial skeletons of four prehistoric adults and one infant along with perforated shells used as ornaments, an object made from ivory, and worked reindeer antler. These Cro-magnon humans were soon identified as a new prehistoric human race distinct from the Neanderthal man fossils discovered in Germany in 1856.

Lartet began teaching geology at the University of Toulouse in 1873 and in 1879 he became a tenured professor of geology at the university. He became a member of the Société archéologique du midi de la France in 1879, the Société d&#x27;agriculture in 1880; the Académie des sciences in 1882 and the Société d&#x27;histoire naturelle in 1882.

<doc id="406203" wikidata="Q379240" url="?curid=406203" title="White-breasted nuthatch">
<text>The white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) is a species of bird in the nuthatch family Sittidae. It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring approximately in length. Coloration varies somewhat along the species&#x27; range, but the are light blue-gray, with a black and nape in males, while females have a dark gray crown. The are whitish, with a reddish tinge on the lower abdomen. Despite not being closely related, the white-breasted nuthatch and the white wagtail are very similar in plumage. 

The white-breasted nuthatch is a noisy bird. It has a nasal voice and often utters little cries or vocalizations, often composed of repetitions of small invariant whistles. In summer, it is an exclusively insectivorous bird, consuming a wide range of arthropods, but in winter its diet consists mainly of seeds. The nest is located in the cavity of a tree. The clutch consists of five to nine eggs, incubated for two weeks by the female, who is fed by the male. The two adults then feed the young until they fledge, and for a few weeks after that.

The white-breasted nuthatch breeds throughout much of North America, except in the cooler and drier areas. It is mainly found at low elevations, in deciduous forests or in mixed woodlands. Seven to nine subspecies are generally distinguished by their slightly distinct distributions, vocalizations, and coloration. The species was once thought to be related to the white-cheeked nuthatch (&quot;S  leucopsis&quot;) and Przewalski&#x27;s nuthatch (&quot;S. przewalskii&quot;), two species from southern Asia, but is actually more closely related to the giant nuthatch (&quot;S. magna&quot;), also from Southeast Asia. 

== Taxonomy ==
The nuthatches are a genus, &quot;Sitta&quot;, of small passerine birds which derive their English name from the tendency of some species to wedge large insects or seeds into cracks, and then hack at them with their strong bills. &quot;Sitta&quot; is derived from , Ancient Greek for nuthatch, and &quot;carolinensis&quot; means &quot;of Carolina&quot; in Latin. The white-breasted nuthatch was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in his 1790 work, the &quot;Index Ornithologicus&quot;. German ornithologist Hans Edmund Wolters proposed the division of the genus &quot;Sitta&quot; into subgenera in 1975–1982. The white-breasted nuthatch is placed in &quot;Sitta&quot; (&quot;Leptositta&quot;) , alongside the white-cheeked nuthatch (&quot;S. leucopsis&quot;) and Przewalski&#x27;s nuthatch (&quot;S. przewalskii&quot;).

Nuthatch taxonomy is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The white-breasted nuthatch has an appearance and contact call similar to those of the white-cheeked nuthatch, of the Himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it. A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species&#x27; lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the giant nuthatch (&quot;S. magna&quot;) than to Przewalski&#x27;s nuthatch, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; Przewalski&#x27;s nuthatch turned out to be basal in the family.

The simplified cladogram below is based on the phylogenetic analysis of Packert and colleagues (2014):

== Description ==
The white-breasted nuthatch is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring about in length. Like other members of its genus, it has a large head, short tail, short wings, a powerful bill and strong feet; it is long, with a wingspan of and a weight of .

The adult male of the nominate subspecies, &quot;S. c. carolinensis&quot;, has pale blue-gray , a glossy black cap ( of the head), and a black band on the upper back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.

The female has, on average, a narrower black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably distinguished from the male in the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% in the Rocky Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles are similar to the adult, but duller plumaged.

Three other, significantly smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, but none has white plumage completely surrounding the eye. Further distinctions are that the red-breasted nuthatch has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the brown-headed and pygmy nuthatches each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.

=== Geographical variation ===
The white-breasted nuthatch has nine subspecies, although the differences are small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in morphology, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions. The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern &quot;S. c. carolinensis&quot; has the palest back. The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls of the three groups differ, as described above.

===Similar species===
Only three other species of nuthatches inhabit North America: the red-breasted nuthatch (&quot;S. canadensis&quot;), the pygmy nuthatch (&quot;S. pygmaea&quot;) and the brown-headed nuthatch (&quot;S. pusilla&quot;), and their distributions overlap with those of the white-breasted nuthatch. They are, however, clearly distinct and much smaller, since they are the smallest nuthatches, measuring 10 centimeters long and weighing around 10 grams. The red-breasted nuthatch has reddish underparts and has a black stripe on the eye. The pygmy nuthatch and the brown-headed nuthatch have a brown crown with a white spot on the nape.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The breeding habitat of the white-breasted nuthatch is woodland across North America, from southern Canada to northern Florida and southern Mexico. In the eastern part of its range, its preferred habitat is old-growth open deciduous or mixed forest, including orchards, parks, suburban gardens and cemeteries; it is found mainly in the lowlands, although it breeds at elevation in Tennessee. In the west and Mexico, the white-breasted nuthatch is found in open montane pine-oak woodlands, and nesting occurs at up to elevation in Nevada, California and Mexico. Pinyon-juniper and riverside woodlands may be used locally where available. The white-breasted nuthatch is the only North American nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees; red-breasted, pygmy and brown-headed nuthatches prefer pines.

The presence of mature or decaying trees with holes suitable for nesting is essential, and trees such as oak, beech and hickory are favored in the east since they also provide edible seeds. White-breasted nuthatches seldom excavate their own nest holes like red-breasted nuthatches. Although suitable habitat is distributed continentally, it is discontinuous. The separate populations of this non-migratory species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies.

The white-breasted nuthatch, like most of its genus, is non-migratory, and the adults normally stay in their territory year-round. There may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high reproductive success in some years, and this species has occurred as a vagrant to Vancouver Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Bermuda. One bird landed on the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; six hours&#x27; sailing east of New York City in October 1963.

== Ecology and behavior ==
The white-breasted nuthatch often travels with small mixed flocks in winter. These flocks are led by titmice and chickadees, with nuthatches and downy woodpeckers as common attendant species. Participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance. It is likely that the attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees&#x27; calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly.

=== Breeding ===
The white-breasted nuthatch is monogamous, and pairs form following a courtship in which the male bows to the female, spreading his tail and drooping his wings while swaying back and forth; he also feeds her morsels of food. The pair establish a territory of in woodland, and up to in semi-wooded habitats, and then remain together year-round until one partner dies or disappears. The nest cavity is usually a natural hole in a decaying tree, sometimes an old woodpecker nest.

The nest hole is usually high in a tree and is lined with fur, fine grass, and shredded bark. The clutch is 5 to 9 eggs which are creamy-white, speckled with reddish brown, and average in size. The eggs are incubated by the female for 13 to 14 days prior to hatching, and the altricial chicks fledge in a further 18 to 26 days. Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and for about two weeks after fledging, and the male also feeds the female while she is incubating. Once independent, juveniles leave the adults&#x27; territory and either establish their own territory or become &quot;floaters&quot;, unpaired birds without territories. It is probably these floaters which are mainly involved in the irregular dispersals of this species. This species of nuthatch roosts in tree holes or behind loose bark when not breeding and has the unusual habit of removing its feces from the roost site in the morning. It usually roosts alone except in very cold weather, when up to 29 birds have been recorded together.

=== Voice ===

Like other nuthatches, the white-breasted nuthatch is a noisy bird with a range of vocalizations. The male&#x27;s mating song is a rapid nasal &quot;qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui&quot;. The contact call between members of a pair, given most frequently in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky &quot;nit&quot;, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill &quot;kri&quot; repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement &quot;kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri&quot;; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster &quot;yididitititit&quot; call, and Pacific birds a more nasal &quot;beeerf&quot;.

=== Feeding ===
The white-breasted nuthatch forages along tree trunks and branches in a similar way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.

The white-breasted nuthatch is omnivorous, eating insects and seeds. It places large food items such as acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees. The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects consumed by the white-breasted nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as pine weevils, oystershell and other scale insects, and jumping plant lice. This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and sunflower seeds, the last of which it often takes away to store. The white-breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines in order to find seeds.

=== Predators and parasites ===
Predators of adult nuthatches include owls and diurnal birds of prey (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper&#x27;s hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and climbing snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making &quot;hn-hn&quot; calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of the white-breasted nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.

The white-breasted nuthatch&#x27;s responses to predators may be linked to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.

The white-breasted nuthatch can be a host for certain parasites such as the protists &quot;Leucocytozoon&quot; or &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;. The white-breasted nuthatch is the typical host of another protist species, &quot;Haemoproteus sittae&quot;. Trematodes, such as &quot;Collyriclum faba&quot;, have also been recorded in this species. The white-breasted nuthatch can also be the target of hematophagous flies of the family Hippoboscidae, such as &quot;Ornithoica confluenta&quot; and &quot;Ornithomya anchineuria&quot; or of certain mites, such as &quot;Knemidokoptes jamaicensis&quot;, which produces scabies.

== Conservation status ==
The white-breasted nuthatch is a common species with a large range, estimated at . Its total population is estimated at 10 million individuals, and there is evidence of an overall population increase, so it is not believed to approach either the size criterion (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals) or the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the IUCN Red List. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The removal of dead trees from forests may cause problems locally for this species because it requires cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington state, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest. The white-breasted nuthatch is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) are all signatories.

<text>Carl Richard Jacobi (July 10, 1908 – August 25, 1997) was an American journalist and writer. He wrote short stories in the horror and fantasy genres for the pulp magazine market, appearing in such pulps of the bizarre and uncanny as &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Strange Stories&quot;. He also wrote stories crime and adventure which appeared in such pulps as &quot;Thrilling Adventures&quot;, &quot;Complete Stories&quot;, &quot;Top-Notch&quot;, &quot;Short Stories&quot;,&quot; The Skipper&quot;, &quot;Doc Savage&quot; and &quot;Dime Adventures Magazine&quot;. Jacobi also produced some science fiction, mainly space opera, published in such magazines as &quot;Planet Stories&quot;. He was one of the last surviving pulp-fictioneers to have contributed to the legendary American horror magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; during its &quot;glory days&quot; (the 1920s and 1930s). His stories have been translated into French, Swedish, Danish, Russian and Dutch.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Jacobi was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1908 and lived there throughout his life. He was a lifelong bachelor. He was a voracious reader at an early age, reading Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells as well as the Frank Merriwell and Tom Swift boys&#x27; adventure yarns. Jacobi was always a writer; at his junior high school he earned good pocket-money concocting his own &#x27;dime novels&#x27; (short story booklets) and selling them to fellow students as 10 cents-a-piece.

Jacobi attended the University of Minnesota from 1927 to 1930, majoring in English Literature, where he began his writing career in campus magazines and was an undergraduate classmate of Donald Wandrei. He wrote of this period on &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; (June 1939) that &quot;I tried to divide my time between rhetoric courses and the geology lab. As an underclassman I was somewhat undecided whether future life would find me studying rocks and fossils or simply pounding a typewriter. The typewriter won.&quot; Jacobi&#x27;s first stories were published while he was at the university. Long before graduation he made his first professional sale, a short detective tale, &quot;Rumbling Cannon&quot;, to &quot;Secret Service Stories.&quot; This ought to have paid around fifty dollars but Jacobi received nothing since the pulp folded soon after the story was published. The last of the stories he published while at university, &quot;Moss Island&quot;, was a graduate&#x27;s contribution to &quot;The Quest&quot; of Central High School, and &quot;Mive&quot; (which won a college-wide contest judged by Margaret Culkin Banning), published in the University of Minnesota&#x27;s &quot;The Minnesota Quarterly&quot;. Both stories were later sold to &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (Winter 1932) and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; respectively and marked his debut in professional magazines. &quot;Mive&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, 1932) brought him payment of 25 dollars. &quot;Mive&quot; was praised by H. P. Lovecraft in his letter to Jacobi of February 27, 1932: &quot;Mive please me immensely, and I told Wright that I was glad to see at least one story whose weirdness of incident was made convincing by adequate emotional preparation and suitably developed atmosphere.&quot; Lovecraft commended Jacobi&#x27;s work to Derleth and thereby helped set up the long-term relationship Arkham House would have with Jacobi.

Beginning in 1928, Jacobi corresponded with adventure-pulp veteran Arthur O. Friel.

Jacobi&#x27;s early story &quot;The Monument&quot; (1932) was submitted only once—to Farnsworth Wright of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. It was not submitted subsequently but was discovered in a filing cabinet when R. Dixon Smith was researching his biography &quot;Lost in the Rentharpian Hills: Spanning the Decades with Carl Jacobi&quot; (1985) and finally saw print when included by Smith in &quot;Smoke of the Snake&quot; (1994).

=== 1930s===

Jacobi joined the editorial staff of &quot;The Minnesota Quarterly&quot;, and after graduation in 1931, he became a news reporter, reviewer and sub-editor for the &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot;, as well as a frequent reviewer of books and plays. He also served on the staff of the &quot;Minnesota Ski-U-Mah&quot;, a campus humor magazine (described on the jackets of Jacobi&#x27;s books as &#x27;a scholastic publication&#x27;). After a while regular hours palled, and he left the &quot;Star&quot;, renting an office in uptown Minneapolis in which were typewriter, paper, a few reference books, and a list of editorial addresses in New York.

Jacobi met August Derleth in January 1931 when Derleth was visiting Minneapolis to see Donald Wandrei. Jacobi had read Derleth&#x27;s stories in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and his Solar Pons stories in &quot;Dragnet&quot; and asked to be introduced; they met together, and with Donald Wandrei, for a literary roundtable at Minneapolis&#x27; Rainbow Cafe. Though Derleth and Jacobi corresponded for 40 years thereafter, Jacobi saw him but a few times in St Paul and never visited Derleth&#x27;s home of Sauk City, Wisconsin. Over the following summer, when Derleth worked briefly as an editor for Fawcett Publications, outside Minneapolis, the three men frequently got together for brainstorming sessions.

Jacobi owned his own private retreat, a cabin at Minnewashta in the Carver country outlands of Minneapolis. His intimate familiarity with the terrain and environment there provided the setting for many of his most distinguished stories.

From 1932 until Jacobi&#x27;s death in 1997, pulp writer Hugh B. Cave corresponded with Jacobi. Scores of their letters are quoted in Cave&#x27;s memoir &quot;Magazines I Remember&quot; (Chicago: Tattered Pages Press, 1994), though many of Jacobi&#x27;s early letters to Cave were lost in a fire in the early 1970s, along with copies of all Cave&#x27;s early stories. Jacobi and Cave often criticised and improved each other&#x27;s stories.

Jack Adrian writes:

In the depression years of the early 1930s, the pulp-writer needed as formidable a creative armoury as possible, along with a certain amount of luck, and cunning, to crack even the lowest paying markets. Jacobi had a useful knack for dreaming up memorable milieu against which to set his tales, and bizarre situations that stayed in the mind long after the magazine the story itself was in had been finished and tossed away. He may have been the only writer ever to have a story firmly rejected by the redoubtable &quot;Weird Tales&quot; editor Farnsworth Wright, only to have Wright, weeks later, begging for the story back, because an incident in it had stuck in his mind. This was &quot;Revelations in Black&quot;, a chilling, and much-reprinted, vampire tale set in an old stone farmhouse outside of Minneapolis Jacobi had driven past one night (the house&#x27;s eerie statue-lined garden, as seen by brilliant moonlight, had caught his eye and his imagination.

Jacobi wrote scores of tales for all the best-known magazines of fantasy and science fiction and was represented in numerous anthologies of imaginative fiction published in the United States, England and New Zealand. His stories were translated into French, Swedish, Danish and Dutch. Many of his tales were published in anthologies edited by Derleth, and Arkham House published his first three short story collections. Stories also appeared in such magazines as &quot;Short Stories&quot;, &quot;Railroad Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;, &quot;MacLean&#x27;s magazine&quot;, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, &quot;Strange Stories&quot;, &quot;Thrilling Mystery&quot;, &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, &quot;Complete Stories&quot;, &quot;Top-Notch&quot; and others. Though best known for his macabre fiction, Jacobi also wrote science fiction, weird-menace yarns and adventure stories.

Already by 1935, Jacobi was seeing a greater percentage of rejected stories. Pressed by financial problems and the need to help his parents survive the Depression, he took a $50 a week job as a continuity writer for the local radio station where he stayed until 1940.

Jacobi was fascinated by adventure tales with a Southeast Asia setting, particularly in regard to Dutch central Borneo and the Maritime Southeast Asia. Jacobi wrote to officials working in Southeast Asia to obtain details for his stories, and he had considerable knowledge of that background in his fiction. According to Jack Adrian, &quot;He would write to those in charge of far-flung outposts deep in the heart of the Borneo jungle, say, demanding geographical detail, obscure ethnic lore, atmospheric and forestall conditions; anything, in short, you couldn&#x27;t get out of a book. This way he became an acknowledged expert in a field he had created himself, at the same time inventing whole new fiction subgenres, such as &quot;Borneo terror tale&quot;, &quot;New Guinea adventure&quot; and so on. Later he turned the same trick with Baluchistan.

In 1939, Jacobi met writer Clifford D. Simak when Simak moved to Minneapolis to take a job with the Minneapolis &quot;Star&quot;; they became friends. At this time, Jacobi listed his hobbies as &quot;studying the night sky with a 60 power glass; continuing contacts with friends now located in jumping off spots of the South Seas and Malaysia; and collecting old tobacco tins.&quot;

=== 1940s and 1950s===

In 1940–41, Jacobi served as editor of &quot;Midwest Media&quot;, an advertising and radio trade journal. He then spent some years as a reporter, and reviewer of books and plays, for the Minneapolis &quot;Star&quot;. He worked for them for many years, writing fiction on the side. Following this, he &quot;travelled a spell; fooled about with telegraphy, both wireless and Morse for another spell; then turned to writing fiction full-time.&quot;

At the time of the compilation of &quot;Revelations in Black&quot; (1947), Jacobi&#x27;s first collection, Jacobi was at work on a novel, but it is unknown whether this was completed.

Jacobi continued to sell stories to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; up through the 1950s, with that market taking eighteen of his stories in all.

When the pulp markets collapsed, Jacobi took regular employment with one of the Honeywell defense plants as an electronics inspector, a job he had through WWII and beyond, while writing part-time. He worked the night shift at Honeywell seven days a week, which had a severe effect on both his writing schedule and his health, leading to heart problems.

=== 1960s===

1964 saw the publication of Jacobi&#x27;s second collection of weird fiction, &quot;Portraits in Moonlight&quot;, and several short stories published in magazines.

=== 1970s and 1980s===

In 1972, Arkham House published Jacobi&#x27;s third collection of weird fiction, &quot;Disclosures in Scarlet&quot;. Don Herron, writing in Jack Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural&quot;, calls Jacobi&#x27;s 1972 story &quot;The Unpleasantness at Carver House&quot; his masterpiece – &quot;a ghoulish tale of horror and madness that may rank with the best work of Robert Aickman and Walter de la Mare in its brilliant use of suggestion. A feeling of unease pervades the story, and its many macabre implications prey on the imagination long after the last sentence is read.&quot;

In 1973, Jacobi attended the science-fiction convention Torcon II 31st World Science Fiction Convention, held in Canada, having been persuaded to attend by literary agent Kirby McCauley. There he met such figures as J. Vernon Shea and Robert Bloch. In the same year, &quot;Etchings and Odysseys&quot; magazine was launched in Minneapolis by Kirby McCauley, John Koblas, Eric Carlson, Joe West and others. Jacobi attended the launch, along with Mary Elizabeth Counselman, who had frequently appeared in the pages of the same magazines as Jacobi. Jacobi also met E. Hoffman Price (visiting from the West) at both Donald Wandrei&#x27;s home and at &quot;Etchings and Odysseys&quot; &#x27;headquarters&#x27;. Koblas had come to know Jacobi much earlier, and received encouraging criticism from Jacobi on his manuscripts. Jacobi also came much in contact with poet and novelist Richard L. Tierney, a Twin Cities resident for nine years during the 1970s. During this period, however, Jacobi had suffered a stroke which left one side of his body paralysed and gave him a speech impediment.

1980 saw a collection of Jacobi&#x27;s stories published in French, under the title &quot;Les ecarlates&quot;. In 1989 appeared a collection of all-reprint adventure stories from the pulps, &quot;East of Samarinda&quot;. In the late 1980s, Robert M. Price&#x27;s Cryptic Publications published a number of obscure Jacobi stories in such magazines as &quot;Astro-Adventures&quot;, &quot;Pulp Stories&quot;, &quot;Pulse-Pounding Adventure Stories&quot; and &quot;Shudder Stories&quot;.

Jacobi continued to write macabre stories in the 1970s and 1980s. Many are collected in his final volume, &quot;The Smoke of the Snake&quot; (1994). His last published story, &quot;A Quire of Foolscap&quot; (&quot;Whispers&quot;, Oct 1987) contains an in-joke: an unfaithful wife and her lover check into a motel &quot;out on Carcosa&quot;, an obvious reference to both Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;An Inhabitant of Carcosa&quot; and Robert W. Chambers&#x27; &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, as well as affectionate praise for Karl Edward Wagner&#x27;s newly established publishing firm (see Carcosa).

===Later life and death===

Debilitating illness crippled Jacobi during the final half-decade of his life, although his literary agent and biographer R. Dixon Smith did much to alleviate his various afflictions.

Jacobi died at St Louis Park, Minnesota on August 25, 1997.

A memorial for him was held at the Arcana (convention) 27, Sept 26–28, 1997 at the Holiday Inn Express Bandana Square, Minneapolis.

===Critical reception===

Fritz Leiber wrote about Jacobi: &quot;his best tales surely include &quot;Mive&quot;, &quot;Carnaby&#x27;s Fish&quot;, &quot;Revelations in Black&quot;, &quot;Moss Island&quot;, &quot;Portrait in Moonlight&quot;, &quot;The Lo Prello Paper&quot;, &quot;The Aquarium&quot;, &quot;The Singleton Barrier&quot;...and &quot;The Unpleasantness at Carver House&quot;.

Writer Don Herron has stated &quot;Jacobi has a genuine bent for original, gruesome invention equal to the best writers who emerged from &quot;Weird Tales.&quot;&quot; Herron also said &quot;Jacobi&#x27;s finest stories have an exquisitely creepy quality from first paragraph to last&quot; and described the story &quot;The Unpleasantness at Carver House&quot; as &quot;Jacobi&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;.

<doc id="406210" wikidata="Q518779" url="?curid=406210" title="Leo Ryan">
<text>Leo Joseph Ryan Jr. (May 5, 1925 – November 18, 1978) was an American teacher and Democratic Party politician who represented California&#x27;s 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1973 until his assassination hours before the Jonestown massacre in 1978. Before that, he served in the California State Assembly, representing the state&#x27;s 27th district.

After the 1965 Watts riots, Ryan took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the Los Angeles area. In 1970, he launched an investigation into California prisons. While presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform, he used a pseudonym to enter Folsom State Prison as an inmate. During his time in Congress, Ryan traveled to Newfoundland to investigate the practice of seal hunting. He was also known for his vocal criticism of the lack of congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and co-authored the Hughes–Ryan Amendment, passed in 1974, which requires the president of the United States to report covert CIA activity to Congress.

In 1978, Ryan traveled to Guyana to investigate claims that people were being held against their will at the Peoples Temple Jonestown settlement. He was shot and killed at an airstrip on November 18, as he and his party were attempting to leave. Shortly after the airstrip shootings, 909 members of the Jonestown settlement died in a mass murder–suicide by drinking cyanide-laced Flavor Aid. Ryan was the second sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives to be assassinated in office, after James M. Hinds in 1868.

Ryan was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1983.

== Early life and education ==
Leo Joseph Ryan Jr. was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. During his early life, his family moved frequently, through Illinois, Florida, New York, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts. Ryan graduated from Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 1943. He then received V-12 officer training at Bates College and served with the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 as a submariner.

Ryan graduated from Nebraska&#x27;s Creighton University with a B.A. in 1949 and an M.S. in 1951. He served as a teacher, school administrator and South San Francisco city councilman from 1956 to 1962. He taught English at Capuchino High School, and chaperoned the marching band in 1961 to Washington, D.C., to participate in President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural parade. Ryan was inspired by Kennedy&#x27;s call to service in his inaugural address and decided to run for higher office.

==Career==
===State of California===
In 1962 Ryan was elected mayor of South San Francisco. He served less than a year before being elected to the California State Assembly, winning the 27th district race by 20,000 votes. He had run for the Assembly&#x27;s 25th district in 1958, but lost to Republican Louis Francis. Ryan served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1964 and 1968 and held his Assembly seat until 1972, when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected three times.

Ryan aide Jackie Speier, who later served in Congress, described Ryan&#x27;s style of investigation as &quot;experiential legislating&quot;. After the Watts riots of 1965, Ryan went to the area and took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions there. In 1970, using a pseudonym, Ryan had himself arrested, detained, and strip-searched to investigate conditions in California&#x27;s prisons. He stayed for ten days as an inmate at Folsom State Prison while presiding as chairman on the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform.

As a California assemblyman, Ryan also chaired legislative subcommittee hearings and presided over hearings involving Tom Lantos, his eventual successor in the House. Ryan pushed through significant educational policies and authored what came to be known as the Ryan Act, which established an independent regulatory commission to monitor educational credentialing in California.

===United States Congress===
During his time in Congress, Ryan went to Newfoundland with James Jeffords to investigate the inhumane killing of seals, and became famous for his vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), authoring the Hughes–Ryan Amendment, which would have required extensive CIA notification of Congress about covert operations. Ryan once told Dick Cheney that leaking a state secret was an appropriate way for a member of Congress to block an &quot;ill-conceived operation&quot;. He supported Patty Hearst, and along with Senator S. I. Hayakawa, delivered Hearst&#x27;s application for a presidential commutation to the Pardon Attorney.

==Peoples Temple==
===First investigations===

In 1978, reports of widespread abuse and human rights violations in Jonestown at the Peoples Temple, led by cult leader Jim Jones, began to filter out of its Guyana enclaves. Ryan was friends with the father of former Temple member Bob Houston, whose mutilated body was found near train tracks on October 5, 1976, three days after a taped telephone conversation with Houston&#x27;s ex-wife in which they discussed his leaving the Temple. Ryan&#x27;s interest was further aroused by the custody battle between the leader of a &quot;Concerned Relatives&quot; group, Timothy Stoen, and Jones following a Congressional &quot;white paper&quot; by Stoen detailing the events. Ryan was one of 91 congressmen to write Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham on Stoen&#x27;s behalf.

After reading an article in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, Ryan declared his intention to go to Jonestown, an agricultural commune in Guyana where Jones and roughly 1,000 Temple members resided. His decision was also influenced both by the Concerned Relatives group, which consisted primarily of Californians, as did the Temple, and by his own distaste for social injustice. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, while he investigated, the United States Department of State &quot;repeatedly stonewalled Ryan&#x27;s attempts to find out what was going on in Jonestown&quot; and told him that &quot;everything was fine&quot;.

The State Department characterized possible United States government action in Guyana against Jonestown as a potential &quot;legal controversy&quot;, but Ryan at least partially rejected this viewpoint. In a later article in &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, Ryan was described as having &quot;bucked the local Democratic establishment and the Jimmy Carter administration&#x27;s State Department&quot; in order to prepare for his own investigation.

===Travel to Jonestown===

In November 1978, Ryan led an investigative delegation to Jonestown as part of a government investigation, with governmental permission and funding, in his role as chair of a congressional subcommittee with jurisdiction over U.S. citizens living in foreign countries. He asked the other members of the Bay Area congressional delegation to join him on the trip to Jonestown, but they all declined. Ryan also invited his friend, Indiana Congressman and future Vice President Dan Quayle, who had served with Ryan on the Government Operations Committee, but Quayle was unable to go.

The investigative group was initially to consist only of press and a few members of Ryan&#x27;s staff, but once the media learned of the trip the entourage ballooned to include, among others, concerned relatives of Temple members. Ryan traveled to Jonestown with 17 Bay Area relatives of Peoples Temple members, several newspaper reporters and an NBC TV team. When Jones&#x27;s legal counsel attempted to impose restrictive conditions on the visit, Ryan responded that he would go to Jonestown whether Jones permitted it or not. Ryan&#x27;s stated position was that a &quot;settlement deep in the bush might be reasonably run on authoritarian lines&quot; but that its residents must be allowed to come and go as they pleased. He further asserted that if the place had become &quot;a gulag&quot;, he would do everything he could to &quot;free the captives.&quot;

On November 14, Ryan left Washington and arrived in Georgetown, the capital of Guyana, from Jonestown, with his congressional delegation of government officials, media representatives and some members of the &quot;Concerned Relatives.&quot;

That night the delegation stayed at a local hotel where, despite confirmed reservations, most of the rooms had been canceled and reassigned, leaving the delegation to sleep in the lobby. For three days, Ryan continued to negotiate with Jones&#x27;s legal counsel and held perfunctory meetings with embassy personnel and Guyanese officials.

While in Georgetown, Ryan visited the Temple&#x27;s Georgetown headquarters in the suburb of Lamaha Gardens. He asked to speak to Jones by radio. Sharon Amos, the highest-ranking Temple member present, told Ryan that he could not, because his visit was unscheduled. On November 17, Ryan&#x27;s aide Jackie Speier (who became a Congresswoman in 2008), the United States embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Richard Dwyer, a Guyanese Ministry of Information officer, nine journalists, and four Concerned Relatives representatives of the delegation boarded a small plane for the flight to Port Kaituma Airport, a few miles outside of Jonestown.

At first, only the Temple legal counsel was allowed off the plane, but eventually the entire entourage, including Gordon Lindsay, reporting for NBC, was allowed in. Initially, the group was warmly welcomed, but Temple member Vernon Gosney handed NBC correspondent Don Harris (mistaking him for Ryan) a note that read &quot;Vernon Gosney and (Temple member) Monica Bagby: please help us get out of Jonestown.&quot; Jones was made aware of the note, and Gosney tried and failed to impress upon Ryan the extreme danger that his delegation was now in.

That night the media and the delegation returned to the airfield for accommodations after Jones refused to let them stay the night. The rest of the group remained. The next morning, Ryan, Speier, and Dwyer continued their interviews, and met a woman who secretly expressed her wish to leave Jonestown with her family and another family. Around 11:00 a.m., the media and the delegation returned and took part in interviewing Peoples Temple members. Around 3:00 p.m., 14 Temple defectors, and Larry Layton posing as a defector, boarded a truck and were taken to the airstrip, with Ryan wishing to stay another night to assist any others who wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, a knife attack on Ryan failed while he was arbitrating a family dispute on leaving. Against Ryan&#x27;s protests, Dwyer ordered Ryan to leave, but he promised to return later to address the dispute.

===Jungle ambush and assassination===
The entire group left Jonestown and arrived at the Kaituma airstrip by 4:45 p.m. Their exit transport planes, a twin-engine Otter and a Cessna, did not arrive until 5:10 p.m. The smaller six-seat Cessna was taxiing to the end of the runway when one of its occupants, Larry Layton, opened fire on those inside, wounding several.

Concurrently, several other Peoples Temple members who had escorted the group out began to open fire on the transport plane, killing Ryan, three journalists and a defecting Temple member, while wounding nine others, including Speier. The gunmen riddled Ryan&#x27;s body with over 20 bullets before shooting him in the face. The passengers on the Cessna subdued Layton and the survivors on both planes fled into nearby fields during and after the attack.

That afternoon, before the news became public, the wife of Ryan&#x27;s aide William Holsinger received three threatening phone calls. The caller allegedly said, &quot;Tell your husband that his meal ticket just had his brains blown out, and he better be careful.&quot; The Holsingers then fled to Lake Tahoe and later Houston.

After taking off, the Cessna radioed in a report of the attack, and U.S. Ambassador John R. Burke went to the residence of Prime Minister Burnham. It was not until the next morning that the Guyanese army could cut through the jungle and reach Jonestown. They discovered 909 of its inhabitants dead after consuming grape Flavor-aid mixed with several poisons. They died in what the United States House of Representatives described as a &quot;mass suicide/murder ritual.&quot;

===Conviction of Larry Layton===
Larry Layton (born January 11, 1946), brother of Deborah Layton, a former Peoples Temple member and author of &quot;Seductive Poison&quot;, was convicted in 1986 of conspiracy in Ryan&#x27;s murder. Temple defectors boarding the truck to Port Kaituma had said of Layton that &quot;there&#x27;s no way he&#x27;s a defector. He&#x27;s too close to Jones.&quot; Layton was the only former Temple member to be tried in the United States for criminal acts relating to the murders at Jonestown. He was convicted on four different murder-related counts.

On March 3, 1987, Layton was sentenced to concurrent sentences of life in prison for &quot;aiding and abetting the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan,&quot;conspiracy to murder an internationally protected person, Richard Dwyer, Deputy Chief of Mission for the United States in the Republic of Guyana,&quot; as well as 15 years in prison on other related counts. He was eligible for parole in five years. On June 3, 1987, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied Layton&#x27;s motion to set aside the conviction &quot;on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during his second trial&quot;. After 18 years in prison, Layton was released from custody in April 2002.

==Memorial==

Veterans for Peace Chapter 124 was named the Leo J. Ryan Memorial chapter.

===Burial===

Ryan&#x27;s body was returned to the United States and interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California. His official Congressional Memorial Services were compiled into a book, &quot;Leo J. Ryan – Memorial Services – Held In The House Of Representatives &amp; Senate Of The U.S., Together With Remarks&quot;. Ryan&#x27;s younger sister Shannon said she was surprised both by the number of supporters who attended the funeral and by the &quot;outgrowth of real, honest sorrow&quot;.

==Legacy and honors==
* In 1983, the United States Congress posthumously awarded Ryan a Congressional Gold Medal, as the only member of Congress killed in the line of duty; President Ronald Reagan signed the bill. In Reagan&#x27;s remarks about the medal, he said: &quot;It was typical of Leo Ryan&#x27;s concern for his constituents that he would investigate personally the rumors of mistreatment in Jonestown that reportedly affected so many from his district.&quot; Ryan&#x27;s daughters Patricia and Erin helped garner support for the medal in time for the fifth anniversary of his death.
* In 1984, the National Archives and Records Center in San Bruno, California was named the Leo J. Ryan Federal Building in his honor, through a Congressional bill passed unanimously and signed by Reagan.
* In 1998, Jackie Speier, Ryan&#x27;s former aide, was elected to the California State Senate. In 2008, she won a special election to the US Congress from California&#x27;s 12th congressional district, much of it formerly Ryan&#x27;s constituency. Since 2013, it has been the state&#x27;s 14th congressional district.

===Daughters===

Shannon Jo Ryan (born 1952), Ryan&#x27;s eldest daughter, joined the Rajneesh movement. After the Bhagwan moved to Oregon in 1981, she joined his commune, which became known as Rajneeshpuram. Taking the name Ma Amrita Pritam, by December 1982 she had married another member, who also lived at the commune.

Patricia Ryan (born 1953) received her master&#x27;s degree in public administration from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and served from 2001 to 2012 as executive director of the California Mental Health Directors Association (now the County Behavioral Health Directors Association of California). During the 1980s she became involved as a volunteer and eventually served as president of the board of the national Cult Awareness Network.

Erin Ryan (born 1958) graduated from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law and worked as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency until 1992. She next worked in New York as a pastry chef for eight years. In 2000, Erin Ryan became an aide to her father&#x27;s former aide, California Senator Jackie Speier.

===Anniversaries===
On the 25th anniversary of Ryan&#x27;s death, a special memorial tribute was held in his honor in Foster City, California. His family and friends, including his three daughters and Jackie Speier, attended. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported, &quot;Over and over today, people described a great man who continually exceeded his constituents&#x27; expectations.&quot;

Near the end of the memorial service, parents of those who had died in Jonestown stood to honor and thank Ryan for giving his life while trying to save their children. After the service ended, mounted police escorted the family and friends into Foster City&#x27;s Leo J. Ryan Memorial Park. A wreath was laid next to a commemorative rock that honors Ryan.

The same year, his daughter Erin Ryan, an aide to Speier, attended a memorial for those who died at Jonestown, held at the Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland. On each anniversary of Leo Ryan&#x27;s death, Jackie Speier and Patricia Ryan visit his grave at the Golden Gate National Cemetery.

For the 30th anniversary, Speier sponsored a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility at 210 South Ellsworth Avenue in San Mateo, California, the &quot;Leo J. Ryan Post Office Building&quot;. President George W. Bush signed it into law on October 21, 2008. On November 17, 2008, Speier spoke at the dedication ceremony at the post office. In part, she said,

There are those – still, thirty years after his passing – who question his motives, or the wisdom of his actions. But criticism was just fine with Leo. Leo Ryan never did anything because he thought it would make him popular. He was more interested in doing what he knew was right.

==In popular culture==
Ryan has been portrayed in films about the Jonestown mass murder/suicide, including by actor Gene Barry in the 1979 film &quot;&quot;, and by Ned Beatty in the 1980 made-for-TV miniseries &quot;Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones&quot;.

His assassination was discussed in the documentaries &quot;&quot; (2006), on The History Channel documentaries &quot;Cults: Dangerous Devotion&quot; and &quot;&quot; (2006), and the MSNBC production &quot;Witness to Jonestown&quot; (2008), which aired on the 30th anniversary of Ryan&#x27;s assassination and the mass suicides at Jonestown. In 2012, National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot; aired the sixth-season episode &quot;Jonestown Cult Suicide&quot;, which recreated Ryan&#x27;s assassination.

<text>A trade-off (or tradeoff) is a situational decision that involves diminishing or losing on quality, quantity, or property of a set or design in return for gains in other aspects. In simple terms, a tradeoff is where one thing increases, and another must decrease. Tradeoffs stem from limitations of many origins, including simple physics – for instance, only a certain volume of objects can fit into a given space, so a full container must remove some items in order to accept any more, and vessels can carry a few large items or multiple small items. Tradeoffs also commonly refer to different configurations of a single item, such as the tuning of strings on a guitar to enable different notes to be played, as well as an allocation of time and attention towards different tasks.

The concept of a tradeoff suggests a tactical or strategic choice made with full comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of each setup. An economic example is the decision to invest in stocks, which are risky but carry great potential return, versus bonds, which are generally safer but with lower potential returns.

== Theoretical description ==
The theoretical description of trade-offs involves the pareto front.

==Examples ==
The concept of a trade-off is often used to describe situations in everyday life.

=== Economics ===
In economics a trade-off is expressed in terms of the opportunity cost of a particular choice, which is the loss of the most preferred alternative given up. A tradeoff, then, involves a sacrifice that must be made to obtain a certain product, service, or experience, rather than others that could be made or obtained using the same required resources. For example, for a person going to a basketball game, their opportunity cost is the loss of the alternative of watching a particular television program at home. If the basketball game occurs during her or his working hours, then the opportunity cost would be several hours of lost work, as they would need to take time off work.

Many factors affect the tradeoff environment within a particular country, including the availability of raw materials, a skilled labor force, machinery for producing a product, technology and capital, market rate to produce that product on a reasonable time scale, and so forth.

A trade-off in economics is often illustrated graphically by a Pareto frontier (named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto), which shows the greatest (or least) amount of one thing that can be attained for each of various given amounts of the other. As an example, in production theory, the trade-off between the output of one good and the output of another is illustrated graphically by the production possibilities frontier. The Pareto frontier is also used in multi-objective optimization. In finance, the capital asset pricing model includes an efficient frontier that shows the highest level of expected return that any portfolio could have given any particular level of risk, as measured by the variance of portfolio return.

=== Opportunity cost ===
An opportunity cost example of trade-offs for an individual would be the decision by a full-time worker to take time off work with a salary of $50,000 to attend medical school with an annual tuition of $30,000 and earning $150,000 as a doctor after 7 years of study. If we assume for the sake of simplicity that the medical school only allows full-time study, then the individual considering stopping work would face a trade-off between not going to medical school and earning $50,000 at work, or going to medical school and losing $50,000 in salary and having to pay $30,000 in tuition but earning $150,000 or more per year after 7 years of study.

=== Trash cans ===
Trash cans that are used inside and then taken out to the street and emptied into a dumpster can be small or large. A large trash can does not need to be taken out to the dumpster so often, but it may become very heavy and difficult to move when full. The choice of big versus small trash can is a trade-off between the frequency of needing to take out the trash and ease of use.

In the case of food waste, a second trade-off presents itself. Large trash cans are more likely to sit for a long time in the kitchen, leading to the food decomposing and a nasty odor. A small trash can will likely need to be taken out to the dumpster more often, thus greatly reducing or eliminating the odor. Of course, a user of a large trash can could simply carry the can outside frequently, but the larger can would be more cumbersome to take out often, and the user would have to think more about when to take the can out.

=== Mittens ===
In cold climates, mittens in which all the fingers are in the same compartment work well to keep the hands warm, but this arrangement also confines finger movement and prevents the full range of hand function. Gloves, with their separate fingers, do not have this drawback, but they do not keep the fingers as warm as mittens do. As such, with mittens and gloves, the trade-off is warmth versus dexterity. Similarly, warm coats are often bulky and impede the wearer&#x27;s freedom of movement. Thin coats give the wearer more freedom of movement, but they are not as warm as a thicker coat would be.

=== Music ===
When copying music from compact discs to a computer, lossy compression formats, such as MP3, are used routinely to save hard disk space, but some information is lost resulting in lower sound quality. Lossless compression schemes, such as FLAC or ALAC take much more disk space, but do not affect sound quality.

=== Cars ===
Large cars can carry many people, and since they have larger crumple zones, they may be safer in an accident. However, they also tend to be heavy (and often not very aerodynamic) and thus usually have relatively poor fuel economy. Small cars like the Smart Car can only carry two people, and being lightweight, they are more fuel-efficient. At the same time, the smaller size and weight of small cars mean that they have smaller crumple zones, which means occupants are less protected in case of an accident. In addition, if a small car has an accident with a larger, heavier car, the occupants of the smaller car will fare more poorly. Thus, car size (large versus small) involves multiple tradeoffs regarding passenger capacity, accident safety, and fuel economy.

=== Athletics ===
In athletics, sprint running demands different physical attributes from running a marathon. Accordingly, the two contests have distinct events in such competitions as the Olympics, and each pursuit features distinct teams of athletes. Whether a professional runner is better suited to marathon running versus sprinting is a trade-off based on the runner&#x27;s morphology and physiology (e.g., variation in muscle fiber type), as well as the runner&#x27;s individual interest, preference, and other motivational factors. Sports recruiters are mindful of these tradeoffs as they decide what role a prospective athlete would best suit on a team.

=== Biology ===

In biology, several types of tradeoffs have been recognized. Most simply, a tradeoff occurs when a beneficial change in one trait is linked to a detrimental change in another trait. In environmental resource management, trade-offs occur among different targets. For example, these occur among biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and distributive equity in the distribution of funds of the program for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), as maximizing one of these targets implies reducing the outcomes in the other two targets.

The term is also used widely in an evolutionary context, in which case the processes of natural selection and sexual selection are in reference as the ultimate decisive factors. In biology, the concepts of tradeoffs and constraints are often closely related.

=== Demography ===
In demography, tradeoff examples may include maturity, fecundity, parental care, parity, senescence, and mate choice. For example, the higher the fecundity (number of offspring), the lower the parental care that each offspring will receive. Parental care as a function of fecundity would show a negative sloped linear graph. A related phenomenon, known as demographic compensation, arises when the different components of species life cycles (survival, growth, fecundity, etc.) show negative correlations across the distribution ranges. For example, survival may be higher towards the northern edge of the distribution, while fecundity or growth increases towards the south, leading to a compensation that allows the species to persist along an environmental gradient. Contrasting trends in life cycle components may arise through tradeoffs in resource allocation, but also through independent but opposite responses to environmental conditions.

=== Engineering ===
Tradeoffs are important in engineering. For example, in electrical engineering, negative feedback is used in amplifiers to trade gain for other desirable properties, such as improved bandwidth, stability of the gain and/or bias point, noise immunity, and reduction of nonlinear distortion. Similarly, tradeoffs are used to maximize power efficiency in medical devices whilst guaranteeing the required measurement quality.

=== Computer science ===

In computer science, tradeoffs are viewed as a tool of the trade. A program can often run faster if it uses more memory (a space–time tradeoff). Consider the following examples:
* By compressing an image, you can reduce transmission time/costs at the expense of CPU time to perform the compression and decompression. Depending on the compression method, this may also involve the tradeoff of a loss in image quality.
* By using a lookup table, you may be able to reduce CPU time at the expense of space to hold the table, e.g. to determine the parity of a byte you can either look at each bit individually (using shifts and masks), or use a 256-entry table giving the parity for each possible bit-pattern, or combine the upper and lower nibbles and use a 16-entry table.
* For some situations (e.g. string manipulation), a compiler may be able to use inline code for greater speed, or call run-time routines for reduced memory; the user of the compiler should be able to indicate whether speed or space is more important.
The Software Engineering Institute has a specific method for analyzing tradeoffs, called the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM).

=== Board games ===
Strategy board games often involve tradeoffs: for example, in chess you might trade a pawn for an improved position. In a worst-case scenario, a chess player might even tradeoff the loss of a valuable piece (even the Queen) to protect the King. In Go, you might trade &quot;thickness&quot; for &quot;influence&quot;.

=== Ethics ===
Ethics often involves competing for interests that must be traded off against each other, such as the interests of different people, or different principles (e.g. is it ethical to use information resulting from inhumane or illegal experiments to treat disease today?)

=== Medicine ===
In medicine, patients and physicians are often faced with difficult decisions involving tradeoffs. One example is localized prostate cancer, where patients need to weigh the possibility of a prolonged life expectancy against possible stressful or unpleasant treatment side-effects (patient trade-off).

=== Government ===
Governmental tradeoffs are among the most controversial political and social difficulties of any time. All of politics can be viewed as a series of tradeoffs based upon which core values are most core to most people or politicians. Political campaigns also involve tradeoffs, as when attack ads may energize the political base but alienate undecided voters.

=== Work schedules ===
With work schedules, employees will often use a tradeoff of &quot;9/80&quot; where an 80-hour work period is compressed into a narrow group of 9 nearly-9 hour working days over the traditional 10 8-hour working days, allowing the employee to take every second Friday off.

<text>The red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis) is a small songbird. The adult has blue-grey upperparts with cinnamon underparts, a white throat and face with a black stripe through the eyes, a straight grey bill and a black crown. Its call, which has been likened to a tin trumpet, is high-pitched and nasal. It breeds in coniferous forests across Canada, Alaska and the northeastern and western United States. Though often a permanent resident, it regularly irrupts further south if its food supply fails. There are records of vagrants occurring as far south as the Gulf Coast and northern Mexico. It forages on the trunks and large branches of trees, often descending head first, sometimes catching insects in flight. It eats mainly insects and seeds, especially from conifers. It excavates its nest in dead wood, often close to the ground, smearing the entrance with pitch.



==Taxonomy==
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-breasted nuthatch in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name &quot;Le torchepot de Canada&quot; and the Latin &quot;Sitta Canadensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names for the species, these usually do not conform to the binomial system and none of them are recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. In 1766, when the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-breasted nuthatch. Linnaeus included a brief description and used Brisson&#x27;s name, &quot;Sitta canadensis,&quot; as his binomial name.

Like all nuthatches, the red-breasted nuthatch is assigned to the genus &quot;Sitta&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758), a name derived from &quot;sittē&quot; (), the Ancient Greek word for the Eurasian nuthatch. The specific epithet &quot;canadensis&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;belonging to Canada&quot;. &quot;Nuthatch&quot; is a linguistic corruption of &quot;nuthack&quot;, referring to the bird&#x27;s habit of wedging nuts into cracks in tree bark and hacking at them until they break open. &quot;Red-breasted&quot; is a reference to the rusty colour of the male&#x27;s underparts.
In the past, the red-breasted nuthatch and four other species — the Corsican nuthatch, the Chinese nuthatch, the Algerian nuthatch and the Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch — were thought to be a single species. These five make up a well-defined species group known as the &quot;&quot;Sitta canadensis&quot; group&quot;, and are sometimes considered to be a superspecies. Within the species group, DNA studies have shown that the red-breasted nuthatch, the Corsican nuthatch and the Chinese nuthatch make up one clade and the Algerian nuthatch and Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch make up a sister clade. The red-breasted nuthatch is monotypic across its extensive range.

==Description==
The red-breasted nuthatch is a small passerine, measuring in length, with a wingspan of and a weight of . Its back and uppertail are bluish, and its underparts are rust-colored. It has a black cap and eye line and a white supercilium (eyebrow). Sexes are similarly plumaged, though females and youngsters have duller heads and paler underparts.

==Voice==
The red-breasted nuthatch&#x27;s call is high-pitched, nasal and weak. Transcribed as &quot;yenk&quot; or &quot;ink&quot;, they have been likened to a toy tin horn or a child&#x27;s noisemaker. Its song is a slowly repeated series of clear, nasal, rising notes, transcribed as .

==Habitat and range==
Though it is primarily a full-time resident of northern and subalpine conifer forests, the red-breasted nuthatch regularly migrates irruptively, with both the number migrating and the wintering locations varying from year to year. They sometimes reach northern Mexico, where they are rare winter visitors to Nuevo León, Baja California Norte and south along the Pacific slope as far as Sinaloa. In the eastern United States, its range is expanding southwards. Though formerly resident on Isla Guadalupe, an island off the western coast of Mexico, it appears to have been extirpated there, with the last known record of the species on the island dating from 1971. There is a single vagrant record for Mexico&#x27;s Isla Socorro. It is an extremely rare vagrant to Europe, with two records in the western Palearctic; one bird successfully overwintered in eastern England.

==Feeding behavior and diet==
Like all nuthatches, the red-breasted nuthatch is an acrobatic species, hitching itself up and down tree trunks and branches to look for food. It goes headfirst when climbing down. It can &quot;walk&quot; on the underside of branches. Unlike woodpeckers and creepers, it does not use its tail as a prop while climbing. It tends to forage singly or in pairs.

The red-breasted nuthatch&#x27;s diet changes depending on the season. In the summer, it eats mostly insects, occasionally even flycatching, while in the winter, it switches to conifer seeds. At feeders, it will take sunflower seeds, peanut butter, and suet. It often wedges food pieces in bark crevices in order to break them up with the bill (as opposed to holding the food in their feet, like the black-capped chickadee does).

==Breeding==
The red-breasted nuthatch, like all nuthatches, is monogamous. The male courts the female with a peculiar display, lifting his head and tail while turning his back to her, drooping his wings, and swaying from side to side.

This bird excavates its own cavity nest, above ground (usually around . Excavation is done by both sexes and takes one to eight weeks. The pair smears sap around the entrance hole, presumably to help deter predators. The nest is lined with grass, moss, shredded bark and rootlets. Nest building is done by both sexes, but mostly by females.

The female lays 2–8 eggs (usually 5–6), which are white, creamy or pinkish, and covered with reddish-brown speckles. The eggs measure long by wide. Incubation is done by the female and lasts 12–13 days. The young are altricial and stay in the nest for 2–3 weeks, brooded by the female but fed by both sexes. Normally, there is only one brood per year. Lifespan is around 6 years.

==Conservation status and threats==
Because of its large global range and its increasing population, the red-breasted nuthatch is rated as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the Americas, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

<doc id="406220" wikidata="Q2544042" url="?curid=406220" title="Valentine and Orson">
<text>Valentine and Orson is a romance which has been attached to the Carolingian cycle.

==Synopsis==
It is the story of twin brothers, abandoned in the woods in infancy. Valentine is brought up as a knight at the court of Pepin, while Orson grows up in a bear&#x27;s den to be a wild man of the woods, until 
Valentine finds, overcomes, and tames him. He then becomes Valentine&#x27;s servant and comrade. In some versions, the pair discover their true history with the help of a magical brazen head. The two eventually rescue their mother Bellisant, sister of Pepin and wife of the emperor of Greece, by whom she had been unjustly repudiated, from the power of a giant named Ferragus.

==Early modern versions==
The tale is probably based on a lost French original, with Orson originally described as &quot;sans nom&quot; i.e. the &quot;nameless&quot; one. A 14th-century French &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, &quot;Valentin et Sansnom&quot; (i.e. &quot;Valentin and &quot;Nameless&quot;&quot;) has not survived but was translated/adapted in medieval German as &quot;Valentin und Namelos&quot; (first half of the 15th century).

The kernel of the story lies in Orson&#x27;s upbringing and wildness, and is evidently a folk-tale,
with a purely artificial connection to the Carolingian cycle. The story of the wife unjustly accused with which it is bound up is sufficiently common, and was told of the wives both of Pippin and Charlemagne. The work has a number of references to other, older, works, including: &quot;Floovant&quot;, &quot;The Four Sons of Aymon&quot;, &quot;Lion de Bourges&quot;, and &quot;Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont&quot;.

Like nearly all popular romances of chivalry of the period, the French &quot;chanson de geste&quot; was adapted into a prose romance by the end of the 15th century; several versions from the 16th century are extant; the oldest prose version dates from 1489 (published in Lyon by Jacques Maillet). An English-language version, &quot;The Historye of the two Valyannte Brethren: Valentyne and Orson&quot;, written by Henry Watson, printed by William Copland about 1550, is the earliest known of a long series of English versions - some of which included illustrations. One such illustrated variant of the tale was prepared by S R Littlwood and accompanied by the illustrations of Florence Anderson when published in 1919. 

Other Renaissance versions exist in Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Dutch, German, and Icelandic. The number of translations show a European success for the tale. The works of François Rabelais have a number of echoes to the romance.

A pageant of Valentine and &quot;Urson&quot; was presented in London at Cheapside during the Royal Entry before the Coronation of Edward VI in 1547. It is known that Richard Hathwaye and Anthony Munday produced a theatrical version of the story in 1598.

==Modern versions and adaptations==
Thomas Dibdin wrote an adaptation in 1804 which was later performed at the Theatres Royal Covent Garden, Haymarket, and Bath.

Nancy Ekholm Burkert wrote and illustrated a version of the story in 1989, in which the story is told through the lens of a traveling group of players (including two brothers) who bring the story to a village in Flanders in the Middle Ages.

<text>Édouard Lartet (15 April 180128 January 1871) was a French geologist and paleontologist, and a pioneer of Paleolithic archaeology. He is also known for coining the prehistoric taxon &quot;Amphicyon&quot;, making it one of the earliest-described fossil carnivorans in the palaeontological record.

==Biography==
Lartet was born near Castelnau-Barbarens, &quot;&quot; of Gers, France, where his family had lived for more than five hundred years. He was educated for the law at Auch and Toulouse, but having private means elected to devote himself to science. The then recent work of Georges Cuvier on fossil Mammalia encouraged Lartet in excavations which led in 1834 to his first discovery of fossil remains in the neighborhood of Auch. Additionally, he described a fossil carnivoran that had some anatomical relations to caniforms such as canids, provisionally naming the fossil taxon &quot;Amphicyon&quot; in 1836, although the name would be adopted as a permanent genus name in later studies by other palaeontologists. For the next decade and a half, he continued to explore the geography and palaeontology of the Pyrenees, uncovering ancestral apes close to the hominid line at Sansan.

In 1860, hearing of the discovery of human bones at a cave at Aurignac, and inspired by the work of William Pengelly, he turned his attention most fruitfully to the cave systems of the Dordogne. His first publication on the subject, &quot;The Antiquity of Man in Western Europe&quot; (1860), was followed in 1861 by &quot;New Researches on the Coexistence of Man and of the Great Fossil Mammifers characteristic of the Last Geological Period&quot;. Here he revealed the results of his discoveries in the Aurignac cave, demonstrating the contemporaneous existence of man and extinct mammals. While these first results were met with some incredulity, a fellow geologist helpfully pointed Lartet towards the Vézère valley in the Périgord district, where in 1863 he began to dig backed by the financial and personal help of Henry Christy.

Their conjoint work was immediately to open new horizons, and served to establish a basic stratified typology of Paleolithic man which still holds good today. The important discoveries in the Abri de la Madeleine and Le Moustier provided type-sites for archaic stone-age cultures, which (from the associated fauna) Lartet linked to an early &#x27;mammoth&#x27; phase and a late &#x27;reindeer&#x27; phase. Lartet and Christy were also able to establish and document the presence of mobiliary art in early stratified layers, further transforming the common and professional perception of early man. Such &#x27;home&#x27; art, involving bone patternings and carvings, were associated with both the Aurignacian and the Magdalenean cultures.

The account of their joint researches appeared in a paper descriptive of the Dordogne caves and contents published in &quot;Revue archéologique&quot; (1864); and would eventually be published by Lartet and Christy under the title &quot;Reliquiae Aquitanicae&quot;, the first part appearing in 1865. Christy unfortunately died before the completion of the work, but Lartet continued it until the breakdown of his health in 1870. Many artefacts from their excavations are now kept in the local museum in Toulouse, as well as the British Museum in London. His son Louis Lartet followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps.

The most modest and one of the most illustrious of the founders of modern palaeontology, Lartet&#x27;s work was publicly recognized by his nomination as an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur; and in 1848 he had had the offer of a political post. In 1857 he had been elected a foreign member of the Geological Society of London, and a few weeks before his death he had been made professor of palaeontology at the museum of the Jardin des Plantes. He died at Séissan. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869.

<text>Lake Athabasca ( ; French: &quot;lac Athabasca&quot;; from Woods Cree: , &quot;[where] there are plants one after another&quot;) is in the north-west corner of Saskatchewan and the north-east corner of Alberta between 58° and 60° N in Canada. The lake is about 30% in Alberta and 70% in Saskatchewan.

The lake is fed by the Athabasca River and other rivers, and its water flows northward via the Slave River to the Mackenzie River system, eventually reaching the Arctic Ocean.

== Toponymy ==

The name in the Woods Cree language originally referred only to the Peace–Athabasca Delta formed by the confluence of the Peace and Athabasca rivers at the southwest corner of the lake. Prior to 1789, Sir Alexander Mackenzie explored the lake. In 1791, Philip Turnor, cartographer for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, wrote in his journal, &quot;low swampy ground on the South side with a few willows growing upon it, from which the Lake in general takes its name Athapison in the Southern Cree tongue which signifies open country such as lakes with willows and grass growing about them&quot;. Peter Fidler originally recorded the name for the river in 1790 as &quot;the Great Arabuska&quot;. By 1801, the name had gained a closer spelling to the current name—Athapaskow Lake. By 1820, George Simpson referred to both the lake and the river as &quot;Athabasca&quot;.

== Geography ==

The lake covers or including islands, is long, has a maximum width of , and a maximum depth of , and holds of water, making it the largest and one of the deepest lakes in both Alberta and Saskatchewan (nearby Tazin Lake is deeper), and the eighth largest in Canada. Water flows northward from the lake via the Slave River and Mackenzie River systems, eventually reaching the Arctic Ocean.

Fort Chipewyan, one of the oldest European settlements in Alberta, is on the western shore of the lake, where the Rivière des Rochers drains the lake and flows toward Slave River, beginning its northward journey along the eastern boundary of Wood Buffalo National Park. The eastern section of the lake narrows to a width of about near the community of Fond du Lac on the northern shore then continues to its most easterly point at the mouth of the Fond du Lac River.

Fidler Point on the north shore of Lake Athabasca is named for Peter Fidler, a surveyor and map maker for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

Along with other lakes such as the Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake, Lake Athabasca is a remnant of the vast Glacial Lake McConnell.

== History ==
First Nations have lived in the area for more than 2,000 years. In the era of the North American fur trade, the lake was a pivotal point, since it was as far west as canoes could travel from the east and still return before freeze-up. The first European settlement on Lake Athabasca is Fort Chipewyan, founded as a North West Company (NWC) trading post in 1788. Its original location was Old Fort Point, on the southwest shore west of the Old Fort River. In 1798, Fort Chipewyan was relocated to its current site on the north shore.

In fall 1790, Malcolm Ross, Peter Fidler, Philip Turnor, and others, all working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), travelled from Cumberland House to Île-à-la-Crosse, and on to Lake Athabasca the following spring. They established a HBC fur trade post on the south-west shore of the lake, opposite Fort Chipewyan. The HBC post, also called Athapescow Lake, was abandoned in 1792.

In 1802, the HBC set up another post on English Island at the lake&#x27;s outlet, called Nottingham House, but was abandoned in 1806. In 1815, the HBC tried competing again with the NWC and founded Fort Wedderburn on Coal or Potato Island. When the HBC and NWC merged in 1821, Fort Wedderburn was also abandoned by moving all operations to Fort Chipewyan.

== Development and environment ==
Uranium and gold mining along the northern shore resulted in the birth of Uranium City, Saskatchewan, which was home to mine workers and their families. While the last mine closed in the 1980s, the effects of mining operations had already heavily contaminated the northern shores. The large oil sands mining nearby is suspected to have added to the current pollution levels in the lake.

On October31, 2013, one of Obed Mountain coal mine&#x27;s pits failed, and between 600 million and one billion litres of slurry poured into the Plante and Apetowun Creeks. The plume of waste products then joined the Athabasca River, travelling downstream for a month before settling in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan, over away.

The Lake Athabasca Sand Dunes, the largest active sand dunes in the world north of 58°, are adjacent to the southern shore in Saskatchewan. The dunes were designated a Provincial Wilderness Park in 1992.

Lake Athabasca contains 23 species of fish, with a world record lake trout of caught from its depths in 1961 by means of a gillnet. Other fish species include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, goldeye, lake whitefish, cisco, Arctic grayling, burbot, white sucker, and longnose sucker.

<text>Patient Grissel is a play by Thomas Dekker, Henry Chettle, and William Haughton, first printed in 1603. It is mentioned in Henslowe&#x27;s diary in the entry for December 1599.

The plot is a variant of the medieval tale of Patient Griselda, as told in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; and Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;.

The play contains Dekker&#x27;s poem &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; (which was adapted by Paul McCartney for the song of the same title on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album):&lt;poem&gt;

:Golden slumbers kiss your eyes,
:Smiles awake you when you rise.
:Sleep, pretty wantons; do not cry,
:And I will sing a lullaby:
:Rock them, rock them, lullaby.

:Care is heavy, therefore sleep you;
:You are care, and care must keep you;
:Sleep, pretty wantons; do not cry,
:And I will sing a lullaby:
:Rock them, rock them, lullaby.&lt;/poem&gt;
