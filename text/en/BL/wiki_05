<text>In Christian theology, justification is the event or process by which sinners are made or declared to be righteous in the sight of God.

In the 21st century, there is now substantial agreement on justification by most Christian communions. The collective bodies of most of the largest Christian denominations, including Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican and Methodist, have affirmed a 1999 Lutheran–Catholic Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification that details this consensus, noting different &quot;distinctive emphases&quot; that individual communions consider essential to state.

Historically, the difference in theories on the means of justification has often been the theological fault line that divided Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox from the Lutheran, Anglican and Reformed traditions of Protestantism during the Reformation.

Catholic doctrine characteristically portrays this righteousness as infused, i.e., God &quot;pours&quot; grace into one&#x27;s soul or, &quot;fills&quot; one with his grace more and more over time; faith—shown through charity and good works—justifies sinners (&quot;fides caritate formata&quot;.) Broadly speaking, Catholics have spoken of justification—which in their view initially occurs at baptism, partaking of the sacraments and the resulting grace of cooperation with God&#x27;s will (sanctification)—as an organic whole: one act of reconciliation brought to completeness in glorification. 

In the Lutheran and Reformed denominational traditions, this righteousness is portrayed as imputed to the inherently ungodly, by grace, through faith in the voluntary sacrifice and resurrection of Christ. The Reformed, Lutheran and Anglican traditions emphasize that &quot;the observance of the moral law is not necessary either as a prerequisite for obtaining justification or as a means for preserving it.&quot; Therefore, a righteousness from God is viewed as being credited to the sinner&#x27;s account through faith alone, apart from works, being based solely on the &quot;blood of Christ&quot;. Growth in personal holiness is considered distinct from justification, belonging rather to sanctification.

In Anabaptist Christianity, the Lutheran doctrine of justification is rejected. Rather than a forensic justification that only gives a legal change of one&#x27;s status before God, Anabaptists teach that &quot;justification begun a dynamic process by which the believer partook of the nature of Christ and was so enabled to live increasingly like Jesus.&quot; 

Orthodox theology similarly teaches that &quot;Salvation is accomplished by grace in response to faith. But that faith cannot be passive; it must express itself by feeding, clothing, visiting and otherwise caring for the “least” of Jesus’ brethren (Mt 25).&quot; 

In Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant theology, anyone who has been justified will produce good works as a product of faith, as a result of God&#x27;s grace in sanctification. Notable exceptions to the idea that sanctification and good works always accompany justification are found in Free Grace Theology held by many Independent Baptist churches.

For Lutherans, justification can be lost with the loss of faith. Lutherans affirm that mortal sin can destroy faith; for Catholics and Orthodox Christians, justification can also be lost by committing a mortal sin. Anabaptists teach that Christians can apostatize, resulting in a loss of salvation, through disobedience to God and indulgence in sin; for Methodists along with other groups belonging to the Holiness Movement, salvation also can be lost with the loss of faith or through sinning (cf. &quot;conditional security&quot;). The Reformed tradition generally holds that justification can never truly be lost: for those who have been justified by grace, will certainly persevere through faith until the return of Christ himself.

== Biblical and patristic references ==
=== Gospels ===

Jesus used the idea of ransom, or redemption when referring to his work on earth (; ). Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection (triumph over Satan and death) provide justification for believers before God. His righteousness becomes theirs, and his death becomes an offering to God in their place, to pay for all of their sins. According to Protestants this justification is by faith alone – not through good deeds – and is a gift from God through Christ. According to Catholics and Eastern Orthodox we are justified by God&#x27;s grace which is a free gift but is received through baptism initially, through the faith that works for love in the continuous life of a Christian and through the sacrament of reconciliation if the grace of justification is lost through grave sin.

===James===
James discusses justification briefly but significantly, declaring that a faith that is without works, a fruitless faith (cf. ), cannot be a justifying faith, because faith is made perfect or completed by works (, especially ; see also ). Indeed, works are required for justification because &quot;man is justified by works, and not by faith alone&quot; (), though the sense of the word &quot;justified&quot; in this passage is disputed. The writer of James emphasizes the Jewish belief that faith and deeds go together. 

However, in James, it is possible that &quot;justification&quot; is referring to how believers are to behave as believers, not how an unbeliever becomes a believer (i.e., salvation). Faith without works is counterfeit. The faith must produce good fruit as a sign lest it become the occasion for self-justification.

D. James Kennedy explains this verse:

===Paul===
It was Paul who developed the term justification in the theology of the church. Justification is a major theme of the epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians in the New Testament, and is also given treatment in many other epistles. 

In Romans, Paul develops justification by first speaking of God&#x27;s just wrath at sin (). Justification is then presented as the solution for God&#x27;s wrath (, ). One is said to be &#x27;justified by faith apart from works of the Law&#x27; (). Further, Paul writes of sin and justification in terms of two men, Adam and Christ (). Through Adam, sin came into the world bringing death; through Jesus, righteousness came into the world, bringing justification unto life (). In this connection, Paul speaks of Adam&#x27;s sin being &#x27;imputed&#x27; or &#x27;accounted&#x27; (Greek ελλογειται) and speaks of justification as acting in analogy to sin (; ). In chapter 8, Paul connects justification with predestination and glorification (). He further states that those who are justified cannot be separated from the love of Christ (). Several of these passages are central in the debate between Roman Catholics, and the various streams of Protestantism (while there is broad agreement on justification by faith, there is no complete doctrinal uniformity on justification among all Protestant denominations), who can understand them in quite different ways. 

In Galatians, Paul emphatically rejects justification by works of the Law, a rejection sparked apparently by a controversy concerning the necessity of circumcision for salvation (, ; see also and Council of Jerusalem). He also adds that the only thing that counts is the &quot;faith [which] works by love&quot;().

===Other New Testament writers===
The Epistle to the Hebrews also takes up the theme of justification, declaring that Jesus&#x27; death is superior to the Old Testament sacrifices in that it takes away sin once for all (). In Hebrews, faith in Jesus&#x27; sacrifice includes steadfast perseverance (, ).

=== Early church ===

Justification as a concept is mentioned in the works of early Church Fathers, and in the sermons of John Chrysostom, but it is not developed until Augustine&#x27;s conflict with Pelagius.

Pelagius taught that one became righteous through the exertion of one&#x27;s will to follow the example of Jesus&#x27; life. Over against this, Augustine taught that we are justified by God, as a work of his grace. Augustine took great pains in his anti-Pelagian works to refute the notion that our works could serve as the proper basis for our justification. Following an appeal from Augustine, Pope Innocent I condemned Pelagius. The accused heretic wrote an appeal of his own, declaring his innocence, which was duly accepted by Innocent&#x27;s successor, Pope Zosimus. However, the Council of Carthage (418) again renounced Pelagius with papal approval.

==Joint Declaration on Doctrine of Justification (1999) ==

In 1999, Roman Catholics and most Lutherans as represented by most of the Lutheran councils worldwide agreed to the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (JDDJ): with this, &quot;consensus in basic truths of the doctrine of justification exists between Lutherans and Catholics.&quot;

===Consensus===

* &quot;We confess together that sinners are justified by faith in the saving action of God in Christ. Such a faith is active in love and thus the Christian cannot and should not remain without works. But whatever in the justified precedes or follows the free gift of faith is neither the basis of justification nor merits it.

* &quot;We confess together that in baptism the Holy Spirit unites one with Christ, justifies, and truly renews the person.

* &quot;We confess: By grace alone, in faith in Christ&#x27;s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works.

* &quot;We confess together that all persons depend completely on the saving grace of God for their salvation. Justification takes place solely by God&#x27;s grace.

* &quot;We confess together that persons are justified by faith in the gospel &quot;apart from works prescribed by the law&quot; (Rom 3:28). (a faith which worketh by love. Gal.5:6)&quot;

* &quot;We confess together that good works – a Christian life lived in faith, hope and love – follow justification and are its fruits. When the justified live in Christ and act in the grace they receive, they bring forth, in biblical terms, good fruit. Since Christians struggle against sin their entire lives, this consequence of justification is also for them an obligation they must fulfill. Thus both Jesus and the apostolic Scriptures admonish Christians to bring forth the works of love.&quot; (Section 4.7 no.37)

===Different angle of approach===
The declaration states that several theological views on justification held by Lutherans and Catholics, though not apparently similar to each other, are in fact explaining the same &quot;basic truths of the doctrine of justification&quot; at different angles.

An example can be cited from section 4.7 no. 38–39, &quot;when Catholics affirm the &#x27;meritorious&#x27; character of good works, they wish to say that, according to the biblical witness, a reward in heaven is promised to these works. Their intention is to emphasize the responsibility of persons for their actions, not to contest the character of those works as gifts, or far less to deny that justification always remains the unmerited gift of grace&quot;, in comparison with &quot;the concept of a preservation of grace and a growth in grace and faith is also held by Lutherans. They do emphasize that righteousness as acceptance by God and sharing in the righteousness of Christ is always complete. At the same time, they state that there can be growth in its effects in Christian living. When they view the good works of Christians as the fruits and signs of justification and not as one&#x27;s own &#x27;merits&#x27;, they nevertheless also understand eternal life in accord with the New Testament as unmerited &#x27;reward&#x27; in the sense of the fulfillment of God&#x27;s promise to the believer.&quot;

===Uptake===
In July 2006 the World Methodist Council, representing 70 million Wesleyan Christians, including The United Methodist Church, &quot;signed on&quot; to (or affirmed) the Joint Declaration on Justification between Roman Catholics and the Lutheran World Federation.

In 2016, the Anglican Consultative Committee, representing 85 million Anglicans, issued resolution 16.17

In 2017, the World Communion of Reformed Churches, representing 80 million members of Congregational, Presbyterian, Reformed, United, Uniting and Waldensian churches affirmed the Joint Declaration. 

The Lutheran World Federation represents around 77 million Christians. The Catholic Church represents around 1.4 billion Christians. As of 2022, this tallies to about 1.7 billion people associated with communions that have affirmed the Joint Declaration, or 75% of all Christians worldwide. 

Other Lutherans, especially Confessional Lutherans, maintain that this agreement fails to properly define the meaning of faith, sin, and other essential terms and thus do not support the Lutheran World Federation&#x27;s agreement. Likewise, some Catholics affirming real and serious differences between the decrees of the Council of Trent and the normative Lutheran documents collected in the 1580 Book of Concord equally reject the 1999 &quot;JDDJ&quot; as fatally flawed.

==Comparison of traditions==

Christian traditions answer questions about the nature, function and meaning of justification quite differently. These issues include: Is justification an event occurring instantaneously or is it as an ongoing process? Is justification effected by divine action alone (&quot;monergism&quot;), by divine and human action together (&quot;synergism&quot;) or by human action? Is justification permanent or can it be lost? What is the relationship of justification to sanctification, the process whereby sinners become righteous and are enabled by the Holy Spirit to live lives pleasing to God?

Protestants, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christians together believe that justification is by grace through faith, though they differ on the relationship between faith, obedience, and justification.

Protestants believe justification is applied through faith alone and that rather than being made personally righteous and obedient, which Protestants generally delegate to sanctification as a distinct reality, justification is a forensic declaration of the believer to possess the righteousness and obedience of Christ.

Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe that the obedience that flows from faith is the cause of increase in justification; holding justification to be an ontological process of being truly made righteous by union and cooperation with Christ and also believe they are justified by God&#x27;s grace which is a free gift received through baptism initially, through the faith which works by love in the continuous life and growth of the Christian and through the sacrament of reconciliation if the grace of justification is lost through mortal sin. For the Catholic and Orthodox Christian, justification and sanctification are different ways of speaking of the same reality, rather than positing an actual distinction between the two.
===Catholic Church===
To Catholics, justification is &quot;a translation, from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace, and of the adoption of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Savior&quot;, including the transforming of a sinner from the state of unrighteousness to the state of holiness. This transformation is made possible by accessing the merit of Christ, made available in the atonement, through faith and the sacraments. The Catholic Church teaches that &quot;faith without works is dead&quot; and that works perfect faith.

In Catholic theology, all are born in a state of original sin, meaning that the sinful nature of Adam is inherited by all. Following Augustine, the Catholic Church asserts that people are unable to make themselves righteous; instead, they require justification.

Catholic theology holds that the sacrament of baptism, which is closely connected to faith, &quot;purifies, justifies and sanctifies&quot; the sinner; in this sacrament, the sinner is &quot;freed from sin&quot;. This is termed initial justification or &quot;being cleansed of sin&quot;, the entrance into the Christian life. Catholics use Mark 16:16, John 3:5, Acts 2:38, and 1 Peter 3:21 to support this view in justification by baptism.

As the individual then progresses in his Christian life, he continues to receive God&#x27;s grace both directly through the Holy Spirit as well as through the sacraments. This has the effect of combating sin in the individual&#x27;s life, causing him to become more righteous both in heart and in action. If one falls into mortal sin he loses his justification and it can be gained back through the sacrament of confession.

At the Resurrection those believers who died in a state of grace but with some venial sins will have been purged of these excessive creaturely attachments. As part of the following Final Judgment, the saved individual&#x27;s works will then be evaluated for their reward.

In the Council of Trent, which Catholics believe to be infallible, the Catholic Church declared in the VII session in canon IV (countering the view that sacraments are superfluous and therefore to be eschewed as unnecessary) that, &quot;If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification;-though all (the sacraments) are not indeed necessary for every individual; let him be anathema (excommunicated).&quot;

Anglican John Henry Newman&#x27;s 1838 &quot;Lectures on the Doctrine of Justification&quot; (re-issued as a Catholic in 1879) sought to align the Protestant and Catholic understanding of Justification, writing in terms of the Catholic tradition of &quot;et...et...&quot; (i.e., &quot;both ... and ...&quot;) that righteousness was both imputed and infused (he suggested the term &quot;adhered&quot;.)

===Eastern Christianity===
Eastern Christianity, including both Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, tends to not have a strong emphasis on justification as compared to Catholicism or Protestantism, seeing it as part of the concept of &quot;theosis&quot;; justification is often viewed by Eastern theologians as too highly forensic and they reject it. The Greek term for justification (, &quot;dikaiōsis&quot;) is not understood by most Eastern theologians to mean simply being pardoned of one&#x27;s sins. In large part, this de-emphasis on justification is historical. The Eastern church sees humanity as inheriting the disease of sin from Adam, but not his guilt; hence, there is no need in Eastern theology for any forensic justification.

The Orthodox see salvation as a process of &quot;theosis&quot;, in which the individual is united to Christ and the life of Christ is reproduced within him. Thus, in one sense, justification is an aspect of theosis. However, it is also the case that those who are baptized into the church and experience Chrismation are considered to be cleansed of sin. Hence, the Orthodox concept of justification cannot be reconciled to Protestant concepts, while it is in partial agreement with some Roman Catholic concepts. In the words of one Orthodox Bishop:

&quot;The Holy Spirit effects the vocation, the illumination, the conversion, the justification, the rebirth in Baptism and the sanctification in the Church...&quot;

===Anabaptism===
Anabaptist theology emphasizes a &quot;faith that works&quot;; Anabaptists teach that &quot;justification [began] a dynamic process by which the believer partook of the nature of Christ and was so enabled to live increasingly like Jesus.&quot;

Anabaptist cleric David Griffin writes:

Menno Simons wrote in his &quot;Confession of the Distressed Christians&quot; that salvation was not in &quot;works, words or sacraments&quot; but are found only in Christ. In 1539 he wrote the qualities of this faith; &quot; true evangelical faith... cannot lay dormant; but manifests itself in all righteousness and works of love; it... clothes the naked; feeds the hungry; consoles the afflicted; shelters the miserable; aids and consoles all the oppressed; returns good for evil; serves those that injure it; prays for those that persecute it.&quot; Balthasar Hubmaier wrote in &quot;Eighteen Thesis Concerning the Christian Life&quot; that &quot;Faith alone makes us righteous before God&quot; but further added that &quot;such faith cannot remain idle, but must break forth in gratitude toward God and in all sorts of works of brotherly love toward others.&quot; Pilgram Marpeck similarly wrote that the sinner was justified by faith and also that, &quot;If God...liberates him (the sinner) from the bonds, cords, and power of the devil, and if Christ lives in him again through His Holy Spirit, he is justified through Christ and no longer a sinner. His sins and the stain of his wickedness have been washed away and cleansed through the blood of Christ, and God does not hold sin against him&quot;. Justification for Marpeck is, in a word, liberation—namely, the liberation from the powers of darkness.

===Lutheranism===
From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the Church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity, the most important of which, for Luther, was the doctrine of justification—God&#x27;s act of declaring a sinner righteous—by faith alone through God&#x27;s grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God&#x27;s grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus.

&quot;This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification&quot;, insisted Martin Luther, &quot;is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.&quot; He also called this doctrine the &quot;articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae&quot; (&quot;article of the standing and falling of the church&quot;): &quot;...if this article stands, the Church stands; if it falls, the Church falls.&quot; Lutherans follow Luther in this when they call this doctrine &quot;the material principle&quot; of theology in relation to the Bible, which is &quot;the formal principle.&quot; They believe justification by grace alone through faith alone in Christ&#x27;s righteousness alone is the gospel, the core of the Christian faith around which all other Christian doctrines are centered and based.

Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. When God&#x27;s righteousness is mentioned in the gospel, it is God&#x27;s action of declaring righteous the unrighteous sinner who has faith in Jesus Christ. The righteousness by which the person is justified (declared righteous) is not his own (theologically, &quot;proper&quot; righteousness) but that of another, Christ, (&quot;alien&quot; righteousness). &quot;That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law&quot;, said Luther. &quot;Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ&quot;. Thus faith, for Luther, is a gift from God, and &quot;...a living, bold trust in God&#x27;s grace, so certain of God&#x27;s favor that it would risk death a thousand times trusting in it.&quot; This faith grasps Christ&#x27;s righteousness and appropriates it for the believer. He explained his concept of &quot;justification&quot; in the Smalcald Articles:

Traditionally, Lutherans have taught &quot;forensic&quot; (or legal) justification, a divine verdict of acquittal pronounced on the believing sinner. God declares the sinner to be &quot;not guilty&quot; because Christ has taken his place, living a perfect life according to God&#x27;s law and suffering for his sins. For Lutherans justification is in no way dependent upon the thoughts, words, and deeds of those justified through faith alone in Christ. The new obedience that the justified sinner renders to God through sanctification follows justification as a consequence, but is not part of justification.&quot;&quot;

Lutherans believe that individuals receive this gift of salvation through faith alone. Saving faith is the knowledge of, acceptance of, and trust in the promise of the Gospel. Even faith itself is seen as a gift of God, created in the hearts of Christians by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word and Baptism. Faith is seen as an instrument that receives the gift of salvation, not something that causes salvation. Thus, Lutherans reject the &quot;decision theology&quot; which is common among modern evangelicals.

For Lutherans, justification provides the power by which Christians can grow in holiness. Such improvement comes about in the believer only after he has become a new creation in Christ. This improvement is not completed in this life: Christians are always &quot;saint and sinner at the same time&quot; (&quot;simul iustus et peccator&quot;)—saints because they are holy in God&#x27;s eyes, for Christ&#x27;s sake, and do works that please him; sinners because they continue to sin until death.

===Reformed/Calvinist===

Soteriologically, Reformed Christianity includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Anglican traditions. John Calvin&#x27;s understanding of justification was in substantial agreement with Martin Luther&#x27;s. Calvin expanded this understanding by emphasizing that justification is a part of one&#x27;s union with Christ. The center of Calvin&#x27;s soteriology was Union with Christ. For Calvin, one is united to Christ by faith, and all of the benefits of Christ come from being united to him. Therefore, anyone who is justified will also receive all of the benefits of salvation, including sanctification. Thus, while Calvin agreed in substance with the &quot;simultaneously saint and sinner&quot; formulation, he was more definite in asserting that the result of being justified is a consequent sanctification. Calvin also used more definite language than Luther, spelling out the exchange notion of imputed righteousness: that the good works that Jesus did in his life (collectively referred to as the active obedience of Christ) are imputed to his people, while their sins were imputed to him on the cross.

For Calvin, Adam and Jesus functioned as &quot;federal heads&quot;, or legal representatives, meaning that each one represented his people through his actions. When Adam sinned, all of Adam&#x27;s people were accounted to have sinned at that moment. When Jesus achieved righteousness, all of his people were accounted to be righteous at that moment. In this way Calvin attempted to simultaneously solve the problems of original sin, justification, and atonement.

Some of the technical details of this union with Christ are tied into Calvin&#x27;s understanding of the atonement and of predestination.

One outcome of Calvin&#x27;s change in center over against Luther was that he saw justification as a permanent feature of being connected to Christ: since, for Calvin, people are attached to Christ monergistically, it is therefore impossible for them to lose justification if indeed they were once justified. This idea was expressed by the Synod of Dort as the &quot;perseverance of the saint.&quot;

In recent times, two controversies have arisen in the Reformed churches over justification. The first concerns the teaching of &quot;final justification&quot; by Norman Shepherd; the second is the exact relationship of justification, sanctification, and church membership, which is part of a larger controversy concerning the &quot;Federal Vision&quot;.

===Anglicanism===
In historic Anglicanism, the eleventh article of the &quot;Thirty-Nine Articles&quot;, consistent with Reformed theology, makes it clear that justification cannot be earned, &quot;We are accounted righteous before God... not for our own works or deservings&quot;. The Most Rev. Peter Robinson, presiding bishop of the United Episcopal Church of North America, writes:

Some Anglo-Catholics believe both man and God are involved in justification. &quot;Justification has an objective and a subjective aspect. The objective is the act of God in Christ restoring the covenant and opening it to all people. The subjective aspect is faith, trust in the divine factor, acceptance of divine mercy. Apart from the presence of the subjective aspect there is no justification. People are not justified apart from their knowledge or against their will...God forgives and accepts sinners as they are into the divine fellowship, and that these sinners are in fact changed by their trust in the divine mercy.&quot; Justification, the establishment of a relationship with God through Christ, and sanctification go hand in hand. Certain Anglican theologians (especially Anglo-Catholics) argue for a faith characterized by &quot;faithfulness&quot;, where good works and the Sacraments play important roles in the life of the Christian believer. (see New Perspective on Paul)

===Arminianism/Methodism===

John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, was heavily influenced by the thought of Dutch Reformed theologian Jacob Arminius and Hugo Grotius&#x27; governmental theory of the atonement. Hence, he held that God&#x27;s work in us consisted of prevenient grace, which undoes the effects of sin sufficiently that we may then freely choose to believe. An individual&#x27;s act of faith then results in becoming part of the body of Christ, which allows one to appropriate Christ&#x27;s atonement for oneself, erasing the guilt of sin. According to the Articles of Religion in the &quot;Book of Discipline of the Methodist Church&quot;:

Methodist theology teaches that justification and regeneration occur during the New Birth:

However, once the individual has been so justified, one must then continue in the new life given; if one fails to persevere in the faith and in fact falls away from God in total unbelief, the attachment to Christ – and with it, justification – may be lost.

===Other===
====Universalists====
Universalism became a significant minority view in the 18th century, popularized by thinkers such as John Murray (the American, not the Scot). Universalism holds that Christ&#x27;s death on the cross has entirely atoned for the sin of humanity; hence, God&#x27;s wrath is or will be satisfied for all people. Conservative and liberal varieties of universalism then point in different directions. Pluralistic Unitarian Universalism asserts that many different religions all lead to God. Others teach that God&#x27;s love is sufficient to cover for sins, thus embracing some form of the moral influence theory of Peter Abelard. For some universalists, justification either was accomplished once and for all in the crucifixion, or is altogether unnecessary.
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believes that while justification is a gift from God, the recipient must choose it through striving to do good works to the extent possible. The Second Book of Nephi states &quot;...it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.&quot; In LDS theology, justification is not earned through good works, but rather chosen by striving to rid one&#x27;s life of sin. This allows God to rescue his children from sin while not infringing on their agency.
====The New Church (Emanuel Swedenborg)====
According to the doctrine of The New Church, as explained by Emanuel Swedenborg, the doctrine of justification by faith alone is a false belief which forms the foundation of much of Protestant theology. &quot;Man must of his own volition justify himself, and yet believe that justification comes from God only. Not only must man believe in God, but must love God with all his strength, and his neighbor as himself.&quot; &quot;Inasmuch as man obeys God&#x27;s commandment to love others, so God conjoins himself to man, and man to God. It is from this that man&#x27;s belief becomes a living and saving belief.&quot; &quot;It is by means of faith from charity, that a man is reformed and justified, and this is done as if from himself, and this proceeds from the Divine Truth which flows in from the Holy Spirit.&quot;

==Interactions between various doctrines==

===&quot;Sola fide&quot;===

Luther&#x27;s reformulation of justification introduced the phrase &quot;sola fide&quot;, or &quot;by faith alone&quot;. That phrase has been one of the uniting factors among various Protestant denominations; despite the wide variety of doctrines and practices among Protestants, they all agree that one is saved (often meaning &quot;justified&quot;) by faith alone.

===New Perspectives on Paul===
A range of Protestant scholars such as E.P. Sanders, N.T. Wright, and James Dunn, have attempted a re-thinking of the historical Protestant understanding of justification. They argue that Paul&#x27;s letters have too often been read through the lens of the Protestant Reformation rather than in the context of first-century Second Temple Judaism, and therefore impose a religion of legalism on their understanding of Pharisaism. This view has been criticized by a number of Reformed ministers and theologians including John Piper, D.A. Carson, and Sinclair Ferguson.

Anglican bishop N.T. Wright has written extensively on the topic of justification. Some evangelicals concerned with his view of justification worry that he marginalizes the importance of the penal substitutionary transaction that takes place at salvation.

<text>Katherine Anne &quot;Kitty&quot; Pryde is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist John Byrne and writer Chris Claremont. A mutant, Pryde possesses a &quot;phasing&quot; ability that allows her to pass through objects, hence she is intangible while using this ability. This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation.

The youngest to join the X-Men, she was first portrayed as a &quot;kid sister&quot; to many older members of the group, filling the role of literary foil to the more established characters. She occasionally used the codenames Sprite and Ariel, cycling through several uniforms until settling on her trademark black-and-gold costume. In later comic books, she becomes schooled in fighting techniques and receives ninja stealth training, which combine with her powers to make her one of the X-Men&#x27;s most proficient and reliable combatants. She is frequently deployed on surveillance and espionage missions.

During the miniseries &quot;Kitty Pryde and Wolverine&quot;, she was renamed Shadowcat, the alias she would be most associated with, and shifted to a more mature depiction in her subsequent appearances. Pryde would eventually abandon her nickname, &quot;Kitty&quot;, and switch to &quot;Kate&quot;. She was one of the main cast of characters depicted in the original &quot;Excalibur&quot; title. After momentarily joining the Guardians of the Galaxy, she assumed her then-fiancé&#x27;s superhero identity as the Star-Lord (Star-Lady). In the series &quot;Marauders&quot;, she was informally known as Captain Kate Pryde and the Red Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company. After rejoining the X-Men in the &quot;Fall of X&quot; relaunch, she assumes the name Shadowkat.

In the 20th Century Fox &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, Kitty Pryde was initially portrayed by young actresses in cameos; Sumela Kay in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000) and Katie Stuart in &quot;X2&quot; (2003). Later, Elliot Page portrayed the character in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006) and &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014) in full-length appearances.

==Publication history==
Kitty Pryde was introduced into the &quot;X-Men&quot; title as the result of a Marvel Comics editorial dictate that the series depict a school for mutant children. &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; artist John Byrne named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school (Canada&#x27;s Alberta College of Art and Design) in 1973. Byrne had told Pryde he liked her name and asked her permission to use it, promising to name his first original comics character after her. Byrne drew the character to slightly resemble an adolescent Sigourney Weaver.

The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #129 (January 1980), by writer Chris Claremont and artist Byrne, as a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. Claremont said several elements of the character&#x27;s personality were derived from those of &quot;X-Men&quot; editor Louise Simonson&#x27;s daughter, Julie. Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full-fledged X-Man in issue #139, where she was codenamed &quot;Sprite&quot;. She was the main character in issues #141–142, the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; storyline, where she is possessed by the consciousness of her older self, &quot;Kate&quot;, who time travels from a dystopian future back to the present to get the X-Men to help her prevent an eventual mass extermination of mutants. The six-issue miniseries &quot;Kitty Pryde and Wolverine&quot; (1984–1985), written by Claremont, is a coming-of-age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman, adopting the new name &quot;Shadowcat&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Kitty joined the British-based super team, Excalibur, where she remained for roughly ten years before coming back to the X-Men. In the early 2000s, she disappeared from the spotlight after semi-retiring from superhero work. She was featured in the 2002 mini-series &quot;Mekanix&quot; and came back to the main X-Men books in 2004 under the pen of Joss Whedon in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. She remained a part of the X-Men books until 2008 when she left again for roughly 2 years. After coming back, she was featured in Jason Aaron&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; and Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; &quot;All-New X-Men&quot; books.

In early 2015, she joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. After the Secret Wars event, she adopted her new alias, Star-Lord (first believed to be Star-Lady).

In 2020, Kitty Pryde was revealed to be bisexual. Her co-creator, Chris Claremont, said he had always intended this to be the case, considering Rachel Summers as a possible love interest for Pryde. However, Claremont said he was not allowed to show this at the time, as he claimed on the &quot;Xplain the X-Men&quot; podcast in 2016.

Shadowcat&#x27;s popularity had a profound effect on the real-life Kitty Pryde: the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans, she abbreviated her name to K.D. Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart. She has since stated she has mixed feelings about her fame, saying she values Byrne&#x27;s comics for their entertainment and artistic value, but wishes more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat&#x27;s namesake.

==Fictional character biography==

Katherine Anne &quot;Kitty&quot; Pryde was born in Deerfield, Illinois, to Carmen and Theresa Pryde. She is an Ashkenazi Jewish-American and her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men&#x27;s Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club&#x27;s White Queen, Emma Frost, both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen looked at her as if she were &quot;something good to eat.&quot; She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him, quickly becoming friends with Ororo Munroe. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier&#x27;s school.

Their conversation was cut short when they (along with Wolverine and Colossus) were attacked by armored mercenaries in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen&#x27;s telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty was separated from the X-Men, and not captured along with them. She managed to contact Cyclops, Phoenix, and Nightcrawler. With the help of Dazzler and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates from the Hellfire Club.

The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty&#x27;s parents. Kitty&#x27;s parents had not heard from her in more than a day, because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club&#x27;s men and then working with the X-Men to save their friends. All they knew was Kitty had left with Xavier&#x27;s &quot;students&quot; to get a soda, there had been reports that the soda shop had been blown up, and Kitty had been missing since. Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men. Phoenix then used her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty&#x27;s parents and plant false ones, resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier. Kitty was then allowed to enroll at Xavier&#x27;s school with her parents&#x27; blessing, becoming the youngest member of the team.

===Joining the X-Men===
Kitty joined the X-Men, and assumed the costumed identity of Sprite. Early in her career as an X-Man, Kitty&#x27;s adult self from an alternate future took possession of her body in the present to help X-Men thwart the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly by the second Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Kitty then singlehandedly defeated a N&#x27;Garai demon. Kitty also briefly attended the White Queen&#x27;s Massachusetts Academy when her parents became convinced that she needed to be with students of her own age, but following a failed attempt to subdue the X-Men, Frost revoked Kitty&#x27;s admission.

During her teen years, Kitty fostered a number of close relationships with others at the school and in the X-Men. She developed a crush on Colossus and became close friends with his little sister Illyana Rasputin. Initially uneasy around Nightcrawler and other mutants with physical deformities, Kitty finally overcame her fears and became close friends with him. Kitty also befriended Lockheed, a highly intelligent alien resembling a dragon, who followed her home after a mission in outer space. Lockheed is extremely loyal to Kitty, and the two of them share a psychic bond. Wolverine became something of a mentor to Kitty despite his usually gruff personality. Storm came to view Kitty as the daughter she never had.

Though Xavier has threatened to reassign Kitty to the New Mutants, a team of younger mutants he established in the absence of the X-Men, ever since the X-Men returned from outer space, she never ended up joining the group, who she derisively calls the &quot;X-Babies&quot;. Kitty was later abducted by the Morlocks and nearly forced to wed Caliban. She was then abducted by the White Queen, but rescued by the New Mutants.

During this time, Kitty began to date Colossus, although this did not last long. Colossus developed feelings for an alien woman named Zsaji whom he met on the Beyonder&#x27;s planet in the first Secret Wars. Colossus&#x27; feelings toward Zsaji were primarily a side effect of her own unique healing abilities, which she had used on him after he became injured. Regardless, Colossus&#x27; feelings were real and he returned to Earth consumed with grief after Zsaji&#x27;s death. He admitted to Kitty that he loved Zsaji, which hurt her deeply and ended the budding romantic relationship. Kitty had made good friends with a local boy from Salem Central named Doug Ramsey around this time, but her feelings for him never went as deep as his for her, and they never actually dated, though they remained close, even more so after Doug&#x27;s status as a mutant was revealed and he joined the New Mutants under the codename Cypher. They remained friends until his death some time later.

===Ogun===
During the 1984–1985 &quot;Kitty Pryde and Wolverine&quot; miniseries, Kitty is possessed by a demon, the ninja Ogun. Ogun psychically bestows upon Kitty a virtual lifetime of martial arts training. Kitty was brainwashed by Ogun into becoming a ninja assassin, and was sent to attack Wolverine. Kitty is able to resist Ogun&#x27;s influence with Wolverine&#x27;s help, and the two form a strong teacher/student bond, which helps them in vanquishing Ogun. Kitty returns to the X-Men, no longer the innocent girl they once knew, and officially adopts the codename Shadowcat.

===Morlock Massacre===
While trying to save Rogue, Kitty was badly injured by Harpoon&#x27;s energy spear during the Mutant Massacre story arc, in the massacre of the Morlocks, with the result that she lost control of her power and was stuck in an intangible state and could not regain her solidity. She was rushed to Muir Island along with other surviving casualties of the Massacre to be tended to by Moira MacTaggert. MacTaggert was able to keep Kitty&#x27;s condition from deteriorating to the point where she completely lost physical substance and ceased to exist, but was not able to do any more to help her.

At this time, Kitty&#x27;s natural state was to be intangible. Where she once had to make a conscious effort to phase, she could now only maintain her solidity through an act of conscious will. The X-Men went to Reed Richards, Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four, for aid, but Richards initially refused because he was not sure he would be able to help.

Having nowhere else to go, the X-Men turned to Richards&#x27; enemy Doctor Doom. This created a moral dilemma for both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, and both teams fought each other because the Fantastic Four were trying to stop the treatment while the X-Men were determined to save Kitty&#x27;s life. In the end, both the personal crisis of the Fantastic Four and the life of Shadowcat were saved after Franklin Richards, with the help of Lockheed, brought both teams to their senses. Kitty has since recovered from this state and now has full control over her power again.

===Excalibur===
Among the others injured and brought to Muir Isle were Colossus and Nightcrawler, although Colossus left the United Kingdom shortly after being released from MacTaggert&#x27;s care to join the rest of the X-Men on their mission to battle the Adversary. The X-Men sacrificed their lives to defeat the Adversary, the battle and their sacrifice was televised and broadcast across the world. The X-Men were resurrected later in the same issue, unknown to the world at large, but chose to keep a low profile and perpetuate the belief that they were still dead. This strategy was enforced to more effectively fight their enemies. This meant avoiding contact with friends and family, including Kitty. Thinking the X-Men were dead, Kitty and Nightcrawler joined Rachel Summers, Captain Britain, and Meggan to form the Britain-based team Excalibur following an adventure in which they saved Rachel from Technet. For a brief time, Kitty studied at St. Searle&#x27;s School for Girls in Britain. During her time with Excalibur, Kitty developed a crush on Professor Alistaire Stuart which went unreciprocated since Alistaire was attracted to Rachel. Later, she was romantically involved with former Black Air agent Pete Wisdom. At some point Kitty was recruited by the international law enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. to repair the computer system of their flying headquarters. Kitty discovered the problem was due to Ogun&#x27;s spirit having infiltrated the computer system, and with the aid of Wolverine, she managed to purge Ogun&#x27;s presence. During this time, Kitty was attracted to a S.H.I.E.L.D. intern her own age, and this made her begin to doubt her relationship with Wisdom. Soon after, she broke off their relationship.

===Back to the X-Men===
After Excalibur&#x27;s dissolution, Shadowcat, Nightcrawler, and Colossus return to the X-Men. While returning, they faced a group of imposters following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X. While tracking Mystique, she stumbles onto prophetic diaries that belonged to Irene Adler, a precognitive. During the six-month gap, Kitty visited Genosha. Whatever she experienced there is unknown (although presumably connected to her father, living on Genosha at the time), but it had a profound effect on her. She cut her hair and began to act rebelliously, also using one of Wolverine&#x27;s bone claws broken off during battle as a weapon. Kitty remained with the X-Men for a while before leaving after the apparent death of Colossus. Trying to give herself a normal life, she attended the University of Chicago. During this time, her father was killed when Cassandra Nova&#x27;s Sentinels destroyed Genosha. Kitty later finds a recording of his death due to exploring footage of the attack. She is also kidnapped by William Stryker, but the X-Treme X-Men team helped her escape, and she assisted them on several missions.

At the start of Joss Whedon&#x27;s run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, Kitty once again rejoins the X-Men, despite having extreme reservations about working with the former White Queen, given their history. This was the primary reason why Frost herself wanted Kitty on the team, as a sort of &quot;safety&quot; should Frost ever revert to type. Frost reasoned that the person who trusted her least would be most likely to spot such behavior. On one of the team&#x27;s first missions, Shadowcat discovered Colossus was alive. After some initial awkwardness, Kitty and Colossus resumed dating.

Kitty Pryde appeared alongside Colossus in the &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; arc in X-Men. They are the two X-Men left to look after the students while the rest of the X-Men leave for Mystique&#x27;s home in Mississippi to check up on Rogue, during which they are ambushed by the Marauders. Kitty and Colossus, meanwhile, attempt to protect the students from a faction of the Marauders led by Exodus. It is revealed over the course of the story that Kitty, worried of the Destiny Diaries&#x27; safety, devised a plan with Cyclops and Emma Frost to hide them and have Emma wipe the location from her mind. The location could only be revealed by a code word spoken to Kitty. The arc concludes with a battle between Iceman and Cannonball against the Marauders for the diaries, during which they are destroyed by Gambit.

In the &quot;Torn&quot; arc, the latest incarnation of the Hellfire Club begin an assault on Xavier&#x27;s School. Kitty fulfilled the role that Emma Frost envisioned, personally taking down Frost and imprisoning her, only to fall under a telepathic delusion created by Hellfire member Perfection, who claimed to be the true, unreformed Emma Frost. Under this delusion, Kitty was made to believe that she and Colossus had conceived a child, which was later taken away by the X-Men because its potential mutant abilities were supposedly dangerous. Kitty reacts in the delusion by attempting to rescue the child from a near-inescapable &quot;box&quot; in the depths of the school, unaware that in reality she is freeing an alien entity, Stuff, who contains the trapped consciousness of Cassandra Nova, the apparent ringleader of this new Hellfire Club. A newly awakened Cyclops revealed that the new Hellfire Club, including Perfection and Nova, are actually mental projections created by a piece of Cassandra Nova&#x27;s consciousness; which became lodged in Emma&#x27;s mind during the X-Men&#x27;s last confrontation with her, playing on her survivor&#x27;s guilt over the Genoshan massacre, and utilizing Emma&#x27;s telepathy to both confound the X-Men and orchestrate her (Nova&#x27;s) escape from the Stuff body. As Cyclops killed the mental projections, Emma tried to force Kitty to kill her to get rid of Nova. Undeterred, Cassandra Nova switched her focus to attempt to transfer her mind to Hisako Ichiki. It appears that Nova did not succeed, as the team was transported to S.W.O.R.D.&#x27;s air station en route to Ord&#x27;s Breakworld for the &quot;Unstoppable&quot; arc that concludes Whedon&#x27;s run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;.

===Breakworld===
As the team prepares to end the confrontation with the Breakworld leader, the team splits up—with Kitty on the team appointed to stop the missile pointed at Earth. Kitty phases into the missile to disrupt its circuitry noting that it is composed of the same material as the rest of Breakworld, a material that is difficult and exhausting for her to phase through. After phasing for a mile into the missile, Kitty finds the center only to discover it empty. The missile is fired, causing Kitty to pass out inside of it as Beast discovers too late that due to its shape, trajectory, and lack of internal circuitry, the Breakworld&#x27;s weapon is not a missile, but a bullet. As the bullet hurtles toward Earth, Kitty lies unconscious within it.

As the situation becomes increasingly dire, Emma establishes mental contact with Kitty, reassuring her that she will come out of this fine, though it eventually becomes clear to both that the situation will be grim. Kitty and Emma come to an understanding and reconciliation, Emma stating that she never wanted something like this to happen to her. Kitty then phases the bullet through Earth, but is trapped within. At the end of &quot;Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men&quot;, Scott Summers mentions that Doctor Strange, Reed Richards, and some &quot;top men&quot; tried to save her, but believe she has fused to the bullet, as it continues to hurtle through space. Whether she is alive or dead is unknown, though the X-Men consider her lost to them.

As a result of these events Kitty does not appear in the X-Men crossover event X-Men: Messiah Complex, since this takes place after the events of &quot;Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men&quot;. She is briefly mentioned in the aftermath of the Messiah Complex, by Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine, as the three of them discuss &quot;losing her.&quot;

To cope with Kitty&#x27;s loss, Colossus takes down a group of Russian criminals dealing in human trafficking, and gets a tattoo of the name &#x27;Katya&#x27; on his chest. Emma begins having a recurring dream in which she hears a voice whom she believes is Kitty&#x27;s trying to reach out to her.

It was later confirmed by Abigail Brand that Kitty Pryde was still alive within the bullet, but because the bullet&#x27;s design would harden as time went on, it would become increasingly difficult to break the bullet open.

===Return===
After the X-Men move to the island of Utopia, Magneto arrives on the island professing his desire to join and support the X-Men in their effort to unite the world&#x27;s remaining mutants. The X-Men reluctantly let him stay, remaining wary of him despite his efforts to gain their trust. In a final bid to gain their trust, Magneto focuses his powers, attempting to divert the interstellar path of the metal bullet Kitty is trapped in and bring her home to Earth. Meanwhile, inside the bullet, Kitty is revealed to still be alive. Unbeknownst to the others, Magneto had encountered the bullet earlier while attempting to regain his powers with the High Evolutionary and surmised that Kitty was inside. Despite this and the High Evolutionary&#x27;s apparent ability to retrieve the bullet and Kitty, Magneto chose to focus on regaining his powers, secretly keeping tabs on the bullet until his decision to draw it back to Earth. During her time trapped inside the bullet, Kitty keeps herself and the bullet phased to avoid collisions with any inhabited objects in its path.

Magneto brings Kitty Pryde safely down to Earth by cracking the bullet in two and levitating Kitty to the ground. When she and Colossus try to touch, it is revealed that she is trapped in her intangible form, unable to speak, and the X-Men place her in a protective chamber similar to the one used for her following the events of the Mutant Massacre. How Kitty survived her time in the bullet is unclear to the X-Men&#x27;s science team, where the X-Men discover that all her bodily functions halted. An analysis by Kavita Rao hypothesizes that Kitty created an intense muscle memory to keep herself and the bullet phased and has &quot;forgotten&quot; how to un-phase.

During a conversation with Colossus, with Emma Frost acting as the psi-conduit, Kitty picks up Emma&#x27;s stray thoughts on killing the captive Sebastian Shaw, to prevent Namor from discovering she previously lied to him. While disgusted at Emma&#x27;s intentions, Kitty offers a compromise. Due to her current ghost state, she is the perfect tool for making Shaw disappear.

In a storyline in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, the Breakworlders make their way to Earth. During the conflict between the Breakworlder Kr&#x27;uun and the X-Men, Kitty is slain and resurrected by Kr&#x27;uun&#x27;s mate in an alien ritual, which results in her powers returning to normal.

===Regenesis===
Shortly thereafter, Kitty breaks up with Colossus, and decides to return with Wolverine to Westchester to open the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. In &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; #4, she appears to be suddenly pregnant, but the pregnancy was revealed to be a Brood infestation, and it was swiftly dealt with by a team of X-Men. Since returning to Westchester, Kitty has shared several kisses with Iceman. During the events of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Kitty does not take a side, but instead decides to stay at the school to work with the students. Once Bobby returned from working with the X-Men after realizing that the Phoenix had corrupted them, he and Kitty finally decide to go on a date.

===All-New X-Men===
After Beast brings the original five X-Men into the future to stop Cyclops in the present, Kitty volunteers to take responsibility for the temporally relocated X-Men while they work to undo this dark future. This soon puts her at odds with the rest of her team as they believed the original five should go back to their own time to prevent any damage to the space-time continuity. Eventually, this leads Kitty to take the decision of abandoning the school with the time-displaced X-Men and join Cyclops&#x27;s X-Men at the New Xavier School. During the first few weeks at the New Xavier School, Jean Grey is abducted by the Shiar Empire to stand trial for her future self&#x27;s crimes. Kitty and the time-displaced X-Men team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and succeed in rescuing Jean from the Shiar. At the conclusion of the storyline, Kitty begins a long-distance, flirtatious relationship with Starlord, Peter Quill.

===The Black Vortex===
In the following weeks, Kitty&#x27;s relationship with Peter Quill evolves more and more as they developed stronger feelings for each other every day. At one point, Quill gets captured during one of their dates and she has no option but to go to his rescue, despite her fear of space as a result of her being trapped on the giant space bullet. After rescuing Peter, she decides to stay in space with him. Then, Kitty convinces Peter to steal a powerful artifact called the Black Vortex from his father J&#x27;son. Soon, they find themselves being chased by J&#x27;son&#x27;s assassination squad, the Slaughter Lords. In despair, they request the aid of the X-Men and the Guardians of the Galaxy to protect the Vortex. After a few of their own friends can&#x27;t resist the temptation and submit to the Vortex, betray the team, and escape with the artifact; the team splits and Kitty stays in Spartax to help an orphanage. She is encased in amber after Thane (who was allied with J&#x27;son) freezes the whole planet along with the people inside it; but thanks to her phasing powers, she manages to get out of the amber. Then the Brood attacks Spartax, planning to use every encased person to lay eggs and create an army of Brood to start invading other planets and conquering them. Kitty feels the only way to stop them is by submitting to the Vortex herself as she&#x27;s the only one who can resist the cosmic corruption. She reluctantly submits and becomes a being of unlimited power. After being reminded of the love between her and Peter Quill, she goes back and phases all the amber that encased Spartax, along with the Broods trying to infect the people, and sends them all to another dimension. Kitty doesn&#x27;t give up the cosmic power but admits to Peter that she is afraid of it. Peter promises her that he will never abandon her no matter how much she changes. Then, Peter kneels and proposes marriage to Kitty. She, with tears in her eyes, accepts. Later when Star Lord is declared Emperor of Spartax she is told she will become the first lady of Spartax.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Kitty takes on the mantle of Star Lord and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy in Peter Quill&#x27;s place so he can take on his royal duties. When Hala the Accuser massacres Spartax in an attempt to make Quill pay for J&#x27;son&#x27;s actions against her people, she initially easily lays waste to the capitol and overpowers the Guardians. After the Guardians regroup and formulate a strategy to defeat her, Kitty manages to partially phase Hala into the ground so the rest of the Guardians can knock her out and separate her from her weapon. After Quill loses his title as king he and Kitty end up on a mission with the rest of the Guardians on a concentration camp prison planet owned by the Badoon after Gamora gave them information on it so they can free Angela. Once there, Kitty has a personal reaction upon seeing the prisoners and makes it her mission to liberate everyone there and defeat the captors, as it reminds her of Nazi concentration camps. After Quill gets captured and sentenced to death in an arena battle, Kitty finds and kills one of the Badoon leaders by phasing his heart out of his body. When Captain Marvel summons the Guardians to Earth to help her address Tony Stark, Kitty learns that Thanos is a prisoner on Earth and tries to convince Quill to tell Gamora. When fighting starts Kitty woefully realizes that some of her former students are on Tony Stark&#x27;s side instead of fighting with Captain Marvel. During the battle the Guardians&#x27; ship was destroyed, effectively stranding them on Earth. After helping the Guardians stop Thanos from leading an invasion from the Negative Zone the Guardians are given a new ship; however, Kitty decides to stay on Earth and ends her time with the Guardians and Quill.

===Leading the X-Men===

Upon returning to Earth, Kitty hopes to finally regain a semblance of a normal life but ends up approached by Storm, who informs Kitty of everything the X-Men have gone through while Kitty was away. Storm announces to Kitty that she intends to step down as leader of the X-Men due to the guilt that she feels for leading the X-Men to war and offers Kitty her position. After touring X-Haven and seeing how much things have changed and how much things need to change for the better, Kitty agrees to lead the X-Men as long as Storm remains on the team. Her next act is to relocate the mansion from Limbo to Central Park, New York so the X-Men can refocus on being part of the world instead of fearing it under the belief that if the X-Men truly are to be seen as heroes, then they need to actually live in the world that they are trying to save instead of constantly worrying about their own survival.

Under Kitty&#x27;s new leadership, the X-Men go through some small changes to shed their history and make new names for themselves, such as convincing Rachel Summers to change her code name to Prestige and renaming the mansion as The Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach. Kitty learns first-hand how hard it is to balance leading the X-Men as well as managing the mansion when there are many political factors trying to deliberately get in the way of the X-Men. She also begins to have awkward one-on-one moments with Colossus; they try to remain friends, but given their long history their interactions swiftly become complicated. Kitty&#x27;s first case as field leader of the X-Men sees her and her team taking on a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. After discovering that an outspoken anti-mutant politician brainwashed this new Brotherhood to work for her to publicly discredit mutants, Kitty threatened to expose her if she continued exploiting mutants for her own personal gain.

===Dawn of X===
After Krakoa became a new sovereign nation for Mutants, Kitty Pryde, now going by Captain Kate Pryde, discovers she is the sole mutant who is, for unknown reasons, unable to use the various warp gates leading to Krakoa. It is implied that she has done something to anger Krakoa, but that restriction does not mean Kitty cannot use other means to reach the mutant homeland. She steals a boat and sets sail for the island. Kitty&#x27;s time on Krakoa proves to be just as fruitless, as the island&#x27;s natural resources (like flowers that grow into biome homes) are similarly prohibited to Kitty. Emma Frost comes asking Kitty to take up a special mission: taking a bigger boat out to serve as pirate captain on the X-Men&#x27;s mission to liberate mutants trapped in oppressive countries that do not recognize mutant sovereignty, while also smuggling and supplying for Emma&#x27;s Hellfire Trading Company the lifesaving drugs the X-Men provide to humans. Kate Pryde is later appointed the new Red Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company by Emma Frost, to the dismay of Sebastian Shaw. Seeing Pryde as an obstacle to his complete control of the Hellfire Corporation, Shaw began plotting against Kate and her crew. After taking notice how Emma became overprotective of the newly crowned Red Queen, Shaw realized that for the same reason she can&#x27;t travel through Krakoa&#x27;s gates nor read or understand the Krakoan language until Emma implanted it in her brain, the X-Men&#x27;s Resurrection Protocols also won&#x27;t apply to her, which means Kate cannot be resurrected if she died. He orchestrated a distraction by paying off human supremacists Homines Verendi to stage an attack on his own son. Once Kate was defenseless, Shaw emerged from below deck and ensnared Lockheed with a net gun, making him a helpless hostage. He then released Krakoan seeds at her feet, which wrapped around her and prevented her from using her powers. He then dropped her and Lockheed into the sea. While Lockheed was able to survive, Kate sank helplessly, and once her head dropped under the surface, she had no air left and drowned instantly. Her death is later confirmed by Bishop as he retrieves Kate&#x27;s body, as it was also established that the Resurrection Protocols indeed do not apply to Kate, as the Five, for reasons unknown, cannot resurrect her. However, she is later resurrected, as Emma Frost realized that it was due to the nature of Kate&#x27;s intangibility powers that her mindless body was unable to break out of the egg.

==Powers and abilities==

Kitty is a mutant with the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atomic particles through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed when Shadowcat has finished passing through the object. This process is called &quot;phasing&quot; or quantum tunneling and it renders her almost completely intangible to physical touch. Shadowcat passes through objects at the same speed at which she is moving before entering them. Originally unable to breathe while inside an object, she can now phase through solid objects without needing to hold her breath such as when traveling underground or phasing buildings through the Earth’s surface. The use of her abilities also interferes with electrical systems by disrupting the flow of electrons from atom to atom when she passes through, including the bio-electric systems of living bodies if she concentrates in the right way. This typically causes machines to malfunction or be destroyed, and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings.

Using her power began as an optional ability, but for a period (over ten years of published comics, approximately two years in-continuity) Kitty existed in a naturally &quot;phased&quot; state, and had to consciously choose to become solid. Kitty has returned to her original form and is normally solid and must choose to use her power. While phasing, she does not physically walk on surfaces, but rather interacts with the molecules of air above them, allowing her to ascend and descend, causing her to seemingly walk on air. While phased, she is immune to most physical attacks and has some resistance to telepathy as her psyche may reside in other dimensions from where she phases. The density of some materials (such as adamantium) can prove deleterious to her phasing, causing her to be severely disoriented or experience pain if she tries to pass through them. Some energy attacks also prove problematic for Kitty. For example an energy blast fired by Harpoon, a member of the Marauders, caused her to lose her capacity to become and stay fully tangible for months. Magic and magical beings can harm her in her phased state, as demonstrated in a battle with a N&#x27;Garai demon whose claws left no visible marks but caused Kitty severe pain as they passed through her intangible body.

Kitty can extend her powers to phase other people and objects so long as they establish and maintain physical contact with her. She readily extends this to her own clothing, and has been shown to affect objects with mass up to that of a small truck. She has threatened to leave people phased into a wall, and used her power offensively to harm the Technarch Magus, and Danger.

Kitty&#x27;s powers appear to have increased over the years. During an &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; story arc she is kidnapped by Reverend William Stryker, she phases out of sync with Earth&#x27;s rotation to move from one place in the world (east or west) to another seemingly instantaneously. At the climax of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, Kitty phases a 10 mi (16 km) long &quot;bullet&quot; composed of super-dense alien metals through the entire planet Earth. This feat caused her considerable strain and she was unable to phase out of the bullet. Originally, Kitty found it difficult to impossible to phase only part of her body at a time. In the Days of Future Past story arc, she is possessed by her older future self, allowing her to solidify only her shoulder while phasing the rest of her body through Destiny—a feat explicitly beyond the 13-year-old Kitty&#x27;s abilities. By contrast, the Kitty Pryde of Joss Whedon&#x27;s run can punch and kick someone standing on the other side of a wall, selectively phasing and unphasing body parts as necessary. She can even run and leap through an armed opponent, grabbing their weapon as she passes by, which presumably requires her to solidify only the surface area of the palms of her hands and then immediately phase both her palms and the weapon.

Besides her mutant powers, Kitty is a genius in the field of applied technology and computer science. She is highly talented in the design and use of computer hardware. She is a skilled pilot of piston and jet engine aircraft, and a competent pilot of certain advanced interstellar vehicles. She has previously shown a unique ability to wield the Soulsword and also be harmed by it. Since her possession by the ninja demon Ogun, she has been consistently shown to be an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having since been endowed with a lifetime of training in the martial arts of Japanese ninja and samurai.

She is a professional-level dancer in both ballet and modern dance. She speaks fluent English, Japanese, Russian, and the royal and standard languages of the alien Shi&#x27;ar and Skrull, and has moderate expertise in Gaelic, Hebrew, and German.

Kitty also shares a mental/empathic connection with her pet dragon Lockheed; both she and the alien dragon can &quot;sense&quot; each other&#x27;s presence at times and generally understand one another&#x27;s thoughts and actions.

When Kitty used the Black Vortex, her powers were augmented to a cosmic scale making her a god-like being. She can phase through any material of any density and can even phase a planet out of Thane&#x27;s amber, whereas in her normal state it is an extremely difficult task to simply phase herself out of the amber. She can also apparently transverse between the planes of the multiverse and is immune to the effects of space. Her appearance can be changed but her natural form appears to be rather gaseous in look.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Chris Arrant of &quot;Newsarama&quot; referred to Kitty Pryde as one of the &quot;best Marvel characters of all time&quot;, writing, &quot;The X-Men are amazing - uncanny, even - but it wasn&#x27;t until Kitty Pryde entered the picture that readers gained a real perspective of how uncanny. Created as a &#x27;girl next door&#x27;/grounded character in the original Chris Claremont/John Byrne era, Shadowcat was a hit character from the start - and she only got better over the years. [...] Of all the mutant characters, Kitty Pryde has proven to be the most human when it comes to evolution and growth, And that doesn&#x27;t just make it stand out among her fellow X-Men, but among the entire Marvel Comics pantheon as well.&quot; David Uzumeri of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; described Kitty Pryde as a &quot;fan-favorite phasing mutant&quot;, stating, &quot;She had an appropriately temporary permanent goodbye, and then she was gone, careening through the void in a ballistic dong. When you think about it, this is somewhat appropriate for a character who&#x27;s largely fulfilled the role of &quot;dream girlfriend&quot; for the majority of X-Men writers and readers. Because for a character who purportedly acts as a role model for girls and women, she&#x27;s always seemed like more of a wish-fulfillment fantasy for nerdy teenagers (and fetishistic British comic writers). Kitty was always pretty close to perfect; whatever errors she made were always well-intentioned. [...] The fact is, Kitty&#x27;s moral perfection has become her character, since everyone loves her so much that nobody wants to drag her through any mud. Because she almost never makes mistakes, she can&#x27;t really progress as a character by learning from them – she&#x27;s a patron saint.&quot; Eric Diaz of &quot;Nerdist&quot; called Kitty Pryde &quot;smart and resourceful&quot;, saying, &quot;The character of Kitty was introduced in 1980, in the middle of the legendary run from creators Chris Claremont and John Byrne on Uncanny X-Men. The 14 year old mutant, who could phase through solid objects, was the youngest member of the team and the wish fulfillment character for millions of kids who read X-Men comics. Fans got to see Kitty grow up to become a competent and capable leader over the years. For non-comics fans, she was maybe best known for being part of the X-Men arcade game from the early &#x27;90s, which was based on the animated pilot Pryde of the X-Men. But Katherine Pryde, despite her popularity, has never had much in the way of solo stories to base a movie on.&quot; Kat Vendetti of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; called Kitty Pryde a &quot;protector and a hero&quot;, asserting, &quot;Throughout her history, Kitty Pryde&#x27;s characterization has been both intricate and multifaceted. She has used her strength and wit to save the X-Men, but she also embraces her emotions to stand up for what she wants. She can save the day when others can&#x27;t, and she&#x27;s also not afraid to express her more vulnerable sides. Through it all, Kitty Pryde never shies away from representing everything she stands for. From the moment we met her and as we continue to know her, Kitty has proven time and again to be a natural and worthy leader. Kitty Pryde remains the best choice to lead the team in X-Men Gold; she has everything it takes to be the best leader the X-Men have ever had.&quot;

Jonathan Thompson of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; referred to Kitty Pryde as the &quot;heart and soul of the X-Men&quot;, stating, &quot;Ever since she first appeared in 1980&#x27;s &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #129, Kitty Pryde has been a symbol of female empowerment for fans. She may have seemed like just another teenage mutant who can phase through solid matter, but she was not to be underestimated. [...] Yet, despite this long history in the comics, many people may not know Kitty as well as they think they do. How can she send someone&#x27;s consciousness back in time in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;? How powerful is she? Does she have a romantic past with Colossus in the films? Is that story about the origin of her name true? If you got your X-Men education from the films rather than the comics, there is a lot worth learning about Kitty that makes her a fuller character on the screen. Alternatively, if you have followed Kitty for years through the source material, you may have some questions (or critiques) regarding the live-action version. And then, of course, there is the world of animation which reinterpreted Kitty in a few different ways. No matter what your preferred medium is, there is undoubtedly something more to learn about her.&quot; Nick Abadzis of &quot;Tor.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Kitty led a long line of mutant teenagers who, in turn, represent the disaffected and disenchanted, the rebellious and the geeky. But Kitty was the first and somehow remains the archetype. Her powers initially seemed a secondary element in the appeal of the character, whose intelligence and Jewish ancestry were highlighted. Yet Kitty&#x27;s ability to &quot;phase&quot; was, to a degree, an ingenious metaphor for that teenage desire to sometimes just disappear. Who, at that age, hasn&#x27;t sometimes felt dumb and socially awkward enough to want the world to just swallow them up? Kitty could do it—and it was so cool. [...] Outside the X-Men the reader, through Kitty, caught further glimpses of what it might be like to be a mutant—or, crucially, a member of any minority group—which, in turn, helped elevate the comic book from simple monthly melodrama into an ongoing saga and pop cultural phenomenon.&quot; Thomas Bacon of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; asserted, &quot;Nobody could have predicted just how influential Kitty Pryde would be. In a recent Twitter thread, &quot;The Claremont Run&quot; noted Kitty became Claremont&#x27;s favorite &quot;viewpoint character&quot;, the lens through which readers experienced the X-Men. It was a smart move because Claremont was indulging in increasingly adult themes. Kitty made her debut in the middle of the &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; - and her youthful perspective heightened the narrative impact. But Claremont was quick to ensure readers that Kitty was a capable and competent new addition [...] Brian Bendis openly admits she was his comic book crush, which explains why Kitty wound up dating Peter Parker in his &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; relaunch. Warren Ellis infamously aged her up so she could have a relationship with the mutant Pete Wisdom, who was basically Ellis&#x27; own analog in the Marvel Comics Universe. But her greatest impact was through Joss Whedon, who recalled that famous issue of a teenager who was capable enough to take down a demon when he was creating &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In fact, Whedon has gone so far as to refer to Kitty as the mother of Buffy, the main inspiration for the Slayer.&quot; Hilary Goldstein and Richard George of &quot;IGN&quot; stated, &quot;Most mutants come to Xavier&#x27;s having experienced great trauma and difficulty in their youth. Kitty arrived as an innocent with the seemingly innocuous power to turn intangible. She is the mutant everyman, the common girl turned superhero. Marvel has attempted to replicate Kitty Pryde on several occasions, most notably with Jubilee, but there&#x27;s something special about Kitty that puts her above the rest. She&#x27;s strong-willed, creative and fiercely loyal. Just as her pet dragon, Lockheed, became instantly attached to Kitty, we were hooked early on. Who could have guessed long ago that she would become one of the most endearing characters in the X-Men Universe?&quot;

== Literary reception ==

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde&quot; - 2015 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde&quot; #1 was the 39th best selling comic book in July 2015.

Brian Delpozo of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde&quot; #1 is one of the best issues to come out of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline so far. While its plot is a bit exposition heavy at the start, it eventually starts moving at a brisk pace, with very strong characters and fun art. If the darkness of most of Battleworld is bringing you down, I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this issue a read.&quot; Levi Hunt of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde&quot; #1 a grade of 8.8 out of 10, writing, &quot;&quot;Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde&quot; is a Disney movie of a comic—and that&#x27;s not just because Peter Quill spends half the issue singing Little Mermaid songs. Peter is one of the only survivors of the 616-Marvel Universe still alive and now he is hiding out among God Doom&#x27;s people, just trying not to get caught. Suddenly his life changes when he meets an alternate-reality version of his fiancé – Kitty Pryde. This book has all the hijinks, humor, and heart of Tangled or Aladdin, and that&#x27;s just where the Disney comparisons start. Alti Firmansyah draws this book with all of expressive, big-eyed, joy of Disney minimalism. It perfectly complements Sam Humphries&#x27;s wonderful story and makes for an enjoyable read for (almost) all ages.&quot;

==Other versions==
In addition to her mainstream incarnation, Kitty Pryde has been depicted in other fictional universes.

===Age of Apocalypse===

In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Kitty grows up under harsh circumstances and her nature reflects it. She has short hair, tight clothes, and chain smokes cigarettes. Her parents are killed in the Chicago Cullings, and she is forcibly recruited into Apocalypse&#x27;s army, but is later rescued by Colossus. Magneto puts Shadowcat under Weapon X&#x27;s training, hoping to turn her into the X-Men&#x27;s assassin, and she is given a set of retractable artificial claws around each wrist to better imitate her teacher&#x27;s fighting style. After the fallout between Colossus and Magneto, Shadowcat sides with Colossus, whom she has married. Instead of leaving the fight against Apocalypse altogether, the couple become the teachers of Generation Next. The two submit their trainees to harsh situations, giving them little comfort despite the fact that Shadowcat is close to the age of her students.

Shadowcat assists the team in rescuing Illyana Rasputin from the Seattle Core, and, at Colossus&#x27; behest, abandons her students after Illyana is saved. She is killed by Colossus in his ruthless obsession to protect his sister, Illyana; coming between an enraged Colossus and his endangered sister, Shadowcat never believed he would harm her.

===Days of Future Past===
In the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline (Earth-811), Shadowcat goes by the name Kate Pryde. Kate attempts to go back in time to prevent the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly by Mystique and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. She succeeds, only to create a separate timeline where the events of her past still come to pass. After returning to her own time Kate helps Rachel Summers escape back to the timeline she just created. Captured by Sentinels, Kate escapes by phasing through her inhibitor collar and fell into a time warp, causing her to merge with the Sentinel that was scanning her, and arrives in the timeline Rachel is inhabiting. Kate&#x27;s mind settles in a small, metal, off-spherical body and becomes known as Widget. After a few adventures in that timeline, mostly in company with her Earth-616 counterpart&#x27;s team Excalibur, Kate regains her memory and returns to her original timeline where she is able to reprogram the ruling Sentinels to protect life, ending their tyranny.

===Earth X===
In &quot;Earth X&quot; it is revealed in the appendix of issue six that Kitty Pryde is killed saving Colossus while he could not shift into his metal form. Instead of phasing the bullet through her, she heroically takes the bullet and is killed.

===Exiles===

A version of Kitty Pryde codenamed Cat first appeared in &quot;Exiles&quot; #96. She is younger than her Earth-616 counterpart. She has the appearance and powers of the normal Shadowcat although she wears a different costume. Prior to her joining the Exiles, this version of Kitty had been recruited by Emma Frost as one of the core agents of the Hellfire Club&#x27;s strike force. She helps Psylocke defeat Doom&#x27;s soldiers who have invaded the Panoptichron. She helps retrieve Blink, Morph, and Sabretooth from being scattered across the multiverse. She works as a computer expert for the team and is a full member of the Exiles.

Cat&#x27;s skill with using her powers means she is not tied to any dimension and can see through various realities, including those of the mind (for instance seeing the various personalities in Sage&#x27;s mind as &quot;ghosts&quot; surrounding her). Her arrival in the Crystal Palace and connection to its computers has increased this, giving her the ability to &quot;cascade&quot; through different alternative versions of herself, altering her appearance and details of her powers. Amongst other versions, she has assumed the form of a Kitty Pryde with the appearance and powers of Tigra. During the New Exiles&#x27; last mission Cat faced off against Madame Hydra (Sue Storm) and killed her at the cost of her own life.

There has been another version of Kitty that appeared in the King Hyperion story arc (&quot;Exiles&quot; #38-40). She had survived an attack on the X-Mansion by the Sentinels. The Colossus from her universe had been killed in the attack but she had the same feelings towards Weapon X&#x27;s Colossus even though he was not her Colossus. The two eventually fell in love with each other. Unfortunately this did not last since she died with Colossus when they were shot into the empty vacuum of space by Hyperion.

===House of M===
When the Scarlet Witch altered reality in the 616 Universe, creating the reality known as House of M where mutants were the dominant population, Kitty Pryde was a teacher in a public middle school in Cincinnati, Ohio. Like many of the heroes of Earth 616, she is reminded of the true reality by Layla Miller and recruited in the fight to restore reality.

===Magik===
In the limited series &quot;Magik (Illyana and Storm)&quot;, an alternative reality Kitty renames herself &quot;Cat&quot; after she is mutated by the demonic sorcerer Belasco into a more feline form, with cat eyes, whiskers, a tail, and enhanced physical abilities and senses. Trapped in Belasco&#x27;s Limbo, Cat takes a militant view towards defeating the sorcerer, eschewing the magic that her reality&#x27;s Storm embraces, instead turning to skills in swordplay and physical combat. She tries to save the Illyana Rasputin of Earth-616 from corruption through magic by taking Illyana into the wilderness of Limbo and teaching the child to fight and survive. Like the Kitty Pryde of Earth-616 eventually would, Cat became Illyana&#x27;s best friend, but more in the role of an older sister due to the difference in their ages.

Cat&#x27;s plan goes awry when the pair&#x27;s attempt to confront Belasco fails, at the cost of the life of an enslaved Nightcrawler; Illyana falls under Belasco&#x27;s influence and Cat is further transformed towards a feline, with a semi-animalistic mind completely loyal to Belasco. Cat is eventually slain by Illyana when Belasco sets Cat upon his rebellious apprentice; facing death at Cat&#x27;s hands and knowing that, deep down, a part of Kitty still exists and hates her enslavement, Illyana broke Cat&#x27;s neck in self-defense.

Long after Illyana overthrows Belasco, escapes Limbo, and becomes a member of the junior X-Men team known as the New Mutants, Cat&#x27;s remains are found by the team in Limbo&#x27;s throne room. By then she had completely decomposed to a skeleton. Illyana, facing a rebellion of Limbo&#x27;s demon population that threatened to overrun Earth, smashed Cat&#x27;s skull in rage over the demonic taint that Belasco left on her soul and frustration over the horrible choice she had to make to kill Cat.

===Marvel Zombies===
Kitty is briefly shown in the background as a zombie in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; #23, despite her mutant phasing powers. She is also seen in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;, when zombie Alpha Flight attack the X-Men. This would appear to have been retconned, though, as of &quot;Marvel Zombies: Halloween,&quot; which depicts her and her son Peter with Colossus surviving for several years in an out of the way house farm, encountering zombies, but, fortunately, being rescued by Mephisto, who dispatched the remaining zombies.

The Earth-91126/Earth-Z Kitty is recruited by Earth-2149/Marvel Zombies Spider-Man to help him develop a cure for the zombie hunger, on the grounds that her powers mean that she would be in no danger from him if he should succumb to his zombie instincts, but she is later seemingly killed when the zombie Quasar holds her underwater until she is forced to become solid once more, allowing the infected Namor to eat her flesh (much to the rage of the zombie Wolverine, of Earth-2149).

===Mutant X===
Storm was taken by the vampire Dracula and unlike Earth 616, she does not return. Kitty goes off to battle her, either to save or kill her. Kitty slays several vampires in the way but Storm proves too much for her and Kitty becomes her unwilling slave for some time. She later shows up as the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club and seems to be none too happy with Storm. It&#x27;s also hinted that she was engaged or going to be engaged to Colossus. Her ultimate fate at the end of the series is unknown.

===Lightning Force===
In the reality of Earth-597, an alternative universe where World War II was won by Nazi Germany, Kitty is forced to serve as Shadowcat alongside Nightcrawler, Meggan, and Hauptmann Englande as a member of the Lightning Force (a version of Excalibur), made a virtual slave because of her Jewish heritage. She leads a sad existence and is easily identified by her shaved head and the Star of David tattooed on her forehead. It is indicated, from her own statements and those made by her reality&#x27;s counterpart of Moira MacTaggert, that this Shadowcat is a true ghost, raised from the dead by a combination of science and magic and bound to serve the Nazi regime. This Shadowcat had the added ability to disrupt life force with her phasing power, knocking her victims unconscious, much like how her counterpart in the &quot;prime&quot; Marvel Universe (Earth-616) can disrupt technology that she phases through. She is also able to alter her facial features to a &quot;demonic&quot; aspect when attacking enemies or else responding to aggressive, commanding behavior from her superiors.

===Pirate Kitty===
Kitty tells Illyana a bedtime story and casts herself as Pirate Kitty Pryde, captain of the &quot;Abdul Alhazred&quot;, who operated in a magical world. Unlike her mainstream counterpart, she did not have any mutant powers and wore a classic pirate outfit which also included her Star of David necklace. She was also sometimes known as Colleen. Kitty was good friends of her version of Colossus, the Bamfs (Nightcrawler), Windrider (Storm), the &quot;Fiend-with-no-name&quot; (later revealed to be named &quot;Mean&quot;) (Wolverine) and Lockheed (an alternative version of the X-Jet). Kitty also helped her versions of Professor X and Cyclops capture and cure that universe&#x27;s version of Dark Phoenix.

At first she was only a fairy tale character, but later it is revealed that her fairy tale is actually an alternative universe. (In fact, several members of this universe, the Bamfs, would later come to Earth-616 to cause trouble.) When Earth-616&#x27;s Nightcrawler was temporarily stranded in her world, Kitty helped him defeat the sorcerer Shagreen and also encountered the Earth-616 versions of Illyana, Lockheed, and herself.

===Professor W&#x27;s X-Men===
In the native universe of the Exiles member Nocturne, Kitty is a senior member of the X-Men led by Nightcrawler. She is a teacher and TJ refers to her as &quot;Aunt Kate&quot;. During a fight with Apocalypse Kitty gets exposed to a machine that reverts her to a younger stage of her life when she had only been with the X-Men a few weeks. Nocturne helps Kitty fit into the school and becomes her best friend. She also proves useful in the fight against the Brotherhood led by Cyclops.

===Ruins===
Imprisoned alongside other mutants at a prison camp in Texas by President X, Kitty attempted to use her phasing powers to escape, only to get stuck halfway through her cell door, losing three feet of intestines in the process.

===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, a version of Kitty named Kitten resides in the &quot;wuxia&quot;-inspired K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un region of Battleworld. In this reality, Kitten is a martial artist who joins Callisto&#x27;s band of outcasts after being expelled from her school for attempting a forbidden technique, a side effect of which left her intangible. Kitten and her fellow outcasts became pupils of Shang-Chi, the exiled son of Emperor Zheng Zu. Dubbing their new school &quot;The Lowest Caste&quot;, Shang-Chi represents the group as their master for the tournament deciding the next Emperor of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un, hoping to usurp his father&#x27;s tyrannical rule. Kitten accompanies Shang-Chi for each of his fights in the Thirteen Chambers. During his final fight with Zu, Shang-Chi uses Kitten&#x27;s technique of intangibility, which leads to his eventual victory and replaces his father as the new Emperor of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The Ultimate version of Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) first appears as a 14-year-old girl in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #21. She is also Jewish and wears the Star of David around her neck, but does not appear to possess the same genius IQ as her mainstream (Earth-616) counterpart.

Kitty&#x27;s mother, worried about Kitty&#x27;s mutation, seeks help from Professor Charles Xavier. Kitty becomes a student at Xavier&#x27;s school, when her mother allows her to attend under the condition she does not take part in any X-Men missions, nor train in any &quot;Danger Room&quot; simulations. Kitty soon rebels against this and joins the X-Men as their youngest member. She idolizes Spider-Man and has a crush on him; she even dates Peter Parker for a time. After a fierce argument with Professor Xavier concerning Peter&#x27;s secret identity, which his Aunt May had just found out about, Kitty leaves the X-Men and enrolls in Peter&#x27;s school. Their relationship is strained after their romantic involvement (as superheroes) becomes publicly known, making it impossible for them to date anymore in their civilian identities, and eventually comes to an end when Peter realizes he cannot get over his feelings for Mary Jane. However, Kitty still retains strong feelings for him.

Following the disastrous flood triggered by Magneto and the subsequent ban of public use of mutant powers, Kitty assumes the identity of the Shroud. Kitty also discovers that she can also decrease the space between her atoms make herself super-dense, giving her both superhuman strength and durability. When the authorities see Kitty as a threat, she enters into a fierce rage and demonstrates these powers for the first time to her friends. She is strong and angry enough to punch Spider-Man several feet through the air. She eventually escapes and goes into hiding in the now abandoned Morlock Tunnel with Iceman and the Human Torch after Peter Parker&#x27;s death.

Kitty makes an appearance in &quot;Ultimate Comics: X&quot;, locating Jimmy Hudson, who is revealed to be Wolverine&#x27;s son. Kitty was charged by Logan before his death to locate Jimmy and reveal his true origins to him.

After the death of Spider-Man she formed new team of X-Men consisting of herself, Iceman and the Human Torch. They soon rescued the mutant Rogue from the mutant-hunting Nimrod robots, going on to recruit Jimmy Hudson into their group as well. After killing the mutant-hunting William Stryker, Kitty decided to leave New York for the Southwest along with Bobby, Rogue, and Jimmy (leaving only Johnny behind) to save the mutants there and defeat the Nimrods, now controlled by the deceased Stryker&#x27;s consciousness.

===Spider-Gwen===
In the reality where Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman, Kitty is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Black Ops department, where she works closely with Wolverine to keep him in check and to help him fight his immortal curse. Like the Age of Apocalypse version, she also wields artificial claws on her wrists. It&#x27;s revealed that she works with Logan out of guilt, as Stryker forced her to use her powers to subject Logan to the Weapon X experiment.

===What If===
* In &quot;What if Phoenix Had Not Died&quot;, Kitty is obliterated by Dark Phoenix before she destroyed the Earth.
* In &quot;What If the X-Men had Lost Inferno?&quot;, Kitty is one of the last eight remaining superheroes on the planet. She is slain by a demonic Wolverine, but her death makes Wolverine come to his senses and he fights against Baron Mordo, who had joined up with the demon hordes.
* In &quot;What If... Wolverine: Enemy of the State&quot;, Kitty is the only hero left to kill a Hydra-programmed Wolverine after he has taken down the Marvel Universe. Kitty was the last remaining member of the team assembled to recapture Wolverine. The initial plan failed and Kitty was forced to phase her hand into Wolverine&#x27;s brain. She then solidified her hand killing Wolverine instantly although she lost her hand in the process.
* In &quot;What if Magneto and Professor X Had Formed The X-Men Together&quot;, Kitty is the tech guru at the Good Shepard clinic (That reality&#x27;s version of the X-Mansion). She is very similar to her mainstream counterpart. But unlike the mainstream version this Kitty Pryde would wear different coloured wigs and cut her natural hair short. She also had trouble with her powers since she would phase herself through a solid object and accidentally leave her clothes behind. She was also friends with Lockheed although she only called him Dragon.
* In &quot;What if Astonishing X-Men&quot;, Kitty is amongst the X-Men who fight a Phoenix powered Emma Frost. She phased Emma&#x27;s heart from her chest but a Phoenix fire flares up from her body killing Kitty instantly. In the second story during the events of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #6-12 Elixir had not been able to heal Kitty after being impaled and she dies.
* In &quot;What if the Dark Phoenix Rose Again&quot;, Kitty has Colossus &quot;set up a fastball special&quot; to help her phase into a Master Mold. She is killed after solidifying inside the Master Mold&#x27;s head destroying it in the process.
* In &quot;What if Storm Had the Power of the Phoenix&quot;, Kitty helps revive the &#x27;real&#x27; Storm (the Phoenix being the cosmic entity in Storm&#x27;s shape) by phasing inside her body and getting her internal organs working again.

===X-Babies===
An X-Baby version of Shadowcat appears briefly in the &quot;X-Babies&quot; one-shot comic. She is wearing her original costume and is younger than the other X-Babies. She is named as Shadowkitty rather than Shadowcat or Kitty Pryde. She also doesn&#x27;t seem to have a strong bond with the X-Baby version of Lockheed.

===X-Men Forever===
In the &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; series, Kitty and Nightcrawler have left Excalibur and rejoined the X-Men after the events of X-Men #1-3. Of the X-Men, she undergoes the most drastic changes from the events of &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; #1. During the battle with Fabian Cortez, she phases through Wolverine while he is being affected by Cortez&#x27;s power. This drives her powers haywire as well, and somehow she ends up with one of Wolverine&#x27;s claws in her wrist. Claremont has also hinted in dialogue throughout the title so far that she may have also undergone psychological or psychic changes as a result of the event. From &quot;Forever&quot; #4 to the current issue, she is shown to be able to use the claw in the exact method Wolverine would manifest it, with no apparent ill effects (the mechanism for this has not yet been made clear) outside of excruciating pain. Because of the merger with Logan&#x27;s DNA she has begun to develop a healing factor, slower than Wolverine&#x27;s but it heals faster when she is intangible. She has also slightly enhanced senses, she also can produce a set of five retractable claws on her left hand like Sabretooth. She has also begun to take on Logan&#x27;s personality and memories as well. And because of this she is beginning to wonder what part of her truly remains the same.

===X-Men: Misfits===
In the &quot;X-Men: Misfits&quot; original English language manga one-shot graphic novel from Marvel and DelRay, Kitty is the newest and only female student of the all-male Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, which is now experimenting with having a co-ed student body. As the sole girl, she becomes the center of attention and attraction for the rest of the students. She becomes a member and the mascot of the elitist fraternity, The Hellfire Club, and has a short-lived romantic relationship with the school troublemaker Pyro.

===X-Men: The End===
In the &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; future, Kitty Pryde becomes the mayor of Chicago and then President of the United States. She has three children: her eldest daughter, named Meredith, and twins 10 years younger than Meredith, Sara and Doug, with an unnamed partner who died protecting her from an assassination attempt.

===Miscellaneous===
* In &quot;Excalibur&quot; #103, several alternative versions of Shadowcat appear. Many of these variations have appeared in other comics, such as Age of Apocalypse, but there were other variations, including one of her as a Phalanx convert, a sex dominatrix, a homeless person, a nun, a version wearing a costume similar to Phantom Girl, and a normal person who owns an Olde Curiosity Shoppe.
* In &quot;New Mutants&quot; #63 Illyana (Magik), along with Lockheed, gets trapped on an alien spaceship that has been invaded by a Brood Queen. On this ship the Brood Queen created clones of the X-Men, including Kitty. This one had the Ariel suit on, but it was green, instead of the typical blue. These X-Men are implanted with Brood eggs. Her memories were altered by the Brood Queen like the other X-Men, but eventually they rebel against her and are free. Illyana uses the soulsword to eliminate the Brood Eggs from their bodies. The X-Men stay on the ship; whether they are still on it is unknown.
*During the Cross Time Caper storyline a few different appearances of Kitty appear. One was a princess who was gifted with magic abilities. She eventually married a short dashing prince (who had originally fallen in love with the mainstream version of Kitty). A second version was a crime boss who was betrayed and killed by her partner in crime Illiyana Rasputin. A third was from a world of sentient dinosaurs. She went by the name of Shadowcompsognathus.

* Kitty Pryde as Shadowcat appears in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, voiced by Danielle Judovits. This version&#x27;s design takes inspiration from her &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; appearance and was a student at the Xavier Institute before the X-Mansion was destroyed and Professor X and Jean Grey disappeared under mysterious circumstances. A year later, Pryde intended to travel to Genosha before Wolverine re-recruits her into the X-Men to avert a dystopian future controlled by Master Mold.

As of a dystopian future controlled by the Sentinels, she has developed the ability to send a person&#x27;s consciousness into their past self, which she uses to help the surviving X-Men combat the Sentinels. She later uses this ability to send Logan&#x27;s mind back in time to his past self in 1973 to avert the Sentinels&#x27; creation as his mind is the only one capable of surviving the mental rigors of the journey. In the &quot;Rogue Cut&quot; of the film, Rogue takes over for Pryde in keeping Logan&#x27;s mind in the past after Pryde is injured. During the final battle, Pryde saves Magneto from being killed by Sentinels. After Logan&#x27;s mission succeeds and the timeline is successfully altered in both versions of the film, Pryde becomes a teacher at the Xavier Institute alongside Colossus.
* In January 2018, a Kitty Pryde solo film was announced to be in development at 20th Century Fox, with Tim Miller attached as the director and Brian Michael Bendis as the writer. However, following Disney&#x27;s purchase of 21st Century Fox in March 2019, Fox executive Emma Watts described &quot;The New Mutants&quot; as the final film in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, which brought development on the Kitty Pryde film to an end.

<text>Kalimpong is a town and the headquarters of an eponymous district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is located at an average elevation of . The town is the headquarters of the Kalimpong district. The region comes under Gorkhaland Territorial Administration which is an autonomous governing body within the state of West Bengal. The Indian Army&#x27;s 27 Mountain Division is located on the outskirts of the city.

Kalimpong is known for its educational institutions, many of which were established during the British colonial period. It used to be a gateway in the trade between Tibet and India before China&#x27;s annexation of Tibet and the Sino-Indian War. Kalimpong and neighbouring Darjeeling were major centres calling for a separate Gorkhaland state in the 1980s, and more recently in 2010.

The municipality sits on a ridge overlooking the Teesta River and is a tourist destination owing to its temperate climate, natural environment and proximity to popular tourist locations in the region. Horticulture is important to Kalimpong: It has a flower market notable for its wide array of orchids; nurseries, which export Himalayan grown flower bulbs, tubers and rhizomes, contribute to the economy of Kalimpong. The Tibetan Buddhist monastery Zang Dhok Palri Phodang holds a number of rare Tibetan Buddhist scriptures.

The Kalimpong Science Centre, established under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council in 2008 is a recent addition to its many tourist attractions. The Science Centre, which provides for scientific awareness among the students of the town and the locals sits atop the Deolo Hill.

== Etymology ==
The precise origin of the name &quot;Kalimpong&quot; remains unclear. There are many theories on the origin of the name. One widely accepted theory claims that the name &quot;Kalimpong&quot; means &quot;Assembly (or Stockade) of the King&#x27;s Ministers&quot; in Tibetan, derived from &quot;kalon&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s ministers&quot;) and &quot;pong&quot; (&quot;stockade&quot;). The name may be derived from the translation &quot;ridge where we play&quot; from Lepcha, as it was known to be the place for traditional tribal gatherings for summer sporting events. People from the hills call the area &quot;Kalempung&quot; (&quot;the black spurs&quot;).

According to K.P. Tamsang, author of &quot;The Untold and Unknown Reality about the Lepchas&quot;, the term Kalimpong is deduced from the name &quot;Kalenpung&quot;, which in Lepcha means &quot;Hillock of Assemblage&quot;; in time, the name was distorted to &quot;Kalebung&quot;, and later further contorted to Kalimpong. Another possible derivation points to Kaulim, locally known as odal Scientific name &quot;Sterculia Villosa,&quot; a fibrous plant found in abundance in the region.

== History ==
Until the mid-19th century, the area around Kalimpong was ruled in succession by the Sikkimese and Bhutanese kingdoms.
Kalimpong is said to have come under the control of Bhutan in the year 1706. However, according to historians, the Bhutanese encroachments had been in effect for about two decades by then, following the defeat of Gyalpo Ajok and other Lepcha chieftains.

The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous Lepcha and Limbu community and migrant Bhutia and Kirati tribes.
After the Anglo-Bhutan War in 1864, the Treaty of Sinchula (1865) was signed, in which Bhutanese-held territory east of the Teesta River was ceded to the British East India Company. It was administered as the &#x27;Western Duars&#x27; district for a few years, and divided into three tehsils. Kalimpong fell into the Dalingkot tehsil, which consisted of all the mountainous part of the annexed territory. In 1867, the Dalingkot tehsil was merged with the Darjeeling district, and eventually renamed the Kalimpong Subdivision.

At the time of annexation, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with only two or three families known to reside there. The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by Ashley Eden, a government official with the Bengal Civil Service. Kalimpong was added to district of Darjeeling in 1866. In 1866–1867 an Anglo-Bhutanese commission demarcated the common boundaries between the two, thereby giving shape to the Kalimpong subdivision and the Darjeeling district.

After the war, the region became a subdivision of the Western Duars district, and the following year it was merged with the district of Darjeeling. The temperate climate prompted the British to develop the town as an alternative hill station to Darjeeling, to escape the scorching summer heat in the plains. Kalimpong&#x27;s proximity to the Nathu La and Jelep La passes (La means &quot;pass&quot;) for trading with Tibet was an added advantage. It soon became an important trading outpost in the trade of furs, wools and food grains between India and Tibet. The increase in commerce attracted large numbers of Nepali&#x27;s from the neighbouring Nepal and the lower regions of Sikkim, the areas where, Nepali&#x27;s were residing since the Gorkha invasion of Sikkim in 1790. The movement of people into the area, transformed Kalimpong from a small hamlet with a few houses, to a thriving town with increased economic prosperity. Britain assigned a plot within Kalimpong to the influential Bhutanese Dorji family, through which trade and relations with Bhutan flowed. This later became Bhutan House, a Bhutanese administrative and cultural centre.

The arrival of Scottish missionaries saw the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British. Rev. W. Macfarlane in the early 1870s established the first schools in the area. The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the Dr. Graham&#x27;s Homes for destitute Anglo-Indian students. The young missionary (and aspiring writer and poet) Aeneas Francon Williams, aged 24, arrived in Kalimpong in 1910 to take up the post of assistant schoolmaster at Dr. Graham&#x27;s Homes, where he later became Bursar and remained working at the school for the next fourteen years. From 1907 onwards, most schools in Kalimpong had started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population comprised many ethnic groups, including Nepalis, Lepchas, Tibetans, Muslims, the Anglo-Indian communities. Hence by 1911, the population had swollen to 7,880.

Following Indian independence in 1947, Kalimpong became part of the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan. With China&#x27;s annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the Sino-Indian War disrupted trade between Tibet and India, and led to a slowdown in Kalimpong&#x27;s economy. In 1976, the visiting Dalai Lama consecrated the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.

Between 1986 and 1988, the demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland and Kamtapur based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and the West Bengal government reached a stand-off after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under siege, and the state government called in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This led to the formation of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, a body that was given semi-autonomous powers to govern the Darjeeling district, except the area under the Siliguri subdivision. Since 2007, the demand for a separate Gorkhaland state has been revived by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and its supporters in the Darjeeling hills. The Kamtapur People&#x27;s Party and its supporters&#x27; movement for a separate Kamtapur state covering North Bengal have gained momentum.

== Geography ==

The town centre is on a ridge connecting two hills, Deolo Hill and Durpin Hill, at an elevation of . Deolo, the highest point in Kalimpong, has an altitude of and Durpin Hill is at an elevation of . The River Teesta flows in the valley below and separates Kalimpong from the state of Sikkim. The soil in the Kalimpong area is typically reddish in colour. Occasional dark soils are found due to extensive existence of phyllite and schists. The Shiwalik Hills, like most of the Himalayan foothills, have steep slopes and soft, loose topsoil, leading to frequent landslides in the monsoon season. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Kanchenjunga, at the world&#x27;s third tallest peak, is clearly visible from Kalimpong.
===Climate===

The annual temperature is . Summers are mild, with an average maximum temperature of in August. Summers are followed by the monsoon rains which lash the town between June and September. The monsoons are severe, often causing landslides which sequester the town from the rest of India. Winter lasts from December to February, with the minimum temperature being around . During the monsoon and winter seasons, Kalimpong is often enveloped by fog.

== Economy ==

Tourism is the most significant contributor to Kalimpong&#x27;s economy. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town&#x27;s residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hoped to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La pass in April 2006. Though this resumed Indo–China border trades, local leaders requested that the Jelep La pass also be reopened to allow trade.

Kalimpong is a major ginger growing area of India. Kalimpong and the state of Sikkim together contribute 15 per cent of the ginger produced in India. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is internationally famous for its tea industry. However, most of the tea gardens are on the western side of Teesta river (towards the town of Darjeeling) and so tea gardens near Kalimpong contribute only 4 percent of total tea production of the region. In Kalimpong division, 90 percent of land is cultivable but only 10 percent is used for tea production. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry—especially for its wide array of indigenous orchids and gladioli.

A significant contributor to the town&#x27;s economy is education sector. The schools of Kalimpong, besides imparting education to the locals, attract a significant number of students from the plains, the neighbouring state of Sikkim and countries such as Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand.

Many establishments cater to the Indian army bases near the town, providing it with essential supplies. Small contributions to the economy come by the way of the sale of traditional arts and crafts of Sikkim and Tibet. Government efforts related to sericulture, seismology, and fisheries provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents.

The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove to be one of the chief draws of tourism to the township.

<text>The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003 is a law passed in 2003 establishing the United States&#x27; first national standards for the sending of commercial e-mail. The law requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce its provisions. Introduced by Republican Conrad Burns, the act passed both the House and Senate during the 108th United States Congress and was signed into law by President George W. Bush in December 2003 and was enacted on January 1, 2004.

== History ==
The backronym CAN-SPAM derives from the bill&#x27;s full name: &quot;C&quot;ontrolling the &quot;A&quot;ssault of &quot;N&quot;on-&quot;S&quot;olicited &quot;P&quot;ornography &quot;A&quot;nd &quot;M&quot;arketing Act of 2003. It plays on the word &quot;canning&quot; (putting an end to) spam, as in the usual term for unsolicited email of this type. The bill was sponsored in Congress by Senators Conrad Burns and Ron Wyden.

The CAN-SPAM Act is occasionally referred to by critics as the &quot;You-Can-Spam&quot; Act because the bill fails to prohibit many types of e-mail spam and preempts some state laws that would otherwise have provided victims with practical means of redress. In particular, it does not require e-mailers to get permission before they send marketing messages. It also prevents states from enacting stronger anti-spam protections, and prohibits individuals who receive spam from suing spammers except under laws not specific to e-mail. The Act has been largely unenforced, despite a letter to the FTC from Senator Burns, who noted that &quot;Enforcement is key regarding the CAN-SPAM legislation.&quot; In 2004, less than 1% of spam complied with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.

The law prescribed the FTC to report back to Congress within 24 months of the effectiveness of the act. Once this took place, no changes were recommended. It also requires the FTC to promulgate rules to shield consumers from unwanted mobile phone spam. On December 20, 2005 the FTC reported that the volume of spam has begun to level off, and due to enhanced anti-spam technologies, less was reaching consumer inboxes. A significant decrease in sexually explicit e-mail was also reported.

Later modifications changed the original CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 by (1) Adding a definition of the term &quot;person&quot;; (2) Modifying the term &quot;sender&quot;; (3) Clarifying that a sender may comply with the act by including a post office box or private mailbox; and (4) Clarifying that to submit a valid opt-out request, a recipient cannot be required to pay a fee, provide information other than his or her email address and opt-out preferences, or take any other steps other than sending a reply email message or visiting a single page on an Internet website.

== The mechanics of CAN-SPAM ==

=== Applicability ===
CAN-SPAM, a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails, defines a &quot;commercial electronic mail message&quot; as &quot;any electronic mail message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service (including content on an Internet website operated for a commercial purpose).&quot; It exempts &quot;transactional or relationship messages.&quot; The FTC issued final rules () clarifying the phrase &quot;primary purpose&quot; on December 16, 2004. Previous state laws had used bulk (a number threshold), content (commercial), or unsolicited to define spam. The explicit restriction of the law to commercial e-mails is widely considered by those in the industry to essentially exempt purely political and religious e-mail from its specific requirements. Such non-commercial messages also have stronger First Amendment protection, as shown in &quot;Jaynes v. Commonwealth&quot;.

Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. However, CAN-SPAM does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings that are &quot;materially false or misleading&quot;. In addition there are conditions that email marketers must meet in terms of their format, their content, and labeling. The three basic types of compliance defined in the CAN-SPAM Act—unsubscribe, content, and sending behavior — are as follows:

=== Unsubscribe compliance ===
*A visible and operable unsubscribe mechanism is present in all emails.
*Consumer opt-out requests are honored within 10 business days.
*Opt-out lists also known as suppression lists are used only for compliance purposes.

=== Content compliance ===
* Accurate &quot;From&quot; lines
* Relevant subject lines (relative to offer in body content and not deceptive)
* A legitimate physical address of the publisher or advertiser is present. PO Box addresses are acceptable in compliance with and if the email is sent by a third party, the legitimate physical address of the entity, whose products or services are promoted through the email should be visible.
* A label is present if the content is adult.

=== Sending behavior compliance ===
* A message cannot be sent without an unsubscribe option.
* A message cannot contain a false header
* A message should contain at least one sentence.
* A message cannot be null.
* Unsubscribe option should be below the message.

There are no restrictions against a company emailing its existing customers or anyone who has inquired about its products or services, even if these individuals have not given permission, as these messages are classified as &quot;relationship&quot; messages under CAN-SPAM. But when sending unsolicited commercial emails, it must be stated that the email is an advertisement or a marketing solicitation. Note that recipients who have signed up to receive commercial messages from you are exempt from this rule.

If a user opts out, a sender has ten days to cease sending and can use that email address only for compliance purposes. The legislation also prohibits the sale or other transfer of an e-mail address after an opt-out request. The law also requires that the unsubscribe mechanism must be able to process opt-out requests for at least 30 days after the transmission of the original message.

Use of automated means to register for multiple e-mail accounts from which to send spam compound other violations. It prohibits sending sexually oriented spam without the label later determined by the FTC of &quot;SEXUALLY EXPLICIT.&quot; This label replaced the similar state labeling requirements of &quot;ADV:ADLT&quot; or &quot;ADLT.&quot;

CAN-SPAM makes it a misdemeanor to send spam with falsified header information. A host of other common spamming practices can make a CAN-SPAM violation an &quot;aggravated offense,&quot; including harvesting, dictionary attacks, IP address spoofing, hijacking computers through Trojan horses or worms, or using open mail relays for the purpose of sending spam.

==== Criminal offenses ====
Although according to the law, legitimate businesses and marketers should be conscientious regarding the aspects mentioned above, there are misinterpretations and fraudulent practices that are viewed as criminal offenses:
* Sending multiple spam emails with the use of a hijacked computer
* Sending multiple emails through Internet Protocol addresses that the sender represents falsely as being his/her property
* Trying to disguise the source of the email and to deceive recipients regarding the origins of the emails, by routing them through other computers
* Sending multiple spam emails via multiple mailings with falsified information in the header
* Using various email accounts obtained by falsifying account registration information, in order to send multiple spam emails.

== Private right of action ==
CAN-SPAM provides a limited private right of action to Internet Access Services that have been adversely affected by the receipt of emails that violate the Act; and does not allow natural persons to bring suit. A CAN-SPAM plaintiff must satisfy a higher standard of proof as compared with government agencies enforcing the Act; thus, a private plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant either sent the email at issue or paid another person to send it knowing that the sender would violate the Act. Despite this heightened standard, private CAN-SPAM lawsuits have cropped up around the country, as plaintiffs seek to take advantage of the statutory damages available under the Act.

== Overriding state anti-spam laws ==
CAN-SPAM preempts (supersedes) state anti-spam laws that do not deal with false or deceptive activity. The relevant portion of CAN-SPAM reads:

:This chapter supersedes any statute, regulation, or rule of a State or political subdivision of a State that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages, except to the extent that any such statute, regulation, or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.

Though this move was criticized by some anti-spam activists, some legal commentators praised it, citing a heavily punitive California law seen as over broad and a wave of allegedly dubious suits filed in Utah.

== CAN-SPAM and the FTC ==
CAN-SPAM allows the FTC to implement a national do-not-email list similar to the FTC&#x27;s popular National Do Not Call Registry against telemarketing, or to report back to Congress why the creation of such a list is not currently feasible. The FTC soundly rejected this proposal, and such a list will not be implemented. The FTC concluded that the lack of authentication of email would undermine the list, and it could raise security concerns.

The legislation prohibits e-mail recipients from suing spammers or filing class-action lawsuits. It allows enforcement by the FTC, state attorneys general, Internet service providers, and other federal agencies for special categories of spammers (such as banks). An individual might be able to sue as an ISP if (s)he ran a mail server, but this would likely be cost-prohibitive and would not necessarily hold up in court. Individuals can also sue using state laws about fraud, such as Virginia&#x27;s that gives standing based on actual damages, in effect limiting enforcement to ISPs.

The McCain amendment made businesses promoted in spam subject to FTC penalties and enforcement remedies, if they knew or should have known that their business was being promoted by the use of spam. This amendment was designed to close a loophole that allowed those running affiliate programs to allow spammers to abuse their programs, and encouraged such businesses to assist the FTC in identifying such spammers.

Senator Jon Corzine sponsored an amendment to allow bounties for some informants. The FTC has limited these bounties to individuals with inside information. The bounties are expected to be over $100,000 but none have been awarded yet.

== Reaction ==
Those opposing spam greeted the new law with dismay and disappointment, almost immediately dubbing it the &quot;You Can Spam&quot; Act. Internet activists who work to stop spam stated that the Act would not prevent any spam — in fact, it appeared to give federal approval to the practice, and it was feared that spam would increase as a result of the law. CAUCE (Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email) stated:

This legislation fails the most fundamental test of any anti-spam law, in that it neglects to actually tell any marketers not to spam. Instead, it gives each marketer in the United States one free shot at each consumer&#x27;s e-mail inbox, and will force companies to continue to deploy costly and disruptive anti-spam technologies to block advertising messages from reaching their employees on company time and using company resources. It also fails to learn from the experiences of the states and other countries that have tried &quot;opt-out&quot; legal frameworks, where marketers must be asked to stop, to no avail.

AOL Executive Vice President and General Counsel Randall Boe stated:

[CAN-SPAM] not only empowered us to help can the spam, but also to can the spammers as well. ... Our actions today clearly demonstrate that CAN-SPAM is alive and kicking — and we&#x27;re using it to give hardcore, outlaw spammers the boot.

Advertising organizations such as the Data &amp; Marketing Association (DMA) have sought to weaken implementation of the law in various ways. These include lengthening the time for honoring opt-outs from 10 business days to 31 calendar days, limiting the validity of opt-out requests to no more than two to three years, and eliminating rewards to persons who assist the Federal Trade Commission in enforcement of the act. The DMA has also opposed provisions requiring the subject line of spam to indicate that the message is an advertisement.

== Criminal enforcement ==
On February 16, 2005, Anthony Greco, 18, of Cheektowaga, New York, was the first person to be arrested under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced in a closed session.

Within a few months, hundreds of lawsuits had been filed by an alliance of ISPs. Many of these efforts resulted in settlements; most are still pending. Though most defendants were &quot;John Does,&quot; many spam operations, such as Scott Richter&#x27;s, were known.

On April 29, 2004, the United States government brought the first criminal and civil charges under the Act. Criminal charges were filed by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, and the FTC filed a civil enforcement action in the Northern District of Illinois. The defendants were a company, Phoenix Avatar, and four associated individuals: Daniel J. Lin, James J. Lin, Mark M. Sadek, and Christopher Chung of West Bloomfield, Michigan. Defendants were charged with sending hundreds of thousands of spam emails advertising a &quot;diet patch&quot; and &quot;hormone products.&quot; The FTC stated that these products were effectively worthless. Authorities said they face up to five years in prison under the anti-spam law and up to 20 years in prison under U.S. mail fraud statutes.

On September 27, 2004, Nicholas Tombros pled guilty to charges and became the first spammer to be convicted under the Can-Spam Act of 2003. He was sentenced in July 2007 to three years probation, six months house arrest, and a fine of $10,000.

On April 1, 2006, Mounir Balarbi, of Tangier, Morocco, was the first person outside the United States to have an arrest warrant validated under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Mounir&#x27;s trial was held in absentia, and he was sentenced in a closed session.

On January 16, 2006, Jeffrey Goodin, 45, of Azusa, California, was convicted by a jury in United States district court in Los Angeles in &quot;United States v. Goodin, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, 06-110&quot;, under the CAN-SPAM Act (the first conviction under the Act), and on June 11, 2007, he was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison. Out of a potential sentence of 101 years, prosecutors asked for a sentence of 94 months. Goodin was already detained in custody, as he had missed a court hearing.

As of late 2006, CAN-SPAM has been all but ignored by spammers. A review of spam levels in October 2006 estimated that 75% of all email messages were spam, and the number of spam emails complying with the requirements of the law were estimated to be 0.27% of all spam emails. , about 90% of email was spam.

On August 25, 2005, three people were indicted on two counts of fraud and one count of criminal conspiracy. On March 6, 2006 Jennifer R. Clason, 33, of Raymond, New Hampshire, pled guilty and was to be sentenced on June 5, 2006. She faced a maximum sentence of 5 years on each of the three counts and agreed to forfeit money received in the commission of these crimes. On June 25, 2007, the remaining two were convicted of spamming out millions of e-mail messages that included hardcore pornographic images. Jeffrey A. Kilbride, 41, of Venice, California, and James R. Schaffer, 41, of Paradise Valley, Arizona, were convicted on eight counts in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, Arizona. Both were sentenced to five years in prison, and ordered to forfeit $1,300,000. The charges included conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and transportation of obscene materials. The trial, which began on June 5, was the first to include charges under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, according to the Department of Justice. The specific law that prosecutors used under the CAN-Spam Act was designed to crack down on the transmission of pornography in spam. Two other men, Andrew D. Ellifson, 31, of Scottsdale, Arizona, and Kirk F. Rogers, 43, of Manhattan Beach, California, also pled guilty to charges under the CAN-SPAM Act related to this spamming operation. Both were scheduled to be sentenced on June 5, 2006 in Phoenix. After sentencing, Ellifson received a presidential pardon by President Obama.

== Civil enforcement ==
In July 2005, the Federal Trade Commission lodged civil CAN-SPAM complaints against nine companies alleging that they were responsible for spam emails that had been sent by them or by their affiliates. Eight of the nine companies, Cyberheat of Tucson, Arizona, 
APC Entertainment, Inc., of Davie, Florida, MD Media, Inc., of Bingham Farms, Michigan, Pure Marketing Solutions, LLC, of Tampa, Florida, TJ Web Productions, LLC, of Tampa, Florida, and BangBros.com, Inc., RK Netmedia, Inc., and OX Ideas, Inc., LLC, of Miami, Florida entered into stipulated consent decrees. Impulse Media Group, Inc. of Seattle, Washington, represented by CarpeLaw PLLC, defended the case brought against it.

The Department of Justice asserted that the CAN-SPAM statute imposed strict liability on producers such as Impulse Media for the actions of its non-agent, independent-contractor affiliates. However, the two courts to consider that argument rejected the DOJ&#x27;s contention. In March 2008 the remaining defendant, Impulse Media Group, went to trial. At trial, it was determined that IMG&#x27;s Affiliate Agreement specifically prohibited spam bulk-email and that if an affiliate violated that agreement, it would be terminated from the program. In fact, several affiliates had been terminated for that very reason. After a 2½ day trial, the jury retired to determine whether Impulse Media should be held liable for the bad acts of its affiliates. Three and one-half hours later, the jury returned with a verdict that IMG was not liable and that the emails were the fault of the affiliates.

In March 2006, the FTC obtained its largest settlement to date—a $900,000 consent decree against Jumpstart Technologies, LLC for numerous alleged violations of the CAN-SPAM act. However, the FTC has never prevailed at trial with their theory of strict liability.

<text>The Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM), or International Congresses of Modern Architecture, was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the Modern Movement focusing in all the main domains of architecture (such as landscape, urbanism, industrial design, and many others).

==Formation and membership==
The &quot;International Congresses of Modern Architecture&quot; (CIAM) was founded in June 1928, at the Chateau de la Sarraz in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by Le Corbusier, Hélène de Mandrot (owner of the castle), and Sigfried Giedion, (the first secretary-general). CIAM was one of many 20th-century manifestos meant to advance the cause of &quot;architecture as a social art&quot;.

=== Members ===
Other founder members included Karl Moser (first president), Hendrik Berlage, Victor Bourgeois, Pierre Chareau, Sven Markelius, Josef Frank, Gabriel Guevrekian, Max Ernst Haefeli, Hugo Häring, Arnold Höchel, Huib Hoste, Pierre Jeanneret (cousin of Le Corbusier), André Lurçat, Ernst May, Max Cetto, Fernando García Mercadal, Hannes Meyer, Werner M. Moser, Carlo Enrico Rava, Gerrit Rietveld, Alberto Sartoris, Hans Schmidt, Mart Stam, Rudolf Steiger, Szymon Syrkus, Henri-Robert Von der Mühll, and Juan de Zavala. The Soviet delegates were El Lissitzky, Nikolai Kolli and Moisei Ginzburg, although at the Sarraz conference they were unable to obtain visas.

Later members included Minnette de Silva, Walter Gropius, Alvar Aalto, Uno Åhrén, Louis Herman De Koninck (1929) and Fred Forbát. In 1941, Harwell Hamilton Harris was chosen as secretary of the American branch of CIAM, which was the Chapter for Relief and Post War Planning, founded in New York City. Josep Lluís Sert participated in the congresses as of 1929, and served as CIAM president from 1947 to 1956. He was co-founder of GATEPAC and GATCPAC (in Zaragoza and Barcelona, respectively) in 1930, as well as ADLAN (Friends of New Art) in Barcelona in 1932.

=== CIRPAC ===
The elected executive body of CIAM was CIRPAC, the &quot;Comité international pour la résolution des problèmes de l’architecture contemporaine&quot; (International Committee for the Resolution of Problems in Contemporary Architecture).

==Influence==
The organization was hugely influential. It was not only engaged in formalizing the architectural principles of the Modern Movement, but also saw architecture as an economic and political tool that could be used to improve the world through the design of buildings and through urban planning.

The fourth CIAM meeting in 1933 was to have been held in Moscow. The rejection of Le Corbusier&#x27;s competition entry for the Palace of the Soviets, a watershed moment and an indication that the Soviets had abandoned CIAM&#x27;s principles, changed those plans. Instead it was held on board ship, the SS &quot;Patris II&quot;. which sailed from Marseille to Athens. Here the group discussed the principles of &quot;The Functional City&quot;, which broadened CIAM&#x27;s scope from architecture into urban planning. Based on an analysis of thirty-three cities, CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals. These proceedings went unpublished from 1933 until 1943, when Le Corbusier, acting alone, published them in heavily edited form as the Athens Charter.

=== Separation ===
As CIAM members travelled worldwide after the war, many of its ideas spread outside Europe, notably to the USA. The city planning ideas were adopted in the rebuilding of Europe following World War II, although by then some CIAM members had their doubts. Alison and Peter Smithson were chief among the dissenters. When implemented in the postwar period, many of these ideas were compromised by tight financial constraints, poor understanding of the concepts, or popular resistance. Mart Stam&#x27;s replanning of postwar Dresden in the CIAM formula was rejected by its citizens as an &quot;all-out attack on the city&quot;.

The CIAM organization disbanded in 1959 as the views of the members diverged. Le Corbusier had left in 1955, objecting to the increasing use of English during meetings.

For a reform of CIAM, the group Team 10 was active from 1953 onwards, and two different movements emerged from it: the Brutalism of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the Structuralism of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob B. Bakema).

<doc id="394071" wikidata="Q261847" url="?curid=394071" title="Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus">
<text>Charlotte (28 June 1444 – 16 July 1487) was the Queen of Cyprus from 1458 until 1464. She was the eldest and only surviving daughter of King John II of Cyprus and Helena Palaiologina. At the age of 14, she succeeded to the Cypriot throne upon the death of her father. Her illegitimate half-brother, James, challenged her right to the crown. With the support of the Egyptians, he forced her to flee the island in 1463, and he was later crowned king. She made a military attempt to regain her throne, but was unsuccessful, and died childless in Rome.

==Family and childhood==

Charlotte was born in Nicosia on 28 June 1444, the eldest and only surviving daughter of King John II of Cyprus and Helena Palaiologina. Her younger sister Cleopha died in June 1448, shortly before Charlotte&#x27;s fourth birthday, leaving her the sole legitimate heir to the Cypriot throne and her father&#x27;s titles. She had an illegitimate half-brother, James, born to her father&#x27;s Greek mistress Marietta de Patras.

She was raised in the Byzantine tradition and spoke fluent Greek, which she learned from her mother. She could write French, Italian, and possibly Latin, but throughout her life spoke mainly Greek. Due to her outspoken manner, Pope Pius II called her the &quot;Greek torrent&quot;.

==Queen of Cyprus==

Charlotte was named Princess of Antioch in 1456. The same year she married her first husband, John of Portugal. The marriage might have been intitiated by John&#x27;s aunt Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy, in order to acquire a naval base in the Mediterannean for safe passage of band of Burgundian Crusaders into the Holy Land.

Charlottes husband tried counterbalanced the Greek Orthodox influence of his mother-in-law, Helena Palaiologina. But after a time the relationship between John and his mother in law had become so strained that he and Charlotte moved to the home of Peter of Lusignan.

After a short illness, (allegedly due to poisoning by Helena)he died in 1457 and was buried in the Church of St. Francis in Nicosia.

Now a young widow, this was followed the very next year by her father dying on the 28 July 1458 .

At the age of fourteen Charlotte therefore became Queen of Cyprus and was crowned at St. Sophia Cathedral on 7 October 1458.

Charlotte&#x27;s reign was not successful. She had a tenuous hold on the kingdom as her right to the throne was constantly being challenged by her illegitimate half-brother James. On 7 October 1459, she married her second husband, Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva. This marriage had been arranged by the Genoese who promised their assistance in retaining her crown against the claims by James.

In 1460 he managed to capture Famagusta and Nicosia with aid from the Egyptian sultanate of Sayf ad-Din Inal. After being blockaded in the castle of Kyrenia for three years, she and Louis fled to Rome in 1463.

With the fall of Kyrenia before the autumn of 1464, de facto Charlotte and Louis lost their throne. Her half-brother was crowned King James II. She took up residence at the Convertendi Palace in Trastevere. Pope Pius II, who was acquainted with her described Charlotte as &quot;a woman of about twenty-four, of middle height: bright eyes, complexion betwixt dark and pale; speech smooth and flowing torrent like after the manner of the Greeks; French costume; manners becoming her royal blood&quot;.

She later formed a small court on the Greek island of Rhodes. She made an unsuccessful military attempt to regain her throne with papal support. She also intrigued against James&#x27;s widow, Catherine Cornaro, but failed to oust her from power. In November 1483 she was received by Pope Sixtus IV in the Vatican Palace and was seated in a chair of the same &quot;height and dignity&quot; as the pope. In Rome, she lived in a house in Piazza Scossacavalli in Borgo which had already hosted queen Catherine of Bosnia.

==Succession and death ==
She had adopted as her son, Alonso d&#x27;Aragona (1460–1510), the illegitimate child of King Ferdinand I of Naples, who was either married or engaged to her half-brother&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, Charla de Lusignan, b. 24 July 1468.

Charlotte had intended to maintain the continuity of the dynasty through her niece, and circa 1473, accompanied by Alonso, she visited Sultan Al-Asraf Khalil in Cairo to discuss a possible restoration to the throne. Al-Asraf supported Charlotte&#x27;s cause, but the plan could not be carried out until she had custody of young Charlotte. 

The former queen&#x27;s opponents ensured this would never happen by imprisoning the little girl in Padua; she died there before her twelfth birthday in 1480. Afterwards, a marriage was suggested between Alonso and Catherine Conaro, but this also failed due to the interference of the Republic of Venice. Instead, around February 1485, in exchange for an annual pension of 4,300 florins, Charlotte ceded her claims to her cousin&#x27;s son, Charles I of Savoy, the next in the legitimate line of succession.

Charlotte died on 16 July 1487, shortly after her forty-third birthday. Her body is buried in the chapel of Saint Andrew and Saint Gregory, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica; the funeral was paid for by Pope Innocent VIII. She was the last member of the House of Poitiers-Lusignan as her only son and heir Hugh died not long after birth . 

==Marriages==
Charlotte married twice:
# Infante John of Portugal, also known as John of Coimbra, (1431 or 1433 – between July and 11 September 1457) (son of Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra and grandson of King John I of Portugal), in May 1456 in Nicosia. He was made a titular Prince of Antioch. It is rumoured that his death was a murder due to poisoning, arranged by Queen Helena, leaving Charlotte free to make a second marriage.
# Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva (Geneva, 5 June 1436 or 1 April 1437 – Château-Monastery de Ripaille, August 1482). The couple were married on 7 October 1459, almost a year after Charlotte&#x27;s coronation. Louis was her cousin: he was the second son and namesake of Louis, Count of Savoy by Anne de Lusignan, daughter of King Janus of Cyprus, and became a King of Cyprus from 1459 to 1462 and also a titular King of Jerusalem.

By her second husband Louis, Charlotte had;
*Hugh or Henry, who was born on 4 July 1464 in Rhodes. The boy died within a month of his birth.

<text>Meiringen () is a municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. Besides the village of Meiringen, the municipality includes the settlements of Balm, Brünigen, Eisenbolgen, Hausen, Prasti, Sand, Stein, Unterbach, Unterheidon, Wylerli and Zaun. The municipal coat of arms shows a black eagle in a yellow field. (&quot;Or an Eagle displayed Sable crowned, beaked, langued and of the first.&quot;)
Formerly the coat of arms of the entire Oberhasli &quot;Talschaft&quot;, this design continues the imperial coat of arms.

Meiringen is famous for the nearby Reichenbach Falls, a waterfall that was the setting for the final showdown between Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his nemesis Professor Moriarty. The village is also known for its claim to have been the place where meringue was first created.

==Geography==

Meiringen is located in the eastern Bernese Oberland region, in a valley of the upper reaches of the river Aare, called Haslital, upstream of Lake Brienz. It lies at the foot of several mountain passes, including the Brünig Pass to the valley of the Sarner Aa and hence central Switzerland, the Joch Pass to Engelberg, the Susten Pass to the upper valley of the Reuss, the Grimsel Pass to the valley of the Rhone and hence southern Switzerland, and the Grosse Scheidegg Pass to Grindelwald.

On the right bank of the Aare, the municipality of Meiringen rises from an elevation of on the valley floor to the Brünig Pass at and beyond that to a point at on the slopes of the Wilerhorn. On the left bank it stretches up into the Alps and reaches an elevation of at the summit of the Wellhorn. It includes the village of Meiringen and the settlements of Sand, Stein, Eisenbolgen, Hausen, Balm, Unterbach and Unterheidon in the valley, the village of Brünigen in the Brünig Pass and the hamlets of Prasti, Zaun and Wylerli on the slopes above the valley.

The municipality has an area, , of . Of this area, or 43.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 32.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 7.5% is settled (buildings or roads), or 1.3% is either rivers or lakes and or 15.0% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 3.1% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.3%. Out of the forested land, 29.7% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.4% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 3.3% is used for growing crops and 17.8% is pastures and 22.5% is used for alpine pastures. All the water in the municipality is in rivers and streams. Of the unproductive areas, 5.6% is unproductive vegetation and 9.4% is too rocky for vegetation.

==History==

Meiringen is first mentioned in 1234 as &quot;Magiringin&quot;. Due to its strategic location at the foot of several alpine passes, the area around Meiringen was settled at least in the Early Middle Ages. The first village church was built in the 9th or 10th century. When it was destroyed in a flood the new church of St. Michael (first mentioned in 1234) was built about above the old church. The current church of St. Michael dates from the 15th century and was renovated in 1683–84. The Restiturm castle was constructed in the 13th century, whilst the Wyghus fortress in the Brünig Pass was first mentioned in 1333, though it was destroyed later.

Meiringen was always the political capital of the surrounding valley (&quot;Talschaft&quot;). It was the capital of the Imperial &quot;reichsfrei&quot; bailiwick of Hasli. In 1275 it formed an alliance with the city of Bern. In 1311, Hasli was given to the house of Weissenburg by Henry VII. After an unsuccessful revolt in 1334, Hasli passed to the city of Bern as a subject territory in name but regained most of its earlier privileges. Under Bernese control it was the capital of the District of Oberhasli until 1798. Following the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic it was the capital of the district of Oberhasli in the Canton of Oberland (1798–1803) and then the capital of the District of Oberhasli in the canton of Bern. The village was the home of the &quot;Talschaft&quot; council and the regional court met at the cross street in front of the churchyard. Today it is still home to the Bernese District authorities, though many of the administrative offices and the district court are now in Interlaken.

Meiringen was the only market town in the valley with a yearly fair starting in 1417. In 1490 this became a weekly market. Traders from the lowlands of Lombardy came here to purchase cattle, horses, and cheese. Located at the foot of Brunig, Grimsel, Susten and Joch passes, Meiringen was a hub in the trade from the lowlands through the passes. Outside of Meiringen village the main occupation was agriculture or cattle farming until the 19th century. Originally there were six Bäuert (farming collectives) among the villages and hamlets in the valley.

In the 1550s, a series of floods of the Aare destroyed the valley floor villages of Balm and Bürglen, both of which were abandoned. The old village of Unterheid was destroyed in 1762 when the Aare changed its course, though the village was rebuilt in a new location. In 1734 the Alpbach wall was built to protect against the river, though this problem was not solved until the 1866–80 Aare water correction project.

The population growth after 1800 led to impoverishment and forced many to emigrate, mainly to America. Beginning in 1880, the growth of tourism brought new wealth into the valley. Increasing tourist traffic came over the roads that were opened over the Brünig (1859–61), the Grimsel (1847–94) and the Susten (1939–46) passes. The Brünigbahn (Brünig railway) opened in 1888, making it easier for tourists to come into the valley. Following fires in 1879 and 1891, much of the village was rebuilt with tourists in mind. In 1913 Meiringen had 18 hotels with 500 beds. In 1912, the Meiringen–Reichenbach–Aareschlucht tramway was constructed to link the village to the Reichenbach Falls and Aare Gorge, two of the principle local tourist attractions; the line survived until closure in 1956.

In 1892 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle visited the Reichenbach Falls outside Meiringen and subsequently used them as the setting for the struggle between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty in his story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

During World War II, the tourism industry collapsed, so the Federal Government created jobs by opening the Unterbach military airfield; the federal armory; the SBB depot; the power plants at Oberhasli AG and in hospitals. The municipal museum was founded in 1968 and the Sherlock Holmes Museum opened in 1991.

<doc id="394077" wikidata="Q4809579" url="?curid=394077" title="Association list">
<text>In computer programming and particularly in Lisp, an association list, often referred to as an alist, is a linked list in which each list element (or node) comprises a key and a value. The association list is said to &quot;associate&quot; the value with the key. In order to find the value associated with a given key, a sequential search is used: each element of the list is searched in turn, starting at the head, until the key is found. Associative lists provide a simple way of implementing an associative array, but are efficient only when the number of keys is very small.

==Operation==
An associative array is an abstract data type that can be used to maintain a collection of key–value pairs and look up the value associated with a given key. The association list provides a simple way of implementing this data type.

To test whether a key is associated with a value in a given association list, search the list starting at its first node and continuing either until a node containing the key has been found or until the search reaches the end of the list (in which case the key is not present).
To add a new key–value pair to an association list, create a new node for that key-value pair, set the node&#x27;s link to be the previous first element of the association list, and replace the first element of the association list with the new node. Although some implementations of association lists disallow having multiple nodes with the same keys as each other, such duplications are not problematic for this search algorithm: duplicate keys that appear later in the list are ignored.

It is also possible to delete a key from an association list, by scanning the list to find each occurrence of the key and splicing the nodes containing the key out of the list. The scan should continue to the end of the list, even when the key is found, in case the same key may have been inserted multiple times.

==Performance==
The disadvantage of association lists is that the time to search is , where is the length of the list. For large lists, this may be much slower than the times that can be obtained by representing an associative array as a binary search tree or as a hash table.
Additionally, unless the list is regularly pruned to remove elements with duplicate keys, multiple values associated with the same key will increase the size of the list, and thus the time to search, without providing any compensatory advantage.

One advantage of association lists is that a new element can be added in constant time. Additionally, when the number of keys is very small, searching an association list may be more efficient than searching a binary search tree or hash table, because of the greater simplicity of their implementation.

==Applications and software libraries==
In the early development of Lisp, association lists were used to resolve references to free variables in procedures. In this application, it is convenient to augment association lists with an additional operation, that reverses the addition of a key–value pair without scanning the list for other copies of the same key. In this way, the association list can function as a stack, allowing local variables to temporarily shadow other variables with the same names, without destroying the values of those other variables.

Many programming languages, including
Lisp,
Scheme,
OCaml, and
Haskell have functions for handling association lists in their standard libraries.

==See also==
*Self-organizing list, a strategy for re-ordering the keys in an association list to speed up searches for frequently-accessed keys.
*Property list, or plist, another associative array data structure used in Lisp (not to be confused with property lists, a file format also called plist files).

<text>Blanche Kelso Bruce (March 1, 1841March 17, 1898) was an American politician who represented Mississippi as a Republican in the United States Senate from 1875 to 1881. Born into slavery in Prince Edward County, Virginia, he went on to become the first elected African-American senator to serve a full term (Hiram R. Revels, also of Mississippi, was the first African American to serve in the U.S. Senate but did not complete a full term).

He was appointed as Recorder of Deeds in Washington D.C. during Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s presidency. His home, the Blanche K. Bruce House, is a National Historic Landmark.

==Early life and education==
Bruce was born into slavery in 1841 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, near Farmville to Polly Bruce, an African-American woman who served as a domestic slave. His father was his master, Pettis Perkinson, a white Virginia planter. Bruce was treated comparatively well by his father, who educated him together with a legitimate half-brother. When Bruce was young, he played with his half-brother. One source claims that his father legally freed Blanche and arranged for an apprenticeship so he could learn a trade. In an 1886 newspaper interview, however, Bruce says that he gained his freedom by moving to Kansas as soon as hostilities broke out in the Civil War.

==Career==
Bruce attended Oberlin College for two years in Oberlin, Ohio. He next worked as a steamboat porter on the Mississippi River. In 1864, he moved to Hannibal, Missouri, where he established a school for black children.

In 1868, during Reconstruction, Bruce relocated to Bolivar near Cleveland in northwestern Mississippi, at which he purchased a Mississippi Delta plantation. He became a wealthy landowner of several thousand acres in the Mississippi Delta. He was appointed to the positions of Tallahatchie County registrar of voters and tax assessor before he won an election for sheriff in Bolivar County. He later was elected to other county positions, including tax collector and supervisor of education, while he also edited a local newspaper. He became sergeant-at-arms for the Mississippi State Senate in 1870.

In February 1874, Bruce was elected to the U.S. Senate, the second African American to serve in the upper house of Congress. On February 14, 1879, Bruce presided over the U.S. Senate, becoming the first African American (and the only former slave) to have done so. In 1880, James Z. George, a Confederate Army veteran and member of the Democratic Party, was elected to succeed Bruce. After his Senate term expired, Bruce remained in Washington, D.C., secured a succession of Republican patronage jobs and stumped for Republican candidates across the country. He acquired a large townhouse and summer home, and presided over black high society.

At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Bruce became the first African American to win any votes for national office at a major party&#x27;s nominating convention, with eight votes for vice president. The presidential nominee that year was Ohio&#x27;s James A. Garfield, who narrowly won election over the Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock.

In early 1889, politically connected blacks lobbied for Bruce to receive a Cabinet appointment in the Harrison Administration. Said one newspaper: &quot;Bruce is a man of respectable ability, and has, perhaps, more than any other man of his race who has sat in Congress, the respect of those with whom he served.

Bruce served by appointment as the District of Columbia recorder of deeds from 1890 to 1893. A Philadelphia newspaper reported his appointment in 1890, but persistent claims that his salary was $30,000 a year are not substantiated by any primary records. He also served on the District of Columbia Board of Trustees of Public Schools from 1892 to 1895. He was a participant in the March 5, 1897 meeting to celebrate the memory of Frederick Douglass and the American Negro Academy led by Alexander Crummell. He was appointed as Register of the Treasury a second time in 1897 by President William McKinley and served until his death from diabetes complications in 1898.

==Personal life==
On June 24, 1878, Bruce married Josephine Beall Willson (1853–1923), a fair-skinned socialite of Cleveland, Ohio, amid great publicity; the couple traveled to Europe for a four-month honeymoon. Their only child, Roscoe Conkling Bruce, was born in 1879. He was named for U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, Bruce&#x27;s mentor in the Senate.

One newspaper wrote that Bruce did not approve of the designation &quot;colored men.&quot; He often said, &quot;I am a Negro and proud of it.&quot;

==Honors and legacy==
In July 1898, the District of Columbia public school trustees ordered that a then-new public school building on Marshall Street in Park View be named the Bruce School in his honor.

In 1975, the Washington, D.C. residence of Bruce, was declared a National Historic Landmark and formally named The Blanche K. Bruce House.

In October 1999, the U.S. Senate commissioned a portrait of Bruce. African-American Washington D.C. artist Simmie Knox was selected in 2000 to paint the portrait, which was unveiled in the Capitol in 2001.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Blanche Bruce on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

On March 1, 2006, the African American Heritage Preservation Foundation unveiled a historical highway marker noting Bruce&#x27;s birthplace at the intersection of highway 360 and 623 near Green Bay, Prince Edward County, Virginia.

Lawrence Otis Graham authored a historical book about Bruce titled &quot;The True Story of America&#x27;s First Black Dynasty: The Senator and the Socialite&quot; in June 2006.

<doc id="394081" wikidata="Q7457059" url="?curid=394081" title="Seussical">
<text>Seussical, sometimes Seussical the Musical, is a musical comedy with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, music by Stephen Flaherty, and book by Ahrens and Flaherty. based on the many children&#x27;s stories of Dr. Seuss, with most of its plot being based on &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;, &quot;Gertrude McFuzz&quot;, and &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; while incorporating many other stories. The musical&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of &quot;Seuss&quot; and the word &quot;musical&quot;. Following its Broadway debut in 2000, the show was widely panned by critics, and closed in 2001 with huge financial losses. It has spawned two US national tours and a West End production, and has become a frequent production for schools and regional theaters.

==Plot==
&quot;This synopsis describes the tour version of the show, currently being licensed as &quot;Seussical the Musical&quot; by Music Theatre International (MTI).&quot;

===Act I===
The show opens on a bare stage, with an odd red-and-white-striped hat in the center. A small boy wanders into view and notices the hat, wondering to whom it might belong. He finally mentions the word Cat in the Hat, who appears before the Boy and tells him he has been brought to life by the Boy&#x27;s &quot;Thinks&quot;. The Cat urges this boy to Think up the &quot;Seussian&quot; world and characters around the boy and himself (&quot;Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!&quot;). The Cat then reveals to the Boy that he is about to tell a story about someone as imaginative as the Boy is.

To begin the story, the Cat encourages the Boy to think up the Jungle of Nool, where Horton the Elephant is bathing. Horton hears a strange noise coming from a nearby speck of dust, and reasons that someone must be on it, calling out for help. He carefully places the speck on a soft clover and decides to guard it (&quot;Horton Hears a Who&quot;). But he is mocked mercilessly by the Sour Kangaroo and the other animals of the jungle, who do not believe him (&quot;Biggest Blame Fool&quot;). The only exceptions are Horton&#x27;s bird neighbors, Gertrude McFuzz, who admires his compassion, and Mayzie LaBird, who is more concerned about herself (&quot;Biggest Blame Fool Playoff&quot;).

Horton soon discovers that the speck is actually a microscopic planet populated by creatures called Whos. The citizens of Who-ville introduce themselves and their yearly Christmas pageant directed by their friend the Grinch. They also reveal that in addition to being unable to control where the speck flies, they are on the brink of war and their entire population of Truffula Trees has been cut down (&quot;Here on Who&quot;). The Whos thank Horton and ask for his protection, and he agrees to guard their planet.

At this point, the Cat pushes the Boy into the story; he becomes Jojo, the son of the Mayor of Who-ville and his wife. Jojo has been getting into trouble at school for having Thinks, so his parents order him to &quot;take a bath and go to bed, and think some normal Thinks, instead&quot;. Jojo blames the Cat for getting him into trouble and tries to send him away. The Cat refuses and persuades Jojo to imagine the tub is McElligot&#x27;s Pool (&quot;It&#x27;s Possible&quot;). Jojo inadvertently floods the house, leading the Mayor and his wife to contemplate what to do with their son (&quot;How to Raise a Child&quot;). When the Cat hands them a brochure, they decide to send Jojo to a military school run by General Genghis Khan Schmitz, who is preparing to go to war with those who eat their bread with the butter side down (&quot;The Military&quot;). While there, Jojo meets Horton, and finds a mutual friend in him (&quot;Alone in the Universe&quot;).

Gertrude, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Horton, but is afraid he does not notice her because of her own tail, which consists of only &quot;one droopy-droop feather&quot; (&quot;The One Feather Tail of Miss Gertrude McFuzz&quot;). At the advice of Mayzie, whose tail is enormous and dazzling, she consumes pills which make her tail grow new feathers. Gertrude is so excited that she overdoses, causing her tail to grow long and unwieldy (&quot;Amazing Mayzie&quot;/&quot;Amazing Gertrude&quot;).

Horton is ambushed by the Wickersham brothers, a gang of delinquent monkeys, who steal the clover and make off with it (&quot;Monkey Around&quot;). Horton gives chase until the Wickershams hand the clover to an eagle named Vlad Vladikoff, who drops it into a large patch of identical clovers (&quot;Chasing the Whos&quot;). Here, the Cat cuts briefly into the action to remind the audience how lucky they are to not be Horton (&quot;How Lucky You Are&quot;). Undeterred, Horton begins to look for the clover, hoping the Whos are still alive, when Gertrude catches up with him and tries to get him to notice her new tail. Horton is too busy, so she leaves to take more pills (&quot;Notice Me, Horton&quot;).

Horton is about to search his three millionth clover when he loses hope. Mayzie, sitting in a nearby tree, offers to help him forget about the Whos by hatching an egg that she is too lazy to care for (&quot;How Lucky You Are (Reprise)&quot;). Horton reluctantly agrees, and Mayzie leaves for a vacation. Horton sits through months of harsh weather as he tries to decide between the egg and the Whos (&quot;Horton Sits on the Egg&quot;) before he is captured by hunters, who take him away along with the entire tree. Gertrude tries to stop the hunters, but cannot fly due to her heavy tail.

The Cat closes the act with a reprise of &quot;How Lucky You Are&quot;, and conducts the band during the intermission.

===Act II===
Horton, still hatching the egg, is auctioned off to the traveling Circus McGurkus (&quot;Egg, Nest, and Tree&quot;/&quot;Circus McGurkus&quot;/&quot;How Lucky You Are (Reprise)&quot;). At one show in Palm Beach, he meets up with Mayzie, who insists that he keep the egg for himself before leaving (&quot;Amayzing Horton&quot;). Horton mourns the loss of the Whos and Jojo, but vows just as surely to protect the egg, as it, too, is alone without its mother (&quot;Alone in the Universe (Reprise)&quot;), and sings it a lullaby with Jojo about a magical place called Solla Sollew. At the same time, the Mayor and his wife begin to miss Horton and Jojo, and wish for Solla Sollew, as well (&quot;Solla Sollew&quot;).

Jojo is with General Schmitz and his platoon as the Butter Battle commences (&quot;Transition to Butter Battle&quot;). Jojo deserts Schmitz, but sprints into a minefield and vanishes in an explosion. Schmitz assumes the worst and heads to Who-ville to tell Jojo&#x27;s parents that their son has died (&quot;A Message from the Front&quot;). The Cat returns to perform a re-enactment of the dramatic scene. But in reality, Jojo has survived, but is lost with no idea of where to turn. The Cat appears to him with a band of Hunches, encouraging him to use his Thinks to find his way home (&quot;Havin&#x27; a Hunch&quot;). Jojo does so and happily reunites with his parents, who forgive him for his Thinks.

Gertrude sneaks into the circus to free Horton, explaining she plucked out all but one of her tail feathers to fly there, and confesses her love for him. She also reveals she has found his clover, delighting and relieving Horton to find the Whos alive and well (&quot;All for You&quot;). However, the Sour Kangaroo and the Wickersham brothers arrive to take Horton back to the jungle.

Icabod and Izzy journeyed alphabet letters from Aunt Annie&#x27;s Alligator to Zizzer-Zazzer-Zuzz (&quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27;s ABC&quot;).

In the jungle, Horton is put on trial for the crimes of &quot;talking to a speck, disturbing the peace, and loitering... on an egg&quot; (&quot;The People Versus Horton the Elephant&quot;). Aided by Gertrude, Horton makes his best case, but Judge Yertle the Turtle finds him guilty. He orders Horton remanded to the &quot;Nool Asylum for the Criminally Insane&quot; and the clover destroyed in a kettle of hot &quot;Beezle-Nut&quot; oil. Desperate, Horton encourages the Whos to make as much noise as possible to prove their existence, but the animals do not hear them. Jojo finally uses his Thinks to conjure a new word, &quot;Yopp&quot;, which he shouts loudly enough to reach the animals&#x27; ears. Convinced at last, the animals repent and promise to help protect the Whos, and Horton is acquitted. Jojo is accepted by his parents and the rest of Who-ville as &quot;Thinker Non-Stop&quot; for saving their planet. Horton&#x27;s egg hatches into a tiny flying &quot;Elephant-Bird&quot;, amazing everyone, but dismaying Horton, who panics at the thought of flying progeny. Gertrude reassures him that they can raise the child together, and they agree to do so.

With the story finished, the Cat returns to close the show (&quot;Finale - Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!&quot;), then vanishes along with the scenery, leaving only his hat and Jojo, who is now the Boy again. The Boy picks the hat up, dons it, and says, &quot;Seuss!&quot;

During a curtain call, the company performs a number based on &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; (&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;).

==Productions==
===Pre-Broadway===
In a reading in New York City, Eric Idle played the Cat in the Hat, and was credited at the time for contributions to the story line. In the Toronto workshop in 2000, coordinated by Livent Inc., Andrea Martin played the Cat in the Hat. Positive early buzz set off a bidding war among New York theatre producers, with Barry and Fran Weissler acquiring the rights. The musical had its out-of-town tryout in Boston, Massachusetts at the Colonial Theatre in September 2000.

An extensive sequence adapting &quot;The Lorax&quot; was seen in the original script, which involved Jojo meeting the Once-ler (played by Eddie Korbich in Boston) after deserting the army, and receiving the last Truffula Tree seed from him, giving him the courage to save Who-ville. Relevant characters included the Lorax himself as well as Bar-ba-loots, Swomee-Swans, and Humming-Fish, who would all appear and disappear as the Once-ler told his story. The sequence faced numerous difficulties due to the show&#x27;s already lengthy running time, and was ultimately cut entirely after its Boston tryout.

===Broadway===
&quot;Seussical&quot; opened on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on November 30, 2000. 
It was directed by Frank Galati and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall. Marshall&#x27;s brother Rob Marshall was hired to direct the show when it returned to Broadway from Boston, though was uncredited. Originally, Catherine Zuber was the costume designer who made costumes as close to Seuss&#x27;s illustrations as possible, and her costumes were seen in the Boston run. However, for Broadway, Zuber was replaced by William Ivey Long, whose costumes were more realistic and clashed with the Seussian set design. David Shiner played the Cat in the Hat, while Kevin Chamberlin played Horton, Michele Pawk played Mayzie LaBird, Stuart Zagnit and Alice Playten played Mr. and Mrs. Mayor, and Sharon Wilkins played the Sour Kangaroo.

The show received almost universally negative reviews. In January 2001, in response to falling ticket sales, producers brought in Rosie O&#x27;Donnell to replace Shiner as the Cat in the Hat for a month-long engagement. O&#x27;Donnell also came in because Shiner went on vacation to see his wife in Germany. The move was criticized as stunt casting, but was successful at temporarily boosting ticket sales. After O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s run ended, Shiner returned to Seussical as the Cat in the Hat in February until March. In March, young pop star Aaron Carter and former Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby were cast as JoJo and the Cat respectively for short engagements. Due to poor box office, the show closed on May 20 the same year after 198 performances. Its ultimate financial losses were estimated at $11 million, making it one of the worst financial flops in Broadway history.

===US tours===
Following the Broadway production, there were two US national tours. Rigby reprised her role as the Cat for the first tour which ran from September 2002 to June 2003. A second non-Equity production toured from 2003 to 2004.

The script for the first tour was reworked extensively after the show&#x27;s poor showing on Broadway, resulting in the removal or reworking of several songs. The biggest change involved Jojo, who would now initially appear as an anonymous boy imagining the events onstage before the Cat pushed him into the story. Additional dialogue was included, and some songs and their reprises were cut. This version of the show is the one currently licensed by MTI as &quot;Seussical the Musical&quot;.

===Off-Broadway===
A 90-minute Off-Broadway production was staged at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in 2007 by Theatreworks USA. It was directed and choreographed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge. This production was downscaled for the National Tour, which had its last show in spring 2018.

===West End (London)===
&quot;Seussical&quot; opened on the West End at the Arts Theatre on December 4, 2012, presented by Selladoor Worldwide. It returned in 2013.

===Off West End (London)===
&quot;Seussical&quot; opened at the Southwark Playhouse on 22 November 2018, and ran performances until 29 December.

=== South Africa ===
&quot;Seussical&quot; opened at the Lyric Theatre at Gold Reef Cityon December 20, 2019, for the festive season, presented by AndCoSA &amp;CO.

==One-act versions==
A one-act version of the Broadway show titled &quot;Seussical Jr.&quot; has been created as part of MTI&#x27;s &quot;Jr.&quot; series. It is intended to be shorter and more accessible for junior high or middle school students, and has an average run time of 60 minutes. For &quot;Jr.&quot;, various songs are cut and shortened; the subplots based on &quot;The Butter Battle Book&quot; and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, and their relevant songs and characters, are removed to make the story more understandable for younger audiences, though the Grinch retains one line during the song &quot;Here on Who&quot;. General Schmitz is replaced in &quot;Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!&quot; by the Wickersham Brothers. Songs cut include &quot;Our Story Resumes&quot;, &quot;The Circus McGurkus&quot; and &quot;The Circus on Tour&quot;.

An even shorter version of the show, &quot;Seussical KIDS&quot;, is also available from MTI. The 30-minute &quot;KIDS&quot; version is intended for a large cast of young performers. Notable differences between &quot;Jr.&quot; and &quot;KIDS&quot; include the introduction of three Cats in the Hats and the removal of the songs &quot;Biggest Blame Fool&quot;, &quot;Amayzing Mayzie&quot;, and &quot;Notice Me, Horton&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;Seussical&quot; was reworked into a &quot;Theatre for Young Audiences&quot; version. The cast was reduced to 12 actors, with the plot changed to focus more on Horton.

<text>AS-102 (also designated SA-7) was the seventh flight of the Saturn I launch vehicle, which carried the boilerplate Apollo spacecraft BP-15 into low Earth orbit. The test took place on September 18, 1964, lasting for five orbits (about seven and a half hours). The spacecraft and its upper stage completed 59 orbits before reentering the atmosphere and crashing in the Indian Ocean on September 22, 1964.

==Objectives==
AS-102 was designed to repeat the flight of AS-101. It would once again carry a boilerplate Apollo command and service module. The only difference from Boilerplate 13 carried on AS-101 was that on Boilerplate 15, one of the simulated reaction control system thruster quads (attitude control thrusters) was instrumented to record launch temperatures and vibrations. Another major difference on AS-102 was that the launch escape system (LES) tower would be jettisoned using the launch escape and pitch control motors.

AS-102 was the first time a Saturn rocket carried the ST-124 programmable guidance computer. Previous launches had used an onboard &quot;black box&quot; that was preprogrammed. On AS-102 it would be possible to reprogram the computer during flight so that any anomalous behavior could potentially be corrected.

==Flight==
In early July, a small crack in engine number six was found. This meant removing the engine, the first time that the ground crew had to do this with a Saturn rocket. It was then decided to return all eight engines to the manufacturer, which meant a job that would take about ten hours because of the large number of tubes, hoses and wires that connected each engine to the rocket. The replacement delayed the launch by about two weeks, followed by another delay of several days because of Hurricanes Cleo and Dora.

Launch was on 18 September from Cape Kennedy, Florida just before noon local time. The first stage burned for 147.7 seconds, with separation 0.8 seconds later. The second stage ignited 1.7 seconds later, and the LES jettisoned at 160.2 seconds after launch. It burned until +621.1 seconds with the stage and boilerplate in a 212.66 by 226.50 km orbit.

The flight met all its objectives. The spacecraft continued to transmit telemetry for five orbits and was tracked until re-entry on its 59th orbit over the Indian Ocean.

The only anomalous event on the flight was the failure to recover the eight film-camera pods. They had landed downrange of the expected area, where Hurricane Gladys forestalled a continued search. However, two of the pods did wash ashore two months later. The pods were covered with barnacles, but the film inside was undamaged.

<text>James II (; /1439 or 1440 – 10 July 1473) was the penultimate King of Cyprus (usurper), reigning from 1460/1464 until his death.

==Archbishop of Nicosia==
James was born in Nicosia as the illegitimate son of John II of Cyprus and Marietta de Patras. He was a great favourite of his father, and in 1456, at the age of 16, he was appointed to the archbishopric of Nicosia. After murdering Iacopo Urri, the royal chamberlain, on 1 April 1457, he was deprived of the archbishopric and fled to Rhodes on a ship of the Catalan Juan Tafures. He was pardoned by his father, and the archbishopric was returned to him.

==King of Cyprus==
In 1458, his father died and his half-sister Charlotte became Queen of Cyprus. Then in 1460, with support from the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Sayf ad-Din Inal, James challenged her right to the throne, blockading her and her husband, Louis of Savoy, in the castle of Kyrenia for three years. Charlotte fled to Rome in 1463.

With the fall of Kyrenia before the autumn of 1464, de facto Charlotte and Louis lost their throne. James was crowned king in her stead. In gratitude, he made his friend and supporter Juan Tafures Master of his Household and titular Count of Tripoli.

==Marriage, death and succession==
In Venice, on 30 July 1468, seeking political support, he married a 14-year-old Venetian, Catherine Cornaro, by proxy. She finally sailed to Cyprus in 1472 and married in person at Famagusta in October or November. James died in Famagusta a few months later amidst some suspicion that he might have been poisoned by agents of Venice, possibly by Catherine&#x27;s uncles. According to his will, Catherine, who was pregnant, became regent. The couple&#x27;s son, James III, died under suspicious circumstances in 1474 before his first birthday, leaving Catherine as queen regnant of Cyprus. During her reign, the island was controlled by Venetian merchants. In 1489, Venice forced her to abdicate, and Cyprus became a colony of the Republic of Venice.

==Illegitimate children==
Prior to his marriage, King James II had three natural children with an unnamed mistress:
* Eugene of Lusignan (b. c. 1468 - d. Venice, 1536), married Donna Paola Mazzara of Sicily after 1509.
*Janus of Lusignan (d. after 1552), married (1) 1504 to N de Toro, married (2) 1547 to Virginia Cosanza dei Duchi di San Sava, with issue.
*Charlotte of Lusignan (b. April 1468 - d. 24 July 1480 in Castel of Padua), she was either married or engaged to the designated heir of her aunt, Alonso, batard d&#x27;Aragona (1460–1510), a son of Ferdinand I of Naples. She was imprisoned by Queen Charlotte&#x27;s opponents and died in captivity shortly before her twelfth birthday. 
He had another mistress, by the name of Eschive de Nores (d. after 1468), who married his cousin, Philippe, Titular Prince of Galilee, a natural son of his great-uncle, Henry. However, there is no record of any children with her.

<text>Horton Hears a Who! is a children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by Theodor Seuss Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss. It was published in 1954 by Random House. This book tells the story of Horton the Elephant and his adventures saving Whoville, a tiny planet located on a speck of dust, from the animals who mock him. These animals attempt to steal and burn the speck of dust, so Horton goes to great lengths to save Whoville from being incinerated. 

&quot;A person&#x27;s a person, no matter how small&quot; is the most popular line from &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; and also serves as the major moral theme that Dr. Seuss conveys to his audience. Horton endures harassment to care for and ensure the safety of the Whos, who represent the insignificant. &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; has been well-received in libraries, schools, and homes across the world. The book has been adapted as a 1970 television special and a 2008 animated film by Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox Animation, and much of its plot was incorporated into the Broadway musical production &quot;Seussical&quot;.

==Background==
Geisel began work on &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; in the fall of 1953. It is his second book to feature Horton the Elephant with the first being &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot;. The Whos would later reappear in &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;. The book&#x27;s main theme, &quot;a person&#x27;s a person no matter how small&quot;, was Geisel&#x27;s reaction to his visit to Japan, where the importance of the individual was an exciting new concept. Geisel, who had harbored strong anti-Japan sentiments before and during World War II, changed his views dramatically after the war and used this book as an allegory for the American post-war occupation of the country. His comparison of the Whos and the Japanese was a way for him to express his willingness for companionship. Geisel strived to relay the message that the Japanese should be valued equally, especially in a stressful post-war era. He dedicated the book to a Japanese friend.

==Plot==
The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who, &quot;On the 15th of May, in The Jungle of Nool&quot;, while splashing in a pool, hears a speck of dust talking to him. Horton surmises that a small person lives on the speck and places it on the top of a red clover, vowing to protect it. He later discovers that the speck is actually a tiny planet, home to a community called Whoville, where microscopic creatures called Whos live. The Mayor of Whoville asks Horton to protect them from harm, which Horton happily agrees to, proclaiming throughout the book, &quot;A person&#x27;s a person, no matter how small&quot;.

Throughout the book, Horton is trying to convince the Jungle of Nool that &quot;a person is a person no matter how small&quot; and that everyone should be treated equally. In his mission to protect the speck, Horton is ridiculed and harassed by the other animals in the jungle for it since they believe that anything that can&#x27;t be seen or heard is nonexistent. He is first criticized by the sour kangaroo and her joey. The splash they make as they jump into the pool almost reaches the speck, so Horton decides to find somewhere safer for it. But the news of his odd new behavior spreads quickly, and he is soon harassed by the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys (which are actually apes). They steal the clover from him and give it to Vlad Vladikoff, a “black-bottomed” eagle. Vlad flies the clover a long distance, with Horton in pursuit, until Vlad drops it into the middle of a field of clovers that stretches for hundreds of miles.

After an extremely long search, Horton finally finds the clover (the 3,000,000th flower) with the speck on it. However, the Mayor informs him that Whoville, the town on the speck, is in bad shape from the fall, and Horton discovers that the sour kangaroo and the Wickersham Brothers (along with their extended family) have caught up to him. They tie Horton up and threaten to boil the speck in a hot steaming kettle of &quot;Beezle-Nut&quot; oil. To save Whoville, Horton implores the little people to make as much noise as they can, to prove their existence. So almost everyone in Whoville shouts, sings, and plays instruments, but still no one but Horton can hear them. So the Mayor searches Whoville until he finds a very small shirker named JoJo, who is playing with a yo-yo instead of making noise. The Mayor carries him to the top of Eiffelberg Tower, where JoJo shouts out a loud &quot;Yopp!&quot;, which finally makes the kangaroo and the monkeys hear the Whos. Now convinced of the Whos&#x27; existence, the other jungle animals vow to help Horton protect the tiny community.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; was published on August 28, 1954, by Random House Children&#x27;s Books which is a division of the publishing company Random House. There are four formats of the book that exist including a hardcopy version, a paperback version, an e-book version, and an audio version. There are several editions of the hardcopy version including a &quot;Party Edition&quot; and a 65th-anniversary edition. Dr. Seuss has sold hundreds of millions of copies in over thirty languages of his well-known children&#x27;s books, which includes &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;

==Reception and analysis==
&quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; is written in anapestic tetrameter, like many other Dr. Seuss books. Unlike some of his books, however, &quot;Horton&quot; contains a strong moral message—&quot;a person&#x27;s a person, no matter how small&quot;—which Thomas Fensch identifies as &quot;universal, multinational, multi-ethnic. In a word: Equality&quot;. 

The book unites two polar opposite worlds through Horton&#x27;s determination, integrity, faithfulness, and bravery.

&quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; received praise for the moral message Dr. Seuss exemplifies through Horton the Elephant. A 2002 news article in the &quot;Santa Fe Reporter&quot; details comedic performer Susan Jayne Weiss saying, &quot;Horton is the ultimate metaphor for believing in yourself, your mission and what you know to be true, against societal prescriptions to the contrary&quot;. Ben Witherington of the Asbury Theological Seminary applauds Dr. Seuss for his work in the characterization of Horton as the elephant fights to show the other animals that even the small people are people deserving of respect and love. Additionally, Witherington commended Dr. Seuss for his disdain for cynicism while proving that the imagination can solve life&#x27;s troubles.

Peter Tonguette, writing for &quot;National Review&quot;, lauded the book&#x27;s intricate and thoughtful rhymes and appealing illustrations defined Seuss&#x27;s work.

In recent years, the book has been adopted by the United States anti-abortion movement, with some interpreting &quot;a person&#x27;s a person, no matter how small&quot; as being an allegory for the human fetus. This interpretation has been criticized by Audrey Geisel, the widow of the author, and Karl ZoBell, an attorney for Dr. Seuss Enterprises.

==Adaptations in other media==
===1970 television special===

&quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; was adapted into a half-hour animated TV special by MGM Animation/Visual Arts in 1970. It was directed by Chuck Jones, produced by Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), and narrated by Hans Conried, who also voiced Horton. The Sour Kangaroo (voiced by June Foray)&#x27;s name is Jane Kangaroo while her son is named Junior. Horton&#x27;s contact in Whoville was not the Mayor, but a scientist named Dr. Hoovie who was also voiced by Hans Conried. Vlad Vladikov&#x27;s name was changed to Whizzer McWoff. Dr. Seuss was awarded a Peabody Award for the animated special &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; 

===&quot;My Friends, Where Are You?&quot; (1987 Ukrainian animated short film)===
===&quot;I Can Hear You&quot; (1992 Russian short film)===
===2000 stage production===
The story, along with &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot;, also provides the basic plot for the 2000 Broadway musical &quot;Seussical&quot; with &quot;the biggest blame fool in the jungle of Nool&quot;, Horton the Elephant, as the main protagonist. &quot;Seussical&quot; debuted on November 30, 2000, at the famed Richard Rodgers Theatre with high expectations. The music in the play was written by Tony Award winners Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The show flopped and eventually closed six months later on May 20, 2001. Known as one of &quot;Broadway&#x27;s biggest losers&quot;, &quot;Seussical&quot; lost an estimated 11 million dollars. During its time on Broadway, &quot;Seussical&quot;″s Kevin Chamberlin was nominated for one Tony Award (Best Actor in a Musical).

===2008 film===

&quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; was adapted into a computer-animated feature-length film of the same name in 2008, using computer animation from Blue Sky Studios, the animation arm of 20th Century Fox. The cast includes Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, and Amy Poehler. It was released on March 14, 2008. The film received 18 award nominations including a Kids&#x27; Choice Award, Golden Schmoes Award, and Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films. The film also won the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Award at the ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards show.

=== Upcoming streaming series ===
An animated series based on the book &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; aimed at preschoolers, among other Seuss story adaptations, is in development for Netflix.

<doc id="394094" wikidata="Q592506" url="?curid=394094" title="James III of Cyprus">
<text>James III of Cyprus (or Jacques III de Lusignan) (6 August 1473 – 26 August 1474) was the only child by the marriage of James II of Cyprus and Catherine Cornaro. He died as an infant, leaving his mother as the last Queen of Cyprus. His death paved the way for the Republic of Venice to gain control of Cyprus.

==Biography==
On 30 July 1468, James II of Cyprus married a 14-year-old Venetian, Catherine Cornaro, by proxy in Venice, seeking political support. She finally travelled to Cyprus and married in person at Famagusta in October or November, 1472. Later on, James II died on 10 July 1473, a month before his son&#x27;s birth. However, a three-day festival was held to celebrate the newborn in the capital, Nicosia, in which all the prisoners were released and a large feast was held on 26 and 29 September.

The infant was baptized on 26 September, and received the name James in memory of his father. His mother had assumed the regency before his birth, but her power was practiced by her Venetian relatives. In November 1473, there were unsuccessful attempts to seize power by nobles of the Crown of Aragon, during which Catherine Cornaro&#x27;s uncle, Andrea Cornaro, was assassinated.

James died in Famagusta, probably of malaria, on August 26, 1474, twenty days after his first birthday. His was buried along with his father in the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas in Famagusta. With his death, the Lusignan dynasty of Cyprus became extinct and the island lost its independence. His sudden death opened the doors to the rule of the Venetian Republic over the island. His mother, Catherine Cornaro, was appointed as the Queen of Cyprus, under strict Venetian surveillance and was forced to abdicate in 1489 where she spent the rest of her life in Asolo until 1509 where she fled to exile in Venice where she died in 1510.

<doc id="394097" wikidata="Q228119" url="?curid=394097" title="The Final Problem">
<text>&quot;The Final Problem&quot; is a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring his detective character Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom, and &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; in the United States, under the title &quot;The Adventure of the Final Problem&quot; in December 1893. It appears in book form as part of the collection &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

The story, set in 1891, introduces the criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty. It was intended to be the final Holmes story, ending with the character&#x27;s death, but Conan Doyle was later persuaded to revive Holmes for additional stories and novels. 

Conan Doyle later ranked &quot;The Final Problem&quot; fourth on his personal list of the twelve best Holmes stories.

==Plot==
An injured Holmes arrives at Watson&#x27;s residence one evening, having escaped three separate murder attempts that day. Holmes reveals to Watson he has been tracking Moriarty and his organisation for months, who are responsible for most of the crimes orchestrated in London. As Holmes is close to snaring them all and delivering them to the police, Moriarty visits Holmes at 221B Baker Street earlier that day and warns him to withdraw from his pursuit of justice against him. Holmes admits that Moriarty could thwart his plans given his great mind that could rival his, and plans to flee to Europe while the police capture Moriarty and his gang.

Watson decides to join Holmes on the trip. Holmes then gives him unusual instructions intended to hide his tracks to the boat train at Victoria station before leaving Watson&#x27;s house by climbing over the back wall in the garden, paranoid that he might be followed. The next day, Watson follows Holmes&#x27;s instructions and finds himself waiting in the reserved first-class coach for his friend, who is disguised as an elderly Italian priest. As the boat train pulls out of Victoria, Holmes spots Moriarty on the platform trying to stop the train. Holmes deduces that Moriarty has tracked Watson despite extraordinary precautions. Changing their planned route, Holmes and Watson alight at Canterbury, hiding behind the luggage as Moriarty (who had chartered a special one-coach train) passes them in pursuit.

Having made their way to Strasbourg via Brussels, Holmes receives a message from the London Police that most of Moriarty&#x27;s gang have been arrested in England, but Moriarty has escaped and is in pursuit of Holmes in Europe. He urges Watson to return to England as he considers himself a very dangerous companion for Watson. Watson, however, decides to stay with his friend. Holmes and Watson continue to Meiringen, Switzerland and visit the Reichenbach Falls. At the Falls, a boy hands Watson a letter, saying that there is a dying Englishwoman at the hotel who seeks an English doctor. While Holmes realises it is a hoax, he allows Watson to see the patient.

Watson soon realises the trick when returning to the hotel and rushes back to the Falls. He only finds two sets of footprints that lead to the end of the path, where he uncovers other signs of a violent struggle and a note from Holmes explaining that he knew about the hoax but chose to fight Moriarty himself. Holmes and Moriarty have both fallen to their deaths down the gorge and their bodies cannot be recovered. A saddened Dr Watson returns to England. The Moriarty gang are all convicted on the strength of evidence secured by Holmes. Watson ends his narrative by saying that Sherlock Holmes was the best and the wisest man he had ever known.

==Background==

&quot;The Final Problem&quot; was intended to be exactly what its name says. Conan Doyle meant to stop writing about his famous detective after this short story; he felt the Sherlock Holmes stories were distracting him from more serious literary efforts and that &quot;killing&quot; Holmes off was the only way of getting his career back on track. &quot;I must save my mind for better things,&quot; he wrote to his mother, &quot;even if it means I must bury my pocketbook with him.&quot;

Conan Doyle sought to sweeten the pill by letting Holmes go in a blaze of glory, having him rid the world of a criminal so powerful and dangerous that any further task would be trivial in comparison; indeed, Holmes says as much in the story.

In 1893, Conan Doyle and his wife toured Switzerland and discovered the village of Meiringen in the Bernese Alps. This experience fired Conan Doyle&#x27;s imagination.

==Publication history==
The story was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1893, and in the US in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; in the same month. It was also published in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1894. It was published with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with eleven illustrations by Harry C. Edwards in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

==Reaction==
In an article published by the BBC, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong noted that &quot;The public reaction to the death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.&quot; &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; &quot;barely survived&quot; the resulting rush of subscription cancellations. There were some stories that &quot;young men throughout London wore black mourning crêpes on their hats or around their arms for the month of Holmes’ death&quot; although these may have been exaggerations propounded by Doyle&#x27;s son. Armstrong continues, &quot;Readers typically accepted what went on in their favourite books, then moved on. Now they were beginning to take their popular culture personally, and to expect their favourite works to conform to certain expectations.&quot;

Pressure from fans eventually persuaded Doyle to bring Holmes back, writing &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (set before &quot;The Final Problem&quot;) and reviving him in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;. There were enough holes in eyewitness accounts to allow Doyle to plausibly resurrect Holmes; only the few free surviving members of Moriarty&#x27;s organisation and Holmes&#x27; brother Mycroft (who appears briefly in this story) know that Sherlock Holmes is still alive, having won the struggle at the Reichenbach Falls and sent Moriarty to his doom—though nearly meeting his own at the hands of one of Moriarty&#x27;s henchmen.

==Influence and legacy==

Inhabitants of Meiringen are still grateful to Doyle and his creation Holmes for ensuring the enduring worldwide fame of their falls and considerably promoting tourism to the town.

A museum dedicated to Holmes is housed in the basement of the English Church, located in what has now been named Conan Doyle Place. 

At the funicular station near the falls, there is a memorial plate to &quot;the most famous detective in the world&quot;.

The actual ledge from which Moriarty fell is on the other side of the falls. It is accessible by climbing the path to the top of the falls, crossing the bridge, and following the trail down the hill. The ledge is marked by a plaque written in English, German, and French. The English inscription reads &quot;At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891.&quot; It is also marked by a large white star so as to be visible from the viewing platform.

Fans who call themselves &quot;pilgrims&quot; travel to Meiringen dressed as characters, both major and minor, from the Holmes stories. There, they take part in a reenactment of the events of &quot;The Final Problem&quot; organized by the Sherlock Holmes Society of London.

==Adaptations==

===Film===

&quot;The Final Problem&quot; was adapted as a 1923 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series, starring Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with Percy Standing as Moriarty.

The 1931 film &quot;The Sleeping Cardinal&quot;, the first film in the 1931–1937 film series starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, is based in part on &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem.&quot; The scene from &quot;The Final Problem&quot; in which Moriarty confronts Holmes at Baker Street and attempts to persuade Holmes to stop his investigations is used in &quot;The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1935), another film in the series.

In the 1939–1946 film series starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, a number of films borrow elements from &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Most noticeable of these elements are the methods of killing Moriarty off; in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1939), &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Woman in Green&quot; (1945), Moriarty is seen in all three films falling from a great height to his death. &quot;The Woman in Green&quot; contains a variation on the conversation between Holmes and Moriarty in Baker Street, as well as the idea of Moriarty manipulating Watson out of the way by hoaxing an injured Englishwoman who requires his treating.

The 2011 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; is based in part on &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Like the story, it ends with Holmes and Moriarty plummeting into the falls, and Watson is shown writing the final sentences of &quot;The Final Problem&quot; on his typewriter. However, in the film, the characters are attending a European Peace Conference held near the falls which Moriarty seeks to sabotage, and the two plunge down from a balcony overlooking the falls rather than from the ledge of the original story. Holmes is also shown falling over the edge with Moriarty rather than simply being assumed to have fallen, being too injured to defeat Moriarty in a straight fight but knowing that Moriarty will go after Watson if he lives. While Holmes is shown to have survived, having used his brother&#x27;s oxygen inhaler to survive the water at the bottom of the falls, Moriarty&#x27;s fate is less certain.

===Television===

The Soviet television film series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; (1979–1986) adapted &quot;The Final Problem&quot; as &quot;The Deadly Fight&quot; (and &quot;The Adventure in the Empty House&quot; as &quot;Hunt for the Tiger&quot;).

In the television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett, the 1985 episode based on the story begins with the theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, masterminded by Moriarty in order to sell prepared fakes to collectors. Holmes recovers the original painting just before Moriarty makes a sale to a &quot;Mr. Morgan&quot;. Holmes&#x27;s interference with his plans convinces Moriarty that the detective must be eliminated, and Holmes is subsequently presumed to have died in a tumble down the Reichenbach Falls. This was the last episode to star David Burke as Dr. Watson. Burke was replaced by Edward Hardwicke until the end of the show&#x27;s run, starting with the adaptation of &quot;The Empty House&quot; which acted as the first episode of &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

The BraveStarr episode &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 23rd Century&quot; begins with a revised version of the climax of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, in which only Holmes plummets down Reichenbach Falls, but instead of falling to his doom, he falls into a natural time warp that transports him into the year 2249. 

The first episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; (1999–2001) begins with the climax of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, where it is later revealed in the second episode that while Holmes managed to survive the fall by grabbing a tree branch and would go on to solve many more cases (later being entombed in honey upon his death of old age, which preserved his body enough to be revitalized in the 22nd century), Moriarty had indeed perished and was buried by Holmes himself, preserved in ice in a freezing cave. Holmes, the robotic Watson and Inspector Beth Lestrade later visit the burial site at Reichenbach Falls to confirm Moriarty&#x27;s death upon news of a lookalike causing a crime spree in New London. Upon seeing a drill hole in the ice, Holmes surmises that the new Moriarty is in fact a clone with all the original&#x27;s memories and skills.

The two part sixth season finale of &quot;Monk,&quot; &quot;Mr. Monk is on the Run&quot; (2008), is loosely inspired by both &quot;The Final Problem and &quot;The Empty House.&quot; Adrian Monk is supposedly shot over a pier after being accused of murder, only to be alive in the second part. The orchestrator is revealed to be Dale &quot;the Whale&quot; Biederbeck, described as &quot;the Genghis Khan of world finance,&quot; much like Moriarty as &quot;the Napoleon of Crime.&quot;

Episode three of the first season of BBC&#x27;s Sherlock, titled The Great Game shows a variation of the part where Moriarty confronts Holmes at Baker Street in the story. The story is also the basis of the episode &quot;The Reichenbach Fall&quot;(Season 2, Episode 3), which first aired on 15 January 2012 and shows Holmes falling from the roof of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, supposedly leading to his death. Throughout a confrontation between Sherlock and Jim Moriarty in Baker Street, Moriarty repeatedly utters the phrase &quot;the final problem&quot;. The special episode of &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot;, which was broadcast on 1 January 2016, featured a re-creation of the showdown between Sherlock and Moriarty set in Victorian times, as depicted in the book. The 2017 series finale of &quot;Sherlock&quot; is named for this story, but bears little to no resemblance to the canon.

The 2012 series finale of the American medical drama &quot;House&quot;—which was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories—sees Dr. Gregory House fake his own death, in an ode to &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

The 2013 Russian television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; adapted &quot;The Final Problem&quot; as &quot;Holmes&#x27; Last Case&quot;.

The 2018 HBO Asia/Hulu Japan series &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot; loosely adapts this story for its series finale &quot;The Dock.&quot; In this version, the famous scene at the Reichenbach Falls is replaced by an analogous scene set at a fictional &quot;Reichenbach Building&quot; in Tokyo.

The 2019 penultimate episode (Season 7 Episode 12) of the CBS adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, &quot;Elementary&quot;, was titled &quot;Reichenbach Falls&quot;, and portrayed Sherlock&#x27;s ploy to bring down a powerful serial killer billionaire, Odin Reichenbach. Holmes fakes his death on a bridge, which puts Odin Reichenbach under investigation for the murder of Sherlock Holmes and thereby exposes Reichenbach&#x27;s past crimes.

The 2024 Indian Television series Shekhar Home remaking the adaptation of the BBC&#x27;s Sherlock in its last episode also adapts the climax of the story where the titular character Shekhar falls down the Howrah bridge with Jaimini Maurya(James Moriarty). 

===Radio===
&quot;The Final Problem&quot; was loosely adapted for multiple episodes of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson, including episodes titled &quot;Murder in the Waxworks&quot; (March 1932), &quot;The Adventure of the Ace of Spades&quot; (May 1932), and &quot;Murder by Proxy&quot; (January 1933).

The story was later adapted for radio by John Kier Cross; it was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme in December 1954 and starred John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Dr. Watson, with Orson Welles as Professor Moriarty. The production was also broadcast on NBC radio on 17 April 1955.

Felix Felton adapted the story as a radio adaptation which aired on the BBC Home Service in March 1955 as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Ralph Truman as Moriarty. Another dramatisation of the story adapted by Felton aired on the BBC Home Service in November 1957, again starring Hobbs and Shelley, with Felton playing Moriarty. Hobbs and Shelley also starred as Holmes and Watson in a 1967 BBC Light Programme adaptation of the story which was adapted by Michael Hardwick.

&quot;The Final Problem&quot; was dramatized for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Pennington as Professor Moriarty, Frederick Treves as Colonel Moran, Sean Arnold as Inspector Patterson, Terence Edmond as Steiler, Richard Pearce as Jenkinson, and Norman Jones as Sir George.

An episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, combined &quot;The Final Problem&quot; with the events of &quot;The Empty House&quot;. The episode, titled &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, aired in 2009, and starred John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

===Other media===
William Gillette&#x27;s 1899 stage play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is based on several stories, among them &quot;The Final Problem.&quot; Films released in 1916 (starring Gillette as Holmes) and 1922 (starring John Barrymore), both titled &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, and a 1938 &quot;Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; radio adaptation titled &quot;The Immortal Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Orson Welles as Holmes, were based on the play. However, in none of these retellings does Holmes die (and indeed in the two film versions he marries).

In 1975, DC Comics published &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; #1, a comic book which adapted both &quot;The Final Problem&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;. It was intended to be an ongoing series, but future issues were canceled due to low sales.

The 1999 comic series &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One&quot; by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill briefly adapts &quot;The Final Problem&quot; in issue #5 and shows Holmes triumphing over Moriarty and climbing the cliff, although Moriarty survives as well. The film adaptation references these events, but does not show them; the novelization copies the event almost verbatim from the graphic novel.

An arc of the Japanese manga series &quot;Moriarty the Patriot&quot;, a series featuring a young Moriarty as a crime consultant, is named after the Japanese translation of the story&#x27;s title. The final two episodes, &quot;The Final Problem Act 1&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem Act 2&quot;, feature Sherlock and William (Moriarty) falling from Tower Bridge to River Thames, though revealed that both of them are alive and in Switzerland.

<text>In computer science, the test-and-set instruction is an instruction used to write (set) 1 to a memory location and return its old value as a single atomic (i.e., non-interruptible) operation. The caller can then &quot;test&quot; the result to see if the state was changed by the call. If multiple processes may access the same memory location, and if a process is currently performing a test-and-set, no other process may begin another test-and-set until the first process&#x27;s test-and-set is finished. A central processing unit (CPU) may use a test-and-set instruction offered by another electronic component, such as dual-port RAM; a CPU itself may also offer a test-and-set instruction.

A lock can be built using an atomic test-and-set instruction as follows:

This code assumes that the memory location was initialized to 0 at some point prior to the first test-and-set. The calling process obtains the lock if the old value was 0, otherwise the while-loop spins waiting to acquire the lock. This is called a spinlock. At any point, the holder of the lock can simply set the memory location back to 0 to release the lock for acquisition by another--this does not require any special handling as the holder &quot;owns&quot; this memory location. &quot;Test and test-and-set&quot; is another example.

Maurice Herlihy (1991) proved that test-and-set (1-bit comparand) has a finite consensus number and can solve the wait-free consensus problem for at-most two concurrent processes. In contrast, compare-and-swap (32-bit comparand) offers a more general solution to this problem, and in some implementations wider compare-and-swap (64- or 128-bit comparand) is also available for extended utility.

== Hardware implementation of test-and-set ==
DPRAM test-and-set instructions can work in many ways. Here are two variations, both of which describe a DPRAM which provides exactly 2 ports, allowing 2 separate electronic components (such as 2 CPUs) access to every memory location on the DPRAM.

=== Variation 1 ===
When CPU 1 issues a test-and-set instruction, the DPRAM first makes an &quot;internal note&quot; of this by storing the address of the memory location in a special place. If at this point, CPU 2 happens to issue a test-and-set instruction for the same memory location, the DPRAM first checks its &quot;internal note&quot;, recognizes the situation, and issues a BUSY interrupt, which tells CPU 2 that it must wait and retry. This is an implementation of a busy waiting or spinlock using the interrupt mechanism. Since all this happens at hardware speeds, CPU 2&#x27;s wait to get out of the spin-lock is very short.

Whether or not CPU 2 was trying to access the memory location, the DPRAM performs the test given by CPU 1. If the test succeeds, the DPRAM sets the memory location to the value given by CPU 1. Then the DPRAM wipes out its &quot;internal note&quot; that CPU 1 was writing there. At this point, CPU 2 could issue a test-and-set, which would succeed.

=== Variation 2 ===
CPU 1 issues a test-and-set instruction to write to &quot;memory location A&quot;. The DPRAM does not immediately store the value in memory location A, but instead simultaneously moves the current value to a special register, while setting the contents of memory location A to a special &quot;flag value&quot;. If at this point, CPU 2 issues a test-and-set to memory location A, the DPRAM detects the special flag value, and as in Variation 1, issues a BUSY interrupt.

Whether or not CPU 2 was trying to access the memory location, the DPRAM now performs CPU 1&#x27;s test. If the test succeeds, the DPRAM sets memory location A to the value specified by CPU 1. If the test fails, the DPRAM copies the value back from the special register to memory location A. Either operation wipes out the special flag value. If CPU 2 now issues a test-and-set, it will succeed.

== Software implementation of test-and-set ==
Some instruction sets have an atomic test-and-set machine language instruction. Examples include x86 and IBM System/360 and its successors (including z/Architecture).
Those that do not can still implement an atomic test-and-set using a read-modify-write or compare-and-swap instruction.

The test and set instruction, when used with boolean values, uses logic like that shown in the following function, except that the function must execute atomically. That is, no other process must be able to interrupt the function mid-execution, thereby seeing a state that only exists while the function executes. That requires hardware support; it cannot be implemented as shown. Nevertheless, the code shown helps to explain the behaviour of test-and-set. NOTE: In this example, &#x27;lock&#x27; is assumed to be passed by reference (or by name) but the assignment to &#x27;initial&#x27; creates a new value (not just copying a reference).

 function TestAndSet(boolean_ref lock) {
 boolean initial = lock;
 lock = true;
 return initial;

Not only is the code shown not atomic, in the sense of the test-and-set instruction, it also differs from the descriptions of DPRAM hardware test-and-set above. Here, the value being set and the test are fixed and invariant, and the value is updated regardless of the outcome of the test, whereas for the DPRAM test-and-set, the memory is set only when the test succeeds, and the value to set and the test condition are specified by the CPU. Here, the value to set can only be 1, but if 0 and 1 are considered the only valid values for the memory location, and &quot;value is nonzero&quot; is the only allowed test, then this equates to the case described for DPRAM hardware (or, more specifically, the DPRAM case reduces to this under these constraints). From that viewpoint, this can, correctly, be called &quot;test-and-set&quot; in the full, conventional sense of that term. The essential point to note is the general intent and principle of test-and-set: a value is both tested and set in one atomic operation such that no other program thread or process can change the target memory location after it is tested but before it is set. (This is because the location must only be set if it currently has a certain value, not if it had that value sometime earlier.)

In the C programming language, the implementation would be like:

#define LOCKED 1

int test_and_set(int* lockPtr) {
 int oldValue;

 // -- Start of atomic segment --
 // This should be interpreted as pseudocode for illustrative purposes only.
 // Traditional compilation of this code will not guarantee atomicity, the
 // use of shared memory (i.e., non-cached values), protection from compiler
 // optimizations, or other required properties.
 oldValue = *lockPtr;
 *lockPtr = LOCKED;
 // -- End of atomic segment --

 return oldValue;


The code also shows that there are really two operations: an atomic read-modify-write and a test. Only the read-modify-write needs to be atomic. (This is true because delaying the value comparison by any amount of time will not change the result of the test once the value to test has been obtained. Once the code writes the initial value, the result of the test has been established, even if it has not been computed yet — e.g., by the == operator.)

== Mutual exclusion using test-and-set ==
One way to implement mutual exclusion is by using a test-and-set based lock as follows:

=== Pseudo-C implementation of a spin lock ===

volatile int lock = 0;

void critical() {
 // Spin lock: loop forever until we get the lock; we know the lock was
 // successfully obtained after exiting this while loop because the 
 // test_and_set() function locks the lock and returns the previous lock 
 // value. If the previous lock value was 1 then the lock was **already**
 // locked by another thread or process. Once the previous lock value
 // was 0, however, then it indicates the lock was **not** locked before we
 // locked it, but now it **is** locked because we locked it, indicating
 // we own the lock.
 while (test_and_set(&amp;lock) == 1); 
 critical section // only one process can be in this section at a time
 lock = 0; // release lock when finished with the critical section

The lock variable is a shared variable i.e. it can be accessed by all processors/threads. Note the &quot;volatile&quot; keyword. In absence of volatile, the compiler and/or the CPU(s) may optimize access to lock and/or use cached values, thus rendering the above code erroneous. Conversely, and unfortunately, the presence of &quot;volatile&quot; does &quot;not&quot; guarantee that reads and writes are committed to memory. Some compilers issue memory barriers to ensure that operations are committed to memory, but since the semantics of &quot;volatile&quot; in C/C++ is quite vague, not all compilers will do that. Consult your compiler&#x27;s documentation to determine if it does.

This spin lock function can be called by multiple processes, but it is guaranteed that only one process will be in the critical section at a time. The rest of the processes will keep spinning until they get the lock. It is possible that a process is never granted the lock. In such a case it will loop endlessly. This is a drawback of a spin lock implementation as it doesn&#x27;t ensure fairness. These issues are further elaborated in the performance section.

=== Assembly implementation ===

enter_region: ; A &quot;jump to&quot; tag; function entry point.

 tsl reg, flag ; Test and Set Lock; flag is the
 ; shared variable; it is copied
 ; into the register reg and flag
 ; then atomically set to 1.

 cmp reg, #0 ; Was flag zero on entry_region?

 jnz enter_region ; Jump to enter_region if
 ; reg is non-zero; i.e.,
 ; flag was non-zero on entry.

 ret ; Exit; i.e., flag was zero on
 ; entry. If we get here, tsl
 ; will have set it non-zero; thus,
 ; we have claimed the resource
 ; associated with flag.

leave_region:
 move flag, #0 ; store 0 in flag
 ret ; return to caller
Here codice_1 is an atomic instruction and codice_2 is the lock variable. The process doesn&#x27;t return unless it acquires the lock.

==Performance evaluation of test-and-set locks==

The four major evaluation metrics for locks in general are uncontended lock-acquisition latency, bus traffic, fairness, and storage.

Test-and-set scores low on two of them, namely, high bus traffic and unfairness.

When processor P1 has obtained a lock and processor P2 is also waiting for the lock, P2 will keep incurring bus transactions in attempts to acquire the lock. When a processor has obtained a lock, all other processors which also wish to obtain the same lock keep trying to obtain the lock by initiating bus transactions repeatedly until they get hold of the lock. This increases the bus traffic requirement of test-and-set significantly. This slows down all other traffic from cache and coherence misses. It slows down the overall section, since the traffic is saturated by failed lock acquisition attempts. Test-and-test-and-set is an improvement over TSL since it does not initiate lock acquisition requests continuously.

When we consider fairness, we consider if a processor gets a fair chance of acquiring the lock when it is set free. In an extreme situation the processor might starve i.e. it might not be able to acquire the lock for an extended period of time even though it has become free during that time.

Storage overhead for TSL is next to nothing since only one lock is required. Uncontended latency is also low since only one atomic instruction and branch are needed.

<doc id="394100" wikidata="Q6779418" url="?curid=394100" title="Mary Elizabeth Lease">
<text>Mary Elizabeth Lease (September 11, 1850 – October 29, 1933) was an American lecturer, writer, Georgist, and political activist. She was an advocate of the suffrage movement as well as temperance, but she was best known for her work with the People&#x27;s Party (Populists).

She made her political debut in 1888 with the Union Labor Party or Socialist Labor Party and soon joined the Farmers&#x27; Alliance or Populist Party. She was referred to as the &quot;People&#x27;s Joan of Arc&quot;. In that party&#x27;s 1890 campaign she made more than 160 speeches and claimed credit for the defeat of Kansas senator John Ingalls. (William A. Peffer was elected on the Populist ticket.)

She opposed big business and stated flatly that &quot;Wall Street owns the country.&quot; She was called &quot;Our Queen Mary&quot; while campaigning with the Populists candidate James B. Weaver during his 1892 run for president, and also &quot;Mother Lease&quot; by her supporters, as well as, &quot;Mary Yellin&quot; by some of her enemies. 

In 1895, she wrote &quot;The Problem of Civilization Solved&quot;,in which she pushed for back-to-the-land government programs for willing workers, self-improvement, and no support for idlers. 

Literary scholar Brian Attebery claimed Mary Elizabeth Lease to have been the model for Dorothy in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Early life==
Lease was born to Irish immigrants Joseph P. and Mary Elizabeth Murray Clyens (an anglicization of the Gaelic name Mac Giolla Chaillín), in Ridgway, Pennsylvania. 

At the age of 20, she moved to Kansas to teach school in Osage Mission (St. Paul, Kansas), and three years later, she married Charles L. Lease, a local pharmacist. They lost their Kingman County farm in the Panic of 1873 and moved to Denison, Texas, where she studied law. The Leases and their four children later moved to Wichita, Kansas, where she took a leading role in civic and social activities. She was admitted to the Kansas bar in 1885.

==Political career==
In 1885 Lease went on her first public speaking tour, raising money for the Irish National Land League. She also spoke at the Kansas state convention of the Union Labor Party. By 1888, she was active within the party, stumping for the 1888 campaign and editing the party newspaper. 

Her work led her to the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance and Knights of Labor, and in 1891, she was elected leader of a local Knights assembly.

She was involved in African American suffrage. From there she became involved in the movement that would become the Populist Party. She believed that big business had made the people of America into &quot;wage slaves&quot;, declaring, &quot;Wall Street owns the country. It is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street, and for Wall Street. The great common people of this country are slaves, and monopoly is the master.&quot; 

She was said to have exhorted Kansas farmers to &quot;raise less corn and more hell&quot;, but she later said that the admonition had been invented by reporters. Lease decided to let the quote stand anyway because she thought &quot;it was a right good bit of advice&quot;. 

She was recognized as being a powerful orator who was adept at expressing the discontent of the people. &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot; editor William Allen White, who did not share her political views, wrote on one occasion that &quot;she could recite the multiplication table and set a crowd hooting and hurrahing at her will&quot;. While many considered her speeches inspirational, the fervor of her words and the vehemence of her conviction, made others hesitant to support her cause. Farmers and labor unions loved her, while the press and the major party politicians criticized her mercilessly. 

Most went far beyond disagreeing with the content of Lease&#x27;s arguments and resorted to ad hominem and misogynistic tactics, focusing their attacks on her looks, self-confidence, and her &quot;unwomanly&quot; argumentative behavior. One reporter described her as &quot;untrained, and while displaying plenty of a certain sort of power, is illogical, lacks sequence and scatters like a 10-gauge gun.&quot; The Wellington Monitor called her “a miserable character of womanhood and hideously ugly of features and foul of tongue”. A Republican editor similarly characterized her as &quot;...the petti-coated smut-mill. Her venomous tongue is the only thing marketable about the old harpy, and we suppose she is justified in selling it where it commends the highest price.&quot; 

Despite the abuse, Lease persevered, continuing to deliver her message throughout America. In 1890 she made more than 160 speeches for the Populist cause, campaigning throughout Kansas, as well as the Far West and the South.
 This helped to elect William A. Peffer as Kansas senator.

==Split with Populists==
Lease was a leader of the anti-fusion faction within the party who opposed merger with the Democratic Party. Lease began drifting away from the Populist Party after Populist Governor Lorenzo D. Lewelling was elected into office. By November 1893, she was reported to have openly criticized the Lewelling administration, only to deny it in an interview several days later.

It would seem that the first interview reflected her true feelings. By December 1893, Lewelling attempted to have her removed from the board of charities, a position to which he originally had appointed her. Lease felt the attempt to have her removed stemmed from her determination to have women&#x27;s suffrage and temperance as her main focus at the Populist Party&#x27;s next state convention. Her public outrage at the attempt to remove her prompted other Populist parties to distance themselves from her.

By 1896, Lease had become alienated from the Populist Party, and historian Gene Clanton cites her split with the Populist Party as being a major contributor to the Populist party&#x27;s defeat in 1894.

Despite her fallout with — and the eventual destruction of — the Populist Party, Lease felt that their work and efforts were ultimately rewarded with the election of Theodore Roosevelt and the national push for reforms that she had championed years earlier: 

&quot;In these later years I have seen, with gratification, that my work in the good old Populist days was not in vain. The Progressive party has adopted our platform, clause for clause, plank by plank. Note the list of reforms which we advocated which are coming into reality. Direct election of senators is assured. Public utilities are gradually being removed from the hands of the few and placed under the control of the people who use them. Women suffrage is now almost a national issue... 

The seed we sowed out in Kansas did not fall on barren ground.&quot;

==Later life==
In 1896, she moved to New York City where she wrote for the &quot;New York World&quot;. In addition, she worked as an editor for the &quot;National Encyclopedia of American Biography&quot;. 
She divorced her husband in 1902 and spent the rest of her life with one or another of her children in the East until her death.

Lease died in Callicoon, New York on October 29, 1933.

==Synthetic food==
In 1893 Lease predicted that by 1993 people would be eating synthetic food. She predicted that in one hundred years&#x27; time &#x27;Agriculture will be developed by electricity, the motive power of the future. Science will take, in condensed form from the rich loam of earth, the life force or germs now found in the heart of the corn, in the kernel of the wheat, and in the luscious juices of the fruit. A small phial of this life from the fertile bosom of Mother Earth will furnish man with subsistence for days. And thus the problems of cooks and cooking will be solved&#x27;. This theory, it is suggested, remained a &#x27;private fantasy&#x27; until 1930 when it found its way into the early science-fiction musical film &quot;Just Imagine&quot;.

==Famous quotes==
&quot;Wall Street owns the country. It is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street and for Wall Street... Our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags...&quot;

<doc id="394101" wikidata="Q2079951" url="?curid=394101" title="Petoskey stone">
<text>A Petoskey stone is a rock and a fossil, often pebble-shaped, that is composed of a fossilized rugose coral, &quot;Hexagonaria percarinata&quot;. Such stones were formed as a result of glaciation, in which sheets of ice plucked stones from the bedrock, grinding off their rough edges and depositing them in the northwestern (and some in the northeastern) portion of Michigan&#x27;s lower peninsula. In those same areas of Michigan, complete fossilized coral colony heads can be found in the source rocks for the Petoskey stones.

Petoskey stones are found in the Gravel Point Formation of the Traverse Group. They are fragments of a coral reef that was originally deposited during the Devonian period, approximately 350 million years ago. When dry, the stone resembles ordinary limestone but when wet or polished using lapidary techniques, it reveals the distinctive mottled pattern of the six-sided coral fossils. It is sometimes made into decorative objects, or even used as a gemstone. Other forms of fossilized coral are also found in the same location.

In 1965, it was named the state stone of Michigan.

==Etymology==
The stone was named for an Ottawa chief, Chief Pet-O-Sega, son of a French fur trader and Ottawa mother. The city of Petoskey, Michigan, is also named after him, and is the center of the area where the stones are found. The stones are commonly found on beaches and in sand dunes.

According to legend, Petosegay was a descendant of French nobleman and fur trader Antoine Carre and an Ottawa daughter of a chief. Petosegay, meaning &quot;rising sun&quot;, &quot;rays of dawn&quot; or &quot;sunbeams of promise&quot;, was named by his father after the rays of sun that fell upon his newborn face. Building on his father&#x27;s start and his place among the Ottawa, Petosegay became a wealthy fur trader who also acquired much land in the region, gaining acclaim for himself and his band. He was said to have a striking and appealing appearance, and spoke both French and English very well. He married another Ottawa, and together they had two daughters and eight sons. In the summer of 1873, a few years before the chief&#x27;s death, settlers began to develop a village on his land along Little Traverse Bay. The settlers named it Petoskey, an anglicized form of Petosegay.

==Locations==
Petoskey stones can be found on various beaches and inland locations in Michigan, with many of the most popular Petoskey stone beaches stretching from Traverse City to Petoskey along Lake Michigan. The movement of the frozen lake ice acting on the shore during the winters is thought to turn over stones at the shore of Lake Michigan, exposing new Petoskey stones at the water&#x27;s edge each spring. The type of coral that forms the basis of Petoskey Stones is also present in the fossil records of Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, New York and locations in Canada, Germany, England, and Asia.

On 23 September 2015, it was reported that a 93-pound Petoskey stone was removed from the shallow waters of Lake Michigan, near the village of Northport, Michigan. In December 2015, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources confiscated the stone under a state law that disallows removing more than of materials from state lands. It was announced in October 2017 that the stone would be placed on permanent display at the Outdoor Adventure Center, east of downtown Detroit near the Detroit River.

<doc id="394104" wikidata="Q878962" url="?curid=394104" title="John II of Cyprus">
<text>John II or III of Cyprus (16 May 1418 – 28 July 1458) was the King of Cyprus and Armenia and also titular King of Jerusalem from 1432 to 1458. He was previously a titular Prince of Antioch.

==History==
Born 16 May 1418 in Nicosia, John was the son of king Janus of Cyprus and Charlotte of Bourbon. In May, sometime between 1435 and 1440, he married Amadea Palaiologina of Monferrato, daughter of John Jacob Palaiologos, Marquess of Montferrat. They had no children. His second wife, a distant relative of his first, was Helena Palaiologina, only child and daughter of Theodore II Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, and his wife Cleofa Malatesta 

By his second marriage he had:
* Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus, married Prince John of Antioch. She died childless
* Cleopha of Lusignan, died young

John died in Nicosia on 28 July 1458 and his daughter Charlotte succeeded to the throne. During his rule, Corycus, the only Cypriot stronghold in mainland Anatolia, was lost to the Karamanids in 1448.

John had an illegitimate son by Marietta de Patras
* James II, King of Cyprus
John appointed James, Archbishop of Nicosia at the age of 16. James did not prove ideal archbishop material, and was stripped of his title after murdering the royal chamberlain. His father eventually forgave him and restored him to the Archbishopric. James and Helena were enemies, vying for influence over John. After Helena died in 1458, it appeared that John would appoint James as his successor, but John died before he could make it so.

<text>Deborah Cleland Grey (born July 1, 1952) is a retired Canadian politician who served as the leader of the Official Opposition in 2000, from March to September. Grey was elected to the House of Commons in 1989, serving as the member of Parliament (MP) for Beaver River until 1997 and MP for Edmonton North until 2004. Grey was a member of the Reform Party. When Reform merged with the Canadian Alliance in 2000, she served as the interim party leader, making her the first woman to serve as leader of the Opposition. She currently serves on the advisory board of the Leaders&#x27; Debates Commission.

==Before politics==
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Grey pursued studies in sociology, English and education at Burrard Inlet Bible Institute, Trinity Western College and the University of Alberta. She then worked as a teacher in a number of rural Alberta communities until 1989.

==Political career==

Grey&#x27;s first run for office was in the 1988 election, when she ran as the Reform candidate in Beaver River, a mostly rural riding in northeastern Alberta. She finished a distant fourth behind Progressive Conservative John Dahmer. However, Dahmer died before he could be sworn in. Grey won a by-election in March 1989, almost tripling her vote total from the 1988 election to become Reform&#x27;s first MP. It was only the second time the Progressive Conservatives had lost a seat in Alberta since 1968. Party leader Preston Manning immediately named her as Reform&#x27;s deputy leader. The two were friends for many years; Grey calls him &quot;Misterbrainiola&quot;. Her first legislative assistant was a young Stephen Harper.

Reform elected 52 MPs in the 1993 election, replacing the Progressive Conservatives as the main right-wing party in Canada. Grey won her first full term in this election. In addition to her duties as deputy leader, she also became chairwoman of the enlarged Reform caucus. In 1997, Beaver River was abolished and its territory split into two neighbouring ridings. Grey moved to Edmonton North at the request of several local conservatives dissatisfied with being represented by a Liberal, John Loney (elected in the 1993 landslide). Lomey retired ahead of that year&#x27;s election, and Grey won handily. She continued to represent this riding for the remainder of her career. Reform became the Official Opposition in that election.

Grey served as Reform&#x27;s deputy leader and caucus chairwoman until March 2000, when the Reform Party was folded into the Canadian Alliance. When Manning stepped down as Leader of the Opposition to contest the Alliance leadership race, Grey was appointed interim leader of the Alliance, and hence Leader of the Opposition. She was the first female Leader of the Opposition in Canadian history. She held the post until new Alliance leader Stockwell Day was elected to the House of Commons in September 2000. He appointed Grey as deputy leader and caucus chairwoman once again.

Grey resigned those posts on April 24, 2001, in protest against Day&#x27;s leadership. In July of that year, Grey quit the Canadian Alliance and joined 10 other Alliance dissidents in the &quot;Independent Alliance Caucus&quot;. While Chuck Strahl eventually emerged as the dissidents&#x27; leader, Grey lent the group instant credibility since she had been Reform/Alliance&#x27;s matriarch as well as the deputy leader. When Day offered an amnesty to the dissidents, Grey was one of seven who turned it down and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus (DRC), led by Strahl with Grey as deputy leader. In September 2001, the DRC formed a coalition caucus with the Progressive Conservatives, and Grey served as chairwoman of the PC-DRC caucus. She later said that she lost confidence in Day after seeing him attack his staffers after a public gaffe.

In April 2002, after Harper defeated Day in the race to be the Alliance leader, Grey and all but two of the DRC MPs rejoined the Alliance caucus, and in December 2003, the Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives ratified an agreement to merge into the Conservative Party of Canada. Grey was co-chair, with former PC leader Peter MacKay, of the new party&#x27;s first leadership convention in March 2004.

Grey was not shy about tossing verbal barbs at the governing Liberals. She called Jean Chrétien &quot;the Shawinigan Strangler&quot;, Don Boudria &quot;Binder Boy&quot;, Jane Stewart &quot;Miss Management&quot; and Paul Martin &quot;Captain Whirlybird&quot;.

Deborah Grey is also well known for refusing to join the lucrative MP Pension Plan and ridiculing other &quot;MP porkers&quot; for feeding at the public trough. Later she bought her way back into the pension plan resulting in former Prime Minister Joe Clark labelling her the &quot;high priestess of hypocrisy&quot;.

Grey&#x27;s riding of Edmonton North was abolished for the 2004 federal election, and Grey retired from politics rather than attempting nomination in another. She was Western chairwoman of the Conservative campaign in the 2006 election, in which Harper became Prime Minister of Canada.

==Retirement==
Shortly after retiring, she published her autobiography, &quot;Never Retreat, Never Explain, Never Apologize: My Life and My Politics.&quot; In 2007, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. On April 22, 2013, she was appointed to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, and along with that appointment, was made a Privy Councillor, giving her the title, &quot;The Honourable&quot;. It was announced that Grey was stepping down from the Security Intelligence Review Committee on May 1, 2015, in a press release from the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

==Personal life==
Grey has been married to Lewis Larson since August 7, 1993; they have no children together. They are grandparents through Lewis&#x27; children by his first marriage.

<doc id="394117" wikidata="Q289428" url="?curid=394117" title="Ida B. Wells">
<text>Ida Bell Wells-Barnett (July 16, 1862 – March 25, 1931) was an American investigative journalist, sociologist, educator, and early leader in the civil rights movement. She was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Wells dedicated her career to combating prejudice and violence, and advocating for African-American equality—especially that of women.

Throughout the 1890s, Wells documented lynching of African-Americans in the United States in articles and through pamphlets such as &quot;Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases&quot; and &quot;The Red Record&quot;, which debunked the fallacy frequently voiced by whites at the time that all Black lynching victims were guilty of crimes. Wells exposed the brutality of lynching, and analyzed its sociology, arguing that whites used lynching to terrorize African Americans in the South because they represented economic and political competition—and thus a threat of loss of power—for whites. She aimed to demonstrate the truth about this violence and advocate for measures to stop it.

Wells was born into slavery in Holly Springs, Mississippi. She was freed as an infant under the Emancipation Proclamation, when Union Army troops captured Holly Springs. At the age of 16, she lost both her parents and her infant brother in the 1878 yellow fever epidemic. She got a job teaching and kept the rest of the family together with the help of her grandmother. Later, moving with some of her siblings to Memphis, Tennessee. Soon, Wells co-owned and wrote for the &quot;Memphis Free Speech and Headlight&quot; newspaper, where her reporting covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality. Eventually, her investigative journalism was carried nationally in Black-owned newspapers. Subjected to continued threats and criminal violence, including when a white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses, Wells left Memphis for Chicago, Illinois. She married Ferdinand L. Barnett in 1895 and had a family while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women&#x27;s movement for the rest of her life.

Wells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the civil rights movement and the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. She was active in women&#x27;s rights and the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, establishing several notable women&#x27;s organizations. A skilled and persuasive speaker, Wells traveled nationally and internationally on lecture tours. Wells died on March 25, 1931, in Chicago, and in 2020 was posthumously honored with a Pulitzer Prize special citation &quot;for her outstanding and courageous reporting on the horrific and vicious violence against African Americans during the era of lynching.&quot;

== Early life ==

Ida Bell Wells was born on the Boling Farm near Holly Springs, Mississippi. Born on July 16, 1862, Ida Wells was the first child of James Madison Wells (1840–1878) and Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; (Warrenton). James Wells was born to an enslaved woman named Peggy and Peggy&#x27;s white enslaver, thus he was enslaved under the doctrine of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;. When James was 18, his father brought him to Holly Springs, hiring him out as a carpenter&#x27;s apprentice to architect Spires Boling, with James&#x27;s wages going to his enslaver. One of ten children born on a plantation in Virginia, Lizzie was abducted and trafficked away from her family and siblings and tried without success to locate her family following the Civil War. Lizzie was owned by Boling for domestic labor in his home, now the Bolling–Gatewood House. Before the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, both of Wells&#x27;s parents were enslaved to Boling, and thus Ida was also born enslaved. James Wells built much of the Bolling–Gatewood house, in which Boling lived, and which in March 2002 became the Ida B. Wells–Barnett Museum. The Wells family lived elsewhere on the property. Ground plans on display in the Ida B. Wells–Barnett Museum identify shacks behind the house as the residence of the Wells family.

After emancipation, James became a trustee of the newly established Shaw University (now Rust College) in Holly Springs. He refused to vote for Democratic candidates during the period of Reconstruction, became a member of the Loyal League, and was known as a &quot;race man&quot; for his involvement in politics and his commitment to the Republican Party. He founded a successful carpentry business in Holly Springs in 1867, and his wife Lizzie became known as a &quot;famous cook&quot;.

Ida B. Wells was one of their eight children, and she enrolled in Shaw University. In September 1878, both of Ida&#x27;s parents died during a yellow fever epidemic that also claimed one of her brothers. Wells had been visiting her grandmother&#x27;s farm near Holly Springs at the time and was spared.

Following the funerals of her parents and brother, friends and relatives decided that the five remaining Wells children should be separated and sent to foster homes. Wells resisted this proposition. To keep her younger siblings together as a family, she found work as a teacher in a rural Black elementary school outside Holly Springs. Her paternal grandmother, Peggy Wells (née Peggy Cheers; 1814–1887), along with other friends and relatives, stayed with her siblings and cared for them during the week while Wells was teaching.

About two years after, Wells&#x27;s grandmother (Peggy) had a stroke and her sister Eugenia died, Wells and her two youngest sisters moved to Memphis to live with an aunt, Fanny Butler ( Fanny Wells; 1837–1908), in 1883. Memphis is about from Holly Springs.

== Early career and anti-segregation activism ==
Soon after moving to Memphis, Tennessee, Wells was hired in Woodstock by the Shelby County school system. During her summer vacations, she attended summer sessions at Fisk University, a historically Black college in Nashville, Tennessee. She also attended LeMoyne–Owen College, a historically Black college in Memphis. She held strong political opinions and provoked many people with her views on women&#x27;s rights. At the age of 24, she wrote: &quot;I will not begin at this late day by doing what my soul abhors; sugaring men, weak deceitful creatures, with flattery to retain them as escorts or to gratify a revenge.&quot;

On September 15, 1883, and again on May 4, 1884, a train conductor with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ordered Wells to give up her seat in the first-class ladies car and move to the smoking car, which was already crowded with other passengers. In 1883, the United States Supreme Court had ruled against the federal Civil Rights Act of 1875 (which had banned racial discrimination in public accommodations). This verdict supported railroad companies that chose to racially segregate their passengers. When Wells refused to give up her seat on September 15, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells gained publicity in Memphis when she wrote a newspaper article for &quot;The Living Way&quot;, a Black church weekly, about her treatment on the train. In Memphis, she hired an African-American attorney to sue the railroad. When her lawyer was paid off by the railroad, she hired a white attorney.

Wells won her case on December 24, 1884, when the local circuit court granted her a $500 (~$ in ) award. The railroad company appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling in 1887. It concluded: &quot;We think it is evident that the purpose of the defendant in error was to harass with a view to this suit, and that her persistence was not in good faith to obtain a comfortable seat for the short ride.&quot; Wells was ordered to pay court costs. Her reaction to the higher court&#x27;s decision revealed her strong convictions on civil rights and religious faith, as she responded: &quot;I felt so disappointed because I had hoped such great things from my suit for my people. ... O God, is there no ... justice in this land for us?&quot;

While continuing to teach elementary school, Wells became increasingly active as a journalist and writer. She accepted an editorial position for a small Memphis journal, the &quot;Evening Star,&quot; and she began writing weekly articles for &quot;The Living Way&quot; newspaper under the pen name &quot;Iola&quot;. Articles she wrote under her pen name attacked racist Jim Crow policies. In 1889, she became editor and co-owner with J. L. Fleming of &quot;The Free Speech and Headlight&quot;, a Black-owned newspaper established by the Reverend Taylor Nightingale (1844–1922) and based at the Beale Street Baptist Church in Memphis.

In 1891, Wells was dismissed from her teaching post by the Memphis Board of Education due to her articles criticizing conditions in the Black schools of the region. She was devastated but undaunted, and concentrated her energy on writing articles for &quot;The Living Way&quot; and the &quot;Free Speech and Headlight&quot;.

== Anti-lynching campaign and investigative journalism ==
=== The lynching at The Curve in Memphis ===

In 1889, Thomas Henry Moss, Sr. (1853–1892), an African American, opened People&#x27;s Grocery, which he co-owned. The store was located in a South Memphis neighborhood nicknamed &quot;The Curve&quot;. Wells was close to Moss and his family, having stood as godmother to his first child, Maurine E. Moss (1891–1971). Moss&#x27;s store did well and competed with a white-owned grocery store across the street, Barrett&#x27;s Grocery, owned by William Russell Barrett (1854–1920).

On March 2, 1892, a young Black male youth named Armour Harris was playing a game of marbles with a young white male youth named Cornelius Hurst in front of the People&#x27;s Grocery. The two male youths got into an argument during the game, then began to fight. As the Black youth, Harris, seemed to be winning the fight, the father of Cornelius Hurst intervened and began to &quot;thrash&quot; Harris. The People&#x27;s Grocery employees William Stewart and Calvin R. McDowell (1870–1892) saw the fight and rushed outside to defend the young Harris from the adult Hurst as people in the neighborhood gathered into what quickly became a &quot;racially charged mob&quot;.

The white grocer Barrett returned the following day, March 3, 1892, to the People&#x27;s Grocery with a Shelby County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy, looking for William Stewart. Calvin McDowell, who greeted Barrett, indicated that Stewart was not present, but Barrett was dissatisfied with the response and was frustrated that the People&#x27;s Grocery was competing with his store. Angry about the previous day&#x27;s &quot;mêlée,&quot; Barrett responded that &quot;Blacks were thieves&quot; and hit McDowell with a pistol. McDowell wrestled the gun away and fired at Barrett—missing narrowly. McDowell was later arrested but subsequently released.

On March 5, 1892, a group of six white men including a sheriff&#x27;s deputy took electric streetcars to the People&#x27;s Grocery. The group of white men were met by a barrage of bullets from the People&#x27;s Grocery, and Shelby County Sheriff Deputy Charley Cole was wounded, as well as civilian Bob Harold. Hundreds of Whites were deputized almost immediately to put down what was perceived by the local Memphis newspapers &quot;Commercial&quot; and &quot;Appeal-Avalanche&quot; as an armed rebellion by Black men in Memphis. Thomas Moss, a postman in addition to being the owner of the People&#x27;s Grocery, was named as a conspirator along with McDowell and Stewart. The three men were arrested and jailed pending trial.

Around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of March 9, 1892, 75 men wearing black masks took Moss, McDowell, and Stewart from their jail cells at the Shelby County Jail to a Chesapeake and Ohio rail yard one mile north of the city and shot them dead. The &quot;Memphis Appeal-Avalanche&quot; reports: Just before he was killed, Moss said to the mob: &quot;Tell my people to go west, there is no justice here.&quot;

After the lynching of her friends, Wells wrote in &quot;Free Speech and Headlight&quot; urging Blacks to leave Memphis altogether:
The event led Wells to begin investigating lynchings. She began to interview people associated with lynchings, including a lynching in Tunica, Mississippi, in 1892 where she concluded that the father of a young white woman had implored a lynch mob to kill a Black man with whom his daughter was having a sexual relationship, under a pretense &quot;to save the reputation of his daughter&quot;. In a 1909 speech at the National Negro Conference, Wells said: 

=== &quot;Free Speech&quot; newspaper destroyed by a mob ===
Wells&#x27;s anti-lynching commentaries in the &quot;Free Speech&quot; had been building, particularly with respect to lynchings and imprisonment of Black men suspected of raping white women. A story was published on January 16, 1892, in the &quot;Cleveland Gazette&quot;, describing a wrongful conviction for a sexual affair between a married white woman, Julia Underwood (née Julie Caroline Wells), and a single Black man, William Offet (1854–1914) of Elyria, Ohio. Offet was convicted of rape and served four years of a 15-year sentence, despite his sworn denial of rape. Underwood&#x27;s husband, Rev. Isaac T. Underwood – after she confessed to him that she had lied two years later – diligently worked to get Offet out of the penitentiary. After hiring an influential Pittsburgh attorney, Thomas Harlan Baird Patterson (1844–1907), Rev. Underwood prevailed, Offet was released and subsequently pardoned by the Ohio Governor.

On May 21, 1892, Wells published an editorial in the &quot;Free Speech&quot; refuting what she called &quot;that old threadbare lie that Negro men rape white women. If Southern men are not careful, a conclusion might be reached which will be very damaging to the moral reputation of their women.&quot;

Four days later, on May 25, &quot;The Daily Commercial&quot; wrote: &quot;The fact that a Black scoundrel [Ida B. Wells] is allowed to live and utter such loathsome and repulsive calumnies is a volume of evidence as to the wonderful patience of Southern whites. But we&#x27;ve had enough of it.&quot; &quot;The Evening Scimitar&quot; (Memphis) copied the story that same day, and added: &quot;Patience under such circumstances is not a virtue. If the Negroes themselves do not apply the remedy without delay it will be the duty of those whom he has attacked to tie the wretch who utters these calumnies to a stake at the intersection of Main and Madison Sts., brand him in the forehead with a hot iron and perform upon him a surgical operation with a pair of tailor&#x27;s shears.&quot;

A white mob ransacked the &quot;Free Speech&quot; office, destroying the building and its contents. James L. Fleming, co-owner with Wells and business manager, was forced to flee Memphis; and, reportedly, the trains were being watched for Wells&#x27;s return. Creditors took possession of the office and sold the assets of the &quot;Free Speech.&quot; Wells had been out of town, vacationing in Manhattan; she never returned to Memphis. A &quot;committee&quot; of white businessmen, reportedly from the Cotton Exchange, located Rev. Nightingale and, although he had sold his interest to Wells and Fleming in 1891, assaulted him and forced him at gunpoint to sign a letter retracting the May 21 editorial.

Wells subsequently accepted a job with &quot;The New York Age&quot; and continued her anti-lynching campaign from New York. For the next three years, she resided in Harlem, initially as a guest at the home of Timothy Thomas Fortune (1856–1928) and wife, Carrie Fortune (née Caroline Charlotte Smiley; 1860–1940).

According to Kenneth W. Goings, no copy of the &quot;Memphis Free Speech&quot; survives. The only knowledge of the newspaper ever existing comes from reprinted articles in other archived newspapers.

=== &quot;Southern Horrors&quot; (1892) ===

On October 26, 1892, Wells began to publish her research on lynching in a pamphlet titled &quot;Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases&quot;. Having examined many accounts of lynchings due to the alleged &quot;rape of white women&quot;, she concluded that Southerners accused Black men of rape to hide their real reasons for lynchings: Black economic progress, which white Southerners saw as a threat to their own economic progress, and white ideas of enforcing Black second-class status in the society. Black economic progress was a contemporary issue in the South, and in many states whites worked to suppress Black progress. In this period at the turn of the century, Southern states, starting with Mississippi in 1890, passed laws and/or new constitutions to disenfranchise most Black people and many poor white people through use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other devices.

Wells, in &quot;Southern Horrors,&quot; adopted the phrase &quot;poor, blind Afro-American Sampsons&quot; to denote Black men as victims of &quot;white Delilahs&quot;. The Biblical &quot;Samson&quot;, in the vernacular of the day, came from Longfellow&#x27;s 1865 poem, &quot;The Warning&quot;, containing the line: &quot;There is a poor, blind Samson in the land&quot; To explain the metaphor &quot;Sampson&quot;, John Elliott Cairnes, an Irish political economist, in his 1865 article about Black suffrage, wrote that Longfellow was prophesizing; &quot;to wit:&quot; in &quot;the long-impending struggle for Americans following the Civil War, [he, Longfellow] could see in the Negro only an instrument of vengeance, and a cause of ruin&quot;.

=== &quot;The Red Record&quot; (1895) ===

After conducting further research, Wells published &quot;The Red Record,&quot; in 1895. This 100-page pamphlet was a sociological investigation of lynching in the United States since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. It also covered Black people&#x27;s struggles in the South since the Civil War. &quot;The Red Record&quot; explored the alarmingly high rates of lynching in the United States (which was at a peak from 1880 to 1930). Wells said that during Reconstruction, most Americans outside the South did not realize the growing rate of violence against Black people in the South. She believed that during slavery, white people had not committed as many attacks because of the economic labor value of slaves. Wells noted that, since slavery time, &quot;ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, [through lynching] without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution&quot;.

Frederick Douglass had written an article noting three eras of &quot;Southern barbarism&quot; and the excuses that whites claimed in each period.

Wells explored these in her &quot;The Red Record:&quot;
* During the time of enslavement, she observed that whites worked to &quot;repress and stamp out alleged &#x27;race riots or suspected rebellions by the abducted, usually killing Black people in far higher proportions than any white casualties. Once the Civil War ended, white people feared Black people, who were in the majority in many areas. White people acted to control them and suppress them by violence.
* During the Reconstruction Era white people murdered Black people as part of mob efforts to suppress Black political activity and re-establish white supremacy after the war. They feared so-called &quot;Negro Domination&quot; through voting and taking office. Wells urged Black people in high-risk areas to move away to protect their families.
* She observed that whites frequently claimed that Black men had &quot;to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women&quot;. She said that white people falsely assumed that any relationship between a white woman and a Black man was a result of rape. But, given power dynamics, it was much more common for white men to take sexual advantage of poor Black women. She stated: &quot;Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that Black men rape white women.&quot; Wells connected lynching to sexual violence, showing how the myth of the Black man&#x27;s lust for white women led to the murder of African-American men.

Wells collected 14 pages of statistics related to lynching cases committed from 1892 to 1895; she also included pages of graphic accounts detailing specific lynchings. She wrote that her data was taken from articles by white correspondents, white press bureaus, and white newspapers. Her delivery of these statistics did not simply reduce the murders to numbers, Wells strategically paired the data with descriptive accounts in a way that helped her audience conceptualize the scale of the injustice. This powerful quantification captivated Black and White audiences about the horrors of lynching, through both her circulated works and public oration.

&quot;Southern Horrors&quot; and &quot;The Red Record&quot;″s documentation of lynchings captured the attention of Northerners who knew little about these mob murders or accepted the common explanation that Black men deserved this fate.

According to the Equal Justice Initiative, 4,084 African Americans were murdered in the South, alone, between 1877 and 1950, of which, 25 percent were accused of sexual assault and nearly 30 percent, murder. Generally southern states and white juries refused to indict any perpetrators for lynching, although they were frequently known and sometimes shown in the photographs being made more frequently of such events.

Despite Wells&#x27;s attempt to gain support among white Americans against mob murders, she believed that her campaign could not overturn the economic interests whites had in using lynching as an instrument to maintain Southern order and discourage Black economic ventures. Ultimately, Wells concluded that appealing to reason and compassion would not succeed in gaining criminalization of lynching by Southern whites. In response to the extreme violence perpetrated upon Black Americans, Wells concluded that armed resistance was a reasonable and effective means to defend against lynching. She said, a &quot;Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home.&quot;

=== Speaking tours in Britain ===
Wells travelled twice to Britain in her campaign against lynching, the first time in 1893 and the second in 1894 in effort to gain the support of a powerful white nation such as Britain to shame and sanction the racist practices of the United States. She and her supporters in America saw these tours as an opportunity for her to reach larger, white audiences with her anti-lynching campaign, something she had been unable to accomplish in America. In these travels, Wells notes that her own transatlantic voyages in themselves held a powerful cultural context given the histories of the Middle Passage, and black female identity within the dynamics of segregation. She found sympathetic audiences in Britain, already shocked by reports of lynching in America.
Wells had been invited for her first British speaking tour by Catherine Impey and Isabella Fyvie Mayo. Impey, a Quaker abolitionist who published the journal &quot;Anti-Caste&quot;, had attended several of Wells&#x27;s lectures while traveling in America. Mayo was a writer and poet who wrote under the name of Edward Garrett. Both women had read of the particularly gruesome mob murder of Henry Smith in Texas and wanted to organize a speaking tour to call attention to American lynchings.

Impey and Mayo asked Frederick Douglass to make the trip, but he declined, citing his age and health. He then suggested Wells, who enthusiastically accepted the invitation. In 1894, before leaving the US for her second visit to Great Britain, Wells called on William Penn Nixon, the editor of the &quot;Daily Inter Ocean&quot;, a Republican newspaper in Chicago. It was the only major white paper that persistently denounced lynching. After she told Nixon about her planned tour, he asked her to write for the newspaper while in England. She was the first African-American woman to be a paid correspondent for a mainstream white newspaper.

Wells toured England, Scotland, with Eliza Wigham in attendance and Wales for two months, addressing audiences of thousands, and rallying a moral crusade among the British. She relied heavily on her pamphlet &quot;Southern Horrors&quot; in her first tour, and showed shocking photographs of lynchings in America. On May 17, 1894, she spoke in Birmingham, West Midlands, at the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Assembly and at Central Hall, staying in Edgbaston at 66 Gough Road. On June 25, 1894, at Bradford she gave a &quot;sensational address, though in a quiet and restrained manner&quot;.

On the last night of her second tour, the London Anti-Lynching Committee was established – reportedly the first anti-lynching organization in the world. Its founding members included many notable figure including the Duke of Argyll, Sir John Gorst, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lady Henry Somerset and some twenty Members of Parliament, with activist Florence Balgarnie as the honorary secretary.

As a result of her two lecture tours in Britain, Wells received significant coverage in the British and American press. Many of the articles published by the latter at the time of her return to the United States were hostile personal critiques, rather than reports of her anti-lynching positions and beliefs. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for example, called her &quot;a slanderous and nasty-minded Mulatress&quot;. Despite these attacks from the American press, Wells had nevertheless gained extensive recognition and credibility, and an international audience of supporters for her cause. Wells&#x27;s tours in Britain even influenced public opinion to the extent that British textile manufacturers fought back with economic strategies, imposing a temporary boycott on Southern cotton that pressured southern businessmen to condemn the practice of lynching publicly.

== Marriage and family ==

On June 27, 1895, in Chicago at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Wells married attorney Ferdinand Lee Barnett, a widower with two sons, Ferdinand Barnett and Albert Graham Barnett (1886–1962). Ferdinand Lee Barnett, who lived in Chicago, was a prominent attorney, civil rights activist, and journalist. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and in support of the civil rights of African Americans. Wells and Barnett had met in 1893, working together on a pamphlet protesting the lack of Black representation at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Barnett founded &quot;The Chicago Conservator&quot;, the first Black newspaper in Chicago, in 1878. Wells began writing for the paper in 1893, later acquired a partial ownership interest, and after marrying Barnett, assumed the role of editor.

Wells&#x27;s marriage to Barnett was a legal union as well as a partnership of ideas and actions. Both were journalists, as well as established activists with a shared commitment to civil rights. In an interview, Wells&#x27;s daughter Alfreda said that the two had &quot;like interests&quot; and that their journalist careers were &quot;intertwined&quot;. This sort of close working relationship between a wife and husband was unusual at the time, as women often played more traditional domestic roles in a marriage.

In addition to Barnett&#x27;s two children from his previous marriage, the couple had four more: Charles Aked Barnett (1896–1957), Herman Kohlsaat Barnett (1897–1975), Ida Bell Wells Barnett, Jr. (1901–1988), and Alfreda Marguerita Barnett &quot;(married surname&quot; Duster; 1904–1983). Charles Aked Barnett&#x27;s middle name was the surname of Charles Frederic Aked (1864–1941), an influential British-born-turned-American progressive Protestant clergyman who, in 1894, while pastor of the Pembrooke Baptist Church in Liverpool, England, befriended Wells, endorsed her anti-lynching campaign, and hosted her during her second speaking tour in England in 1894.

Wells began writing her autobiography, &quot;Crusade for Justice&quot; (1928), but never finished the book; edited by her daughter Alfreda Barnett Duster, it was posthumously published, in 1970, as &quot;Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B. Wells&quot;.In a chapter of &quot;Crusade For Justice&quot;, titled &quot;A Divided Duty&quot;, Wells described the challenge of splitting her time between family and work. She continued to work after the birth of her first child, traveling and bringing the infant Charles with her. Although she tried to balance her roles as a mother and as a national activist, it was alleged that she was not always successful. Susan B. Anthony said she seemed &quot;distracted&quot;.

The establishment by Wells of Chicago&#x27;s first kindergarten prioritizing Black children, located in the lecture room of the Bethel AME Church, demonstrates how her public activism and her personal life were connected; as her great-granddaughter Michelle Duster notes: &quot;When her older children started getting of school age, then she recognized that black children did not have the same kind of educational opportunities as some other students ... And so, her attitude was, &#x27;Well since it doesn&#x27;t exist, we&#x27;ll create it ourselves.

== African-American leadership ==
The 19th century&#x27;s acknowledged leader for African-American civil rights, Frederick Douglass praised Wells&#x27;s work, giving her introductions and sometimes financial support for her investigations. When he died in 1895, Wells was perhaps at the height of her notoriety, but many men and women were ambivalent or against a woman taking the lead in Black civil rights at a time when women were not seen as, and often not allowed to be, leaders by the wider society. The new leading voices, Booker T. Washington, his rival, W. E. B. Du Bois, and more traditionally minded women activists, often viewed Wells as too radical.

Wells encountered and sometimes collaborated with the others, but they also had many disagreements, while also competing for attention for their ideas and programs. For example, there are differing in accounts for why Wells&#x27;s name was excluded from the original list of founders of the NAACP. In his autobiography &quot;Dusk of Dawn&quot;, Du Bois implied that Wells chose not to be included. However, in her autobiography, Wells stated that Du Bois deliberately excluded her from the list.

== Organizing in Chicago ==
Having settled in Chicago, Wells continued her anti-lynching work while becoming more focused on the civil rights of African Americans. She worked with national civil rights leaders to protest a major exhibition, she was active in the national women&#x27;s club movement, and she ultimately ran for a position in the Illinois State Senate. She also was passionate about women&#x27;s rights and suffrage. She was a spokeswoman and an advocate for women being successful in the workplace, having equal opportunities, and creating a name for themselves.

Wells was an active member of the National Equal Rights League (NERL), founded in 1864, and was their representative calling on President Woodrow Wilson to end discrimination in government jobs. In 1914, she served as president of NERL&#x27;s Chicago bureau.

In 1911, Wells attended the second annual Single Tax Conference. This meeting, which promoted the ideology of Land Value Tax, was moved from its original location to protest against the hotel&#x27;s discrimination against African Americans at the conference banquet.

=== World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition ===
In 1893, the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition was held in Chicago. Together with Frederick Douglass and other Black leaders, Wells organized a Black boycott of the fair, for the fair&#x27;s lack of representation of African-American achievement in the exhibits. Wells, Douglass, Irvine Garland Penn, and Wells&#x27;s future husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett, wrote sections of the pamphlet &quot;The Reason Why: The Colored American Is Not in the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition&quot;, which detailed the progress of Blacks since their arrival in America and also exposed the basis of Southern lynchings. Wells later reported to Albion W. Tourgée that copies of the pamphlet had been distributed to more than 20,000 people at the fair. That year she started work with &quot;The Chicago Conservator&quot;, the oldest African-American newspaper in the city.

=== Women&#x27;s clubs ===
Living in Chicago in the late 19th century, Wells was very active in the national Woman&#x27;s club movement. In 1893, she organized &quot;The Women&#x27;s Era Club&quot;, a first-of-its-kind civic club for African-American women in Chicago. Wells recruited veteran Chicago activist Mary Richardson Jones to serve as the first chair of the new club in 1894; Jones recruited for the organization and lent it considerable prestige. It would later be renamed the Ida B. Wells Club in her honor. In 1896, Wells took part in the meeting in Washington, D.C., that founded the National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs. After her death, the club advocated to have a housing project in Chicago named after the founder, Ida B. Wells, and succeeded, making history in 1939 as the first housing project named after a woman of color. Wells also helped organize the National Afro-American Council, serving as the organization&#x27;s first secretary.

Wells received much support from other social activists and her fellow club women. Frederick Douglass praised her work: &quot;You have done your people and mine a service... What a revelation of existing conditions your writing has been for me.&quot;

Despite Douglass&#x27;s praise, Wells was becoming a controversial figure among local and national women&#x27;s clubs. This was evident when in 1899 the National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs intended to meet in Chicago. Writing to the president of the association, Mary Terrell, Chicago organizers of the event stated that they would not cooperate in the meeting if it included Wells. When Wells learned that Terrell had agreed to exclude Wells, she called it &quot;a staggering blow&quot;.

=== School segregation ===
In 1900, Wells was outraged when the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published a series of articles suggesting adoption of a system of racial segregation in public schools. Given her experience as a schoolteacher in segregated systems in the South, she wrote to the publisher on the failures of segregated school systems and the successes of integrated public schools. She then went to his office and lobbied him. Unsatisfied, she enlisted the social reformer Jane Addams in her cause. Wells and the pressure group she put together with Addams are credited with stopping the adoption of an officially segregated school system.

== Suffrage ==
=== Willard controversy ===

Wells&#x27; role in the U.S. suffrage movement was inextricably linked to her lifelong crusade against racism, violence and discrimination towards African Americans. Her view of women&#x27;s enfranchisement was pragmatic and political. Like all suffragists, she believed in women&#x27;s right to vote, but she also saw enfranchisement as a way for Black women to become politically involved in their communities and to use their votes to elect African Americans, regardless of gender, to influential political office.

As a prominent Black suffragist, Wells held strong positions against racism, violence and lynching that brought her into conflict with leaders of largely white suffrage organizations. Perhaps the most notable example of this conflict was her public disagreement with Frances Willard, the first President of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).

The WCTU was a predominantly white women&#x27;s organization, with branches in every state and a growing membership, including in the Southern United States, where segregation laws and lynching occurred. With roots in the call for temperance and sobriety, the organization later became a powerful advocate of suffrage in the U.S.

In 1893 Wells and Willard travelled separately to Britain on lecture tours. Willard was promoting temperance as well as suffrage for women, and Wells was calling attention to lynching in the U.S. The basis of their dispute was Wells&#x27; public statements that Willard was silent on the issue of lynching. Wells referred to an interview Willard had conducted during her tour of the American South, in which Willard had blamed African Americans&#x27; behavior for the defeat of temperance legislation. &quot;The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt&quot;, Willard had said, and &quot;the grog shop is its center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities, so that men dare not go beyond the sight of their own roof tree.&quot;

Although Willard and her prominent supporter Lady Somerset were critical of Wells&#x27; comments, Wells was able to turn that into her favor, portraying their criticisms as attempts by powerful white leaders to &quot;crush an insignificant colored woman&quot;.

Wells also dedicated a chapter in &quot;The Red Record&quot; to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter titled &quot;Miss Willard&#x27;s Attitude&quot; condemned Willard for using rhetoric that promoted violence and other crimes against African Americans in America.

=== Negro Fellowship League ===
Wells, her husband, and some members of their Bible study group, in 1908 founded the Negro Fellowship League (NFL), the first Black settlement house in Chicago. The organization, in rented space, served as a reading room, library, activity center, and shelter for young Black men in the local community at a time when the local Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) did not allow Black men to become members. The NFL also assisted with job leads and entrepreneurial opportunities for new arrivals in Chicago from Southern States, notably those of the Great Migration. During her involvement, the NFL advocated for women&#x27;s suffrage and supported the Republican Party in Illinois.

=== Alpha Suffrage Club ===
In the years following her dispute with Willard, Wells continued her anti-lynching campaign and organizing in Chicago. She focused her work on Black women&#x27;s suffrage in the city following the enactment of a new state law enabling partial women&#x27;s suffrage. The Illinois Presidential and Municipal Suffrage Bill of 1913 (see Women&#x27;s suffrage in Illinois) gave women in the state the right to vote for presidential electors, mayor, aldermen and most other local offices; but not for governor, state representatives or members of Congress. Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi to grant women these voting rights.

The prospect of passing the act, even one of partial enfranchisement, was the impetus for Wells and her White colleague Belle Squire to organize the Alpha Suffrage Club in Chicago on January 30, 1913. One of the most important Black suffrage organizations in Chicago, the Alpha Suffrage Club was founded as a way to further voting rights for all women, to teach Black women how to engage in civic matters, and to work to elect African Americans to city offices. Two years after its founding, the club played a significant role in electing Oscar De Priest as the first African American alderman in Chicago.

As Wells and Squire were organizing the Alpha Club, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was organizing a suffrage parade in Washington D.C. Marching the day before the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson as president in 1913, suffragists from across the country gathered to demand universal suffrage. Wells, together with a delegation of members from Chicago, attended. On the day of the march, the head of the Illinois delegation told the Wells delegates that the NAWSA wanted &quot;to keep the delegation entirely white&quot;, and all African-American suffragists, including Wells, were to walk at the end of the parade in a &quot;colored delegation&quot;.

Instead of going to the back with other African Americans, however, Wells waited with spectators as the parade was underway, and stepped into the white Illinois delegation as they passed by. She visibly linked arms with her white suffragist colleagues, Squire and Virginia Brooks, for the rest of the parade, demonstrating, according to &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, the universality of the women&#x27;s civil rights movement.

== From &quot;race agitator&quot; to political candidate ==
During World War I, the U.S. government placed Wells under surveillance, labeling her a dangerous &quot;race agitator&quot;. She defied this threat by continuing civil rights work during this period with such figures as Marcus Garvey, Monroe Trotter, and Madam C. J. Walker. In 1917, Wells wrote a series of investigative reports for the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; on the East St. Louis Race Riots. After almost thirty years away, Wells made her first trip back to the South in 1921 to investigate and publish a report on the Elaine massacre in Arkansas (published 1922).

In the 1920s, she participated in the struggle for African-American workers&#x27; rights, urging Black women&#x27;s organizations to support the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, as it tried to gain legitimacy. However, she lost the presidency of the National Association of Colored Women in 1924 to the more diplomatic Mary Bethune. To challenge what she viewed as problems for African Americans in Chicago, Wells started a political organization named Third Ward Women&#x27;s Political Club in 1927. In 1928, she tried to become a delegate to the Republican National Convention but lost to Oscar De Priest. Her feelings toward the Republican Party became more mixed due to what she viewed as the Hoover administration&#x27;s poor stance on civil rights and attempts to promote a &quot;Lily-White&quot; policy in Southern Republican organizations. In 1930, Wells unsuccessfully sought elective office, running as an Independent for a seat in the Illinois Senate, against the Republican Party candidate, Adelbert Roberts.

== Influence on Black feminist activism ==
Wells explained that the defense of white women&#x27;s honor allowed Southern white men to get away with murder by projecting their own history of sexual violence onto Black men. Her call for all races and genders to be accountable for their actions showed African-American women that they can speak out and fight for their rights. According to some, by portraying the horrors of lynching, she worked to show that racial and gender discrimination are linked, furthering the Black feminist cause.

== Legacy and honors ==

Wells died of kidney disease on March 25, 1931 in Chicago. Since Wells&#x27;s death, with the rise of mid-20th-century civil rights activism, and the 1971 posthumous publication of her autobiography, interest in her life and legacy has grown. Awards have been established in her name by the National Association of Black Journalists, the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, the Coordinating Council for Women in History, the Type Investigations (formerly the Investigative Fund), the University of Louisville, and the New York County Lawyers&#x27; Association (awarded annually since 2003), among many others. The Ida B. Wells Memorial Foundation and the Ida B. Wells Museum have also been established to protect, preserve and promote Wells&#x27;s legacy. In her hometown of Holly Springs, Mississippi, there is an Ida B. Wells-Barnett Museum named in her honor that acts as a cultural center of African-American history.

In 1941, the Public Works Administration (PWA) built a Chicago Housing Authority public housing project in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago; it was named the Ida B. Wells Homes in her honor. The buildings were demolished in August 2011 due to changing demographics and ideas about such housing.

In 1988, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In August that year, she was also inducted into the Chicago Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Molefi Kete Asante included Wells on his list of &quot;100 Greatest African Americans&quot; in 2002. In 2011, Wells was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame for her writings.

On February 1, 1990, at the start of Black History Month in the U.S., the U.S. Postal Service dedicated a 25¢ stamp commemorating Wells in a ceremony at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The stamp, designed by Thomas Blackshear II, features a portrait of Wells illustrated from a composite of photographs of her taken during the mid-1890s. Wells is the 25th African-American entry – and fourth African-American woman – on a U.S. postage stamp. She is the 13th in the Postal Service&#x27;s Black Heritage series.

In 2006, the Harvard Kennedy School commissioned a portrait of Wells. In 2007, the Ida B. Wells Association was founded by University of Memphis philosophy graduate students to promote discussion of philosophical issues arising from the African-American experience and to provide a context in which to mentor undergraduates. The Philosophy Department at the University of Memphis has sponsored the Ida B. Wells conference every year since 2007.

On February 12, 2012, Mary E. Flowers, a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, introduced House Resolution 770 during the 97th General Assembly, honoring Ida B. Wells by declaring March 25, 2012 – the anniversary of her death – as Ida B. Wells Day in the State of Illinois.
In August 2014, Wells was the subject of an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Great Lives&quot;, in which her work was championed by Baroness Oona King. Wells was honored with a Google Doodle on July 16, 2015, which would have been her 153rd birthday.

In 2016, the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting was launched in Memphis, Tennessee, with the purpose of promoting investigative journalism. Following in the footsteps of Wells, this society encourages minority journalists to expose injustices perpetuated by the government and defend people who are susceptible to being taken advantage of. This organization was created with much support from the Open Society Foundations, Ford Foundation, and CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

In 2018, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice opened, including a reflection space dedicated to Wells, a selection of quotes by her, and a stone inscribed with her name.
On March 8, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her, in a series marking International Women&#x27;s Day and entitled &quot;Overlooked&quot;, which set out to acknowledge that, since 1851, the newspaper&#x27;s obituary pages had been dominated by white men, while notable women – including Wells – had been ignored.

In July 2018, Chicago&#x27;s City Council officially renamed Congress Parkway as Ida B. Wells Drive; it is the first downtown Chicago street named after a woman of color.

On February 12, 2019, a blue plaque, provided by the Nubian Jak Community Trust, was unveiled by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Yvonne Mosquito, at the Edgbaston Community Centre, Birmingham, England, commemorating Wells&#x27;s stay in a house on the exact site of 66 Gough Road where she stayed in 1893 during her speaking tour of the British Isles.

On July 13, 2019, a marker for her was unveiled in Mississippi, on the northeast corner of Holly Springs&#x27; Courthouse Square. The marker was dedicated by the Wells–Barnett Museum and the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation.

In 2019, a new middle school in Washington, D.C., was named in her honor. On November 7, 2019, a Mississippi Writers Trail historical marker was installed at Rust College in Holly Springs, commemorating the legacy of Ida B. Wells.

On May 4, 2020, she was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize special citation, &quot;for her outstanding and courageous reporting on the horrific and vicious violence against African Americans during the era of lynching&quot;. The Pulitzer Prize board announced that it would donate at least $50,000 in support of Wells&#x27;s mission to recipients who would be announced at a later date.

In 2021, a public high school in Portland, Oregon, that had been named for Woodrow Wilson was renamed Ida B. Wells High School.

In 2025, Wells was honored on a U.S. quarter part of the final year of the American Women quarters program. The quarter&#x27;s launch was celebrated at Chicago&#x27;s DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center in partnership with the United States Mint and the National Women&#x27;s History Museum on February 12, 2025.

=== Monuments ===

In 2021, Chicago erected a monument to Wells in the Bronzeville neighborhood, near where she lived and close to the site of the former Ida B. Wells Homes housing project. Officially called &quot;The Light of Truth Ida B. Wells National Monument&quot; (based on her quote, &quot;the way to right wrongs is to cast the light of truth upon them&quot;), it was created by sculptor Richard Hunt.

Also in 2021, Memphis dedicated a new Ida B. Wells plaza with a life-sized statue of Wells. The monument is adjacent to the historic Beale Street Baptist Church, where Wells produced the &quot;Free Speech&quot; newspaper.

=== Representation in media ===
In 1949, the anthology radio drama &quot;Destination Freedom&quot; recapped parts of her life in the episode &quot;Woman with a Mission&quot;, written by Richard Durham.

The PBS documentary series &quot;American Experience&quot; aired on December 19, 1989 – season 2, episode 11 (one-hour) – &quot;Ida B. Wells: A Passion for Justice&quot;, written and directed by William Greaves. The documentary featured excerpts of Wells&#x27;s memoirs read by Toni Morrison. (viewable &quot;via&quot; YouTube)

In 1995, the play &quot;In Pursuit of Justice: A One-Woman Play About Ida B. Wells&quot;, written by Wendy D. Jones (born 1953) and starring Janice Jenkins, was produced. It draws on historical incidents and speeches from Wells&#x27;s autobiography, and features fictional letters to a friend. It won four awards from the AUDELCO (Audience Development Committee Inc.), an organization that honors Black theater.

In 1999, a staged reading of the play &quot;Iola&#x27;s Letter&quot;, written by Michon Boston (née Michon Alana Boston; born 1962), was performed at Howard University in Washington, D.C., under the direction of Vera J. Katz, including then-student Chadwick Boseman among the cast. The play is inspired by the real-life events that compelled a 29-year-old Ida B. Wells to launch an anti-lynching crusade from Memphis in 1892 using her newspaper, &quot;Free Speech&quot;.

Wells&#x27;s life is the subject of &quot;Constant Star&quot; (2002), a widely performed musical drama by Tazewell Thompson, who was inspired to write it by the 1989 documentary &quot;Ida B. Wells: A Passion for Justice&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s play explores Wells as &quot;a seminal figure in Post-Reconstruction America&quot;.

Wells was played by Adilah Barnes in the 2004 film &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;. The film dramatizes a moment during the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913 when Wells ignored instructions to march with the segregated parade units and crossed the lines to march with the other members of her Illinois chapter.

<doc id="394118" wikidata="Q878345" url="?curid=394118" title="Janus, King of Cyprus">
<text>Janus (1375 – 29 June 1432) was King of Cyprus and titular King of Armenian Cilicia and Jerusalem from 1398 to 1432.

==Early life==
Janus was born in Genoa, where his father, James I of Cyprus, was a captive. His mother, Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, named him in honor of the god Janus, the founder of Genoa according to mythological tradition.

When his father was elected king, he negotiated an agreement with the Genoese to release him to go to Cyprus, which he signed on 2 February 1383. Under that agreement, the Genoese were given new commercial privileges. However, the Genoese demanded that his father leave his son Janus in their city as a hostage. James sent a noble to Genoa, John Babin, to act as stepfather to his son. As the Cypriot historian Leontios Makhairas writes, James ordered a special tax which required the Cypriots—both nobles and commoners—to purchase an amount of salt in order to collect the money needed to release his son from Genoese captivity; this was achieved on October 1392, when Janus was 18 years old.

== Reign ==

After his father&#x27;s death on 9 September 1398, Janus took over the throne of Cyprus. He was crowned in Nicosia&#x27;s Saint Sophia Cathedral on 11 November 1398.

As king he tried in 1402 to take back Famagusta, which was under Genoese rule. According to writings of Amati, the administrator of Famagusta, the Genoese Antonio de Karko, was Janus&#x27; godfather. Janus conspired with a priest who was the spiritual father of de Karko, in order to return the city to the Cypriot kingdom, upon which the priest was to become Bishop of Famagusta. Involved in that conspiracy was Peter Makhairas, brother of Leontios. They made secret keys to the city gates and there were many preparations to take over Famagusta and to murder de Karko with the help of Brother Gregory and to open the gates for Janus&#x27; soldiers. However, at the last moment the plan was betrayed, and the conspirators were arrested at Famagusta; 28 of them were executed and the city remained in Genoese hands.

The king continued his effort to take back Famagusta (whose territory also included Kyrenia). In 1403, the governor of Genoa, Jean Le Maingre, had talks with Janus&#x27; representative Giorgio Billi which ended in an agreement by which the cities remained under Genoese hands. Later, he forced the Cypriot people to pay special taxes to assemble an army and siege machines, and he besieged Famagusta for three years but in vain, since there was access from the sea to the city. In 1406 the siege ended and the Genoese tried to occupy Limassol, but were defeated.

Two years later, the island was affected by epidemics. Simultaneously, there were many raids of locusts on the island, which caused destruction to agriculture. A new epidemic arrived in 1419–20, which probably caused the death of Janus&#x27; second wife, Charlotte on 15 January 1422. Because the king was very distraught about her death, the body of the dead queen was moved out of the palace where her funeral was, in order not to be seen by Janus.

Meanwhile, because Cyprus was still a permanent base of campaign for pirates and adventurers, after raids around the Cypriot coasts, Janus had repeated discussions with the Sultan of Egypt via the sultan&#x27;s representatives. Janus was unable to stop the raids, which gave the Muslims a reason to attack Cyprus. Cypriot nobles and officials of the kingdom participated in the raids.

Barsbay, the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt, sent military forces to Cyprus several times. A small force, around 1424, attacked Limassol, and in 1425 the Egyptian army attacked Famagusta and then pillaged Larnaca together with the nearby area, including Kiti, Dromolaxia, Kellia, Aradippou and Agrinou. After Larnaca, they went to Limassol, which was also sacked, including the city&#x27;s castle.

In the summer of 1426, the Egyptian Mamluks launched a large-scale attack against the island. Led by Atallah Muhammad and Inal al-Kakimi, their diverse army contained over 3,000 men and included Mamluks, Circassians, Kurds and Arabs and arrived at the island with 180 ships near Avdimou. Limassol was again occupied. Janus mustered his army and moved from Nicosia to Limassol. He asked in vain for help from the Christian forces in Europe: the Genoese were his enemies, and the Venetians and others did not want to destroy commercial relations with the Egyptian sultan.

Following the Battle of Chirokitia (7 July 1426) against the Mamluks, King Janus was captured by the Egyptian forces. He was ransomed after ten months of captivity in Cairo. During his captivity his brother Hugh of Lusignan, Archbishop of Nicosia, took charge of Cyprus.

After their victory the Mamluks pillaged Larnaca again and then the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia. The royal family retreated to fortified Kyrenia and were rescued. The invaders took a great deal of loot and captives before they left the island.

That disaster, together with the previous raids, the war operations of Janus against Genoese, the epidemics and the invasion of locusts caused the Cypriot serfs, who lived in conditions of utter poverty, to revolt. The leader of the Cypriot revolutionaries was a person called Alexis, who was declared king in Lefkoniko. The revolution was big, and was supported by the population, who elected their own leaders in many places of Cyprus.

Meanwhile, Janus was humiliated in Cairo: they took him, tied up with chains and riding a donkey, in front of the sultan, after which he was forced to kneel and worship nine times the soil on which he stepped. The release of Janus was effected after the intervention of Europeans, who collected money for the required ransom. Cyprus also had to offer the sultan an annual tax based on income from 5,000 duchies. This tax continued to be paid even after the end of Frankish rule in Cyprus. Together with Janus, some of the captives managed to buy their freedom after their families collected money to ransom them. Others remained captive and were sold as slaves.

While Janus was captive in Cyprus, the nobles and the royal family members were trying to deal with Alexis&#x27; rebellion and concurrently trying to achieve the release of Janus. With help from Europe, the rebellion was repressed after 10 months. The rebels&#x27; leader was arrested and after terrible tortures was executed in Nicosia on 12 May 1427, the same day that King Janus arrived in Paphos from Cairo.

==Family and issue==
Janus had nine children. Sometime after January 1400 he married Anglesia Visconti (died 1439), daughter of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan, but the marriage was annulled and they divorced in 1408 or 1407/1409 without issue.

In 1411, he married Charlotte de Bourbon (born 1388 – died of the plague on 15 January 1422 and buried in Nicosia), daughter of John I, Count of La Marche and Catherine of Vendôme, at Nicosia; they had six children:
* John II or III of Lusignan (1414–1458)
* James of Lusignan (d. ca. 1426)
* Anne of Lusignan, Princess of Cyprus (1418 or 1419 – 1462), married at Chambéry on 1 November 1433 or 12 February 1434 to Louis of Savoy
* Mary of Lusignan (died 1437)
* Hugo of Lusignan, Cardinal (born 1415) 
* Phebus or Philip of Lusignan, sire of Sidon (born 1415) 
Out of wedlock, he had three more children: 
* Aloysius of Lusignan (1408 – after 1421)
* Guy of Lusignan (1410–1470), legitimized by the Pope Martin V in 1428
* a daughter de Lusignan, married 1427 Garceran Suarez de los Cernadilla, Admiral of Cyprus

<text>The Voskhod rocket (, &quot;ascent&quot;, &quot;dawn&quot;) was a derivative of the Soviet R-7 ICBM designed for the human spaceflight programme but later used for launching Zenit reconnaissance satellites. It was essentially an 8K78/8K78M minus the Blok L stage and spec-wise was a halfway between the two boosters, with the former&#x27;s older, lower-spec engines and the latter&#x27;s improved Blok I design. Its first flight was on 16 November 1963 when it successfully launched a Zenit satellite from LC-1/5 at Baikonur. Boosters used in the Voskhod program had a man-rated version of the RD-0107 engine; this version was known as the RD-0108.

Starting in 1966, the 11A57 adopted the standardized 11A511 core with the more powerful 8D74M first stage engines, however the Blok I stage continued using the RD-0107 engine rather than the RD-0110. Around 300 were flown from Baikonur and Plesetsk through 1976, almost all of them used to launch Zenit reconnaissance satellites (one exception was the Intercosmos 6 satellite in 1973).

The newer 11A511U core had been introduced in 1973, but the existing stock of 11A57s took another three years to use up.

The rocket had a streak of 86 consecutive successful launches between 11 September 1967 and 9 July 1970.

<doc id="394125" wikidata="Q1171427" url="?curid=394125" title="The Adventure of the Empty House">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 26 September 1903, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in October 1903.

Public pressure compelled Conan Doyle to bring the sleuth back to life, and explain his survival after his deadly struggle with Professor Moriarty in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. This is the first Holmes story set after his supposed death at the Reichenbach Falls, as recounted in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

== Plot ==
On the night of 30 March, an apparently unsolvable locked-room murder takes place in London: the killing of the Honourable Ronald Adair.


Dr. Watson visits the murder scene. He runs into an elderly deformed book collector, later revealed as Sherlock Holmes in disguise. Contrary to what Watson believed, Holmes won against Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls, explaining that he spent the next few years travelling to various parts of the world.

That evening, they enter an abandoned building known as Camden House whose front room overlooks Baker Street. Holmes&#x27;s room can be seen across the street. In the window is a lifelike waxwork bust of Holmes in profile. At approximately midnight, a sniper, who has taken the bait, fires a specialised air gun, scoring a direct hit on Holmes&#x27;s dummy. Inspector Lestrade arrests the gunman, who is revealed as Colonel Sebastian Moran, Adair&#x27;s whist partner and murderer. Holmes describes Moran as having been &quot;the second most dangerous man in London&quot; while Moriarty was still alive.

Holmes speculates that Adair had caught Moran cheating at cards, and threatened to expose his dishonourable behaviour. Moran, who earned a living playing cards crookedly, got rid of the one man who could rob him of his livelihood.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 26 September 1903, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in October 1903. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.
==Inspirations==
Andrew Glazzard has suggested that the author may have been hinting his audience of the royal baccarat scandal in which Sir William Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet, an army officer and tiger hunter, had been accused of cheating at baccarat. He sued his accusers - the ensuing trial notably saw Prince Edward (later King Edward VII) take the stand as a witness.
Glazzard also suggests that the oblique references that Holmes makes about his &quot;missing years&quot; are hints to the explorations of Sven Hedin in Tibet and Francis Younghusband&#x27;s expedition to that country, and also to pro-British espionage in Mahdist Sudan.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
This story was adapted as a short film released in 1921 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.

The 1931 film &quot;The Sleeping Cardinal&quot; (also known as &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Fatal Hour&quot;) is loosely based on &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

Many elements of &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; were used in the 1939–1946 Sherlock Holmes film series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. In &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon&quot; (1943), Holmes disguises himself as a German bookseller in Switzerland. &quot;The Woman in Green&quot; (1945) uses the scene in which a sniper attempts to shoot Holmes from across the street and shoots a wax bust instead, and is apprehended by Holmes and Watson who lie in wait. Colonel Sebastian Moran appears as the villain in &quot;Terror by Night&quot; (1946) as the last of Moriarty&#x27;s gang.

The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of &quot;We Present Alan Wheatley as Mr Sherlock Holmes in...&quot; starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes, Raymond Francis as Dr. Watson and Bill Owen as Inspector Lestrade. The episode is now lost.

The story was adapted in 1980 as an episode of the Soviet TV series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; starring Vasily Livanov. The episode has some minor departures: Moran tries to shoot Holmes during his fight with Moriarty (he actually appears in the story before Moriarty, and both Holmes and Watson are aware of his motive to kill Adair from early on), with Holmes pretending to be hit to fake his death, Adair is still alive at the start of the episode, Watson unsuccessfully tries to protect him as instructed by Holmes, and Watson briefly becomes a prime suspect in Adair&#x27;s murder.

The story was later adapted in 1986 as an episode of &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett. The episode is rather faithful to Doyle&#x27;s story, except that Moran tries to shoot Holmes in Switzerland instead of dropping boulders on him, and it is Watson – not Holmes – that deduces the reason that Moran had for killing Ronald Adair. It was the first episode to feature Edward Hardwicke as Dr Watson, replacing David Burke who had played the role in the preceding episodes (Hardwicke reenacted a scene from &quot;The Final Problem&quot; in a flashback, consisting of Watson at the waterfall shouting to Holmes and reading his letter, which had been performed by Burke).

&quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; was adapted as an episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot;. The episode, also titled &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, first aired in 1999.

In &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, the first episode of the third series of &quot;Sherlock&quot; starring Benedict Cumberbatch which aired on 1 January 2014, Holmes returns to London two years (instead of three) after faking his death. Although Watson is surprised that Sherlock is alive, he is furious that Sherlock didn&#x27;t contact him in the last two years. He reluctantly teams up with Sherlock to investigate an underground terrorist network.

===Radio===

Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode aired on 5 October 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 15 October 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 29 September 1940. Another episode in the same series that was also adapted from the story aired on 11 April 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

John Gielgud played Holmes with Ralph Richardson as Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired on NBC radio on 24 April 1955.

Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a radio production that aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1961, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Noel Johnson as Colonel Moran.

&quot;The Empty House&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Pennington as Professor Moriarty, Frederick Treves as Colonel Moran, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and Peter Penry-Jones as Sir John.

&quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; was combined with &quot;The Final Problem&quot; for an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode, titled &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, first aired in 2009.

===Other media===
The story, along with &quot;The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;, and &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, provided the source material for the 1923 play &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

In 1975, DC Comics published &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; #1, a comic which adapted &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. It was intended to be an ongoing series, but future issues were cancelled due to low sales.

In the last short story in the book &quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot; (1999) by George MacDonald Fraser, Fraser&#x27;s anti-hero Harry Flashman sets out to murder Moran, who is blackmailing Flashman&#x27;s granddaughter. He trails Moran to Camden House, but instead witnesses Holmes capture him.

== Baritsu ==
Baritsu is the name given to a form of martial art used to explain how Holmes had avoided falling into the Reichenbach Falls with Professor Moriarty. As Holmes himself explained his survival:

In 1982 Fromm and Soames, followed by others including Y. Hirayama, J. Hall, Richard Bowen, and James Webb, suggested that Doyle had meant to refer to &quot;Bartitsu&quot;, an eclectic martial art that had been founded by Londoner E. W. Barton-Wright in 1899: several years after Holmes had supposedly used it, but two years before publication of the story.

It is uncertain why Holmes referred to &quot;baritsu&quot;, rather than &quot;Bartitsu&quot;. It is possible that Doyle, who, like Barton-Wright, was writing for &quot;Pearson’s Magazine&quot; during the late 1890s, was vaguely aware of Bartitsu and simply misremembered or misheard the term, perhaps in part due to Japanese phonology&#x27;s prohibition on consecutive non-nasal consonants; it may even have been a typographical error, a concern about copyright, or a deliberate alteration to match the aforementioned Japanese phonological pattern. A newspaper report on a Bartitsu demonstration in London, published in 1900, had likewise misspelled the name as &quot;baritsu&quot;.

The Japan Sherlock Holmes Club, formed in 1977, evolved from the &quot;Baritsu Chapter&quot; founded in 1948.

<doc id="394134" wikidata="Q5999555" url="?curid=394134" title="Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy">
<text>The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, or IMSA, is a three-year residential public secondary education institution in Aurora, Illinois, United States, with an enrollment of approximately 650 students.

Enrollment is generally offered to incoming sophomores, although younger students who have had the equivalent of one year of algebra and a 9th-grade science equivalent are eligible to apply. All applicants undergo a competitive admissions process involving the review of grades, teacher evaluations, student essays, and SAT scores. Historically, approximately one-third of applicants in any given year are admitted. Due to its nature as a public institution, there are no charges related to tuition, room, and board; however, there is an annual student fee that may be reduced or waived based on family income. IMSA has been consistently ranked by Newsweek as one of the top ten high schools in the country for math and science, and some of its graduates have become leaders in a variety of fields. It is the top-rated public high school in Illinois on Niche.com.

==History==
The school&#x27;s founding president was former Batavia Superintendent Stephanie Pace Marshall, who was involved with the project from the start and with the school’s first legal counsel Richard L. Horwitz, helped form IMSA&#x27;s original legislation, governing by-laws and slogan. Marshall retired from the position on June 30, 2007, and was later named President Emerita by the Board of Trustees.

Although the school received a budget cut in financial year 2002, its budget has since increased with the support of House Minority Leader Tom Cross. IMSA&#x27;s chairperson was Paula Olszewski-Kubilius.

==Admission==
Prospective students, who are usually freshmen in high school but in some cases may be eighth graders, must complete an application to be considered for admission to IMSA.

The application process consists of an official transcript of the student&#x27;s last 2½ years of school, scores from the SAT I or ACT, two student essays, three teacher evaluations in science, mathematics, and English, and a list of awards and extracurricular activities.

===Historic admission statistics===
In order to draw greater numbers of applications and &quot;transform teaching and learning,&quot; IMSA has an outreach program run by the Center for Teaching and Learning (formerly known as The Center for Advancement and Renewal of Learning and Teaching (The Center@IMSA), then &quot;Professional Field Services (PFS)&quot;). Some students who are invited to attend IMSA are admitted on the condition that they successfully complete a three-week, intensive preparation course, known as EXCEL, over the summer. IMSA has a fairly low retention rate; the average retention rate per class is 85%. The reasons for this may include the difficulty of the IMSA curriculum, home-sickness, disciplinary expulsion, student&#x27;s family moving out of state, and the inability for Illinois students to matriculate to IMSA after their sophomore year.

==Academics==
Students at IMSA take rigorous college preparatory courses, with all classes being taught at the honors level, though IMSA philosophically spurns the Advanced Placement curriculum. Each student must fulfill a set of specific credits in order to graduate. This set of credits is broken down by academic subject. Each semester-long class counts for 0.5 credits, unless it meets with greater-than-normal frequency.

In addition to the academic program, IMSA also offers a large number clubs ranging from religious clubs to volunteer organizations. All these clubs are chartered by the Student Council and the Council for Campus Equity (CCE).

Student Inquiry and Research

Most Wednesdays are &quot;I Days&quot; (for &quot;inquiry&quot;) and are usually reserved for juniors and seniors to research in the SIR program. SIR also runs during the summer of one&#x27;s sophomore year and junior year, allowing a student to conduct four disparate investigations. 

==External programs==
Unlike many other secondary schools, IMSA runs extracurricular and summer programs for the teachers and students of the State of Illinois. The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) is the division of the academy that directs and manages programs serving Illinois Educators and Students. CTL offerings enable students to develop and sustain Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills. CTL Student offerings include the IMSA Fusion program, Summer@IMSA, Funshop student enrichment programs, an on-line research course (RISE) open to all Illinois students, ALLIES (selected High School students that lead and facilitate inquiry-based STEM programs) and a variety of online learning experiences. CTL Educator offerings include professional development to include IMSA Core Competencies, IMSA Fusion (Offering professional development for educators teaching the FUSION after school program) and the annual &quot;IMSA Teacher Institute Day&quot; for local Mathematics and Science educators.
All CTL Programs place a special emphasis on students who are historically under-represented and under-served in math and science. Uniquely, The Center for Teaching and Learning also operates a field office in the Metro-east area.

==Student life==

===Publications===
&quot;The Acronym&quot; is IMSA&#x27;s student-run general affairs newspaper. In the 2008–2009 school year &quot;The Acronym&quot; ceased paper publishing and transitioned to an online format. &quot;The Acronym&quot; also publishes yearly Back to School editions and Senior Editions at the beginning and end of the school year, respectively. Since its inception, The Acronym has had the participation of more than 400 writers. In the 2022-2023 academic year, The Acronym reintroduced printed editions while maintaining its online articles. Additionally, it launched its mobile application that same year.

===Athletics===
IMSA is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), the organization which governs most sports and competitive activities in the state of Illinois, and began competing in the Little Ten Conference, a subdivision of the IHSA, during the 2021–2022 school year. IMSA&#x27;s sports teams are stylized as the Titans.

The school sponsors interscholastic teams for young men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. Young women may also compete in badminton. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the school also sponsors a dance team for young men and women.

===Competitive activities===
The following teams have finished in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournament:
* Chess: 4th place (1997–98, 1998–99, 2009–1); 3rd place (1990–91, 1994–95, 2003–04, 2004–05, 2015–16); 2nd place (1989–90); State Champions (1986–87, 1987–88, 1995–96, 1996–97, 2016–17, 2017–18)
* Scholastic Bowl: 4th place (1991–92, 2014–15); 3rd place (2009–10, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19); 2nd place (1992–93); State Champions (1988–89, 1989–90, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98, 1998–99, 2000–01, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2013–14, 2016–17, 2021-2022)

==Student Leadership and Development (SLD) Programs==

===Student Council===
In addition to its primary role as the mediator between administrators and students, Student Council works with administrators to change aspects of the Academy. The Student Council website provides the student body relevant information about projects that the council is working on. Student Council also charters clubs at the beginning of each academic year and provides them with the necessary funds to hold various events. Student Council works throughout the year to collect student feedback and use that information to make changes that reflect the intentions of the student body.

==Awards==
IMSA consistently ranks at the top of the nation in standardized test scores (of roughly 200 students in the senior class, about 50 are National Merit Semifinalists), as well as in the prestigious Siemens and Intel Science competitions. In the class of 2009, five students were named Siemens Regional Finalists and ten others as semifinalists.

Six mathematics teachers have been honored with the Edyth May Sliffe Award: Titu Andreescu (1994), Ronald Vavrinek (1995), Micah Fogel (2001), Steven Condie (2002), Michael Keyton (2003), Don Porzio (2004), and Steven Condie (2nd award) (2007). Asteroid &quot;21441 Stevencondie&quot; is named after Dr. Condie.

Dr. Lee Eysturlid was honored with a University of Chicago Outstanding Educator Award (2020).

==Notable alumni==
*Ramez Naam (1990) - software developer and author. He helped develop Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer and Outlook.

<doc id="394157" wikidata="Q546626" url="?curid=394157" title="James I of Cyprus">
<text>James I (; 1334 – September 9, 1398) was the youngest son of King Hugh IV of Cyprus and by 1369 held the title &quot;Constable of Jerusalem.&quot; When his nephew Peter II died in 1382, he became King of Cyprus. James was also crowned King of Jerusalem in 1389 and assumed the title of King of Armenia in 1393, which was formally given to him in 1396.

James was the third son of Hugh IV of Cyprus and his second wife, Alix of Ibelin. His older half-brother was Guy, Prince of Galilee (1320–43), and his two brothers were Peter I, King of Cyprus (1328–1369), and John of Lusignan, Prince of Antioch (1329–1375). Before becoming king, James had other offices and was known for his resistance against the Genoese invasion of Cyprus.

==Nobleman==
When his father King Hugh IV died in 1359, his eldest brother, Peter I, took the throne and reigned for 10 years, until he was murdered in 1369. Peter&#x27;s heir, his only son, Peter II, was about 14 at that time. James&#x27;s second brother, John, titular Prince of Antioch, Constable of Cyprus, as the eldest living son of Hugh IV, was regent for three years during the minority of Peter II, who was crowned in January of 1372. During the regency, Peter I&#x27;s widow Eleanor of Aragon, to avenge her husband&#x27;s murder, invited the Genoese to invade Cyprus.

Since the Genoese had commercial and financial interests in Cyprus that they wanted to protect and exploit, they invaded the island in April 1373. After achieving the takeover of the well-fortified city of Famagusta, they arrested and held captive Peter II and his mother Eleanor, who had invited them. After they killed the nobles who had murdered Peter I, they wanted to take control of the island. After the end of the war, in 1375, Eleanor succeeded in arranging the murder of her husband&#x27;s brother John of Lusignan, Prince of Antioch (the former regent), whom she claimed she was responsible for her husband&#x27;s murder. James, the other brother, was also said to be among the party that murdered his Peter I, but by this time he had was in prison in Genoa.

James was created Constable of Jerusalem, the second in command, while his elder brother was created Constable of Cyprus, the highest military position Constable of Cyprus, and in that office led the resistance against the invasion by the Genoese in 1373.

Both James and his brother John resisted the invasion. James fought well in command of forces in Kyrenia, successfully resisting this Genoese attack. However, King Peter II, his young nephew, signed a treaty with the Genoese, who kept Famagusta. According to the treaty, James had to leave Cyprus. The Genoese considered him their chief opponent in Cyprus. In 1374 he left the island on a ship from Kyrenia. The ship was forced to stop at Rhodes, and there he was arrested by the Genoese and taken as a captive to Genoa, together with his wife. Their young daughter died, either in Rhodes or Genoa. Their first son, Janus, was born in that city in 1375.
In Genoa he lived with his wife under difficult circumstances as a prisoner for 9 years. Many of their other children were probably also born in Genoa.

==King==
After Peter II&#x27;s death without an heir in 1382, the Parliament of Cyprus decided on James to be the king, while he was still held captive in Genoa. The Genoese, before they would agree to release him to go back to Cyprus, negotiated with him to receive new privileges for commercial activities, and they received his signature on an &quot;extortionate&quot; agreement on February 2, 1383. Famagusta remained under Genoese sovereignty, something that was never accepted by either James and other kings after him. During his reign he tried to regain that city.

While awaiting James&#x27;s return from prison, the Kingdom of Cyprus was governed by a regency council of 12 nobles. After he signed the agreement to the terms of release in 1383, he and his wife returned to Genoa in the custody of the Genoese, but in the meantime, a number of nobles objected to these terms and sought a different monarch. Among them were the brothers Perot and Wilmot de Montolif (Perotte and Vilmonde de Montolivve). Perot privately encouraged the widow of Peter II, Queen Valentina, to take over the island, but publicly he supported her daughter Mariette or Margaret. The Montolif brothers may have had private ambitions to marry into the royal family. When James arrived in Cyprus, many people refused to accept his kingship. James, who at this time held the title of Constable of Cyprus, ordered two defenseless towns burned when the inhabitants, in fear of the rebellious nobles, did not give their allegiance to him as their sovereign. The Montolif brothers were sent by the rebellious nobles to try to negotiate better terms for James&#x27;s release from the Genoese, without cost to Cyprus, but they failed, and they refused the terms of the agreement James had already signed. James&#x27;s escorts from Genoa were unable to complete their mission according to the terms of the agreement, and the time limit they had been given ran out. They returned him to Genoa. The nobles could not be persuaded to accept James until 1385. In April 1385, leaving his son Janus in prison in Genoa as a hostage, James again returned to Cyprus and went to Nicosia, where he was welcomed with great enthusiasm. He was crowned in May 1385 in Saint Sophia Cathedral by Paul Palaiologos Tagaris. After his crowning, his opponents were arrested and punished. The Montolif brothers were executed. He imposed a tax to raise funds to ransom his son. This was accomplished more than seven years after his coronation, in December of 1392.

James I was crowned King of Jerusalem in 1389. In 1393, King Leo V of Armenia died, and James assumed the title of King of Armenia, which was formally given to him in 1396. That kingdom was by now reduced to the city of Korikos, which had been in Cypriote hands since its conquest by Peter I of Cyprus.
He died in Nicosia in 1398.

==Marriages and issue==
According to some sources, James married one Agnes of Bavaria (b.1338), daughter of Duke Stephen II of Bavaria from his first wife Elisabeth of Sicily. This marriage, assuming it was real, took place before James married his well known wife Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen about 1365.

James married his kinswoman Helvis (Heloise) of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (1353 – January 15/25, 1421) (daughter of Philip of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, Constable of Jerusalem and Helisia of Dampierre) in 1365. Her brother John of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (d. June 11, 1414 unmarried and without issue) was an Admiral of Cyprus and their father Philip of Brunswick-Grubenhagen(ca. 1332 – August 4, 1369/1370) was a Constable of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

<text>David Lewis (born David Losz; June 23 or October 1909 – May 23, 1981) was a Canadian labour lawyer and social democratic politician. He was national secretary of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) from 1936 to 1950 and one of the key architects of the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961. In 1962, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP), in the House of Commons of Canada, for the York South electoral district. While an MP, he was elected the NDP&#x27;s national leader and served from 1971 until 1975. After his defeat in the 1974 federal election, he stepped down as leader and retired from politics. He spent his last years as a university professor at Carleton University and as a travel correspondent for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. In retirement, he was named to the Order of Canada for his political service. After suffering from cancer for a long time, he died in Ottawa in 1981.

Lewis&#x27;s politics were heavily influenced by the Jewish Labour Bund, which contributed to his support of parliamentary democracy. He was an avowed anti-communist, and while a Rhodes Scholar prevented communist domination of the Oxford University Labour Club. In Canada, he played a major role in removing communist influence from the labour movement.

In the CCF, he took the role of disciplinarian and dealt with internal organizational problems. He helped draft the Winnipeg Declaration, which moderated the CCF&#x27;s economic policies to include acceptance of capitalism, albeit subject to stringent government regulation. As the United Steelworkers of America (USW)&#x27;s legal counsel in Canada, he helped them take over the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (Mine-Mill). His involvement with the USW also led to a central role in the creation of the Canadian Labour Congress in 1956.

The Lewis family has been active in socialist politics since the turn of the twentieth century, starting with David Lewis&#x27;s father&#x27;s involvement in the Bund in Russia, continuing with David, and followed by his eldest son, Stephen Lewis, who led the Ontario NDP from 1970 until 1978. When David was elected the NDP&#x27;s national leader in 1971, he and Stephen became one of the first father-and-son-teams to simultaneously head Canadian political parties.

==Early life==

===The Bund and Jewish life in the Pale===
David Losz was born in the Russian Empire sometime after Svisloch&#x27;s first snowfall in October 1909 to Moishe Losz and his wife Rose (née Lazarovitch). His official birth date of June 23 was the one he gave the immigration officer when he arrived in Canada. Lewis&#x27;s political activism began in the &quot;shtetl&quot; he lived in until 1921. Svisloch was located in the Pale of Settlement, the westernmost region of the Russian Empire, in what is now Belarus. After World War I, it became a Polish border town, occasionally occupied by the Soviet Union during the Polish-Soviet War of the early 1920s. Jewish people were in the majority, numbering 3,500 out of Svisloch&#x27;s 4,500 residents. Unlike many of the other shtetls in the Pale, it had an industrial economy based on tanning. Its semi-urban industrial population was receptive to social democratic politics and the labour movement, as embodied by the Jewish Labour Bund.

Moishe (or Moshe) Losz was Svisloch&#x27;s Bund Chairman. The Bund was an outlawed socialist party that called for overthrowing the Tsar, equality for all, and national rights for the Jewish community; it functioned both as a political party and labour movement. Lewis spent his formative years immersed in its culture and philosophy. The Bund&#x27;s membership, although mostly ethnically Jewish, was secular humanist in practice.

Moishe and David were influenced by the Bund&#x27;s political pragmatism, embodied in its maxim that &quot;It is better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain a purist.&quot; David would bring this philosophy to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and New Democratic Party (NDP); in clashes between the parties&#x27; &quot;ideological missionaries and the power pragmatists when internal debates raged about policy or action&quot;, he was in the latter camp.

When the Russian Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War were at their fiercest, in the summer of 1920, Poland invaded, and the Red Russian Bolshevik army counter-attacked. The Bolsheviks reached the Svisloch border in July 1920. Moishe Losz openly opposed the Bolsheviks and would later be jailed by them for his opposition. When the Polish army recaptured Svisloch on August 25, 1920, they executed five Jewish citizens as &quot;spies&quot;. Unsafe under either regime and with his family&#x27;s future prospects bleak, Moishe left for Canada in May 1921, to work in his brother-in-law&#x27;s Montreal clothing factory. By August, he saved enough money to send for his family, including David and his siblings, Charlie and Doris.

David Lewis was a secular Jew, as was Moishe. However, his maternal grandfather, Usher Lazarovitch, was religious and, in the brief period between May and August 1921 before David emigrated, gave his grandson the only real religious training he would ever receive. David did not actively take part in a religious service again until his granddaughter Ilana&#x27;s Bat Mitzvah in the late 1970s. In practice, the Lewis family, including David, his wife Sophie, and their children Janet, Nina, Stephen, and Michael, were atheists.

===Early life in Canada===

The family came to Canada by boat and landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia in Autumn 1921. They then went by rail to Montreal to meet Moishe Lewis. David Lewis was a native Yiddish speaker and understood very little English. He learned it by buying a copy of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; and a Yiddish-English dictionary. A Welsh teacher at Fairmount Public School, where Lewis was a student, helped him learn English but also passed on his Welsh accent.

Lewis entered Baron Byng High School in September 1924. He soon became friends with A.M. (Abe) Klein, who became one of Canada&#x27;s leading poets. He also met Irving Layton, another future prominent Canadian writer, to whom he acted as a political mentor. Baron Byng High School was predominantly Jewish because it was in the heart of Montreal&#x27;s non-affluent Jewish community, and was ghetto-like because Jews were forbidden from attending many high schools.

Besides poets, at high school, Lewis met Sophie Carson, who eventually became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family. Her father did not approve of Lewis, because he was a recent immigrant to Canada, and in Carson&#x27;s father&#x27;s opinion had little to no possibility of success.

After high school, Lewis spent five years at McGill University in Montreal: four in arts and one in law. While there, he helped found the Montreal branch of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League. He gave lectures sponsored by this anti-communist socialist club, and was its nominal leader. One of his favourite professors was Canadian humorist and noted Conservative party proponent, Stephen Leacock, whom Lewis liked more for his personality than for his discipline and economics.

In his third year, Lewis founded &quot;The McGilliad&quot; campus magazine. It published many of his anti-communist views, though the December 1930 issue included an article he wrote expressing his approval of the Russian Revolution and calling for a greater understanding of the Soviet Union; throughout his career, he would attack communism, but would always have sympathy for the 1917 revolutionaries. Also at McGill, Lewis met and worked with prominent Canadian socialists like F. R. Scott, Eugene Forsey, J. King Gordon, and Frank Underhill. He would work with all of them again in the 1940s and 50s in the CCF.

==Rhodes Scholarship and Oxford==
With Scott&#x27;s encouragement, Lewis applied for a Rhodes Scholarship during his first year at law school. The interviews for the Quebec representative were conducted in Montreal. The examining board included the then-president of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), Sir Edward Beatty. In response to a question about what he would do if he became prime minister, Lewis stated that he would nationalize the CPR. Despite this answer and his socialist views in general, his responses to the board&#x27;s cross-examination satisfied them that he was not a communist, and they awarded him the scholarship.

===Political involvement===
When David Lewis entered Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1932, he immediately took a leadership role in the university&#x27;s socialist-labour circles. Michael Foot, the future leader of the British Labour Party, mentioned in an interview that Lewis was, 

When Lewis came to Oxford, the Labour Club was a tame organization adhering to Christian activism, or genteel socialist theories like those expressed by R.H. Tawney in his book &quot;The Acquisitive Society&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s modified Bundist interpretation of Marxism, which Smith labels &quot;Parliamentary Marxism&quot;, ignited renewed interest in the club after the disappointment of Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government.

The Oxford newspaper &quot;Isis&quot; noted Lewis&#x27;s leadership ability at this early stage in his career. In its February 7, 1934, issue, while Lewis was president, they wrote of the club: &quot;The energy of these University Socialists is almost unbelievable. If the Socialist movement as a whole is anything like as active as they are, then a socialist victory at the next election is inevitable.&quot;

In February 1934, British fascist William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw) visited Oxford. Lewis and future Ontario CCF leader Ted Jolliffe organized a noisy protest by planting Labour Club members in the dance hall where Joyce was speaking and having groups of two and three of them leave at a time, making much noise on the creaking wooden floors. They were successful in drowning out Joyce, and he did not complete his speech. Afterward, a street fight erupted between Joyce&#x27;s Blackshirt supporters and members of the Labour Club, including Lewis.

Lewis prevented the communists from making inroads at Oxford. Ted Jolliffe stated &quot;there was a difference between his speeches at the Union and his speeches at the Labour Club. His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious ... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else&#x27;s, I think, explains the failure of the Communists to make headway there. There were so many naive people around who could have been taken in.&quot; He increased the Labour Club&#x27;s membership by three-quarters by the time he left.

In accordance with Bundism, Lewis rejected violent revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Bund insisted that the revolution should be through democratic means, as Marx had judged possible in the late 1860s, and that democracy should prevail afterward. Influenced by Fabianism, Lewis became an incrementalist in his approach to replacing non-socialist governments. As Lewis biographer Cameron Smith points out:

Lewis was a prominent figure in the British Labour Party, which, in emphasizing parliamentary action and organizational prowess, took an approach similar to the Bund&#x27;s. Upon his 1935 graduation, the party offered him a candidacy in a safe seat in the British House of Commons. This left Lewis with a difficult decision: whether to stay in England or go home to Canada. If he had stayed in England, he likely would have been a partner in a prominent London law firm associated with Stafford Cripps and become a cabinet minister the next time Labour formed a government. Cripps, then a prominent barrister and Labour Party official, was grooming Lewis to be Prime Minister. Lewis&#x27;s other choice was to return to Montreal and help build the fledgling Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), with no guarantee of success. A personal note from J. S. Woodsworth, dated June 19, 1935, asked Lewis to take this latter option; in the end, he did.

===Oxford Union===

Besides his political involvement, Lewis was active with the Oxford Union, probably the most prestigious and important debating club in the English-speaking world. His first debate, in January 1933, was on the resolution &quot;That the British Empire is a menace to International good will&quot;; Lewis was one of the participants for the &quot;Aye&quot; side. They lost.

The February 9, 1933, debate brought Lewis some level of early prominence. The resolution was &quot;That this House will under no circumstances fight for its King or Country&quot; and was so controversial that it was news around the British Empire and beyond. Lewis again spoke for the &quot;Aye&quot; side. They won overwhelmingly and caused a newspaper uproar throughout the Empire. &quot;The Times&quot; of London entered the fray by pooh-poohing those who took the Union and their motion seriously.

Lewis became a member of the Union&#x27;s Library Committee on March 9, 1933, and its treasurer in March 1934. After two failed attempts, he was narrowly elected president in late November 1934. He was president during the Hilary term, from the beginning of January until the end of April 1935. &quot;The Isis&quot; commented that &quot;... David Lewis ... will be, beyond question, the least Oxonian person ever to the lead the Society. In appearance, background, and intellectual outlook he is a grim antithesis to all the suave, slightly delicate young men who for generations have sat on the Union rostrum ...&quot;

==CCF National Secretary==

===Return to Canada===

Sophie Carson had accompanied Lewis to Oxford, and they wed on August 15, 1935, shortly after their return. The wedding took place in his parents&#x27; home; though a rabbi officiated, most traditional Jewish practices were not observed.

In 1935, David Lewis became the National Secretary of the CCF. As Smith puts it:

Into this political whirlwind stepped David. A centralist in a nation that was decentralizing. A socialist in a country that voted solidly capitalist. A campaigner for a party with no money, facing two parties each of which was big, powerful, and affluent. A professional, in a party of amateurs who mostly thought of themselves as a movement, not a party. An anti-Communist at a time when Canadian Communists were about to enter their heyday. A publicist seeking a unified voice for a party riven with dissent. An organizer whose leader, J.S. Woodsworth, really didn&#x27;t believe in the organization, thinking that the CCF should remain a loosely knit, co-operative association and believed this so implicitly that when it came time to appoint Lewis full-time to the job of the national secretary [in 1938] he resisted, fearing the CCF would lose its spontaneity.

That Lewis not only survived but prevailed is a testament to his skill and perseverance.
Most of the founders of the CCF – including Woodsworth, Tommy Douglas, M. J. Coldwell, and Stanley Knowles, – were informed by the Social Gospel, to which Lewis, with his Marxist socialism balanced by the Bund&#x27;s democratic principles, felt an affinity. Both the Bund and the Social Gospel were focused on the material present rather than the afterlife. Both called on people to change their environment for the better rather than hoping that God might do it for them. Social justice, the brotherhood of man, and moral self-improvement were common to both.

It became obvious after the October 1937 Ontario election that the CCF needed an image change; it was seen by the electorate as too far left. F. R. Scott pointed this out to Lewis in a letter, recommended moderating some of the party&#x27;s policies, and advised that &quot;... in the political arena we must find our friends among the near right.&quot;

In August 1938, Lewis quit his job at the Ottawa law firm of Smart and Biggar to work full-time as the CCF National Secretary. His starting salary was $1,200 per year, a low sum of money, even at that time, for a job with so much responsibility.

===Trying to create an organization===

As National Secretary, Lewis emphasized organization over ideology and forging links to unions. He worked to moderate the party&#x27;s image and downplay the Regina Manifesto&#x27;s more radical language, which seemed to scare off moderate voters. The offending language included &quot;No CCF government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning&quot;. Lewis, federal leader M.J. Coldwell, and Clarie Gillis would spend the next 19 years trying to modify this declaration, finally succeeding with the 1956 Winnipeg Declaration.

At the 1944 CCF convention, Lewis won a concession &quot;that even large business could have a place in the party – if they behave.&quot; Rather than opposing all private enterprise, Lewis was concerned with preventing monopoly capitalism. He passed a resolution reading &quot;The socialization of large-scale enterprise, however, does not mean taking over every private business. Where private business shows no signs of becoming a monopoly, operates efficiently under decent working conditions, and does not operate to the detriment of the Canadian people, it will be given every opportunity to function, to provide a fair rate of return, and to make its contribution to the nation&#x27;s wealth.&quot; This resolution allowed for a mixed-economy that left most jobs in the private sphere.

Lewis did not share the desire of some members to keep the CCF &quot;ideologically pure&quot;, and adhered to the Bundist belief that &quot;it was better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain &#x27;purist&#x27;.&quot; However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments, saying &quot;... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. If what we say and do will blunt or harm our purpose ... then we are saying and doing a false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true ... When, in heaven&#x27;s name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where the purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences.&quot;

David Lewis was the party&#x27;s &quot;heavy&quot;, which did not help his popularity among CCF members, but after witnessing what he considered to be the European left&#x27;s self-destruction in the 1930s, he was quick to end self-immolating tactics or policies. He would tolerate some criticism of the party by its members, but when he believed that it rose to self-mutilation, he suppressed it ruthlessly. This was most apparent when Lewis attacked and discredited Frank Underhill and his handling of Woodsworth House. Early in Lewis&#x27;s career, Underhill was one of his mentors; this did not matter when Woodsworth House was stricken with financial difficulties in the late 1940s. Lewis was quick to blame and then discharged Underhill and the rest of the Woodsworth executive of their responsibilities. It was an unfortunate event that cost the CCF in the academic and intelligentsia world. To sum up Lewis&#x27;s reign, discipline and solidarity were paramount. There had to be limited to discussion and tolerance of dissenting views.

===&quot;Make This Your Canada&quot;===

In 1943, Lewis co-wrote &quot;Make This Your Canada&quot; with F. R. Scott, then the CCF&#x27;s National Chairman. The book&#x27;s main argument was that national economic planning had proven itself during wartime with the King government&#x27;s imposition of wage and price controls through the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. Lewis and Scott further argued that its wartime success could translate to peacetime, and that Canada should adopt a mixed economy. They also called for public ownership of key economic sectors, and for the burden to be placed on private companies to demonstrate that they could manage an industry more effectively in the private sector than the government could in the public sector. The book also outlined the history of the CCF up to that time and explained the party&#x27;s decision-making process. By Canadian standards, the book was popular, and sold over 25,000 copies in its first year of publication.

===1943 Cartier by-election===

Lewis first ran for the CCF in the 1940 federal election in York West. He placed a distant third, receiving 8,330 fewer votes than the second-place Liberal candidate, Chris J. Bennett. Despite his poor showing in his first election, the party asked Lewis to run in the 1943 by-election in the Montreal, Quebec, federal riding of Cartier, made vacant by the death of Peter Bercovitch. Lewis&#x27;s opponents included Fred Rose of the communist Labor–Progressive Party. It was a vicious campaign, immortalized by A. M. Klein in an uncompleted novel called &quot;Come the Revolution&quot;. The novel was broadcast in the 1980s on Lister Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Ideas&quot; programme on CBC Radio One. If the Communist rhetoric could be believed, &quot;Lewis was a Fascist done up in brown.&quot;

Rose won and became the only (as of 2013), Communist, to sit in the House of Commons. Lewis placed fourth. The sizable Jewish vote mostly went to Rose. The leftist &quot;common front&quot; punished Lewis by supporting Rose, who was seen to be of the community; Lewis lived in Ottawa at the time. It took Lewis many years to recover from this campaign, and its reverberation coloured Lewis&#x27;s decision on where to run.

===1945 elections: disappointment and defeat===

The Canadian federal and the Ontario elections of 1945 were possibly the most crucial to Canada in the 20th century. They took place at the beginning of the welfare state, and the elections would set the course of political thought to the end of the century and beyond. The year was a disaster for the CCF, both nationally and in Ontario. It never fully recovered, and in 1961 would dissolve and become the New Democratic Party. As NDP strategist and historian Gerald Caplan put it: &quot;June 4, and June 11, 1945, proved to be black days in CCF annals: socialism was effectively removed from the Canadian political agenda.&quot;

The anti-socialist crusade by the Ontario Conservative Party, mostly credited to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) special investigative branch&#x27;s agent D-208 (Captain William J. Osborne-Dempster) and the Conservative propagandists Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, diminished the CCF&#x27;s initially favourable position: the September 1943 Gallup poll showed the CCF leading nationally with 29 percent support, with the Liberals and Conservatives tied for second place at 28 percent. By April 1945, the CCF was down to 20 percent nationally, and on election day it received only 16 percent.

Another factor in the CCF&#x27;s defeat was the unofficial coalition between the Liberal Party of Canada and the communist Labor-Progressive Party. It guaranteed a split in the left-of-centre vote.

Lewis ran in Hamilton West instead of the CCF-friendly Winnipeg North riding that had elected CCF and Labour Party candidates since the 1920s and had a substantial Jewish population. Historians and activists disagree on Lewis&#x27;s reasons for doing so, but Caplan suggests that the shock of the Cartier election probably made him reluctant to fight another intense campaign against a Jewish Communist candidate. Whatever his reasons, he was soundly defeated. In the 1949 federal election, Lewis ran again in the Hamilton area, in the riding of Wentworth. He lost again, placing a relatively distant third.

===Fighting Communist influence===

The 1945 defeats were partially the result of an alliance between the Liberals and the communist Labor–Progressive Party (LPP). The LPP focused in on CCF-held seats, deliberately splitting the vote, and declared a &quot;Liberal–Labour&quot; coalition on May 29, 1944. They declared open warfare on the CCF in 1944, with spokesman John Weir stating in the LPP&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot; newspaper that &quot;a resounding defeat of the CCF at the polls must be [their] the main objective.&quot;

The Canadian Congress of Labour (CCL) supported the CCF, but the Trades and Labour Congress (TLC) refused to officially endorse them. This lack of unity between the two main Canadian umbrella labour organizations hurt the CCF, and was part of the Liberal–Communist alliance: TLC president Percey Berough was a Liberal, and vice-president Pat Sullivan was a Communist.

In the Ontario provincial election, the communists urged trade union members to vote for the right-wing Conservative George Drew rather than the CCF.

Lewis and Charles Millard, of the Canadian Congress of Labour, decided to purge organized labour&#x27;s decision-making bodies of communists. Their first target was the Sudbury, Ontario, CCF riding association and its affiliated International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (Mine-Mill) Local 598. However, Local 598 was not under Communist control: out of 11,000 dues-paying members, fewer than 100 were communists. Over the next twenty years, a fierce and ultimately successful battle was waged by Millard&#x27;s United Steel Workers of America (USW) to take over Local 598.

The attacks on the Sudbury CCF were even more costly, at least in terms of voter support. Sudbury&#x27;s Bob Carlin was one of the few CCF Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) to survive the Drew government&#x27;s 1945 landslide victory. Carlin had been part of Ted Jolliffe&#x27;s team that had orchestrated the CCF&#x27;s 1943 breakthrough but was first and foremost a union man. He was a long-time labour organizer, going back to 1916 and the predecessor to the Mine-Mill: the Western Federation of Miners. Carlin was loyal to his union, in whose service he had spent ten years, and to the men and woman who helped build it, regardless of their political affiliation; this made him unpopular with the CCF establishment in both Toronto and Ottawa.

Millard, Jolliffe, and Lewis did not directly accuse Carlin of being a communist. Instead, they attacked him for not dealing with communists in Local 598, which was built by both communists and CCFers (with the latter firmly in control of the executive). Lewis and Jolliffe made the case to expel him from the Ontario CCF caucus at a Toronto special meeting of the CCF executive and the legislative caucus on April 13, 1948. In essence, Carlin became a casualty of Steel&#x27;s plans to raid Mine-Mill. The CCF lost the seat in the 1948 Ontario election, placing fourth. The Conservatives won the seat and Carlin, as an independent, finished a close second. It was not until the CCF became the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Mine-Mill versus USW war was over, in 1967, that another social democrat – Elie Martel in Sudbury East – was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from the city.

Lewis and Millard&#x27;s crusade to limit communist influence received an unexpected boost from the Soviet Union, in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1956 denunciation of Stalinism. In his &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot;, delivered to a closed session of the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for his cult of personality and his regime for &quot;violation of Leninist norms of legality&quot;. When the excesses of Stalin&#x27;s regime were exposed, it caused a split in the communist movement in Canada and permanently weakened it. By the end of 1956, the LPP&#x27;s influence in the trade union movement and politics was spent.

==Private labour law practice==

Lewis resigned as national secretary in 1950 and moved to Toronto to practise law in partnership with Ted Jolliffe. He became the chief legal advisor to the USW&#x27;s Canadian division, and assisted them in their organizing efforts and battles with the Mine-Mill union. Lewis focused on his law practice for the next five years. In his first year, he paid more in income tax than he had earned annually as CCF National Secretary.

He bought his first house, in the Bathurst Street – St. Clair Avenue West area of Toronto, during this period. After his father Moishe died in 1951, his mother Rose moved into the 95 Burnside Drive Lewis home from Montreal. This is the home where his son Stephen Lewis would spend his teenage years, and the other three children would grow up.

===Winnipeg Declaration and the New Party===

Although he gave-up day-to-day running of the party&#x27;s organization, he stayed on the national executive as the English-speaking vice-president from 1950 to 1954. After four years of comparatively limited involvement with CCF internal politics, Lewis became the party&#x27;s national chairman, by winning the election to replace Percy Wright. He, along with Lorne Ingle, the person that replaced him as national secretary in 1950, became the main drafters of the &quot;1956 Winnipeg Declaration&quot;, which replaced the &quot;Regina Manifesto&quot;. The lead-up to the August 1956 CCF convention had Lewis working full-time in his labour practice, including work on the merger of the Canadian Congress of Labour and the Trades and Labour Congress to form the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), and putting in long hours organizing the committee that wrote the &quot;Declaration&quot;. He collapsed in his office in May 1956; after administering several tests for a possible cardiac condition, the doctors concluded that Lewis collapsed of exhaustion. He stayed in bed for a week and recovered enough to help the &quot;Declaration&quot; pass ten weeks later. The Winnipeg convention was the CCF&#x27;s swan song. Even with the &quot;Declaration&quot;&#x27;s modified tone, which removed state planning and nationalization of industry as central tenets of the party&#x27;s platform, the CCF suffered a crippling defeat in the 1958 federal election, which became known as the &quot;Diefenbaker sweep&quot;. It was obvious to Lewis, Coldwell and the rest of the CCF executive that the CCF could not continue as it was, and, with the co-operation of the CLC, they started exploring how to broaden its appeal.

===CCF President===

In 1958, Lewis worked closely with the CLC&#x27;s president, Claude Jodoin, and the CLC&#x27;s executive vice-president Stanley Knowles to merge the labour and social-democratic movements into a new party. Coldwell did not want to continue as the party&#x27;s national leader, because he lost his parliamentary seat in the election. Lewis persuaded him to stay on until the new party was formed. Lewis was elected party president at the July 1958 convention in Montreal, which also endorsed a motion for the executive and National Council to &quot;enter into discussions with Canadian Labour Congress&quot; and other like-minded groups to lay the groundwork for a new party.

===Leadership succession crisis===

By 1960, progress was being made in creating a new party, but Lewis had to again act as the disciplinarian. Since Coldwell lost his seat, he was constantly considering resignation but was repeatedly dissuaded by the party. With Coldwell lacking a seat, the CCF caucus chose Hazen Argue as its leader in the House of Commons. During the lead-up to the 1960 CCF convention, Argue was pressing Coldwell to step down. This leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party. Lewis and the rest of the new party&#x27;s organizers opposed Argue&#x27;s manoeuvres and wanted Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas to be the new party&#x27;s first leader. To prevent their plans from derailing, David Lewis attempted to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party&#x27;s leadership. He was unsuccessful. There was a split between the parliamentary caucus and the party executive on the convention floor. Coldwell quit and Argue replaced him as a leader.

In July 1961, the CCF became the New Democratic Party (NDP). They elected Tommy Douglas as their leader by a convincing 1391 to 380 margin over Argue. Six months later, Argue quit the party and crossed the floor to join the Liberals.

In the mid-1970s, David Lewis reflected on this incident and he concluded that he had not handled the leadership transition well:

==1962–1971: Member of Parliament for York South==

Two days after the end of the NDP&#x27;s 1961 founding convention, Tommy Douglas wrote a letter to Sophie Lewis, David&#x27;s wife, telling her that David must run in the next election. Lewis decided to run in his home riding of York South, which was concurrently held provincially, in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, by the NDP&#x27;s Ontario leader, Donald C. MacDonald.

Diefenbaker&#x27;s government had to call an election sometime in 1962, so there was time to plan Lewis&#x27;s campaign. He had two campaign managers: his son Stephen and Gerry Caplan. One of their main strategies was to gain votes in the riding&#x27;s affluent Jewish enclave in the Village of Forest Hill. Lewis, however, was perceived by the Jewish community as an outsider because he did not take part in community events or belong to a synagogue. His opposition to the creation of the state of Israel, a result of his Bundist politics, also did not sit well with the mostly Zionist community. It took extra effort on Stephen&#x27;s and Caplan&#x27;s parts to convince community members that David was a legitimate Jewish voice and that he would not harm their businesses. Besides resistance from the Jewish community, in his role as party national vice-president David Lewis had to tackle the impending doctors&#x27; strike in Saskatchewan, the result of the CCF government&#x27;s implementation of Medicare. He called the province&#x27;s doctors &quot;blackmailers&quot; for suggesting such a strike. Lewis also appeared on one of the NDP&#x27;s few national television spots. He appeared on the national CTV Television Network with Walter Pitman to present the NDP&#x27;s platform on a planned economy, in a conversation-style election broadcast. On June 18, 1962, Lewis was elected in York South, and finally became an MP. Since Tommy Douglas lost in his seat, Lewis was considered the front-runner to become house leader until Douglas entered the house in an October by-election.

Lewis&#x27;s first term as MP was a short one, as Diefenbaker&#x27;s minority government was defeated in the April 8, 1963, general election. Lewis lost in Forest Hill, as his support among its Jewish community evaporated and returned to the Liberals, who were seen as best able to contain the Social Credit Party, which was perceived to be anti-Semitic. This was only a temporary set-back. With Diefenbaker in opposition (and unlikely to resurrect the coalition in Quebec that gave him his majority in 1958) and Social Credit a diminished force, Lewis returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 general election. He was re-elected in the 1968 election, and became the NDP leader in the House of Commons after Douglas lost his seat. At the 1969 Winnipeg National Convention, Douglas announced that he intended to step down as leader by 1971, which meant that Lewis became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader in the interim.

The October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis put Lewis in the spotlight, as he was the only NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Douglas were opposed to the October 16 implementation of the War Measures Act. The Act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in-force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. Sixteen of the 20 members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons. They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it. Lewis stated at a press scrum that day: &quot;The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act.&quot; About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield went so far as to say that, &quot;Quite frankly, I&#x27;ve admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time...I don&#x27;t brood about it. I&#x27;m not proud of it.&quot;

==Leader of the NDP==

Stephen Lewis was coming into his own during this period. In 1963, at the age of 26, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Following the engineered 1970 resignation of Donald C. MacDonald, Stephen was elected leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. During the early-to-mid-1970s, the father-and-son-team led the two largest sections of the NDP.

In February 1968, Stephen Lewis, as a supposed representative of the Ontario NDP legislative caucus, asked the 63-year-old Tommy Douglas to step down as leader so that a younger person could take over. Donald C. MacDonald stated that Lewis was not representing the caucus, but acting on his own. Though Douglas was taken aback by the suggestion, his defeat in the ensuing election bolstered Stephen&#x27;s case and on October 28, 1969, Douglas announced that he would step down as leader before the NDP&#x27;s 1971 convention.

David Lewis ran to succeed Douglas as national leader. The 1971 leadership convention was a tumultuous affair. A new generation of NDP activists known as The Waffle proposed many controversial resolutions, including nationalization of all natural resource industries and support for Quebec Sovereignty. It took the combined efforts of the NDP establishment—and the sizable trade union delegation—to vote down these resolutions, which caused many bitter debates and sharply divided the convention. Lewis, as the leading establishment figure, won the party&#x27;s leadership on April 24 in a surprisingly close race that required four ballots before he could claim victory over the Waffle&#x27;s James Laxer. Laxer had been prominently featured in media coverage leading up to and during the convention. Lewis&#x27;s perceived heavy-handedness in dealing with The Waffle at this and previous conventions made him many enemies, as had his involvement in most of the CCF and NDP&#x27;s internal conflicts during the previous 36 years. Many members who had felt his wrath as party disciplinarian plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle, as they were soundly defeated at the convention, and that he made no promises to them. He also warned the party&#x27;s Quebec wing that they could continue to theorize about possible self-determination resolutions, but that come election time they must pledge themselves to the party&#x27;s newly confirmed federalist policy. He did not purge the Waffle from the NDP, but left it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972, when the party&#x27;s Ontario wing resolved to disband the Waffle or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order.

David Lewis led the NDP through the 1972 federal election, during which he uttered his best-known quotation, calling Canadian corporations &quot;corporate welfare bums&quot;, a term also used in the title of his 1972 book &quot;Louder Voices: The Corporate Welfare Bums&quot;. This election campaign also employed the first dedicated plane for the NDP leader&#x27;s tour, dubbed &quot;Bum Air&quot; by reporters, because it was a slow, twin-engine, turbo-prop driven Handley Page Dart Herald. In previous campaigns, the party&#x27;s leader, Tommy Douglas, had to use commercial Air Canada flights to get around during the election, with few people in his entourage.

The 1972 election returned a Liberal minority government and elected the greatest number of NDP MPs until the 1980 election, and left the NDP holding the balance of power until 1974. The NDP propped up Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government in exchange for the implementation of NDP proposals such as the creation of Petro-Canada as a crown corporation. Lewis wanted to topple the government in a vote of no-confidence as early as possible because he saw no strategic advantage to support the Trudeau government: he believed that Trudeau would get the credit if a program was well-received and that the NDP would be vilified if it was unpopular.

In hindsight, Lewis&#x27;s no-win evaluation of the situation appears correct: the party would not be rewarded for its efforts by the electorate. In the 1974 election, the NDP were reduced to 16 seats. Lewis lost his seat, leading him to resign as party leader in 1975. It was revealed immediately after the election that he had been battling leukemia for about two years; he had reportedly kept everyone, including his family, unaware of his condition.

==Final years==

Lewis became a professor at the Institute of Canadian Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa during this time. In 1978, as a travel correspondent for &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, Lewis visited Svisloch one last time, and noted that, &quot;not one Jew now lives there.&quot; The Holocaust wiped out the town&#x27;s Jewish community, and with it his extended family.

He completed the first volume, of a planned two, of his memoirs, &quot;The Good Fight: Political Memoirs 1909–1958&quot; in 1981. He died of leukemia shortly thereafter, on May 23, 1981, in Ottawa. He is the father of Stephen Lewis, a former Ontario NDP leader and was the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa post-political career. His other son, Michael Lewis, was a former Ontario NDP Secretary and a leading organizer in the NDP. He is also the father of Janet Solberg, president of the Ontario NDP in the 1980s. His other twin daughter is Nina Libeskind, the wife and business partner of architect Daniel Libeskind. Stephen&#x27;s son, broadcaster Avram (Avi) Lewis, is his grandson. In 2010, his granddaughter-in-law Naomi Klein, gave the inaugural David Lewis Lecture, sponsored by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

==Awards and honours==

In December 1976, Lewis was named as a Companion of the Order of Canada and was invested into it on April 20, 1977. He was appointed to the highest level of the Order of Canada in &quot;recognition of the contributions he has made to Labour and social reform and the deep concern he has had over the years for his adopted country.&quot; David Lewis Public School in Scarborough, Ontario is named in his honour.

<text>The Church of God of Prophecy (COGOP) is a Holiness Pentecostal Christian Church. It is one of six &quot;Church of God&quot; bodies headquartered in Cleveland, Tennessee that arose from a small meeting of believers who gathered at the Holiness Church at Camp Creek near the Tennessee/North Carolina border on Saturday, June 13, 1903.
The Church of God of Prophecy has congregations and missions in over 135 countries, with a membership of over 1,500,000. Membership in the United States as of 2010 was 98,407 in 1,743 churches. Ministries of the Church include homes for children, bible training institutes, youth camps, ministerial aid, and Spirit and Life Seminary. The Church operates Fields of the Wood, a Bible theme park and popular tourist attraction, near Murphy, North Carolina.
==History==
The Church has, in the past, internally referred to itself as &quot;Church of God&quot; in its worship services. Many past official records utilized that name with the parenthetical qualifier of &quot;(Cleveland, Tennessee)&quot;. However, the more generic moniker fell out of common official use many decades ago. There was controversy over which side of the division had the legal right to the name and who was really the true &quot;Church of God&quot;. This (COGOP) body was definitely a part of the original &quot;Church of God&quot;, over which originally A. J. Tomlinson was the general overseer. In 1923, these two Churches became divided over church idealism (specifically, the matter of church polity) which could not be compromised on or resolved by either side, (the one Church of God would be governed by twelve men in the upper room &quot;called elders&quot; and the other Church would be governed and overseen by one man A.J. Tomlinson). In 1952, after lengthy litigation over the use of the simple name &quot;Church of God&quot;, a court in Bradley County, Tennessee ordered that the Tomlinson faction add &quot;of Prophecy&quot; to their name, because this &quot;Church of God&quot; then viewed itself as the New Testament Church of the last days, or so the court reasoned. Thereafter, the Church uses the appellation &quot;Church of God of Prophecy&quot;. Both groups claim the same history up to the year 1923.
===Early history===
In August 1886, Elder Richard Spurling (1810-1891), an ordained Baptist minister associated with the Latter Rain movement, rejected the dominant Landmark Baptist views of the Church, which he believed were too credal and exclusive. With seven members from Holly Springs and Pleasant Hill Missionary Baptist churches in Monroe County, Tennessee, and Cherokee County, North Carolina, he organized the Christian Union. These Christians hoped to free themselves from man-made creeds and unite on the principles of the New Testament. In September 1886, Spurling&#x27;s son, Richard G. Spurling Jr (1857-1935), was ordained as pastor of the Christian Union congregation. He also formed two other congregations. The father and son shared a vision to restore the Church.

Around 1895, a revival under the preaching of B. H. Irwin swept into the area. Richard G. Spurling accepted Irwin&#x27;s teachings on holiness, but was wary of the extreme direction in which he felt the movement was headed. The Shearer Schoolhouse Revival of 1896 helped to move Spurling&#x27;s group away from the general faith and practice of Baptists and toward that of the Holiness Movement. In 1902, R. G. Spurling influenced a Holiness group led by W. F. Bryant to form the Holiness Church at Camp Creek, North Carolina. Spurling was elected pastor and Bryant was ordained as a deacon. The next year brought into the Church an energetic and powerful leader, Ambrose Jessup Tomlinson, or A. J. Tomlinson. Tomlinson, a former Quaker, who experienced an inner change of regeneration and sanctification, came in 1899 to the Appalachian region as a missionary. He became acquainted with Spurling and Bryant and caught Spurling&#x27;s vision of the restoration of the Church. He united with the Church at Camp Creek on June 13, 1903, and soon became the acknowledged leader.

New churches were organized in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. The first annual meeting of all the churches was held in 1906 in Cherokee County, North Carolina, and the name &quot;Church of God&quot; was adopted in 1907. Tomlinson professed a baptism of the Holy Ghost experience in 1908, which firmly established the Church as part of the Pentecostal Movement. This took place under the preaching of Gaston B. Cashwell, a minister who was very influential in bringing Pentecostalism to North Carolina, the Appalachians and the east coast. Tomlinson was elected general overseer of the Church of God in 1909.

The present day Church of God of Prophecy officially accepts the Bible as God&#x27;s holy word, inspired, inerrant, and infallible and as the highest authority in matters of faith and practice. This expression, &quot;rightly divided&quot;, is evidence that the early 20th century organizers of the &quot;Church of God of Prophecy&quot; were heavily influenced by the works of C. I. Scofield, in particular his writings on dispensationalism.

In 1923, the Church of God was disrupted by matters concerning finance and governance, leading to a division. The largest body resulting from the division exists as the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee). What is now known as the Church of God of Prophecy was the smaller body and remained under the leadership of Tomlinson. Tomlinson continued as general overseer over this Church until his death in 1943.

The presbytery believed that God directed them to bring the younger son, Milton Ambrose Tomlinson (1906–1995), forward to leadership. The General Assembly confirmed this in 1944, and he became the general overseer of the Church. The additional phrase &quot;of Prophecy&quot; was added to the name on May 2, 1952. Under Milton Tomlinson&#x27;s leadership, the Church began the White Wing Publishing House, White Wing Christian Bookstores, The Voice of Salvation radio and TV programs, and numerous other ministries. In 1961, the publishers at the White Wing Publishing House and Press considered M. A. Tomlinson to be &quot;God&#x27;s spokesman&quot;, a belief which was shared among the Church at large. M. A. Tomlinson served as general overseer until 1990. Past educational institutions include the Church of God of Prophecy Bible Training Institute, and also Tomlinson College, both of which are now defunct. Both institutions were located in Cleveland, Tennessee.

===Schisms===
In 1943–44, Homer Aubrey Tomlinson, older brother of Milton, left to form a denomination headquartered in Queens Village, Queens. This denomination would become the Church of God (Huntsville, Alabama), when it relocated its headquarters after Homer&#x27;s death in 1968. Homer founded the Theocratic Party and was its candidate for U.S. president in 1952 and 1964. He was a Bishop who planned to crown himself King of the World or &quot;King of All Nations of Men&quot; in Jerusalem on October 7, 1966.

In 1957, Grady R. Kent went out of the Church of God of Prophecy and formed the Church of God (Jerusalem Acres), which adopted its name in 1958.

When the Church elected a new general overseer in 1990 after the retirement of Milton Tomlinson, the stage was set for another division. A small body left in 1993 after a division in the Church led to another Church being formed by a group that felt that its congregation was led by God to appoint Robert J. Pruitt as their general overseer. That group is commonly known as The Church of God (Charleston, Tennessee).

===Recent history===
&quot;Exclusivity&quot; has never been an official Church teaching. However, some ministers have subscribed to such teachings, and still hold them today, separate from the Church&#x27;s official stance on the subject. The Church is working hard to correct the negative impression that this assumption has caused. In 2004, a joint cooperative world evangelism effort began between the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) and the Church of God of Prophecy. This, and other efforts, are steps toward healing the effects of the long-time hurt and mistrust between the two organizations. 

In 2006, at the Church&#x27;s bi-annual General Assembly, General Overseer Fred Fisher retired from this leadership role and a new general overseer was appointed, Randy Howard. After a week-long discussion between members at this same General Assembly, the Church changed its long-standing interpretation of acceptable reasons for divorce and remarriage. The Church agreed that people who had been divorced (for the cause of fornication) and were later remarried may become members of the Church of God of Prophecy. There was an overwhelming majority, made up of several thousand voting members, that voted for the change.

Bishop Howard announced his resignation on April 26, 2013, for a season of spiritual renewal and to focus on personal issues within his family. With Howard&#x27;s resignation, the general presbyters of the Church were Bishops David Browder (Asia and Oceania), Sam Clements (North America), Clayton Endecott (Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Middle East), Benjamin Feliz (Central America, Mexico and Spanish-speaking Caribbean), Clayton Martin (Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Isles), Stephen Masilela (Africa) and Gabriel Vidal (South America) served as a plurality of leadership until before the International Assembly convened in Orlando, Florida in late July 2014.

During the pre-Assembly meeting of International Presbytery, after days of prayer and discussion, it was discerned that Bishop Sam N. Clements, North America General Presbyter, was God&#x27;s choice as the sixth general overseer of the Church of God of Prophecy. Bishop Clements began his term on September 1, 2014. The current Presiding Bishop is Tim Coalter, who was selected at the 2022 International Assembly.

==Beliefs==
From early on, the Church of God of Prophecy has claimed belief in principles based in the Bible, and continually researches scriptures through various committees. At the Eleventh Annual Assembly in 1915, the general overseer stated in his annual address, &quot;We do not claim to have reached perfection; we are only searching for it.&quot; The following doctrinal insights reflect current findings through the Church of God of Prophecy International Assembly. The leadership acknowledges through various studies and writings that there are human limits of spiritual comprehension. Therefore, the organization continually studies for greater knowledge of God&#x27;s design for the church and attempts to better align itself to the New Testament teachings of Christianity in order to continually grow and develop into the &quot;fullness of the stature of Christ&quot;.

Henceforth, following each Assembly, the Biblical Doctrine and Polity Committee would be expected to make any further adjustments that would be required in light of this mandate to reflect Assembly decisions.

From its beginnings, the Church of God of Prophecy has asserted that its beliefs are based on &quot;the whole Bible rightly divided&quot;. Water baptism by immersion, the Lord&#x27;s Supper, and feet washing are held to be ordinances of the Church. Individuals must profess to be born again in order to become members, as well as maintain a consistent Christian witness. This group does not maintain that an individual must be a member of the Church to be a Christian.

The Church of God of Prophecy is firm in its commitment to orthodox Christian belief. It affirms that there is one God eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It believes in the deity of Christ, his virgin birth, sinless life, the physical miracles he performed, his atoning death upon the cross, his bodily resurrection, his ascension to the right hand of the Father, and his personal return in power and glory at his second coming. It professes that regeneration by the Holy Spirit is essential for the salvation of sinful mankind.

It teaches the belief that the sinner is brought to an awareness of the need for salvation through the convicting work of the Holy Spirit. It teaches the belief that in sanctification by the blood of Christ, one is made holy. It affirms the present, active ministry of the Holy Spirit who guides the Church and by whose indwelling and empowerment that individuals are able to live godly lives and render effective service to God and others. It teaches the oneness and ultimate unity of believers for which our Lord prayed, and that this should be visibly displayed &quot;that the world may know, see, and believe&quot; God&#x27;s glory, the coming of His Son, and the great love He has for His people (John 17:20-23). The organization is committed to the sanctity of the marriage bond and the importance of strong, loving Christian families.

The Church teaches (and many members believe) that it embraces all biblical doctrines as taught in the New Testament. The particular interpretations of the teachings (primarily from the New Testament) were originally introduced in a series of 29 sermons delivered on the Voice of Salvation radio program by M. A. Tomlinson. Several doctrinal beliefs of the Church became summarized by the 29 Prominent Teachings.

<doc id="394220" wikidata="Q269826" url="?curid=394220" title="Alice of Champagne">
<text>Alice of Champagne (; 1193 – 1246) was the queen consort of Cyprus from 1210 to 1218, regent of Cyprus from 1218 to 1232, and regent of Jerusalem from 1243 to 1246. She was the eldest daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and Count Henry II of Champagne. In 1210, Alice married her stepbrother King Hugh I of Cyprus, receiving the County of Jaffa as her dowry. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1218, she assumed the regency for their infant son, King Henry I, but her maternal uncle Philip of Ibelin became the actual head of state administration as bailli (governor). 

Alice began seeking contacts within her father&#x27;s counties in France to bolster her claim to Champagne and Brie against her cousin, Theobald IV, but the kings of France never acknowledged her claim. After a dispute with Philip of Ibelin, she left the island in 1223. She married Bohemond, heir apparent to the Principality of Antioch and the County of Tripoli, but their marriage was annulled on grounds of consanguinity—they were too closely related according to canon law. In 1229, she laid claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the infant Conrad (the son of her niece Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II) who was absent from the kingdom, but the High Court of Jerusalem rejected her claim. When her son reached the age of majority in 1232, Alice abdicated her regency and departed for France to claim Champagne and Brie. She subsequently renounced her claim and returned to the Holy Land.

In 1240, she married Raoul of Nesle who was about half of her age at the time. The High Court of Jerusalem proclaimed Alice and her husband regents for Conrad in 1243, but their power was only nominal. Raoul of Nesle left the kingdom, and Alice, before the end of the year. Alice retained the regency until her death in 1246.

== Childhood ==
Alice, born around 1193, was the eldest daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and her third husband, Count Henry II of Champagne. The Kingdom of Jerusalem had been established by western European knights in Palestine in the aftermath of the First Crusade in 1100 but it was nearly annihilated by the Egyptian sultan Saladin in 1187–89. The kingdom and two other Crusader states—the Principality of Antioch and County of Tripoli—survived in a small strip along the eastern Mediterranean coast due to the Third Crusade, proclaimed by the papacy for their rescue, but the city of Jerusalem remained in Muslim hands. Isabella&#x27;s first marriage with the Jerusalemite aristocrat Humphrey IV of Toron had been annulled in preparation for her second marriage with an ambitious crusader leader, Conrad of Montferrat. As the only surviving child of her father, King Amalric of Jerusalem, Isabella had a strong claim to rule the remnants of the kingdom along with her new husband. Their joint rule did not last long for Conrad was murdered by two members of the Assassins in 1192. Urged by her subjects, the widowed Isabella quickly agreed to remarry. As a nephew of both Richard I of England and Philip II of France, Henry was an ideal candidate. Before joining the Third Crusade, he had bequeathed his French counties of Champagne and Brie to his brother, Theobald III, should he die without issue.

Henry married Isabella in May 1192 and assumed power in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, although he was never crowned king. They had two children who survived childhood: Alice, and her younger sister Philippa. Henry and Aimery of Lusignan, the lord of Cyprus, agreed that Aimery&#x27;s eldest surviving son was to marry Henry&#x27;s eldest surviving daughter, and Henry promised the County of Jaffa as her dowry. Henry died unexpectedly when he fell from a tower in his palace in Acre on 10 September 1197. A month later, his widow chose Aimery, who had recently been crowned the first king of Cyprus, as her fourth husband. Although Alice and Philippa survived their father, the French king Philip II invested their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving the two counties to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of Blanche of Navarre, who was the child&#x27;s mother. Theobald IV&#x27;s position was not secure because Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge their uncle&#x27;s posthumous son&#x27;s claim to his counties.

Aimery died on 1 April 1205 and was followed by Alice&#x27;s mother, Queen Isabella, before the end of the year. Maria, Isabella&#x27;s fourteen-year-old daughter with Conrad of Montferrat, ascended the throne while Isabella&#x27;s half-brother, John of Ibelin, assumed the regency for the young queen. As Maria&#x27;s eldest half-sister, Alice became heir presumptive, and she was placed under the guardianship of their maternal grandmother Maria Komnene.


 
 

== Cyprus ==

=== Queen consort ===

Maria Komnene conducted the negotiations for the marriage of Alice to King Hugh I of Cyprus, Aimery of Lusignan&#x27;s eldest surviving son and successor, in accordance with the agreement their fathers had reached. Since the marriage of Alice&#x27;s mother and Hugh I&#x27;s father made them step-siblings, a special dispensation was needed. This was granted by Pope Innocent III. Blanche paid part of her niece&#x27;s dowry to ensure that she would stay in Cyprus rather than attempt to lay claim to Champagne and Brie. To strengthen her son&#x27;s position, Blanche also persuaded Philip II of France in 1209 to promise that he would not allow anyone to challenge Theobald IV&#x27;s right to the two counties before Theobald reached the age of majority.

Alice and Hugh I married in the first half of 1210, with Alice receiving the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. They had two daughters, Maria and Isabella, and a son, Henry. Alice&#x27;s sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa&#x27;s behalf in 1213, leading to a succession war. Blanche soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice&#x27;s and Philippa&#x27;s mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey of Toron had not been annulled in accordance with canon law. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the Pope&#x27;s order concluded that both Humphrey and Isabella had protested against the annulment of their marriage, implying that her two subsequent marriages were void. If the inquiry had been completed, Queen Maria, Alice and Philippa could have lost their claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, for children born to parents whose marriage was declared void were regarded as illegitimate. Probably to avoid such undesirable political consequences, as the historian Bernard Hamilton notes, the investigation was not &quot;pursued with any degree of rigour&quot;.

=== Regent ===
After Hugh I died in Tripoli on 10 January 1218, Alice assumed the regency for their infant son, Henry I, and installed her uncle Philip of Ibelin as bailli. The administration of the kingdom was, according to the contemporaneous lawyer Philip of Novara, arranged by Hugh I on his deathbed. Another contemporaneous source, the &quot;Chronicle of Ernoul and Bernard the Treasurer&quot; suggests that Alice acted independently. Finally, a papal letter of February 1226 states that the Cypriote nobles, barons, knights, and people elected Ibelin as bailli. Pope Honorius III instructed his legate, Cardinal Pelagius Galvani, to protect Alice and her children against &quot;certain men inspired with wicked fervour&quot;, suggesting that Alice faced some opposition at the beginning of her regency. Her regency set a precedent, for no queen mothers had previously assumed regency for an underage son in Jerusalem or Cyprus, but the appointment of her uncle as the actual governor indicates a deep-seated aversion to female rulers.

In 1218, Alice&#x27;s brother-in-law Erard of Ramerupt renounced his wife&#x27;s claim to Champagne in return for compensation, even promising to support Theobald IV against Alice. This led Alice to send envoys to Champagne, prompting her aunt Blanche to make a complaint against her at the Holy See on 23 June 1219. Alice entered into negotiations with Pelagius about the status of the Church in Cyprus where the native Greek population adhered to the autocephalous (or autonomous) local Orthodox Church. Either under the influence of her Byzantine grandmother, or for political considerations, Alice protected the interests of the Orthodox clergy. She achieved a compromise at an assembly of the Cypriote aristocrats and Catholic prelates in Pelagius&#x27;s presence in October 1220. On her demand, the Orthodox priests were exempted from taxation, and she also prevented the abolition of the Orthodox hierarchy on the island, as the Pope permitted the appointment of Orthodox suffragan bishops in the four Catholic dioceses. The compromise also included obligating the Cypriote aristocrats to pay a tithe for the maintencance of the Latin hierarchy, which they opposed. On the other hand, the Holy See demanded that the estates the nobles had seized from the Orthodox Church be transferred to Catholic clerics. A new agreement, reached in 1222, sanctioned the , as it neither freed the noblemen from the tithe nor prescribed the restoration of Church property.

Rumours that Alice would marry William II of Dampierre, constable of Champagne, spread in France in 1223. In August that year, Pope Honorius forbade the marriage at Theobald IV&#x27;s behest, emphasizing that Alice and William were closely related. According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Holy Land&quot; section of the &quot;Gestes des Chiprois&quot;, Alice &quot;spent the revenues of the kingdom liberally&quot;, resulting in conflict with Philip of Ibelin. She furiously accused Ibelin of disrespecting her wishes and voluntarily retired from Cyprus in 1224. She settled in either Tripoli or Jaffa, but her children remained on the island.

== In exile ==

=== Conflicts ===

Around late 1224 or early 1225, Alice married Bohemond, heir apparent to Antioch and Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Archbishop Eustorgius of Nicosia to inquire into the legality of the marriage, probably on the request of Cypriote barons who did not want her new husband to intervene in the government of Cyprus. Alice, who continued to regard herself as regent, was planning to appoint Bohemond as bailli, but the Cypriote barons resisted her plan, saying that Bohemond would probably mistreat their young king. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, but the High Court—the supreme tribunal in the kingdom—ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli for the duration of her son&#x27;s minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter Gavin of Chenichy visited Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who had decided to launch the Sixth Crusade for the Holy Land.

Emperor Frederick II regarded himself as overlord of Cyprus. as his father Emperor Henry VI had sent the royal crown to Aimery of Lusignan. On Philip of Ibelin&#x27;s initiative, the High Court arranged the coronation of the eight-year-old Henry without the Emperor&#x27;s consent in 1225, drawing Frederick&#x27;s ire. The marriage of Frederick and Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem, daughter and successor of Alice&#x27;s half-sister Maria, had been decided in 1223. Alice attended the coronation of Isabella in Tyre before she departed for Italy to meet Frederick in 1225. Frederick persuaded the dying Pope Honorius to delegate two new judges (the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem Gerold of Lausanne and the bishop of Acre Jacques de Vitry) to investigate the marriage of Alice and Bohemond, accusing Eustorgius of partiality in the couple&#x27;s favour. Honorius III&#x27;s decision was confirmed by his successor, Pope Gregory IX. Alice and her husband came to Limassol in summer 1227 intending to meet Frederick, but illness prevented Frederick from departing Italy. Alice and Bohemond&#x27;s marriage was subsequently annulled but the circumstances of the process are unknown.

When Philip of Ibelin died in 1227, the High Court appointed his brother, John of Ibelin, as bailli without consulting the Emperor or Alice. Frederick departed for Cyprus, landing at Limassol on 21 July 1228. Upon arriving, he ordered John of Ibelin to account for the administration of royal revenue, but John refused, stating that the revenue had been paid to Alice. Frederick dismissed Ibelin and forced Henry to swear fealty to him. He also demanded an oath of fealty from the Cypriote noblemen, but they were only willing to submit to him as their king&#x27;s overlord, declaring that they only owed fealty to Alice who served as regent to their king. Frederick made Aimery Barlais, Gavin of Chenichy, Amaury of Beisan, Hugh of Gibelet and William of Rivet baillis of Cyprus without Alice&#x27;s consent before departing for Italy in May 1229. Duke Peter I of Brittany declared that he wanted to marry Alice, but this was refused on 29 May by Pope Gregory because of consanguinity.

=== Claims ===

In autumn 1229, Alice arrived in Acre, whereupon she laid claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the infant Conrad, son and successor of her niece Isabella II. She appeared before the High Court of Jerusalem declaring that Conrad had forfeited his right to the kingdom as he had failed to personally take possession of it within a year and a day of the death of his mother, as required by a local law regarding fiefs inherited by a non resident heir. The members of the High Court, who had recently pledged fealty to Conrad&#x27;s father, rejected Alice&#x27;s claim, emphasizing that Conrad was a minor. However, they sent their envoys to Frederick in Foggia, Italy, requesting that he send Conrad to the Holy Land within a year and a day. Frederick informed the envoys in May 1230 that he would do what he thought best.

When her son reached the age of majority on 3 May 1232, Alice abdicated from her regency, which she had retained despite having left Cyprus. She went to France to personally advance her claim for Champagne and Brie in 1233, but only one local nobleman, Renier II of Nogent, supported her. Theobald IV of Champagne later captured the fortress of Nogent and confiscated Renier&#x27;s estates.

At Theobald&#x27;s request, Pope Gregory urged Alice to come to Rome, because the legitimacy of her parents&#x27; marriage was to be investigated. Alice refused to appear before the papal tribunal, but concluded a treaty with Theobald in September 1234, renouncing her claim to Champagne and Brie for 40,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot; and estates yielding a yearly income of 2,000 &quot;livres&quot;. In the agreement with Theobald, she also stated that she would not erect fortresses in her estates in Champagne.

Alice returned to the Holy Land in 1233. She probably renounced the County of Jaffa in favor of her son-in-law, Walter IV of Brienne, who married her daughter, Mary, in the same year, because Walter was styled Count of Jaffa from there on. Alice (who was about 46) married Ralph of Nesle, a man in his twenties who had come to the Holy Land during her cousin Theobald&#x27;s crusade.

== Jerusalem ==

In 1242, the citizens of Tyre offered the barons opposed to Frederick&#x27;s rule in Jerusalem (Balian of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut, and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Toron) their assistance against Richard Filangieri, who ruled Tyre on Frederick&#x27;s behalf. Marsilio Zorzi, the bailli of the Venetian community in the Holy Land offered naval support to the coalition. Conrad reached the age of majority on 25 April 1243. The members of the High Court approached Philip of Novara, a noted jurist, for a legal opinion, and he concluded that Frederick could no longer administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem on his son&#x27;s behalf. Novara also argued that Alice and her husband were entitled to rule the kingdom as regent for the absent Conrad because she was his closest relative who lived in the Holy Land. The members of the High Court, the representatives of the clergy, the Military Orders and the Italian communities held a joint assembly where Alice and Ralph of Nesle were proclaimed regents on 5 June. She agreed that Balian of Ibelin and Philip of Montfort would keep all royal castles in the kingdom.

Frederick&#x27;s troops were expelled from Tyre in mid-July. Ralph of Nesle sought to retain control of the town, but was rejected by Ibelin and Montfort. Ibelin and Montfort also refused to transfer Acre to him and Alice, causing Nesle to depart the Holy Land in anger, stating that he was only a &quot;shadow” ruler in the kingdom. Frederick refused to acknowledge Alice as regent and sent Thomas of Acerra to administer the kingdom on Conrad&#x27;s behalf, but Thomas was prevented from landing in the kingdom, instead disembarking in the County of Tripoli.

Jerusalem became a &quot;sort of feudal republic&quot; administered by the most powerful barons. Alice nonetheless exercised royal prerogatives: she annulled grants and appointments that Frederick had made after the death of Queen Isabella II, and Philipp of Novara received a money-fief of 1,000 bezants from her. Despite these exercises of royal power, she also stated before Marsilio Zorzi, who demanded the confirmation of the rights of the Venetian commune in Tyre, that she could not restore rights that had been withdrawn by a monarch because &quot;she was not the lawful ruler of the kingdom&quot;. When Alice died in 1246, her son, Henry of Cyprus, succeeded her as regent of the Kingdom of Jerusalem although her younger half-sister Melisende also claimed the regency.

<text>Hugh I (; (Oúgos); 1194/1195 – 10 January 1218) succeeded to the throne of Cyprus on 1 April 1205, underage upon the death of his elderly father Aimery, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem. His mother was Eschiva of Ibelin, heiress of that branch of Ibelins who had held Bethsan and Ramleh.

== Early life ==

Hugh was the youngest of the three sons of Aimery of Lusignan, Lord of Cyprus, and his first wife, Eschiva of Ibelin. He was born between around 1194/1195 and 1199. Shortly after his birth, he lost his mother. Hugh and his two brothers, Guy and John, were engaged to the three daughters of Isabella I of Jerusalem (Maria of Montferrat, Alice of Champagne and Philippa of Champagne), as a sign of reconciliation between Cyprus and Jerusalem. Hugh was his father&#x27;s only son to survive childhood.

== Reign ==

=== Minority ===

Hugh was still a minor when his father died on 1 April 1205. The High Court of Cyprus appointed his brother-in-law, Walter of Montbéliard, regent. Walter was also made Hugh&#x27;s guardian, thus he seized the custody of both the kingdom and the young monarch. Walter intervened in a conflict over the possession of Satalia between the Sultanate of Rum and an adventurer, Aldobrandino, on the latter&#x27;s behalf, but the Seldjuks captured the town with the assistance of the local Greeks.

=== Ruler of Cyprus ===

Hugh reached the age of majority in September 1210. He called Walter of Montbéliard to account, stating that Walter had kept him in a &quot;state of deprivation&quot; during his minority. He demanded 240,000 white bezants from the ex-regent, claiming that 200,000 bezants had been in the royal treasury when his father died and he had spent 40,000 bezants to secure his own subsistence. Instead of rendering an account, Walter left Cyprus with the assistance of Bohemond IV of Antioch. John of Brienne, the new king of Jerusalem, gave shelter to Walter. In a letter sent to Pope Innocent III, Walter stated that Hugh had expelled him from Cyprus and confiscated his property without the judgement of the High Court.

Hugh concluded a treaty with the Seldjuq Sultan of Rum which guaranteed that the merchants from Cyprus and Rum could safely run their business in both countries. He gave his sister, Helvis, in marriage to Bohemond IV&#x27;s rival, Raymond-Roupen, although she had been married to Odo of Dampierre (who was Walter of Montbéliard&#x27;s kinsman). Odo of Dampierre urged the pope to intervene and prevent the new marriage. Hugh supported John of Brienne&#x27;s opponents, according to a 1213 letter of Innocent III. The pope also rebuked him for capturing John of Brienne&#x27;s vassals whom Muslim ships had forced to land at Cyprus.

Hugh especially favored the Knights Hospitaller. He exempted them of duties levied on goods bought or sold in Cyprus already at the beginning of his personal rule. He sent reinforcements to them in Syria in 1214. 

In September 1217, Hugh joined King Andrew II of Hungary on the Fifth Crusade in raiding Muslim lands in Galilee. On his return, he stopped in Tripoli to attend the wedding of his half-sister Melisende on 10 January 1218, but he became ill during the celebration and died. He was buried at the Church of the Hospitallers at Tripoli, then at the Church of the Hospitallers at Nicosia.

== Family ==
Hugh married Alice of Champagne, the elder daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and her third husband, Count Henry II of Champagne. Alice was the heir presumptive to Isabella&#x27;s successor, Queen Maria, at the time of the marriage. The marriage was celebrated before Hugh reached the age of majority in 1210, according to the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot;. Two other chronicles (&quot;Annales de Terre Sainte&quot; and &quot;Les gestes des Chiprois&quot;) misdated the marriage to 1211.

The couple had three children:
# Mary (before March 1215 – 5 July 1251 or 1253), who married Count Walter IV of Brienne in 1233 ( – murdered at Cairo, 1244). She became mother of Hugh of Brienne (c. 1240–1296), who was Count of Lecce and Brienne and pursued the kingdoms in Levant for himself when his uncle Henry&#x27;s line began to go extinct. This claim fell to her grandson Walter V of Brienne and his descendants. They are the heirs-general of King Aimery of Cyprus and Hugh I himself.
# Isabella (1216–1264), who married Henry of Antioch, and who was the mother of Hugh III of Cyprus and ancestress of the line named later as the second dynasty of Lusignan.
# Henry I (1217–1253), namesake of his maternal grandfather, who became King of Cyprus upon his father&#x27;s death in 1218, with his mother acting as regent.

<text>Larry Kenneth Robert Walker (born December 1, 1966) is a Canadian former professional baseball right fielder. During his 17-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played with the Montreal Expos, Colorado Rockies, and St. Louis Cardinals. In 1997, he became the only player in major league history to register both a .700 slugging percentage (SLG) and 30 stolen bases in the same season, on his way to winning the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player Award (MVP). The first player in more than 60 years to record a batting average of .360 in three consecutive seasons from 1997 to 1999, Walker also won three NL batting championships. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2007, and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in the Class of 2009, and was named the 13th-greatest sporting figure from Canada by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1999. In 2020, Walker was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Widely considered a five-tool player of prodigious athleticism and instincts, Walker hit for both average and power, combined with well-above-average speed, defense and throwing strength and accuracy. He was recognized as the top Canadian athlete in 1998 with the Lou Marsh Trophy. Other honors include five MLB All-Star selections, seven Gold Glove Awards, three Silver Slugger Awards, and nine Tip O&#x27;Neill Awards. His career SLG of .565 ranks 12th all time. Walker is one of only 19 hitters in history to accomplish a .300 batting average, .400 on-base percentage (OBP), and .500 SLG with at least 5,000 plate appearances, and one of six whose careers began after 1960. Considering advanced metrics, he is one of only three players in history to rank within the top 100 of each of batting runs, base-running runs, and defensive runs saved; the others are Barry Bonds and Willie Mays.

Raised in the Greater Vancouver area of British Columbia, Walker spent his youth playing street hockey with consuming NHL goaltender aspirations. That dream never materialized; however, the Expos saw his baseball potential and signed him in 1984. By 1990, Walker became their starting right fielder, propelling them to the majors&#x27; best record in 1994 when that year&#x27;s strike stopped their first serious World Series run. He signed with the Rockies as a free agent following the season, and, during a six-year period starting in 1997, was the major league batting leader three times while finishing second in the NL twice. In 1997, he also led the league in home runs, OBP, and SLG, while joining the 30–30 club, registering 12 outfield assists and leading his position with four double plays turned; he won the NL MVP Award that year. Desiring a trade to a contending team, Walker was sent by the Rockies to St. Louis in the middle of their 105-win season of 2004 where he made his first World Series appearance while tying or setting three Cardinals postseason records. He announced his retirement from playing baseball after Game 6 of the 2005 National League Championship Series.

Following his playing career, Walker has served as a guest instructor for the Cardinals, and, since 2009, has coached the Canadian national team. In that time, Team Canada has competed in three World Baseball Classic (WBC) tournaments, and twice at the Pan American Games, winning consecutive gold medals in 2011 and 2015.

==Early life and amateur career==

Larry Kenneth Robert Walker Jr. was born on December 1, 1966, in Maple Ridge, a suburb of Greater Vancouver in British Columbia, to Larry Sr., and Mary Walker, both of Scottish descent. Larry Jr. was the youngest of four boys, Barry, Carey and Gary. The five men often played together in a fastpitch softball league, frequently all in the same starting lineup. Walker grew up passing much of his free time playing street hockey, especially as part of a group of boys in the backyard and driveway of another boy named Rick Herbert. In that group was future Hockey Hall of Famer Cam Neely, who became one of Walker&#x27;s close friends. Walker dreamed of a career in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a goaltender, only casually playing an occasional baseball game during the summer.

He played hockey and volleyball at Maple Ridge Secondary School; baseball was not offered. One of his boyhood idols was NHL goalie Billy Smith, winner of four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980−83 during Walker&#x27;s teenage years. Walker sharpened his skills by blocking shots against Neely. Brother Carey, also a goaltender, was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 12th round of the 1977 NHL Draft.

===Junior hockey===
At the age of 16, Walker was offered tryouts with Junior A teams in Regina, Saskatchewan, and Kelowna, British Columbia, however, he was cut from both teams, while Herbert made the Regina Pats. Other offers Walker received were from Western Hockey League teams, including Swift Current, which he toured. After seeing substandard conditions there, he decided that he no longer wanted to pursue hockey once he arrived at the rink, and subsequently focused his athletic aspirations on baseball.

===Amateur baseball===
The popularity of baseball in Canada during Walker&#x27;s youth was minuscule in contrast to the following he would help spawn related to his later success with the Montreal Expos. Previously, Canadian baseball luminaries included Tip O&#x27;Neill, the first Canadian to win a Triple Crown back in 1887, and Ferguson Jenkins, Canada&#x27;s first selectee to the American Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991. It was Walker who would help dramatically increase the profile of the sport in a hockey-mad nation. Part of the factor are Canada&#x27;s short summers, which make it more challenging to play outdoors than in the United States. Recalled Walker later in his major league career, &quot;I&#x27;d never seen a forkball, never seen a slider. I didn&#x27;t know they existed. I had never really seen a good curveball. In Canada, as a kid, we&#x27;d play 10 baseball games a year. Fifteen, tops. Some pitchers had a thing they&#x27;d call a spinner, but nothing like this. Baseball just wasn&#x27;t big. The weather was against it. Nobody ever played baseball thinking about making the major leagues.&quot; He was also unaware of many of the rules, attesting to his lack of experience playing when he turned a professional.

In 1984, Walker played for the Coquitlam Reds of the British Columbia Premier Baseball League. He was selected to join the Canadian team at the 1984 World Youth Championships in Kindersley, Saskatchewan. At that tournament, he caught the eye of Expos scouting director Jim Fanning after hitting a home run with a wooden bat, in contrast to all the other players who were using metal bats. Fanning signed Walker for $1,500 (USD, $ today) as an amateur free agent owing to his relative lack of experience playing organized baseball. At that time, Canadians were not eligible to be selected through the Major League Baseball draft. While the Expos perceived Walker to be very athletic, they decided that he was very raw, and that he did not initially warrant rating as a top prospect.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Walker attended Expos minor league spring training camp in 1985 and it was clear from the outset that pitching was a complete mystery to him. He swung indiscriminately, expecting every pitch to be a fastball, including at ones that bounced 10 feet in front of, or on, home plate. When the camp ended, there was still about one and a half months remaining until the start of the season, so he returned home, seeking additional preparation. He joined a fast-pitch softball team sponsored by a bowling alley, but this brought little relief. The Expos assigned Walker to the Utica Blue Sox of the New York–Penn League, a Class A Short Season league, for his first season of professional baseball. He played third base and first base. Although he could hit fastballs well, he continued to have difficulties with strike zone judgment and the more sophisticated pitches, finishing with a .223 batting average and two home runs. Manager Ken Brett, who was less preoccupied with fielding a winning team than giving the athletic players the opportunity to experiment, allowed Walker to stay in the lineup as a regular in part because of his willingness to learn. Walker heard that he would be released, but Brett recalled that &quot;he was just so tough,&quot; and marveled at his &quot;outstanding athleticism, freakish hand-eye coordination and mental approach;&quot; he also had 12 stolen bases. Expos hitting coach Ralph Rowe successfully lobbied for him to be sent to the Florida Instructional League (FIL). With further tutelage, relentless preparation, and sheer hard work, Walker soon developed into one of the Expos&#x27; best young prospects. He continued to make annual off-season returns to FIL in West Palm Beach to calibrate and refine his approach, and eventually made his home there.

In his second professional season in 1986, Walker achieved his breakthrough while playing for two A-level clubs, the Burlington Expos and West Palm Beach Expos. His combined totals in 133 games included a .288 average, .397 on-base percentage (OBP), .602 slugging percentage (SLG), 87 runs scored, 19 doubles, 11 triples, 33 home runs, 90 runs batted in (RBI) and 18 stolen bases. Walker caught the eye of his fellow Canadians, and, as a 19-year-old minor leaguer, had acquired an entourage of Canadian reporters. &quot;I know now I can hit the ball. I have a lot of confidence even though I still strike out a lot. I swing at too many bad pitches,&quot; he contemplated. Asserted West Palm Beach manager Felipe Alou, &quot;If he keeps improving the way he has the last 12 months, there&#x27;s no telling what he could do. You have a kid with his kind of potential, they don&#x27;t last long in the minor leagues.&quot; Meanwhile, the club clinched the Florida State League South division, winning by two games over the Fort Lauderdale Yankees.

After promotion to Jacksonville Expos of the Southern League in 1987, Walker totaled a .287 average, .383 OBP, .534 SLG, 91 runs, 26 home runs, 24 stolen bases and three times caught stealing. He won his first Tip O&#x27;Neill Award that year as the top Canadian baseball player. He missed the 1988 season after undergoing reconstructive knee surgery for an injury while playing in the Mexican Pacific League. The Expos moved him up to Indianapolis Indians of the Triple-A International League in 1989. There, he played in 114 games and batted .270 with 68 runs scored, 12 home runs, 36 stolen bases and six times caught stealing.

===Montreal Expos===
====Major league debut (1989)====
Walker made his debut with the Montreal Expos on August 16, 1989. He walked twice in the game while recording a single in his first official at bat, off Mike LaCoss of the San Francisco Giants. Walker&#x27;s first season totals included a .170 batting average, .264 OBP, and .170 SLG in 56 plate appearances. Montreal fans gave him the nickname &quot;Booger.&quot;

====Early major league career (1990−1992)====
 Ranked No. 42 on &quot;Baseball America&quot;&#x27;s list of top prospects in advance of the 1990 season, the Expos never optioned Walker back to the minor leagues, instead, he became their regular right fielder following Hubie Brooks&#x27; departure via free agency, patrolling an outfield which at times featured Tim Raines and Marquis Grissom, both ultra-fleet basestealers and well-accomplished hitters. Walker batted .241 with a .326 OBP and .434 SLG for a 112 OPS+ in his first full season. He also hit 19 home runs with 21 stolen bases and produced 3.4 Wins Above Replacement (WAR). He placed seventh in the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year balloting. As the top native Canadians to ever play for the Expos, Walker became a role model for thousands of young Canadian baseball players.

Over the next four seasons, Walker combined to hit .293/.366/.501 for a 134 OPS+, with an average of 20 home runs, 19 stolen bases, excellent defense (+10 runs per year) and 4.5 WAR. He became another in the succession of Montreal&#x27;s great outfielders. He never appeared in more than 143 games, spending significant time on the disabled list (DL) in 1991 and 1993 while playing on Olympic Stadium&#x27;s notorious artificial turf, a product perceived to create excessive stress on knees, accelerating injuries to players like the former Expos star outfielder Andre Dawson. In 1991, Walker appeared in 39 games at first base, including Dennis Martínez&#x27;s perfect game on July 28, a 2−0 victory versus the Los Angeles Dodgers. In that contest, Walker hit the only RBI, driving in Dave Martinez on a triple, and scored the second run on an error. He was involved in 17 of 27 outs: 16 putouts and one assist.

Approximately one-quarter of the way through the 1992 season, the Expos made Alou manager at the major league level, touching off a period of heightened success lasting the rest of Walker&#x27;s time in Montreal. In the July 4 contest versus the San Diego Padres, he fielded a ground ball to right field and threw out speedy shortstop Tony Fernández at first base. Walker was named to his first All-Star Game, debuting as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning for Greg Maddux and producing a single. Walker was also selected to his first Home Run Derby, hitting four home runs. For the 1992 season, Walker batted .301/.353/.506 and rated 10 runs above average while fielding, with 16 outfield assists, for a total value of 5.4 WAR. He won his first both of a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Award, and became the first and only Canadian to win the Expos Player of the Year award. Walker received consideration for the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) for the first time in 1992, finishing fifth in the National League.

====1993−94 seasons====
The 1993 Expos reached a rare watermark, winning 94 games. A core of immense young talent propelled the club, including Grissom and a rising Moisés Alou (son of manager Felipe) complementing Walker in the outfield, Ken Hill and Jeff Fassero in the starting rotation and John Wetteland and Mel Rojas anchoring the bullpen. An improbable finish to the regular season including a record of 30−9 catapulted Montreal to a second-place standing with a 94−68 record, thus nearly matching the club record of 95 wins set in 1979. Now the delight of Montreal fans who had watched the team struggle through decades of futility, excitement in Canada began to crescendo over the prospect of the first-ever all-Canadian World Series, as the Toronto Blue Jays were defending champions in 1993, and repeated that October. Walker batted .265, 22 home runs, and 86 RBI, setting then-career highs each of 80 walks, 20 intentional walks, 29 stolen bases, and .371 OBP. He won his second Gold Glove Award.

Before the start of the 1994 season, the Expos, seeking to replace departed ace Dennis Martínez in the starting rotation, acquired a young reliever in Pedro Martínez, who the Los Angeles Dodgers had cast doubt over his potential as starter and pitched him out of the bullpen. One amusing moment (video) materialized on April 24 while playing the Dodgers in Los Angeles and Martínez starting. With one out in the third inning, Walker caught a Mike Piazza fly ball and innocently handed it to a young fan, six-year-old Sebastian Napier, thinking it was the third out of the inning. He then quickly noticed that José Offerman, already on base, was running at full speed. Walker managed to retrieve the ball from Napier and throw it back in, but Offerman was held at third base because the ball had gone out of play. Embarrassed, Walker admitted that he &quot;told the little kid that maybe next time I&#x27;ll give him a ball when there are three outs instead of two. Everybody around him was laughing.&quot; Where Offerman was stationed made little difference as Tim Wallach homered on the next pitch from Martínez for two runs. True to his word, when the Expos assumed the field in the bottom half of the fourth inning, Walker gave Napier a signed ball, inducing a standing ovation.

From June 1 forward, Montreal transformed into the dominant club in the National League, going 46−18 until the players&#x27; strike halted the season on August 11. In turn, they produced the most successful season in franchise history in terms of winning percentage (.649) as they attained a major league-best 74−40 record. Walker was suspended four games starting June 24 for inciting a bench-clearing brawl by charging the mound in a game against Pittsburgh. He paced for new levels production in spite of a shoulder injury in late June that confined him to first base for the remainder of the season. He easily accelerated past his previous career highs set in 1992 with a .322 batting average, .394 OBP, and .587 SLG, including an immanency of his first 100-RBI year. He finished with 86 RBI, 151 OPS+, and a league-leading 44 doubles; the latter two figures were also new career-highs. He was sixth in the league in RBI, seventh in WAR (4.7), offensive win % (.739) and OPS+, and eighth in batting and SLG. He placed 11th in the NL MVP voting.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Expos&#x27; transcendent season was that they did so with the second-lowest payroll in baseball. However, as the team lost millions of dollars in revenue from 29 canceled home games and playoffs, general manager Kevin Malone was given orders to drastically reduce payroll. The club dealt away their young stars, including declining to offer arbitration to Walker. As such, he was granted free agency.

===Colorado Rockies===

Walker signed a four-year contract with the Colorado Rockies worth nearly $22.5 million USD ($ million today), the largest agreement since the strike. The average annual value equated to more than $5.6 million ($ million today), up from the $4,025,000 ($ million today) the Expos had paid him the year prior. From Olympic Stadium to Coors Field, Walker transitioned into the most benevolent hitting environment since World War II. Nonetheless, even after mathematically adjusting for stadium and altitude advantages, his production during his Rockie years consistently rivaled other hitters whose accomplishments came in settings of greater difficulty.

====1995−96 seasons====
In his Rockies debut and inaugural game of Coors Field on April 26 versus the New York Mets, Walker doubled three times, including one that tied the score with two outs in the ninth resulting in an 11−9 extra innings win. On May 7, 1995, he hit his 100th career home run versus Hideo Nomo of Los Angeles.

Walker attained new career-highs with 36 home runs and 101 RBI − reaching both 30 home runs and 100 RBI for the first time in his career − in spite of missing 13 games of a season shortened by the strike that had begun the year before. His rate numbers were .306/.381/.607, and as the average club scored 5.4 runs per game, his OPS+ fell about 20 percent from the year before to 131. Walker ranked second in the NL in home runs (tied with Sammy Sosa), slugging, extra base hits (72), total bases (300), at bats per home run (13.7) and hits by pitch (14), third in OPS (.988), and seventh in runs scored (96) and RBI. He placed seventh in the NL MVP voting, his second time in the top ten.

One of a quartet of Rockies players who became known as The Blake Street Bombers, Walker, Dante Bichette, Vinny Castilla and former Expos teammate Andrés Galarraga each contributed at least 30 home runs in 1995. The Rockies simultaneously won the first-ever National League wild card berth under the new postseason format and first playoff appearance in franchise history in just their third season of play. Walker collected three hits in 14 at bats in the National League Division Series (NLDS) versus the Atlanta Braves. He hit his first career postseason home run off Tom Glavine in the sixth inning of a 7−4 Game 2 loss. The Braves defeated the Rockies in four games.

Walker primarily played center field in 1996—54 of 83 total games—in a season cut short by injury. In the May 21 game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he doubled, tripled and hit a pair of two-run home runs to drive in a career-best six runs in a 12–10 win. He set a club record with 13 total bases in one game. The next day, also against the Pirates, he set an MLB record with six consecutive extra base hits. On May 26, Walker was selected for his first MLB Player of the Week Award. He missed more than two months of the 1996 season due to a fractured clavicle that occurred in a collision with an outfield fence. He hit .393 at Coors Field and .142 on the road.

====Most Valuable Player Award (1997)====
The Rockies commenced the 1997 season on the road, and thus Walker started a reversal of his poor fortunes away from Coors. He hit two home runs in the season-opening series against the Reds in Cincinnati, and, on April 5, hit three more versus the Expos in Montreal for his first career three home run game. The second landed near a home-made sign reading &quot;Boogerville.&quot; After the third, fans cheered Walker for the hat-trick in recognition of his former dream of playing hockey professionally. His first week accomplishments included a .440 batting average with six home runs in 25 at bats and the NL Player of the Week Award for the second time on April 6. He concluded the month of April batting .456 with 41 hits, 29 runs scored, 11 home runs, 29 RBI, seven stolen bases, .538 OBP, .911 SLG, and 1.449 OPS. He set major league records for March–April for both OPS—until surpassed by Barry Bonds in 2004—and runs scored—until surpassed by Bryce Harper in 2017. Walker was named NL Player of the Month for the first time.

Walker sat out an interleague game on June 12 versus the Seattle Mariners. Former Expos teammate Randy Johnson, a left-handed pitcher standing and one of the most intimidating players in sports history, was scheduled as the starter. &quot;I faced Randy one time in spring training and he almost killed me,&quot; Walker explained of the rationale. He collected his 1,000th career hit and 108th of the season on June 20 against Andy Ashby of San Diego.

However, the decision to not bat against Johnson instigated a debacle as one of the indelible moments of Walker&#x27;s career one month later in the 1997 All-Star Game. This time, Walker faced Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head. Ever adaptable, Walker placed his batting helmet backwards and switched sides in the batters&#x27; box to stand &quot;right-handed&quot; for one pitch. He ended the at bat by drawing a walk. The incident momentarily drew mirth and laughter from players in both dugouts, fans and announcers, and comparisons to Johnson pitching against John Kruk in the 1993 All-Star Game, in which he also threw over his head. In spite of garnering a reputation of avoiding Johnson, Walker batted .393 (11 hits in 28 at bats) against him in his career, nearly double the rate of all left-handed batters at .199.

During the All-Star break, Walker participated in the Home Run Derby, placing second with 19 home runs. Both he and Tony Gwynn of the Padres, also a selectee that year&#x27;s All-Star Game, were batting near .400, and right fielders for teams in the National League West division. They were jointly interviewed, as batting .400 is one of the most difficult achievements in all of sports. Asked just how challenging it is, Gwynn, known to be a very studious hitter, elaborated with what he later termed a &quot;complete dissertation.&quot; Walker responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about that stuff. I just hit the ball.&quot; While neither player wound up achieving the statistic over any full season, Gwynn won that year&#x27;s National League batting championship and Walker was second.

Continuing his remarkable season, Walker was batting .402 as late as July 17. On September 12, Walker was batting a league-leading .371 with 43 home runs; no National League player had ever simultaneously marshaled those totals. He then experienced another power surge, hitting home runs in four consecutive games – a total of five in that span – including the 199th and 200th of his career in San Diego on September 17. He injured the right elbow while swinging at the pitch that was pre-flight to his 49th home run in the Rockies&#x27; 160th game, forcing him out of the last two games. In spite of Walker&#x27;s magnificent season, the Rockies were unable to capitalize, missing the playoffs with an 83–79 record.

The career season for Walker was 1997, when he hit .366 with 49 home runs, 130 RBI, 208 hits, 143 runs scored, 33 stolen bases, .720 slugging percentage, 1.172 OPS, 409 total bases and 9.8 WAR. He won the NL MVP Award, thus becoming the first Canadian player to win the MVP in Major League Baseball. The home run and stolen base totals placed him in the 30–30 club. He became and remains the only player to have reached at least 30 stolen bases and a slugging percentage of .700 in the same season, the second with at least 45 home runs and 30 stolen bases, and the fifth with 40−30. The 9.8 WAR produced is tied for the 64th-highest single-season total among position players in MLB history, per Baseball-Reference.com. Walker&#x27;s production slotted within four hits and 10 RBI of winning the first batting Triple Crown in 60 years. He led the major leagues in WAR, slugging, OPS, total bases, runs created (187), adjusted batting runs (71), adjusted batting wins (6.7), extra base hits (99), and offensive win % (.857); and the NL in on-base percentage (.452), and at bats per home run (11.6).

Also, Walker&#x27;s 409 total bases were the most in an NL season since Stan Musial gained 429 in 1948, and is tied with Lou Gehrig and Rogers Hornsby for the 18th-highest in MLB history. Walker&#x27;s season marked the 23rd occasion in MLB history a batter reached 400 total bases and the first time in the National League since Hank Aaron&#x27;s 400 in 1959. Combined with 12 outfield assists, and a league-leading of both a .992 fielding percentage and four double plays turned, Walker&#x27;s 1997 season remains one of the finest all-around performances in recent baseball history. Further, he won a series of other awards, including the Players Choice Award for National League Outstanding Player, the &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; Player of the Year Award, his seventh Tip O&#x27;Neill Award, third Gold Glove, second Silver Slugger, and first Rockies Player of the Year Award. In honor of Canada&#x27;s 150th anniversary of Confederation on July 1, 2017, The Sports Network named Walker&#x27;s achievement of the MVP award among the nation&#x27;s most iconic sports moments.

The 49 home runs set a single-season club record for Colorado. Walker&#x27;s production held up well on the road, including nine more home runs than at Coors Field: .346 average, 29 home runs and 62 RBI in 75 games. Other single-season franchise records Walker set in 1997 were WAR, slugging percentage, OPS, runs scored, total bases, adjusted OPS+, offensive win percentage, and at bats per home run.

====First batting title (1998)====
Although he rested the right elbow in the off-season, Walker aggravated the injury while playing golf the following January. The elbow soreness kept him at one home run through April of the 1998 season. He produced a season-high 20-game hitting streak from May 4−25, and the second-longest in the NL, batting .342 in that span, which was actually &quot;worse&quot; than his average at season&#x27;s end. In that streak, Walker hit a pinch hit grand slam on May 6 versus Jerry Spradlin of the Philadelphia Philles. The Rockies placed Walker on the DL for two weeks in June due to the elbow soreness, and he managed to hit .331 through the first half of the season. Walker started in the All-Star Game for the second consecutive season, playing center field and batting seventh. He drew a walk and scored a run.

Immediately following the All-Star break, Walker collected six hits in his first 32 at bats (.188), bringing his average to .314, its lowest since April 5. During a seven-game homestand spanning July 23−28, he produced 15 hits in 27 at bats (.556) with three doubles, two triples, four home runs and nine RBI, raising his average from .319 to .340. He surged from tenth to second place for the batting crown. From August 19 to the end of the season, he hit .440 (78-for-177). He endured back spasms toward the end of the season, starting in nine of the team&#x27;s final 17 games.

Walker produced a .402 second-half batting average. After 1997, he never reached 500 at bats again as various injuries cut short each season. With a .363 batting average, he became the first Canadian-born player to win a major league batting title in the 20th century, the first to do so in the National League, and broke Gwynn&#x27;s streak of four consecutive National League batting championships.

Walker won the prestigious Lou Marsh Trophy in 1998 as Canadian athlete of the year, one year after finishing runner-up to Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve, of which he remarked at the time that he lost &quot;to a car.&quot; Walker also attained the Lionel Conacher Award as the top male Canadian athlete, the ESPY Award for Best Major League Player, and a Tip O&#x27;Neill Award. He also received his fourth Gold Glove.

====1999 season====
Plagued by injuries for the last several years of his career, Walker nevertheless continued to produce. He missed the first week of the 1999 season with a strained rib cage. On April 28, he hit three home runs against the St. Louis Cardinals for his second career three home run game while contributing eight RBI in a 9–7 win. Walker hit safely in 21 consecutive games from April 25−May 19, making that the second occasion since 1987 a reigning batting champion had achieved a hit streak of at least 20 games. On May 19, Walker collected four hits versus the Cincinnati Reds to raise his season average to .431, but the Rockies were on the losing end of a 24−12 final, tied for the fourth-highest run-scoring output in MLB history. For the month of May, Walker batted .392, .647 slugging, and 40 hits in 102 at bats.

From June 18−23, Walker tied Bichette&#x27;s club record by homering in five consecutive games. The following day, Walker tied another club record, held by Galarraga, with his sixth consecutive multi-hit game. In June, Walker played in 25 games, and batted .385, .813 SLG, 10 home runs, 30 RBI, 25 scored, 35 hits, 10 walks, and nine strikeouts. On July 8, Walker hit his 250th career home run versus Chan Ho Park of the Dodgers. Walker batted .326 in July with 15 walks and 10 home runs.

Carrying a .382 first-half average, Walker had batted .390 (189 hits in 484 at bats) from the 1998 All-Star break to the same point in 1999, the equivalent of a full season. He was named to his third consecutive All-Star team. Played at Fenway Park in Boston, he started in right field and batted second. He was one of the strikeout victims of former Expos teammate Pedro Martínez, who became the first to strike out the first three batters in an All-Star Game. In the July 19 contest versus the Oakland Athletics, Walker became the second player to homer into the plaza reserve seating of one of the upper decks in the Oakland Coliseum, following Mark McGwire, who had done so three seasons earlier. On July 27, Walker recorded his 100th and 101st career outfield assists. He hit the game-winning home run August 18 versus John Rocker of Atlanta for his 1,400th career hit. Walker closed his season by hitting safely in 12 consecutive starts, including multiple hits in the final six. Limited to 15 games and 49 plate appearances in September, Walker batted .513 with 20 hits in 39 at bats, 10 runs scored, five doubles, four home runs, 13 RBI, nine walks and two strikeouts.

For the season, Walker batted .379 − setting a Rockies record and the fourth-highest since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941 − while leading the major leagues in batting for a second time. Walker also led the major leagues in offensive win % (.838), on-base percentage (.458), slugging percentage (.710), and OPS (1.168). Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Slash Stat Triple Crown,&quot; he became the seventh player within the previous 60 years to lead the league in each of average, OBP and SLG in the same season, and first since George Brett in 1980. The last NL player to lead the majors in each of the three slash stat categories was Musial in 1943. Walker also hit 37 home runs and 115 RBI in just 438 at bats, stole 11 bases in 15 attempts, and registered 12 outfield assists.

Per the Elias Sports Bureau (ESB), Walker&#x27;s .461 average at Coors is the highest home batting average since ESB began tracking home/road splits in 1974, and 43 points higher than any other player&#x27;s in that span. In 66 games at Coors, Walker also hit .531 OBP, .879 SLG, 26 home runs, 70 RBI, 107 hits, 72 runs, nine stolen bases, 31 walks, and 17 strikeouts in 273 plate appearances. On the road, he batted .286, .894 OPS, 11 home runs and 35 strikeouts. He won his fifth Gold Glove and was selected as Rockies Player of the Year for the second time. He placed 10th in the NL MVP balloting. Following the season, he underwent knee surgery.

Walker produced 10.8 WAR combined in 1998−99 while missing at least 30 games in both seasons, and from 1997−99, he hit .314/.410/.592 ... &quot;away&quot; from Coors Field. His aggregate batting average at .369 in that same time, he became the first player since Al Simmons from 1929–31 to hit at least .360 in each of three consecutive seasons. Walker signed a six-year, $75 million (USD, $ million today) contract extension after the 1999 season. He was named as the ninth top male athlete of Canada&#x27;s Athletes of the 20th Century list compiled in 1999, trailing only Ferguson Jenkins (number seven) among baseball players. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed Walker as the 13th greatest sporting figure in Canadian history in 1999.

====2000−01 seasons====
While missing a major portion of 2000 with a stress fracture in the right elbow, Walker spent two stints on the DL. He recorded an outfield fielder&#x27;s choice on April 16 versus St. Louis, leading to a forceout at second base. On April 19 versus the Arizona Diamondbacks, he collected his 1,448th career hit to pass Jeff Heath as the major&#x27;s all-time hits leader for Canadian-born players. Walker completed his longest hitting streak of the season, at eight games, from April 21−May 1. In that time, he batted .471 (16-for-34) with three home runs and nine RBI. On May 13, the team received diagnostic results revealing he had a stress reaction irritation in his right elbow, and placed him on the DL, in which he missed 23 games. To that point, he was batting .347.

Walker returned from the DL notably weakened, batting .286 over his final 57 games of the season. He homered to drive in his 888th career run on July 1 versus the Oakland Athletics, passing Heath for the all-time lead among Canadian-born players. He also collected his 1,500th career hit in that game. On the August 10−17 road trip, he collected five outfield assists. On September 8, he had surgery on the elbow after it was revealed to be troubled with soreness. Walker appeared in 87 games and batted .309 with nine home runs and 51 RBI. He led the club with 10 outfield assists, eight from right field and two from left field. He ended the season as Canada&#x27;s all-time leader in hits, doubles, home runs, RBI, and runs scored in the major leagues. First baseman Todd Helton, Walker&#x27;s teammate on the Rockies from 1998 until his trade to the Cardinals in 2004, won the MLB Slash Stat Triple Crown in 2000, making them the first teammates in history to accomplish the feat in consecutive years. It also gave the Rockies four consecutive MLB batting champions in 1998−2001. Helton eventually succeeded Walker as the Rockies&#x27; career franchise leader in a number of statistical categories.

Prior the 2001 season, Walker committed to a new fitness regimen, including enlisting a personal trainer. He displayed restored health in his right arm on Opening Day, throwing out Fernando Viña of the Cardinals at home plate (video). Walker opened the season with a 10-game hit streak, from April 4−13, batting .425 with six home runs and 16 RBI. From April 17 to May 23, Walker safely reached base in 31 consecutive games. He batted .375, 11 home runs, 30 RBI during the month of April, becoming the first player in NL history to hit at least 11 home runs in the month of April twice. On May 22, he swiped his 200th career base. He scored his 1,000th career run on June 3 versus San Francisco.

Walker was selected to play in the 2001 All-Star Game, starting as the designated hitter and batting fifth. On August 5, he hit his 300th career home run, coming against the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 5−4 loss. He hit his 204th home run for Colorado on August, passing Castilla for the franchise record. On September 5, he took the lead for good for the batting title from former Expos teammate Moisés Alou. By scoring five runs on September 24 versus San Diego, Walker tied his career-high and the Rockies franchise record.

On the season, Walker tied Ichiro Suzuki for the major league lead in batting at .350 for his third batting title, with 38 homers and 123 RBI in 497 at bats. He did not reach his personal goal of 150 games, but did play in 142 and managed 601 plate appearances, his highest totals since 1997. Also he finished in the top ten in numerous other categories, including second in OBP (.449), third in offensive win % (.831), fifth in SLG (.663), sixth in OPS (1.111), adjusted OPS+ (160), at bats per home run (13.1), and WAR (7.8), and ninth in home runs. He led the majors with a .406 home batting average and in left-hander versus left-hander batting average at .378. He won another Gold Glove that year.

====2002−2004 seasons====
The Rockies struggled to play well in 2002, including a franchise-worst 6−16 start, and ended the season 25 games out of first place. Walker played his 1,532nd game on April 6, surpassing Terry Puhl for most games played by a Canadian-born player in MLB history. Walker&#x27;s 74th outfield assist with Colorado on May 23 gave him the franchise record, passing Bichette. Walker raised his average from .310 to a season-high .368 in June and July. His June totals included .410, seven doubles, seven home runs and 21 RBI. He hit safely in 20 of 24 games. In July, he was the NL Player of the Month for the second time, batting .438/.505./742, five home runs, and 17 RBI. He became the first player since Paul O&#x27;Neill in April and May of 1994 to hit at least .400 in successive months.

Overall, Walker batted .338 in 2002, second in the NL to Bonds&#x27; .370 average, and reached 100 RBI for the second consecutive year. Walker also hit 26 home runs and led the team with 40 doubles. He played in 136 games, and hit for a .421 OBP and .602 SLG. He won his seventh Gold Glove Award and was 20th in the MVP voting. His .452 average in interleague play led the major leagues. Throughout his age-36 season of 2003, Walker battled knee, shoulder, hamstring, groin and hip ailments. The knee injury occurred in a collision with Preston Wilson on August 2. In spite of all the injuries, Walker never missed more than three consecutive games and made 143 appearances. He hit 16 home runs and 79 RBI while batting .284, just the second time since 1993 his average had slipped below .300. He drew a career-high 98 bases on balls, resulting in a .422 on-base percentage, the seventh time in his career he reached .400. He was fifth in the NL in OBP, sixth in IBB (16), eighth in BB, and ninth in HBP (11). Commented manager Don Baylor, &quot;Even with the injuries and the lack of numbers from what they used to be in the past, Larry is still pitched to very carefully and fearfully throughout the league. He&#x27;s played beaten up and bruised.&quot; Walker underwent surgery to repair the labrum in the left shoulder and meniscus in the right knee following the season.

A groin strain caused Walker to miss the first 68 games, or two and one-half months, of the 2004 season. His first three home runs of the season (video ) came on June 25, 2004, versus the Cleveland Indians, including one off José Jiménez which won the game in the 10th inning for a 10−8 margin. Walker totaled four hits and five RBI on the day, and it was his third career three-home run game. He reached 2,000 career hits on June 30, 2004, becoming the 234th player in major league history to do so (video). Having already achieved 400 doubles, 300 home runs, 1,000 runs scored, and 1,000 RBI, Walker became the 40th player to reach all five totals. The milestone hit was a double off Ben Sheets in the fourth inning versus the Milwaukee Brewers. Through that point, Walker was the Rockies&#x27; career leader in 12 categories.

With the Rockies struggling to make the playoffs—which they had not accomplished since his first year in Colorado in 1995—Walker indicated a desire to be traded to a contender. The Texas Rangers agreed to send to the Rockies two of their prospects then-minor leaguer Ian Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson in exchange for Walker in July, but he vetoed the trade.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
====World Series appearance (2004)====

On August 6, 2004, Colorado sent Walker, who was batting .324 in 38 games, to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor league pitcher Jason Burch and two players to be named later. On August 11, those players were identified as Chris Narveson and Luis Martínez. Customarily the Rockies&#x27; number three hitter, Walker became the Cardinals&#x27; number two hitter. He hit behind a speedy Tony Womack and in front of the 3−4−5 hitters of Jim Edmonds, Albert Pujols and Scott Rolen, who combined for 122 home runs and 358 RBI that year. Walker made his Cardinals debut on August 8, playing the New York Mets, and appeared as a pinch-hitter and struck out in the seventh inning. He drew a walk from Mike Stanton in the ninth inning and scored the game-winning run on a Yadier Molina single. Walker appeared in 44 games for the Cardinal powerhouse that won a major league-best 105 games, batting .280, .393 OBP, .560 SLG and 11 home runs.

In three playoff rounds in 2004, Walker combined to hit .293/.379/.707 with a pair of home runs in each tournament, setting a franchise record for home runs hit by a left-handed batter in one postseason. Walker made his playoff debut with the Cardinals in Game 1 of the NLDS versus the Dodgers, homering twice and scoring four runs in an 8−3 Cardinals win. He became the first Cardinal with a multi-home run game in LDS play. In Game 1 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS) versus the Houston Astros, he was a home run short of hitting for the cycle.

St. Louis advanced to the World Series to face the Boston Red Sox − the first and only of Walker&#x27;s playing career. In his debut, he collected four hits in five at bats with a home run and two doubles. His four-hit outing tied a Cardinals World Series record, becoming the seventh overall and first to do so since Lou Brock in 1967. Boston won the Series by sweeping St. Louis. The Cardinals struggled to hit, batting .190 with a .562 OPS, while Walker batted .357 with a 1.366 OPS. His two home runs accounted for the only two hit by the entire Cardinals team. In the 2004 postseason, Walker scored 21 percent (14 of 68) of Cardinals runs.

====Final season (2005)====

Walker also contributed to the 2005 NL Central division champions, winners of 100 games. A herniated disc in his neck prevented him from turning his head to the left, and on June 27, 2005, he received a second cortisone shot to alleviate the pain. With eight previous surgeries and now playing in pain that impeded his ability to continue to produce at a high level, Walker signaled that he would retire from playing after the season. He had $12 million team option for 2006.

In 100 regular-season games, Walker batted .289/.384/.502, good for a 130 OPS+. His playoff effort yielded much less success than the year prior, combining to collect three hits in 28 at bats in two rounds. The Astros defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS in the last game ever played at Busch Memorial Stadium, the second iteration of Busch Stadium. Walker doubled in the sixth inning in elimination Game 6 versus Roy Oswalt for his final major league hit, but struck out in the ninth inning versus Dan Wheeler, his final at bat. He retired shortly after the game.

Walker ended his career 50th on Major League Baseball&#x27;s all-time home run list with 383.

==Playing style==
Walker, in spite of earnestly concentrating his efforts at baseball much later than nearly all other players, excelled at all aspects of the game, including hitting for both average and power, plate discipline, speed, defense, and throwing strength and accuracy, almost seamlessly translating the smoothness and agility of his hockey game to the diamond. Famously distinguished as &quot;the accidental ballplayer&quot; by a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article in 1993, he displayed all skills of the ideal five-tool player. The transition was a feat even more impressive considering he only began playing organized baseball after graduating high school and did not attend college, and maintained staggering productivity over the course of his career in spite of myriad injuries. Baseball-Reference&#x27;s advanced metrics of the three major areas of the game (excluding pitching) −batting, baserunning and fielding−, echo a multitude of observations of Walker&#x27;s overall excellence. He produced 420 runs above average in batting, or batting runs (Rbat), 94 fielding runs (Rfield), 40 baserunning runs (Rbase), and 10 runs above average avoiding grounding into double plays (Rdp). In every season following his short debut campaign of 1989, his adjusted OPS+ graded at minimum at 110; in just four seasons did he rate below average in fielding runs and twice in baserunning runs.

Per a profile of Walker&#x27;s batting technique in &quot;Lau&#x27;s Laws on Hitting&quot;, he met all checkpoints on the list of absolutes for a complete swing that would generate the greatest possible success as prescribed by former hitting coach Charley Lau. Overall, Walker produced &quot;a beautiful, one-piece swing.&quot; Highlights included &quot;an exceptionally balanced stance,&quot; &quot;excellent weight transfer&quot; and &quot;admirable ... hip rotation.&quot; All energy transferred to the ball in an explosion upon impact with the bat. The authors assert that due to this balance, he was able to post excellent numbers in Montreal before playing for Colorado.

Rival right fielder and long-time San Diego Padre Tony Gwynn epitomized Walker as &quot;the most complete player in the National League,&quot; and &quot;best baserunner in the game&quot; in a 2002 profile for ESPN. He observed that, in addition to his obvious athletic gifts, Walker approaches the game very cerebrally and is always thinking ahead, unearthing a wide array of advantages that he applied to the game. Said one sportswriter, &quot;His hand-eye co-ordination was off the charts, and his instincts as an outfielder and baserunner were unmatched.&quot; To &quot;Denver Post&quot; sports writer Tony Renck, &quot;Walker is the most talented player I have ever covered. His 1997 National League MVP season was breathtaking in every way from baserunning to defense to his rifle arm and 49 home runs.&quot; Quipped his former manager with the Rockies Don Baylor, &quot;He&#x27;s a six-tool guy. Most talented player I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Former manager Bobby Cox remarked, &quot;He&#x27;s better than one of the best. He is the best.&quot;

On defense, Walker combined uncanny awareness and competence with the aplomb of an expert actor. By tapping into extensive knowledge of where to play for each hitter with what the pitcher was going to throw, he recognized where to position himself accordingly. He understood how to read the path and angle of the ball and anticipate how it would ricochet off the wall. His arm strength and accuracy often made it intimidating for baserunners to seize extra bases. Adept at mimicking catching long fly balls and line drives that he was actually unable to apprehend, he often fooled hitters into settling for singles when they could have taken extra bases.

==Post-playing career==
===Impact on baseball in Canada===
Although Walker was not the first Canadian to become a star player in the major leagues, his influence in Canada and native British Columbia is far-reaching. &quot;He was the standard for the height of baseball in Canada,&quot; commented Jeff Francis, a former major league pitcher from North Delta, Vancouver. &quot;If you went to a provincial championship, his picture was on your T-shirt. Or if you went to play in Maple Ridge, you were playing at Larry Walker Field. The fact that he played for the Montreal Expos helped, too, so even people who weren&#x27;t baseball fans knew who he was. He was that unreachable dream for kids who let you know it was reachable, that a Canadian could go do it.&quot;

===Coaching work===
====St. Louis Cardinals====
As of 2008, Walker was an instructor on the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; spring training staff under former manager Tony La Russa and did fill-in training with the Cardinals staff. He was offered a full-time position but chose to remain in his part-time position.

====Canada national baseball team====
Since 2009, Walker has served as a hitting coach and first base coach for the Canadian national team. He has coached for Team Canada in three World Baseball Classic (WBC) tournaments, 2009, 2013, and 2017. In 2011, he served as hitting and first base coach for Canada at the Pan Am Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, where Team Canada won their first major international baseball championship. In the semifinal, Canada defeated host Mexico, 5–3. Next, Canada won by a score of 2–1 versus the United States in the final, crowning them with that edition&#x27;s gold medal. Walker reprised his coaching role at the 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto. In a rematch of 2011, Canada defeated the United States in extra innings, 7–6, to claim their second consecutive gold medal at the Pan Am Games.

===Recognition, awards, and halls of fame election and consideration===
====Post-career awards====
During the 2006 season, MLB and DHL Express announced a promotional event, named DHL Hometown Heroes, for fans to vote for the most outstanding player in the history of each franchise among five nominees each. Nominees for the Colorado Rockies included Walker, Bichette, Castilla, Galarraga, and Helton. On October 1, 2006, Walker was announced as the winner for the Colorado Rockies franchise.

Walker was elected to the BC Sports Hall of Fame, and inducted May 13, 2009, and CTV Vancouver noted that he was &quot;perhaps the greatest Canadian-born ballplayer of all time.&quot;

On June 20, 2009, it was announced that Walker and former major league catcher Ernie Whitt were inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Walker was elected on his first ballot.

Of 33 MLB players and employees surveyed in 2012 to solicit the opinion of the greatest Canadian baseball player, Walker led with 16 votes, Jenkins was second with 10, and Joey Votto, Justin Morneau and Stubby Clapp each received two.

Fellow British Columbia native Justin Morneau signed with the Rockies prior to the 2014 season and requested and wore uniform number 33 in honor of Walker. Morneau had previously won an MVP in the American League. At the end of the 2014 season, he won the NL batting title, joining Walker as the second Canadian to win a batting title as a member of the Rockies.

MLB held a contest dubbed &quot;The Franchise Four&quot; in 2015 for fans to select the four most influential players in the history of each franchise. On July 14, it was announced that Walker was selected along with Galarraga, Helton, and Troy Tulowitzki for the Colorado Rockies.

====National Baseball Hall of Fame====
Walker became eligible for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011. During his first year of eligibility, he received 118 votes, or 20.3 percent of all ballots cast; the threshold for entry is 75 percent. With a 34.1% of voters supporting enshrinement in 2018 — Walker&#x27;s personal high at that point — he had previously yet to receive more than 22.9% of the vote. As Jay Jaffe noted, Walker has had difficulty gaining more support for election as he is &quot;in something of a perfect storm&quot; — low counting statistics relative to already-elected Hall of Famers, playing a large part of his career during the &quot;steroid era,&quot; and taking more turns at the plate at Coors Field than anywhere else. One perception of Coors Field is that it inflates batting statistics far beyond a hitter&#x27;s true ability.

Jaffe wrote that he found Walker to be well-qualified for induction into the Hall of Fame, contending that even though &quot;his counting stats were low for the era, ... his all-round greatness added a considerable amount of hidden value that made up for lost time.&quot;

Of all who played right field as their primary position, Walker&#x27;s 72.7 career Baseball-Reference WAR ranks tenth all-time, and all nine ahead of him are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. A top-heavy list highlights five achievers of over 100 WAR and another two who accumulated at least 90. Three of the most accomplished hitters in history are there − Ruth (163.1), Aaron, (142.6), and Musial (128.1). Three of the next four after Walker, including Gwynn, have also been elected to the Hall of Fame.

Wrote Tom Verducci of Walker&#x27;s American Hall of Fame credentials, the difference between playing in Denver and all other locations, including producing a 98-point in difference in average (.380 vs. .282), and a 49% higher home run rate, were &quot;bothersome.&quot; Further, the lack of longevity kept him from election, as no right fielder with fewer than 2,500 games played or 2,500 hits has been selected. John Brattain noted for Baseball Prospectus in 2002 that Walker had &quot;Hall of Fame talent&quot; and named him &quot;among the elite National League outfielders, Coors Field or not,&quot; but without Hall of Fame credentials, due to a lack of longevity from injury. Brattain compared him to a number of failed hopefuls with similar statistics, including Dick Allen, who accrued impressive rate statistics adjusted for era and an MVP award. However, the comparisons only extended to batting accomplishments, leaving out defense and baserunning.

Noted of Walker&#x27;s proper swing balance by the authors of &quot;Lau&#x27;s Laws on Hitting&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that all of his glowing statistics are the result of playing at Coors Field. He posted some superb numbers in Montreal, too.&quot; Former AL batting champion George Brett offered on playing at Coors that &quot;you have to adjust to what the ballpark offers you. The reason I hit the way I do is [Kauffman] Stadium — the big outfield and the turf. You play half your games there.&quot; Mike Piazza, who finished second to Walker in the 1997 NL MVP voting, commented the same year that &quot;Walker is a great player having a great year. He plays in a great hitter&#x27;s park, and I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that some of their players don&#x27;t get the credit they deserve because of that.&quot;

Walker was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2020 in his 10th and final year of eligibility; he was named on 304 of the 397 ballots (76.57%) cast by the writers. He became only the second Canadian elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame after Ferguson Jenkins was elected in 1991. Walker is also the first Hall of Fame player to wear a Rockies cap on his plaque. He created a sensation by wearing a NASCAR-style &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; shirt during the video interviews to commemorate the announcement of his election, citing that he was not optimistic he would be elected to the Hall of Fame. Both Amazon and Walmart in its online apparatus were found to have sold out of the shirt shortly after the interview aired. The SpongeBob shirt that Larry Walker wore on the day he was elected was itself put in the Hall of Fame as part of an exhibit in 2021.

==Accomplishments==
Over his career, Walker produced a .313 batting average, .400 on-base percentage, and .565 slugging percentage for a 141 adjusted OPS+. One of only 19 hitters in history with a .300/.400/.500 batting line with at least 5,000 career plate appearances, his is one of only six whose careers began after 1960. Injuries forced him to miss 375 games from 1996 to 2004 as he appeared in 1,083 of 1,458 possible games. He hit over .300 nine times, hit at least 30 home runs four times and drove in 100 RBI five times. Defensively, he ranks eighth all-time among right fielders with 94 runs above average, per Baseball-Reference. He was the 40th player in history to reach 2,000 hits, 400 doubles, 300 home runs, 1,000 runs scored, and 1,000 RBI.

Per Baseball-Reference&#x27;s advanced metrics, Walker produced 420 runs above average in batting, or batting runs (Rbat), 94 fielding runs (Rfield), and 40 base-running runs (Rbase). According to sports journalist Joe Posnanski, of all players who rank within the top 100 of either Rbat, Rfield, and defensive runs saved, 34 are in the top 100 in two of the categories, and three are in the top 100 in all three: Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, and Walker. His 94 Bfield ranks eighth all-time among right fielders, and Rbase are third all-time among right fielders and 32nd among all outfielders. Considering players of all positions in MLB history, just 13 others achieved a combination of 94 Rfield and 40 Rbase. When also considering Walker&#x27;s 420 Rbat (which are park-adjusted), just three others met or exceeded all three levels: Hank Aaron, Bonds, and Mays.

With 72.6 career WAR according to Baseball-Reference, Walker ranks 10th all-time among right fielders, including a top-heavy class where five achieved over 100 WAR and another two accumulated 90 WAR. All nine ahead of him are in the National Hall of Fame, and eight of nine played at least 2,400 games, compared to Walker&#x27;s 1,988. There are 24 right fielders in the Hall of Fame. Populating the list are two of the top three home run hitters in history (Babe Ruth, 163.1; and Hank Aaron, 142.6), Musial (128.1), Mel Ott (107.8), Frank Robinson (107.2), Roberto Clemente (94.5) and Al Kaline (92.5). Three of the next four after Walker, including Gwynn, are also in the Hall of Fame.

Walker is the only player in MLB history to have met or exceeded a .310 batting average, 380 home runs, 1,300 RBI, .965 OPS and 471 doubles, and 230 stolen bases. Just four others players reached all levels other than the stolen base category: Musial, Ruth, Ted Williams, and Lou Gehrig. Among all players with at least 8,000 plate appearances, Walker is tied with Chipper Jones for 36th all-time with a 141 OPS+. Walker&#x27;s slugging percentage ranks 12th all-time. His 140 wRC+ ranks 34th in history among players with at least 8,000 plate appearances. He is one of twenty players to win at least three batting titles.

Remarkably, Walker maintained superior longevity in right field in spite of persistent injuries over the course of his career. Never having to permanently move off the position, he made significant contributions there every season of his career, while at times covering for significant stretches at first base (1991 and 1994), center field (1996) and left field (2000). He ranks 17th in games played in right field, with 1,718, 18th in assists (150), tenth in double plays turned (40), eighth in defensive zone runs (100), and 29th in fielding percentage (.986). Among all outfielders, he is 21st in defensive zone runs (101), 77th in double plays turned (40), and 93st in games played (1,804).

Over his general peak seasons covering 1992−2002, Walker ranked sixth among all MLB position players in WAR with 53.9, while batting .327, .410 OBP, .602 SLG, with 300 home runs. Among all players with at least 4,000 at bats in that span, the average ranked second to Gwynn, weighted on-base average (wOBA, .428) and slugging third to McGwire and Bonds, and OBP eleventh. During his five highest peak seasons spanning 1997−2001, he batted .357/.445/.658.

In Colorado, Walker batted .382/.462/.710 and 229 of his career home runs in 2,501 PA. At all other locations, he batted .282/.372/.501 and 154 of career home runs in 5,529 PA. His road OPS in nine full seasons playing for the Rockies was .890, and his career road OPS was .865, just ahead of Ken Griffey Jr. at .860. Of all players with at least 1,000 road games played, Walker&#x27;s OPS ranks 39th. As of 2016, the number of Hall of Famers who had exceeded his road totals followed as thus: 35 hit more than his 168 home runs, 63 drove in more than his 564 RBI, 32 stole more than his 109 bases, 33 hit for a higher OPS than his .865, and 56 hit more than his 203 doubles.

Walker is the Rockies&#x27; career leader in batting average (.334), on-base percentage (.426), slugging percentage (.618), OPS (1.044), and OPS+ (147). He remains in the top ten in many cumulative offensive categories for the Rockies, many of which he is in second place trailing Todd Helton, who played nearly twice as many games for Colorado as Walker (2247 to 1170). He is the Rockies&#x27; single-season record holder for numerous categories, many of them set during his MVP season of 1997.

Of frequent debate for &quot;greatest Canadian-born player ever&quot; is between Walker and pitcher Ferguson Jenkins. Jenkins was, prior to Walker&#x27;s election, the only native Canadian to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and the first of only two Canadians to win the Cy Young Award (the second is Éric Gagné in 2003). Since Walker won the MVP Award in 1997, Justin Morneau (2006) and Joey Votto (2010) became the second and third Canadians win the MVP award of MLB. Only Walker and Votto (six) have won the Tip O&#x27;Neill Award more than three times in their career.

==Personal life==
Walker resides in West Palm Beach, Florida. He is married and has three daughters, including one from a previous marriage.

Walker&#x27;s talents extend beyond the diamond. He enjoys playing and watching soccer. In West Palm Beach, he frequently bowls for recreation. He bowled a 300 game on April 10, 2014.

Superstitious about the number three, Walker wore number 33 during his playing career and was married on November 3 at 3:33. All of his in-game rituals would involve the number three, including taking three swings, or any multiple thereof, in the batter&#x27;s box before each at bat. His superstition continued after his career, as Walker was the 333rd person to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

A donor to the Rockies Youth Field of Dreams program, Walker opened five facilities in Colorado, in Aurora, Denver, Fort Collins, Northglenn, and Thornton.

<text>Andrew Russell Pearson (December 13, 1897 – September 1, 1969) was an American columnist, noted for his syndicated newspaper column &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot;. He also had a program on NBC Radio titled &quot;Drew Pearson Comments&quot;. He was known for his approach towards high-level politicians, such as senators, cabinet members, generals and American presidents.

==Early life and career==
Pearson was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Quaker parents Paul Martin Pearson, an English professor at Northwestern University, and Edna Rachel Wolfe Pearson. When Pearson was 6 years old, his father joined the faculty of Swarthmore College as professor of public speaking, and the family moved to Pennsylvania, joining the Society of Friends, with which the college was then affiliated. After being educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, Pearson attended Swarthmore from 1915 until 1919, where he edited its student newspaper, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

From 1919 to 1921, Pearson served with the American Friends Service Committee, directing postwar rebuilding operations in Peć, which at that time was part of Serbia. From 1921 to 1922, he lectured in geography at the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1923 Pearson traveled to Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, India, and Serbia, and persuaded several newspapers to buy articles about his travels. He was also commissioned by the American &quot;Around the World Syndicate&quot; to produce a set of interviews entitled &quot;Europe&#x27;s Twelve Greatest Men&quot;.

In 1924, he taught industrial geography at Columbia University.

From 1925 to 1928, Pearson continued reporting on international events, including strikes in China, the Geneva Naval Conference, the Pan-American Conference in Havana, and the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris.

In 1929 he became the Washington correspondent for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. However, in 1931 and 1932, with Robert S. Allen, he anonymously published a book called &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; and its sequel. When the &quot;Sun&quot; discovered Pearson had co-authored these books, he was promptly fired. Late in 1932, Pearson and Allen secured a contract with the Scripps–Howard syndicate, United Features, to syndicate a column called &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot;. It first appeared in Eleanor &quot;Cissy&quot; Patterson&#x27;s &quot;Washington Herald&quot; on November 17, 1932. But as World War II escalated in Europe, Pearson&#x27;s strong support of Franklin D. Roosevelt, in opposition to Patterson and the &quot;Herald&quot; isolationist position, led to an acrimonious termination of Pearson&#x27;s and Allen&#x27;s contract with the &quot;Herald&quot;. In 1941 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; picked up the contract for the &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot;.

===Radio, film, and other media===
From 1935 to 1936, Allen and Pearson broadcast a 15-minute program twice a week on the Mutual Broadcasting System. They continued with a 30-minute music and news show, &quot;Listen America&quot;, in 1939–1940, ending this partnership in 1941. They also wrote a comic strip, &quot;Hap Hopper, Washington Correspondent&quot;, which was drawn from 1939 to 1943 by Jack Sparling, and from 1943 onward by Al Plastino.

Pearson continued alone on NBC with &quot;Drew Pearson Comments&quot; from 1941 to 1953 for a variety of sponsors (Serutan, Nutrex, Lee Hats, Adam Hats). His commentary was broadcast through 1968 on the now-defunct Intermountain Network.

In addition to radio, Pearson appeared in a number of Hollywood movies, such as RKO&#x27;s 1945 propaganda movie &quot;Betrayal from the East&quot;, and the 1951 science fiction film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. In the former movie, Pearson referred to an exposé that accused Japanese Americans of being part of a Japanese conspiracy to engage in acts of espionage and terrorism. The movie was based on the 1943 best-selling book &quot;Betrayal from the East: The Inside Story of Japanese Spies in America&quot; by Alan Hynd. In the latter film, Pearson (playing himself) is the only journalist who urges calm and restraint (versus the fear and paranoia evoked by his colleagues) while Washington is panicked by the escape of the alien visitor Klaatu. Furthermore, Pearson appeared as himself in &quot;City Across the River&quot; (1949).

In 1952 and 1953, Pearson hosted &quot;The Drew Pearson Show&quot; on the ABC and DuMont Television networks.

On a January 8, 1950, broadcast of CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, Pearson was at the center of a notorious joke. Announcer Don Wilson was to say he heard Jack had bought a new suit on Drew Pearson&#x27;s program, but misspoke Pearson&#x27;s name: &quot;Drear Pooson&quot;. Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Nelson replied with a line surreptitiously given him by the show&#x27;s writers, &quot;Who do you think I am? Drear Pooson?&quot;

==&quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot;==
The &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; column started as a result of Pearson&#x27;s anonymous publication in 1931 of the book, &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot;, co-written with Robert Allen, the Washington bureau chief for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. The book was a collection of muckraking news items concerning key figures in public life that challenged the journalistic code of the day. In 1932 it was followed by a second book, &quot;More Merry-Go-Round&quot;. Although they were exposed as the publishers and forced to resign their positions, their books were successful enough so that Pearson and Allen could become co-authors of the syndicated column, the &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, that same year. Also in 1932, the original book was made into a film of the same name by Columbia Pictures, directed by James Cruze, and starring Lee Tracy and Constance Cummings.

According to his one-time partner, Jack Anderson, Pearson saw journalism as a means to challenge those he thought to be working against the public interest. He himself had the reputation of a person who put principles over profit. Refusing to carry libel insurance or gain the support of his syndicate to finance libel judgments against him, Pearson&#x27;s journalism resulted in more than 120 libel actions against him. However, he only had to pay a settlement in one legal case. 

During World War II, Pearson&#x27;s column not only revealed embarrassing news items, but expanded to criticize the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s conduct of the war, in particular U.S. foreign policy regarding Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. As a supporter of the Soviet Union&#x27;s struggle against Nazi Germany, Pearson demanded that the Allied Command create a second front in Europe in 1943 to assist the Soviets. When Pearson&#x27;s demands were not met, he began to openly criticize Secretary of State Cordell Hull, James Dunn, and other State Department officials, whom Pearson accused of hating Soviet Russia. After one of Pearson&#x27;s more virulent columns accused Secretary of State Hull and his deputies of a conscious policy to &quot;bleed Russia white&quot;, President Roosevelt convened a press conference in which he angrily accused Pearson of printing statements that were a lie &quot;from beginning to end&quot;, jeopardizing United Nations unity, and committing an act of bad faith towards his own nation. The president concluded his statement by calling Pearson &quot;a chronic liar&quot;.

Pearson was the first to report the 1943 incident of General George S. Patton&#x27;s slapping soldier Charles Kuhl. It was the first of two slapping-incidents, when General Patton, who denied the existence of combat stress reaction, struck and badly abused soldiers whom he had encountered during their evaluation at military field hospitals. Allied Headquarters denied that Patton had received either an official reprimand or removal from field command, but confirmed that Patton had slapped a soldier with his gloves. Demands for Patton to be recalled and sent home soon arose in Congress as well as in newspaper articles and editorials across the country. However, public opinion was largely favorable to Patton. While Patton was later reassigned and his career advancement slowed, he was not relieved, but continued to serve in the European theater, where he would later command the U.S. Third Army. Pearson&#x27;s broadcast and subsequent article on Patton&#x27;s alleged behavior sufficiently raised the suspicions of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson that he requested Army General Joseph T. McNarney to &quot;put an inspector on the War Department to see who has been leaking out information. Pearson&#x27;s articles are about three-quarters false but there&#x27;s just a germ of truth in them that someone must have given him.&quot;

After Pearson reported that General Douglas MacArthur was actively campaigning for his own promotion, MacArthur sued Pearson for defamation, but dropped the suit after Pearson threatened to publish love letters from MacArthur to his Eurasian paramour, Isabel Rosario Cooper.

==Post-war investigations==
In February 1946, Pearson revealed the existence of a Canadian ring of Soviet spies who had given away secret information about the atomic bomb, and he hinted that the espionage scandal might extend to the U.S. as well. The U.S. government had kept the news secret for several months until Pearson broke the story in a series of radio broadcasts. It is possible that he was tipped off by a government official who wanted to turn U.S. public opinion against the Soviet Union, possibly even FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, according to historian Amy Knight. 

Pearson also played a role in the downfall of New Jersey Congressman John Parnell Thomas, Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, in 1948. After revelations in Pearson&#x27;s column, Thomas was investigated and later convicted of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government for hiring friends who never worked for him, then depositing their paychecks into his personal accounts. Pearson was a staunch opponent of the actions of Senator Joseph McCarthy and other attempts by Congress to investigate Soviet and communist influence in government and the media, and he eagerly denounced the allegations by Senator McCarthy and the House Committee.

In May 1948, Pearson was among the journalists who reported on the business problems of Preston Tucker and his Tucker Corporation. A former policeman during the Prohibition era, Tucker was a self-made car-designer and businessman. Struggling to finance his high-flying plans in the design and safety of his cars, he had attempted &quot;to raise money through unconventional means, including selling dealership rights for a car that didn&#x27;t exist yet.&quot; When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Justice Department started to investigate the case in 1947, his first annual report, which he initially had refused to produce, resulted in a deficit of $ 5,651,208. Tucker took the news of the latest investigation to the newspapers, publishing full-page ads that read: &quot;My associates and myself and the Tucker Corp. have been investigated time &amp; again . . . Now once more we are being investigated.&quot; Although he was acquitted of fraud charges, Tucker&#x27;s firm went bankrupt in 1950. 

===James Forrestal===
Journalists, such as Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell, were criticized for their continuing critical reports about the treatment of US Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal. Forrestal, whom President Harry S. Truman had forced to resign, had committed suicide during his stay at the psychiatric clinic of the U. S. Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland. The suicide was followed by an investigation, that was intended to clarify controversial aspects of his medical care. Forrestal, who had told his doctors about an earlier episode when he had tried to take his life, had been treated with Sodium amythal. After several weeks of this treatment, an insulin shock therapy followed. Both therapies resulted in strong overreactions: &quot;From that time on he was carried with ten units of insulin before breakfast and another ten units before lunch with extra feedings in the afternoon and evening&quot;. His sleeplessness was treated with sedatives. In the course of the investigation, Forrestal&#x27;s doctors had to explain why the chief of psychiatrists, who had been in charge of Forrestal, had been out of house at the time of his suicide, and why most of the patient&#x27;s restrictions had been relieved. Other questions dealt with the fact that a patient with a high risk of suicide had been placed in a room on the sixteenth floor of the tower of the hospital. The chief of psychiatrists came up with a colleague&#x27;s concern &quot;that the widespread publicity might in some way reflect upon the excellence of Navy psychiatry unless there is full understanding by everyone of necessary risks and hazards which must be faced courageously in the management of such a medical problem.&quot; His diagnosis was that Forrestal had been outworked due to his difficult professional obligations, and that he had suffered from his loss of office. Asking for a second opportunity to elaborate further about what might have happened the night of the suicide, he only then hinted to a possible negative effect of some media reports on the mood of his patient. The investigation finally cleared the US Naval Hospital and its staff from suspicions and stated that its doctors and wards weren&#x27;t responsible for Forrestal&#x27;s death.

===Speaking out against Senator McCarthy===
In 1950, Pearson began the first of a series of columns attacking Senator Joseph McCarthy after McCarthy declared that he had a list of 205 people in the State Department who were members of the American Communist Party. Ironically, Pearson, through his associate Jack Anderson, had been using McCarthy as a confidential source for information on other politicians. Pearson used McCarthy&#x27;s revelations in his columns with one exception – material on suspected Communists working in the U.S. government that McCarthy and his staff had uncovered. Over the next two months McCarthy made seven Senate speeches on Drew Pearson, calling for a &quot;patriotic boycott&quot; of his radio show which cost Pearson the sponsor of his program. Twelve newspapers also cancelled their contracts with Pearson.

In response, Senator McCarthy referred to Pearson&#x27;s one-time assistant David Karr, born Katz, as &quot;Pearson&#x27;s &#x27;KGB controller&#x27; and charged that &#x27;Pearson&#x27;s all-important job, which he did for the Party without fail, under the direction of David Karr, was to lead the character assassination of an man who was a threat to international communism.&quot; Karr had been exposed by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1943 as having worked for two years on the staff of the Communist newspaper &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;. In response, Pearson claimed that Karr had only joined the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; because he had wanted to get into baseball games for free. Karr ostensibly covered home Yankee games for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, a paper not known for its sports readership, but his other activities remained unknown at the time. Years later, however, the release of the FBI&#x27;s Venona decrypt of June 1944 revealed that Karr was an informational source for the NKVD. Another member of Pearson&#x27;s staff, Andrew Older, along with his wife, was identified in 1951 as a Communist Party member in testimony before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Older&#x27;s sister, Julia Older, was also suspected of having spied for the Soviet Union. 

In December 1950 McCarthy and Pearson were involved in a physical altercation at the Sulgrave Club in Washington, D.C. Pearson later sued McCarthy for injuries he allegedly suffered in the altercation, which Pearson stated resulted from being &quot;grabbed by the neck and kicked in the groin.&quot; The following month, McCarthy delivered a speech in the Senate in which he referred to Pearson as a &quot;communist tool&quot;.

In October 1953, Senator McCarthy began investigating communist infiltration into the military. McCarthy&#x27;s attempts to discredit Robert Stevens, the Secretary of the Army, infuriated President Dwight Eisenhower, who instructed the Department of the Army to release information detrimental to McCarthy to journalists who were known to be opposed to him. On December 15, 1952, Pearson, working with Eisenhower&#x27;s staff, published a column using the information on McCarthy, dealing him a significant blow.

===Fight against politically motivated denunciation of Washington &quot;homosexuals&quot;===

On October 19, 1964, Pearson published an article with the title of &quot;Homosexuality Bipartisan Problem Facing Washington&quot;. Here he presented several cases involving members of Congress whose sons were blackmailed, threatened, or eased out of office on the basis of rumors of homosexuality. Arthur Vandenberg Jr., a talented Republican government official from Michigan, had lost the opportunity to becoming President Eisenhower&#x27;s top aide. And Senator Lester Hunt, Democrat of Wyoming, had taken his own life after Republican Senators Styles Bridges of New Hampshire and Herman Welker of Idaho had threatened to reveal how Hunt&#x27;s son had been arrested by the Washington police on a morals charge. 

Pearson&#x27;s article was a reaction to the political elimination of Walter Jenkins, longtime top aide and personal friend to Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson. On October 7, 1964, a month before the presidential election, Jenkins, a &quot;stout catholic&quot;, husband and father of six children, had been arrested and charged with &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; with another man. The scandal was promoted to the press by members of the Republican party, who exploited the scandal in their own interests. Pearson, who called the &quot;history of homosexuality in Washington&quot; &quot;a tragic one&quot;, was aware of the current political atmosphere, where the destruction of the careers of political opponents on the basis of accusations of homosexual behavior had become commonplace. In his 1964 defence of Walter Jenkins, he argued in the line of Lady Bird Johnson, who had thought about de-escalating the situation by attributing the purported offense to the exhaustion of a man who had temporarily overworked himself in the challenging time before the election. In advance to the FBI&#x27;s investigation of the case, Pearson followed several leads that apparently proved that Jenkins had been framed. The journalist, whom Lyndon B. Johnson on another occasion had recommended as a thoroughly informed, critical expert of the Ku-Klux-Klan, let the president know what he had found out.

In October 1967, Drew Pearson once more exposed the hypocrisy of the allegations that had led to the removal of Walter Jenkins and other well experienced public servants. This time, it was two members of Governor of California Ronald Reagan&#x27;s staff who had participated in an eight-man &quot;sex orgy&quot; at Lake Tahoe. Governor Reagan, who had been critical in the case of Walter Jenkins, had not taken action until six months later, when the &quot;most able and highly qualified&quot; men were fired:
&quot;He [Ronald Reagan] campaigned on the proposition that while he did not know much about Government he would surround himself with experts who did. Two of these experts have now turned out to be involved in conduct which society does not condone. Despite this, they were kept in the Governor&#x27;s office for approximately six months and reportedly were only dropped when Reagan&#x27;s right-wing backers demanded that they be fired, not because of their sex behavior, but because they were too moderate for the right wing.&quot;

In Pearson&#x27;s view, the dismissal of the two members of Reagan&#x27;s staff on a pretext was part of a strategy to present the Governor and his actions in a more determined and impartial light:
&quot;The presence of homos in Government was first raised as an issue by a well known Republican, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, who claimed the State Department was riddled with them. Though he was not able to prove his claims, it remains a fact that a homosexual in the Defense or State Departments is automatically fired as a security risk. He can too easily be blackmailed. The reason why Reagan&#x27;s press secretary is now belatedly explaining the facts behind the dropping of his two assistants may well be the desire to show that Ronnie acted quickly - which he did not do.&quot;

Hoping to protect his aspirations for a presidential candidacy, Pearson&#x27;s article argued, Governor Reagan had turned a blind eye to his own government&#x27;s sex scandal and had acted in his very personal interests.

== Engagement for democracy and peace ==
Drew Pearson&#x27;s engagement for democracy and peace started at an early age and lasted throughout his entire life. The best-known of his manyfold activities were:
* 1919-1921: Volunteer for two years of service in Serbia to supervise the American Friends Service Committee (forerunner of the Peace Corps) postwar relief program in Balkan villages
* Long-time president of the Washington D. C. chapter of Big Brothers, at the time a non-profit program with the concept of a One-Man-One-Boy relationship allowing to graduate potential delinquent boys into responsible citizenship
* Taking troupes of professional entertainers (e.g. the Harlem Globetrotters) for visits to American overseas bases at Christmas time
* 1952 Organization of the committee &quot;Americans Against Bombs of Bigotry&quot;, to take action against the bombing of schools and worship that had resulted from racial and religious intolerance
* 1953 Organization of the &quot;Americans Conscience Fund&quot; for victims of racial bigotry
* Largely responsible for raising the money to rebuild the Clinton, Tennessee, schoolhouse, that two years after the 1956 desegregation had been destroyed by white supremacists

Following World War II, Drew Pearson with the support of his wife Luvie Pearson initiated the Friendship Train which on its way through the USA collected over 700 cars of food, clothing and fuel worth over $40 million in aid for &quot;America&#x27;s friends&quot; in war-torn Europe: &quot;Luvie was the steam that powered the train across the northern United States, and Drew fired up the southern route. Both stopped at every village for contributions. They collected enough food to fill &#x27;two long freight trains.&#x27; And then they took it to Europe, with keys to the towns presented at every stop.&quot; On December 19, 1947, one day after the arrival of the much-needed food, medicine and supplies in France, Pearson was awarded the French Legion of Honor, rank of Chevalier, in recognition of his charitable engagement and work.

Some of his other international engagements for democracy and peace were:

* Organisation of the &quot;Democracy Letters to Italy&quot; in the election of 1948, to help defeat Communism in Italy in this election
* 1951 he helped to launch the &quot;Freedom Balloon&quot; campaign, by which the Crusade for Freedom reached behind the Iron Curtain with messages of liberty and encouragement
* 1953: Initiator of the &quot;Food for East Germany&quot; program (supported by the Eisenhower Administration)
* 1959: Delegate to the Atlantic Conference (London)
* 1961: Member of the &quot;President&#x27;s Food for Peace Committee&quot;
* 1961: Interviews with Chairman Khrushchev at his summer home on the Black Sea

== Death and legacy ==
On August 3, 1969, Pearson was hospitalized in Washington for a viral infection that led to heart complications. He was released to his home in Potomac, Maryland, on August 29, but suffered a heart attack on September 1, and died at the emergency room of George Washington University Hospital at the age of 71.

At the time of his death, the column was syndicated to more than 650 newspapers, more than twice as many as any other, with an estimated 60 million readers, and was famous for its investigative style of journalism. A Harris Poll commissioned by &quot;Time&quot; magazine at that time showed that Pearson was America&#x27;s best-known newspaper columnist at the time of his death. The column was continued by Jack Anderson and then by Douglas Cohn and Eleanor Clift, who combine commentary with historical perspectives. It is the longest-running syndicated column in America.

American University Library received the typescript copies of the columns distributed to newspapers around the country in 1992. Shortly thereafter, the Library embarked on a project to digitize the collection.

==Personal life==

Drew Pearson had one daughter, Ellen Cameron Pearson (1926–2010), in a short marriage (1925–28) to Felicia Gizycka, daughter of the newspaper heiress Cissy Patterson and Count Joseph Gizycky of Poland. Thereafter, Pearson maintained a strained relationship with his former mother-in-law, and they frequently exchanged barbed comments in print. His second wife was Luvie Moore Abell (a cousin of Edith Kermit Carow), whom he married in 1936; through that union he had a step son, Tyler Abell, to whom he was close throughout his life. Abell later became chief of protocol under President Lyndon B. Johnson.

==Awards and recognition==
Pearson was awarded Norway&#x27;s Medal of St. Olav, the French Legion of Honour, the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity, and two honorary degrees. He also was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for &quot;The Drew Pearson Show&quot;, an early program of current events.

Character actor Robert F. Simon played Pearson in the 1977 NBC television movie &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot;, a biopic of U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin.

<doc id="394262" wikidata="Q14906254" url="?curid=394262" title="Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City">
<text>Álvaro Obregón () is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. It contains a large portion of the south-west part of Mexico City. It had a 2020 census population of 759,137 inhabitants and lies at an elevation of 2,319 m. above sea level.

It was named after Álvaro Obregón, a leader of the Mexican Revolution and an early-20th-century Mexican president, who was assassinated in this area. Its former name is San Ángel, and the historic San Ángel neighborhood still retains this name, as does the Televisa San Angel motion picture and television studio, which is located in this municipality, which also includes the well-known upscale commercial neighborhoods Santa Fe, Jardines del Pedregal as well as Colonia Florida.

==Geography==
The municipality of Álvaro Obregón is located in the west of Mexico City, and has a land surface of 96.17 km2, with an elongated shape from northeast to southwest.

It borders Miguel Hidalgo to the North, Benito Juárez and Coyoacán to the East, Magdalena Contreras, Tlalpan and Jalatlacalco municipality (State of Mexico) to the South, and Cuajimalpa to the West. Together with Álvaro Obregón becomes the Western access to the city, and its regional roadways are the Federal Highway and the Freeway, which constitute the entry for merchandise and population from the states of Mexico and Michoacán.

The borough&#x27;s maximum height is 3,820 meters above sea level at the summit of Triangulo mountain, and the lowest is at 2,260 meters. The borough occupies 7,720 hectares, or 6.28% of the Federal District area, and it has the fifth place in terms of territory of all municipalities. Of such hectares, 5,052 are urban soil and 2,668 are considered protected soil (66.1% and 33.8% respectively). Other important elevations (in meters) are the San Miguel mountain (3,780); the Cruz de Colica o Alcalica mountain (3,610); the Temamatla mountain (3,500); the Ocotal (3,450) and the Zacazontetla (3,270). In general, the relief is of great contrasts, constituted by surfaces of piedmont, product of the natural erosion of the mountain chain.

It is geographically located between the parallels 19°; 14&#x27;N and 19°; 25&#x27;N and the meridians 99°; 10&#x27; W and 99°; 20&#x27;0 W.

===Edaphology===

In the borough 4 types of soils dominate:
#Haplic and Luvic Phaeozem: Cover 53.8% of the borough&#x27;s territory; it is a soil that presents a normal sequence in its horizons, and a maximum thickness of 100 cm, developing between 2,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.
#Haplic Litosols: Are from a rocky volcanic origin, with a maximum thickness of 30 cm, covering 28.8% of the municipality, are located between 2,300 and 2,500 meters in altitude.
#Andosols: Occupying 21.1% of the borough&#x27;s land area; are rich in volcanic materials, dark superficial horizons, and have a maximum thickness of 50 cm. Their texture is medium and are located between 3,000 and 3,800 meters, and constitute the maximum altitude of the municipality.
#Eutric Regosol: Occupying 1.9% of the borough&#x27;s land area; are soils from a volcanic origin or from meiotic accumulation, little compacted and have a maximum thickness of 30 cm; they present thick texture and brown color.

===Climate===

For the region of San Ángel, Mixcoac, Tacubaya and adjacent areas around 2240 meters above sea level and up to 2,410, the climate is consistently mild with cool mornings and wetter than in Mexico City&#x27;s downtown, averaging and of rainfall yearly. The monthly temperature is warmest from April through June, reaching , whilst the lowest median temperatures occur from December through February reaching . Between 2,410 up to 3,100 meters above sea level the median temperature of the warmest months gets reduced to between also from April through June. The minimum median temperatures (December–February) are cooler at . Precipitation here ranges between annually.

At higher elevations or in more forested areas temperatures cool down but precipitation rises. For instance even though the Desierto de los Leones National Park can reach above 3000 meters above sea level, at only 2220 meters the forest has a much cooler weather than the above-mentioned neighborhoods. The median temperature here drops to and precipitation averages . All regions of the municipality experience the highest rainfall from June through September and the lowest from November through February.

The climate charts illustrate the differences between two regions within Álvaro Obregón.

===Flora and fauna===
The flora and fauna of the borough of Álvaro Obregón developed during prehistoric times.

Nowadays, the vegetation is determined by factors such as soil, water and climate, consisting in the lower part of the municipality&#x27;s territory, in trees and bushes that have been planted in some green or recreative areas that surround the urbanised areas. In the middle area, between 2,500 and 3,000 meters, exist mesophile forests that cover ravines and gullies with epiphytous vegetation such as mosses, ferns and woody creepers. In the lava rocky region there are endemic plants such as: palo loco, palo dulce, tabaquillo, tepozán and copal; species that have been preserved in the ecologic reveroir of the UNAM. The region of great vegetation density comprises the high elevations, where there are located mixed forests, with abundancy in pines and oaks. The primary tree species are oaks, limoncillo and stands of pine, that generally grow together; the more common pines are the ocotes (Pinus moctezumae) and the Mexican mountain pine (Pinus Hartwegui), this last ones resistant to the environmental conditions of the area and due to pollution are present in a low density.

Above 3,000 meters there are coniferous forests where oak and pines dominate, that can achieve heights between 5 and 12 meters. In the southern part of the municipality there are small stands of fir trees that do not reach a great development.
In the region of Tizapán, San Jerónimo and El Batán there are fossils belonging to the Upper Pleistocene. On June 17, 1959, the paleontologist Manuel Maldonado Koerdell, the professor Francisco González Rul and the archeologist Arturo Romano, investigated the fossils of a horse and a mammoth &quot;archidiskidon impera tor leidy&quot;, that lived approximately between 8 and 10 thousand years before Christ. This fossil remains, the first to be found in the whole Valley of Mexico, were located in excavations of 0.60 and 1.80 meters in the tepetate layers that are known as Tacubaya strata.

Other findings were unveiled on August 27 of the same year in the banks of the San Ángel river, in the enlargement of Las Águilas Avenue, around the town of Tlacopac.

The fauna was very varied in prehispanic times, but most of the species have become extinct. The mountain fauna was particularly rich in precious and rapacious birds.

Many of the mammals have disappeared or are in danger of extinction. In the region the while tailed deer, the lynx and the coyote were once plentiful, but the presence of man, that for many years practised hunting in the higher parts of the territory, eliminated them.

Currently, between 2,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level there remains a large fauna, but because of its nearness to the population centers it is easily accessible and thus disturbed. In the Sierra de las Cruces, a few decades ago there can still be found mammals such as the opossum, the armadillo, shrew, rabbit, tree squirrel, ardillón, land squirrel, gopher, mice, mountain mouse, pine mouse, volcano mouse, alfarero mouse and fox, even though their current populations are much diminished.

In the region there can be found the following birds: coquita, hummingbird, , , , , amongst others. In terms of reptiles the most common are lizards, rattlesnakes, and in rocky regions, mainly snakes. In amphibians there are salamanders that inhabit the trunks of trees, frogs and ajolotes. The most distinct insects are those who inhabit the rotten trunks of pines, the bark worn. This xylophagus coleopterous and their adults live below the bark of such trees. Amongst phytophagous invertebrates there are moths of the geometrid family, whose larvae became a serious plague in the abies forest. Another butterfly that inhabited this forest, but without feeding directly from the abies, is the Synopcia eximia, whose larvae eat tepozán (Buddleia).

<doc id="394272" wikidata="Q384522" url="?curid=394272" title="David Lewis (philosopher)">
<text>David Kellogg Lewis (September 28, 1941 – October 14, 2001) was an American philosopher. Lewis taught briefly at UCLA and then at Princeton University from 1970 until his death. He is closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than 30 years.

Lewis made significant contributions in philosophy of mind, philosophy of probability, epistemology, philosophical logic, aesthetics, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of time and philosophy of science. In most of these fields he is considered among the most important figures of recent decades. Lewis is most famous for his work in metaphysics, philosophy of language and semantics, in which his books &quot;On the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (1986) and &quot;Counterfactuals&quot; (1973) are considered classics. His works on the logic and semantics of counterfactual conditionals are broadly used by philosophers and linguists along with a competing account from Robert Stalnaker; together the Stalnaker–Lewis theory of counterfactuals has become perhaps the most pervasive and influential account of its type in the philosophical and linguistic literature. His metaphysics incorporated seminal contributions to quantified modal logic, the development of counterpart theory, counterfactual causation, and the position called &quot;Humean supervenience&quot;. Most comprehensively in &quot;On the Plurality of Worlds&quot;, Lewis defended modal realism: the view that possible worlds exist as concrete entities in logical space, and that our world is one among many equally real possible ones.

== Early life and education ==
Lewis was born in Oberlin, Ohio, to John D. Lewis, a professor of government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kellogg Lewis, a medieval historian. He was the grandson of the Presbyterian minister Edwin Henry Kellogg and the great-grandson of the Presbyterian missionary and Hindi expert Samuel H. Kellogg.

Lewis attended Oberlin High School, where he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959–60), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H. P. Grice, P. F. Strawson, and J. L. Austin. His year at Oxford played an important role in his decision to study philosophy. Lewis received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1967, where he studied under W. V. O. Quine, whose views he would later dispute. It was there he took a seminar with the Australian philosopher J. J. C. Smart. Smart recalled, &quot;I taught David Lewis, or rather, he taught me.&quot;

Lewis joined the philosophy department at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1966. In 1970, he moved to Princeton University, where he spent the remainder of his career.

== Early work on convention ==
Lewis&#x27;s first monograph was &quot;Convention: A Philosophical Study&quot; (1969), which is based on his doctoral dissertation and uses concepts of game theory to analyze the nature of social conventions. It won the American Philosophical Association&#x27;s first Franklin Matchette Prize for the best book published in philosophy by a philosopher under 40. Lewis claimed that social conventions, such as the convention in most states that one drives on the right (not on the left), the convention that the original caller will re-call if a phone conversation is interrupted, etc., are solutions to so-called &quot;&#x27;co-ordination problems&#x27;&quot;. Co-ordination problems were at the time of Lewis&#x27;s book an under-discussed kind of game-theoretical problem; most game-theoretical discussion had centered on problems where the participants are in conflict, such as the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.

Co-ordination problems are problematic, for, though the participants have common interests, there are several solutions. Sometimes one of the solutions is &quot;salient&quot;, a concept invented by the game-theorist and economist Thomas Schelling (by whom Lewis was much inspired). For example, a co-ordination problem that has the form of a meeting may have a salient solution if there is only one possible spot to meet in town. But in most cases, we must rely on what Lewis calls &quot;precedent&quot; for a salient solution. If both participants know that a particular co-ordination problem, say &quot;which side should we drive on?&quot;, has been solved in the same way numerous times before, both know that both know this, both know that both know that both know this, etc. (this particular state Lewis calls common knowledge, and it has since been a frequent topic of discussion among philosophers and game theorists), then they will easily solve the problem. That they have solved the problem successfully will be seen by even more people, and thus the convention will spread in the society. A convention is thus a behavioral regularity that sustains itself because it serves the interests of everyone involved. Another important feature of a convention is that a convention could be entirely different: one could just as well drive on the left; it is more or less arbitrary that one drives on the right in the US, for example.

Lewis&#x27;s main goal in the book, however, was not simply to provide an account of convention but rather to investigate the &quot;platitude that language is ruled by convention&quot; (Convention, p. 1.) The book&#x27;s last two chapters (Signalling Systems and Conventions of Language; cf. also &quot;Languages and Language&quot;, 1975) make the case that a population&#x27;s use of a language consists of conventions of truthfulness and trust among its members. Lewis recasts in this framework notions such as truth and analyticity, claiming that they are better understood as relations between sentences and a language rather than as properties of sentences.

== Counterfactuals and modal realism ==
Lewis went on to publish &quot;Counterfactuals&quot; (1973), which gives a modal analysis of the truth conditions of counterfactual conditionals in possible world semantics and the governing logic for such statements. According to Lewis, the counterfactual &quot;If kangaroos had no tails they would topple over&quot; is true if in all worlds most similar to the actual world where the antecedent &quot;if kangaroos had no tails&quot; is true, the consequent that kangaroos in fact topple over is also true. Lewis introduced the now standard &quot;would&quot; conditional operator ◻→ to capture these conditionals&#x27; logic. A sentence of the form A ◻→ C is true on Lewis&#x27;s account for the same reasons given above. If there is a world maximally similar to ours where kangaroos lack tails but do not topple over, the counterfactual is false. The notion of similarity plays a crucial role in the analysis of the conditional. Intuitively, given the importance in our world of tails to kangaroos remaining upright, in the most similar worlds to ours where they have no tails they presumably topple over more frequently and so the counterfactual comes out true. This treatment of counterfactuals is closely related to an independently discovered account of conditionals by Robert Stalnaker, and so this kind of analysis is called Stalnaker-Lewis theory. The crucial areas of dispute between Stalnaker&#x27;s account and Lewis&#x27;s are whether these conditionals quantify over constant or variable domains (strict analysis vs. variable-domain analysis) and whether the Limit assumption should be included in the accompanying logic. Linguist Angelika Kratzer has developed a competing theory for counterfactual or subjunctive conditionals, &quot;premise semantics&quot;, which aims to give a better heuristic for determining the truth of such statements in light of their often vague and context-sensitive meanings. Kratzer&#x27;s premise semantics does not diverge from Lewis&#x27;s for counterfactuals but aims to spread the analysis between context and similarity to give more accurate and concrete predictions for counterfactual truth conditions.

===Realism about possible worlds===
What made Lewis&#x27;s views about counterfactuals controversial is that whereas Stalnaker treated possible worlds as imaginary entities, &quot;made up&quot; for the sake of theoretical convenience, Lewis adopted a position his formal account of counterfactuals did not commit him to, namely modal realism. On Lewis&#x27;s formulation, when we speak of a world where I made the shot that in this world I missed, we are speaking of a world just as real as this one, and although we say that in that world I made the shot, more precisely it is not I but a &quot;counterpart&quot; of mine who was successful.

Lewis had already proposed this view in some of his earlier papers: &quot;Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic&quot; (1968), &quot;Anselm and Actuality&quot; (1970), and &quot;Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies&quot; (1971). The theory was widely considered implausible, but Lewis urged that it be taken seriously. Most often the idea that there exist infinitely many causally isolated universes, each as real as our own but different from it in some way, and that alluding to objects in this universe as necessary to explain what makes certain counterfactual statements true but not others, meets with what Lewis calls the &quot;incredulous stare&quot; (Lewis, &quot;On the Plurality of Worlds&quot;, 2005, pp. 135–137). He defends and elaborates his theory of extreme modal realism, while insisting that there is nothing extreme about it, in &quot;On the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (1986). Lewis acknowledges that his theory is contrary to common sense, but believes its advantages far outweigh this disadvantage, and that therefore we should not be hesitant to pay this price.

According to Lewis, &quot;actual&quot; is merely an indexical label we give a world when we are in it. Things are necessarily true when they are true in all possible worlds. (Lewis is not the first to speak of possible worlds in this context. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and C.I. Lewis, for example, both speak of possible worlds as a way of thinking about possibility and necessity, and some of David Kaplan&#x27;s early work is on the counterpart theory. Lewis&#x27;s original suggestion was that all possible worlds are equally concrete, and the world in which we find ourselves is no realer than any other possible world.)

=== Criticisms ===
This theory has faced a number of criticisms. In particular, it is not clear how we could know what goes on in other worlds. After all, they are causally disconnected from ours; we can&#x27;t look into them to see what is going on there. A related objection is that, while people are concerned with what they could have done, they are not concerned with what people in other worlds, no matter how similar to them, do. As Saul Kripke once put it, a presidential candidate could not care less whether someone else, in another world, wins an election, but does care whether he himself could have won it (Kripke 1980, p. 45).

Another criticism of the realist approach to possible worlds is that it has an inflated ontology—by extending the property of concreteness to more than the singular actual world it multiplies theoretical entities beyond what should be necessary to its explanatory aims, thereby violating the principle of parsimony, Occam&#x27;s razor. But the opposite position could be taken on the view that the modal realist reduces the categories of possible worlds by eliminating the special case of the actual world as the exception to possible worlds as simple abstractions.

Possible worlds are employed in the work of Kripke and many others, but not in the concrete sense Lewis propounded. While none of these alternative approaches has found anything near universal acceptance, very few philosophers accept Lewis&#x27;s brand of modal realism.

=== Influence ===
At Princeton, Lewis was a mentor of young philosophers and trained dozens of successful figures in the field, including several current Princeton faculty members, as well as people now teaching at a number of the leading philosophy departments in the U.S. Among his prominent students were Robert Brandom, L. A. Paul, J. David Velleman, Peter Railton, Phillip Bricker, Cian Dorr, and Joshua Greene. His direct and indirect influence is evident in the work of many prominent philosophers of the current generation.

== Later life and death ==

Lewis suffered from severe diabetes for much of his life, which eventually grew worse and led to kidney failure. In July 2000 he received a kidney transplant from his wife Stephanie. The transplant allowed him to work and travel for another year, before he died suddenly and unexpectedly from further complications of his diabetes, on October 14, 2001.

Since his death a number of posthumous papers have been published, on topics ranging from truth and causation to philosophy of physics. &quot;Lewisian Themes&quot;, a collection of papers on his philosophy, was published in 2004. A two-volume collection of his correspondence, &quot;Philosophical Letters of David K. Lewis&quot;, was published in 2020. A 2015 poll of philosophers conducted by Brian Leiter ranked Lewis the fourth most important Anglophone philosopher active between 1945 and 2000, behind only Quine, Kripke, and Rawls.

Lewis published five volumes containing 99 papers—almost all the papers he published in his lifetime. They discuss his counterfactual theory of causation, the concept of semantic score, a contextualist analysis of knowledge, and a dispositional value theory, among many other topics.
*&quot;Philosophical Papers, Vol. I&quot; (1983) includes his early work on counterpart theory and the philosophy of language and of mind.
*&quot;&quot; (1986) includes his work on counterfactuals, causation, and decision theory, where he promotes his principal principle about rational belief. Its preface discusses Humean supervenience, the name Lewis gave to his overarching philosophical project.

Lewis&#x27;s monograph &quot;Parts of Classes&quot; (1991), on the foundations of mathematics, sketched a reduction of set theory and Peano arithmetic to mereology and plural quantification. Very soon after its publication, Lewis became dissatisfied with some aspects of its argument; it is currently out of print (his paper &quot;Mathematics is megethology&quot;, in &quot;Papers in Philosophical Logic&quot;, is partly a summary and partly a revision of &quot;Parts of Classes&quot;)

<text>Azcapotzalco ( ; ; from &quot;&quot; “anthill” + &quot;&quot; “place”; literally, “In the place of the anthills”) is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. Azcapotzalco is in the northwestern part of Mexico City.

The town began in the pre-Hispanic era and was the seat of the Tepanec dominion until the Aztec Triple Alliance overthrew it. After that it was a rural farming area becoming part of the Federal District of Mexico City in the mid-19th century. In the 20th century the area was engulfed by the urban sprawl of Mexico City. Today it is 100% urbanized and is a center of industry.

==Geography==

The municipality of Azcapotzalco is in the Valley of Mexico with its eastern half on the lakebed of the former Lake Texcoco and the west on more solid ground. The historic center is on the former shoreline of this lake. The average altitude is 2240 meters above sea level. Politically, the municipality extends over 34.5km2 in the northwest of the Federal District of Mexico City, bordering the municipality of Gustavo A. Madero, Cuauhtémoc, Miguel Hidalgo along with the municipalities of Tlalnepantla de Baz, and Naucalpan in the State of Mexico.

It has a semi-humid temperate climate with an average temperature of 15C.

As the municipality is 100% urbanized, there are no ecological reserves. It is divided into 2,723 city blocks. There are 54 parks which have no wild vegetation but rather planted species such as willow, cedar and pine trees. These parks cover 100.51 hectares, which is 2.9% of the entire municipality. The most important of these are the Parque Tezozómoc and Alameda Norte, which together account for 52.4 hectares.

Parque Tezozomoc was inaugurated in 1982 designed as a scaled replica of the Valley of Basin of Mexico in the pre-Hispanic era. The Alameda Norte park is next to the Ferrería station. It has a pond which was used as an ice rink and playing field but was rehabilitated in the 2000s.
Other important green areas include community squares such as Plaza Hidalgo, sports centers, college campuses, especially that of the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, community parks and cemeteries.

Sports facilities cover about 67 hectares of the municipality with 70 fields and sports centers open to the public. These include the Deportivo Renovacion Nacional, Deportivo Reynosa, Centro Deportivo Ferrocarrilero and the Unidad Deportiva Benito Juarez. Deportivo Reynosa used to host one of Mexico City&#x27;s temporary “artificial beaches” consisting of pools and a sand area, which were constructed by the city government as a service to the poor. The municipality has cemeteries which are counted as green spaces, especially San Isidro because of its large size.

There is little surface water with the exception of the Río de los Remedios which is primarily used for drainage of wastewater. The lowering of water tables in the valley has led to large cracks developing in areas of the municipality which has caused damage to infrastructure. The municipality is flat with inclines of between zero and five percent with no prominent elevations. Because of its flatness, flooding is a problem in heavy rain, especially in areas such as Santiago Ahuizotla, Nueva Santa María, San Pedro Xalpa and Pro Hogar.

Sixty five percent of the municipality is occupied by about 500 industries which use toxic substances. There are hundreds of km of underground gas lines. Nine communities have been classified as high risk because they are surrounded by industries. There are 250 chemical producers mostly concentrated in Colonia Industrial Vallejo which make ethanol, cyanide compounds, phosphates, organic solvents and more.

Air pollution is a significant problem in the municipality as it is in the rest of Mexico City. Most comes from vehicular traffic and industry; it includes ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide as well as suspended particles. Noise pollution is caused by industry and truck traffic. Although the municipality has no surface water, water pollution in its drainage is a problem from residential areas and industry. Industry contamination is mostly in the form of poor water use and the dumping of prime materials often from cleaning and includes organic matter, grease, soaps and detergents, dyes, solvents and more. Solid waste production is a problem from industrial and residential sources. The amount of waste produced in the municipality has grown almost seven-fold since the 1980s at a current rate of 571 tons per day.

Due to the proximity of the old 18 de Marzo refinery (which was part of the municipality), there are many underground pipes some of which are still in use. Even more are associated with another nearby but active refinery Terminal de Almacenamiento y Distribución de Destiados de Pemex-Refinación. Most pipelines are found under Avenida Tezozomoc, 5 de Mayo, Salónica, Eje 3 Norte, Ferrocarril Central and Encarnación Ortiz.

==Communities==
Originally the town of Azcapotzalco consisted of neighborhoods from the pre-Hispanic period. Many of these neighborhoods exist to this day, called colonias, barrios or pueblos. A number of them maintain individual cultural traits despite being fully engulfed by the urban sprawl of Mexico City. These include San Juan Tlihuaca, San Pedro Xalpa, San Bartolo Cahualtongo, Santiago Ahuizotla, San Miguel Amantla, Santa Inés, Santo Domingo, San Francisco Tetecala, San Marcos, Los Reyes and Santa María Malinalco. Today, the municipality has 61 colonias, 15 pueblos and 11 barrios. In 1986, INAH designated the center of Azcapotzalco as a historical monument.

In 2011, the historic center was designated as a &quot;Barrio Mágico&quot;.

The most important community remains the former town of Azcapotzalco, also called the historic center, marked by Plaza Hidalgo. This square consists of fenced stone paths surrounding gardens. Its two main focal points are a statue of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla facing Avenida Azcapotzalco and a six-sided kiosk in the center. On Saturdays, chess players convene to play during the afternoon. Café Alameda is on Plaza Hidalgo — a café and bar with a rock and roll theme. It has images of Jim Morrison, Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon lining its walls. At night on weekends, it hosts live bands which attracts youths from the area. The Historic Archive of Azcapotzalco is on the south side of Plaza Hidalgo. It contains a mural painted by Antonio Padilla Pérez titled &quot;Origen y Trascendencia del Pueblo Tepaneca&quot;. The building contains archeological pieces.

Across the street from the plaza are the parish church and the former municipal hall. The parish and former monastery of San Felipe and Santiago Apóstoles dates from 1565. It has the largest atrium in Mexico City, surrounded by a thick wall with inverted arches. The main church has a large Baroque portal which contains the main door topped by a choir window. To the side there is a slender bell tower with pilasters on it four sides. Under the tower, there is an image of a red ant. A local legend says that when the ant climbs the bell tower, the world will end. To the right of the portal are three arches that front the former Dominican monastery. The interior of the church has a Baroque gilded altarpiece with Salomonic columns which contains images of the Virgin Mary. The main altar is Neoclassical. To the side there is a chapel called the Capilla del Rosario from 1720 with Baroque and Churrigueresque altars. The former cloisters has remains of its former mural work.

Next to the parish and taking over some of its former atrium space is the Casa de Cultura cultural center. The building was constructed in 1891 originally as the municipal hall for Azcapotzalco. It has a sandstone portal with a balcony on the upper level featuring a double arch and an ironwork railing from 1894. The building has three exhibition halls on the lower level. The upper level is dedicated to the Sala Tezozomoc hall, larger than the lower halls combined. The garden areas have rosebushes and orange trees. These areas host art exhibits, workshops, classes and other cultural events. The center has a mural called &quot;La herencia tepaneca en ul umbral del tercer milenio&quot; by Arturo García Bustos, a student of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. In 1986, the building was named a historic monument by INAH and converted into its current use in 1991 on its 100th anniversary.

The main street in the historic center is Avenida Azcapotzalco, which is home to long-established businesses. One of these is the Nevería y Cafetería El Nevado, which has a 1950s rock and roll atmosphere, uniformed waitresses and mid 20th-century furnishings. There are cantinas such as El Dux de Venicia (over 100 years old) with its original furniture and La Luna established in 1918 and noted for its “torta” sandwiches.

The Principe Tlaltecatzin Archeological Museum is a private institution founded by Octavio Romera that focuses on pre-Hispanic pieces related to the Azcapotzalco area. It is the result of a lifelong exploration and study of artifacts he found since he was a child. He educated himself and is considered an expert in the pre-Hispanic history and archeology of the area.

The oldest library of the municipality, Biblioteca Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, has murals by Juan O’Gorman.

In addition to the historic center there are other important communities, many of which maintain old traditions. The Barrio de San Miguel Amantla is near the former 18 de Marzo refinery. It is one of the oldest in the municipality with one of the oldest churches. In the Mesoamerican period, it was noted for its plumería or the making of objects with feathers. The oldest standing church is in San Miguel Amantla which had fallen into ruins but was rebuilt using the original blocks. Barrio de San Luis is one of over 20 which date from the Mesoamerican period. It is noted for its church and its barbacoa. The Barrio de Santa Apolonia Tezcolco was the site of the Tezozomoc&#x27;s treasury. The Barrio de San Juan Tlilhuaca is the largest neighborhood in the municipality and contains the largest church. This church is famous for its passion play for Holy Week and is surrounded by old cypress trees said to have been planted as tribute to Moctezuma.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, areas in the municipality became the site of country homes for the wealthy of Mexico City. Today a number of chalet and English style homes with pitched roofs, towers, porches and gardens can be seen especially in the Clavería neighborhood. This neighborhood was as exclusive as Colonia Juárez and Colonia Condesa at that time. Of the housing developments construction in the latter 20th century, the most important is the Unidad Habitational El Rosario. This apartment complex has 170 buildings, with 7,606 apartments housing over 50,500 residents. It is the largest of its kind in Latin America.

==Socioeconomics==

The municipality as it is found today is a product of the growth of the Mexico City area in the 20th century, especially since the 1970s. The population rose from 534,554 in 1970 to a peak of 601,524 in 1980. The population began to drop to 474,688 in 1990 and 441,008 in 2000. In addition to loss of employment, reasons for the population loss include the 1985 earthquake and the high cost of living space, especially compared to neighboring state of Mexico. Problems in the municipality include uncontrolled street vending, historic buildings abandoned or used as commercial space, lack of maintenance of parks, and heavy traffic. This is particularly problematic in the historic center.

21.7% of the territory is used for industry, 15.5% for storage, 42.12% for housing, open spaces 2.9%, and mixed use 17.78%. Overall, the level of socioeconomic marginalization is low compared to the other municipalities, coming in 12th of 16 in 2005. However, areas of the municipality have very high levels of socioeconomic socialization including Barrio Coltongo, Nueva España, Pasteros, Porvenir, Barrio de San Andrés, Pueblo de San Andrés, San Francisco Xocotitla, San Martín Xochinahuac, San Miguel Amantla, San Rafael, San Sebastián, Santa Barbara, Santiago Ahuizotla. Santo Tomas, Tierra Nueva and the Unidad Habitacional Cruz Roja Tepantongo. Sixty nine percent of the communities are considered to be of medium to high marginalization with 10 communities considered to be of low socioeconomic marginalization: Ampliación San Pedro Xalpa, Ferrería, Industrial Vallejo, Las Salinas and Santa Cruz de las Salinas.

About 80% of the municipality&#x27;s population is working age. Just over 53% of the population is employed. The rest are mostly students, homemakers and retired. Almost all employed persons work in industry, commerce and services. Industry employs just over 21%.

The most important sector to the municipality&#x27;s economy is industry despite its decline since the very late 20th century. Industry accounts for about 72% of the municipality&#x27;s production with commerce and services accounting for the rest. The industrial zone in Azcapotzalco is one of the most important in the Federal District. This zone is centered on Colonia Industrial Vallejo extending into San Salvador Xochimanca, Coltongo, Santo Tomas, San Martin Xochinahuac, Santa Ines, Santo Domingo, Ampliacion Petrolera, Industrial San Antonio, San Miguel Amantla, San Pablo Xalpa and San Juan Tlihuaca. Much of the industry has slowed or halted due to competition abroad which can make them cheaper. This has led to efforts to reorient the municipality&#x27;s economy because of the high rates of unemployment and migration out of the area. About sixty percent of the Federal District&#x27;s heavy industry is in the municipality. The municipality accounts for about 40% of the Federal District&#x27;s industrial zoning and provides over 15% of industrial employment.

Housing in the municipality is varied. Most residential buildings (45%) are two or three levels, as a single house with two or three families. Apartment buildings average about five floors. Since the 1970s, there has been construction of extremely large apartment complexes such as the Unidad Habitacional El Rosario. There are 340 “vecindades,” irregular structures generally made with construction and industrial waste, which can be found mostly in Colonia Pro-Hogar, Colonia Ampliacion San Pedro Xalpa, Coltongo and Liberación. Azcapotzalco is one of the city most crowded municipalities, mostly due to the large apartment complexes, but the decline in population has alleviated this somewhat.

Azcapotzalco is ranked 9th of 16 municipalities in reported crime which is often associated with gangs and the use of drugs. In the municipality there are 70 communities considered to have high drug use accounting for about 45% of the total population. These include La Raza, El Rosario, Prohogar, Industrial Vallejo, La Preciosa, San Pedro Xalpa and ObreraMundial. There are crime gangs identified by police such as Los Pepes, Los Negros and Los Maquedas. The most frequent violent crimes include muggings, car theft and robbery of businesses — much of which is related to the socioeconomic problems of the area.

The municipality provides services to ease socioeconomic problems such as health, education, recreation and other programs. It runs 20 traditional fixed markets and has offered vendors courses in marketing. In 2008 the city sponsored an entrepreneurship program with the Instituto Politécinco Nacional and the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana to help deal with the loss of employment. Starting in 2008, the municipality has offered free wedding ceremonies and certificates to encourage couples to formally legalize their unions. The wedding ceremonies involve hundreds of couples who are married at the same time.

==History==

The name is derived from Nahuatl and means “ant hill” with the municipality Aztec glyph depicting a red ant surrounded by corn. It comes from a legend that says that after the creation of the Fifth Sun, the god Quetzalcoatl was tasked with recreating man. To do this, he needed to enter the realm of the dead, Mictlan, to recover the bones of men from the Fourth Sun. Ants helped Quetzalcoatl to find the realm of the dead and bring the bones up as well as grains of corn. Another version of the legend relates to the discovery of corn by observing that ants had put grains underground and corn plants grew there.

The very early history of the area follows that of the rest of the Valley of Mexico. About 7,000 years ago, hunter/gatherers arrived to the valley attracted by the vegetation and large game such as mammoths. Fossilized mammoth, bison and other bones were found when Line 6 of the Metro was constructed. When the large game died out, the inhabitants of the valley turned to agriculture, forming permanent villages sometime between 5000 and 2000 BCE. Plants were domesticated — the most important of which were corn, squash, chili peppers, avocados and beans.

Pottery and villages were founded all over the Valley of Mexico from 2200 BCE to 1200 BCE, supported by agriculture with some hunting and fishing. From 1200 to 700BCE the most important villages were in the south of the valley. Around 200 BCE, the Teotihuacan civilization arose and the Azcapotzalco area rose in importance as well, being in the empire&#x27;s political and cultural sphere. Villages that grew during this time included San Miguel Amantla, Santiago Ahuixotla and Santa Lucia which are in the south of the modern municipality. When Teotihuacan waned in 800 CE, the Azcapotzalco area remained important as a center of that culture, becoming an important ceremonial center. When Tula rose, Toltec influence then dominated Azcapotzalco and the rest of the Valley of Mexico. Toltec influence is most evident in ceramic finds from Santiago Ahuizotla and was possibly a Toltec tribute city.

When Tula fell, there were new migrations into the Valley of Mexico including Otomis, Mazahuas and Matlatzincas. One of these groups was led by a chieftain called Matlacoatl in the 12th century. Legend states that he established the village of Azcapotzaltongo, which is now Villa Nicolás Romero in 1152, but its development is best documented between 1200 and 1230. The village grew to become the Tepanec Empire in the 12th and 13th centuries with a ruling dynasty with the territory expanding over the Valley of Mexico. Acolhuatzin was leader from 1283 to 1343. He married a daughter of Xolotl of Tenayuca and then moved the capital of the dominion to what is now the historic center of Azcapotzalco, on the edge of what was Lake Texcoco. He allowed the Mexica to settle on Tepaneca lands, founding Tenochtitlan, in exchange for tribute and military service. The last major ruler of Azcapotzalco was Tezozomoc who ruled from 1367 to 1427. Under him the empire reached over most of the Valley of Mexico into Cuernavaca and north into Tenayuca and Atotonilco. This made Azcapotzalco the most important city in the Valley of Mexico and archeological work related to this dominion continues to this day.

In 2012, burials and remains of buildings were found the San Simon Pochtlan neighborhood, believed to have belonged to Tepaneca traders between 1200 and 1300CE. Other settlements were found in the same area when Line 6 was constructed in 1980.

Under the Tepanecas, conquered areas were allowed to keep their own leadership as long as they paid tribute and performed military service. In 1427, these leaders included Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco, Izcoatl of Tenochtitlan and Totoquihuaztli of Tlacopan. When Tezozomoc died, there was a power struggle for the throne which allowed these tribute-paying entities a chance to rebel, forming the Triple Alliance and defeating Azcapotzalco in 1428. The former Tepanec lands were divided among the three leaders and the city of Azcapotzalco was destroyed and turned into a slave market.

With the end of the Tepanec Empire political and economic power shifted to Texcoco, Tlatelolco and Tenochtitlan.

The area remained ruled by the Aztec Empire until 1521, when the Aztecs fell to the Spanish when Azcapotzalco had a population of 17,000. From 1528 to 1529 the Dominicans were in charge of the evangelization of the area under Fray Lorenzo de la Asunción, who built churches of over the former Tepaneca ceremonial center dedicated to the Apostles Phillip and James. Despite accounts that Lorenzo de la Asuncion defended the indigenous against their Spanish overlords, during the 16th century, the indigenous population of the area fell from 17,000 to about 3,000 due to mistreatment and disease.

During the colonial period, the area not underwater was home to haciendas, resulting from the partition of lands among the conquistadors and their descendants. In 1709, Azcapotzalco was formed by 27 communities, divided into six haciendas and nine ranches. Azcapotzalco was the scene of one of the last battle of the Mexican War of Independence with the Army of the Three Guarantees under Anastasio Bustamante defeating royalist forces on August 19, 1821, shortly before Agustín de Iturbide entered Mexico City.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the area was rural, far outside Mexico City proper, part of the State of Mexico. It was organized as a municipality in 1824 with the town of Azcapotzalco serving as the seat of government for ranches and haciendas such as Ameleo, San Rafael, San Marcos, El Rosario, Pantaco, San Isidro, San Lucua, Acaletengo and Azpeitia along with communities such as Concepción, San Simón, San Martín, Santo Domingo, Los Reyes, Santa Catarina, Santa Bárbara, San Andrés, San Marcos, San Juan Mexicanos, San Juan Tlilhuaca, Xiocoyahualco, Santa Cruz del Monte, San Mateo, San Pedro, San Bartolome, San Francisco, Santa Apolonia, Santa Lucia, Santiago, San Miguel Ahuizutla, Santa Cruz Acayuca, Nextengo, San Lucas, San Bernabe, Santa Maria, San Sebastian and Santo Tomas. When it became part of the Federal District of Mexico City in 1854, Azcapotzalco was classified as a town as part of the Guadalupe municipality but in 1899 it became the head of its own municipality. The town of Azcapotzalco was still separate from Mexico City by about two leagues. In the 19th century the community of San Juan Tlilhuaca was known for its warlocks. By the end of the 19th century, the municipality had a population of about 11,000 with 7,500 in the seat.

At that time, the area became popular with the wealthy who built country homes, especially along the Mexico-Tacuba road and near the town of Azcapotzalco. This construction was the forerunner of many of the municipality&#x27;s more modern neighborhoods. In the first decades of the 20th century, rail lines were constructed, including a trolley that connected the town of Azcapotzalco with Mexico City center in 1913.

According to the 1900 census, the Federal District has an Azcapotzalco District which consisted of the municipalities of Azcapotzalco and Tacuba. These districts were eliminated in 1903, creating thirteen municipalities, of which Azcapotzalco was one. In 1928, the District was reorganized again into municipalities which the town of Azcapotzalco still heads.

From the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1920, the Mexico City area began a process of rapid growth, with the modernization of infrastructure and the establishment of industry in the area. The first factories in the municipality were established in Colonia Vallejo in 1929, which lead to the industrialization of most of the area. The Refinería 18 de Marzo refinery was founded at the end of the 1930s and attracted even more industry. Today, it has been abandoned. In 1944, the federal government formally established the industrial zone of Colonia Vallejo. Around the same time the government also established a major rail station for cargo at Pantaco.

The industrialization created new residential neighborhoods, mostly for the working classes. Two exception were Colonia Clavería and Nueva Santa María which remained middle class in the mid 20th century, mostly descendants of those who had built country homes. In the latter 20th century, the rest of the vacant land in the municipality was built over to make the territory 100% urbanized. The urbanized area in the municipality increased from 1.8% in 1940 to 95.2% at the beginning of the 1980s. Most of this last construction in the north and west was residential areas. In the 1970s, the Azcapotzalco campus of the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana was established as a major educational center for Mexico City as well as the El Rosario apartment complex, the largest of its kind in Latin America.

==Culture==

Residents of Azcapotzalco are referred to as Chintololos. There are several stories as to the origin of the term, but Azcapotzalco chronicler José Antonio Urdapilleta states that it came from a disrespectful Aztec term “tsintli- tololontic” which means excessively round buttock. Over time the pronunciation changed to the current and its disrespectful meaning disappeared.

Azcapotzalco holds one of the oldest continuous annual pilgrimages to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which has been done for over 475 years. It is considered to be the first one organized by the indigenous in Mexico with records indicating the first one done in 1532, only 11 months after the report of the appearance of the Virgin Mary to Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin. The annual event is known as the Fiesta de los Naturales in which leaders from 28 communities collect money and more as offering to Guadalupe. Before the procession sets off, there is a festival with fireworks and a mass to bless the pilgrims.

One legend of the area is about the “Enchanted Pool of Xancopina” a fresh water spring that existed during the pre-Hispanic era and where Moctezuma is said to have submerged much of his treasure after being defeated by the Spanish. It was where the Unidad Habitacional Cuitláhuac is now.
The first El Bajio restaurant was founded in Azcapotzalco and is still in operation. The chain specializes in Mexican food from the center of the country.

==Education==
The municipality has 228 schools and other public educational facilities from preschool to university levels. These include 61 preschools, 79 primary schools, 42 middle schools, 17 high/vocational schools, six night schools, eight special education schools, four middle schools for adults, one open enrollment facility and ten infant development centers. Private education includes 71 preschools, 21 elementary schools, six middle schools, five high school level institutions and one college. However, many of the schools at the basic levels lack maintenance. The illiteracy rate is 2.34 percent, lower than the 2.9 percent average of the Federal District. In 2007, the municipality became the second in Mexico City to open a recreational and educational video gaming center for children with the aim of stimulating cognitive and motor skills, at the Deportivo Calpulli sports center.

The two main higher education campuses are Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) and Escuela Superior de Ingenería Mecánica y Eléctrica (ESIME). In Colonia Reynosa Tamaulipas, the Azcapotzalco campus of the UAM was established in 1974 and has since grown to over 21 buildings include classrooms, laboratories, computer labs a 225,000 volume library and more. Its large campus is an important part of municipality efforts to maintain green spaces. In 2012, the UAM campus received 15 monumental sculptures from 15 notable artists such as Vicente Rojo, Manuel Felguérez, Gilberto Aceves Navarro and Gabriel Macotela. (The project is part of ongoing efforts to keep the campus as a cultural center in the north of the city.) The ESIME is part of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional which is dedicated to Electromechanical Engineering at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as research. It began as the Escuela Nacional de Artes y Oficios in the latter 19th century. Other institutions include the Colegio de Ciencias y Humanidades (CCH) affiliated with UNAM, TecMilenio Ferrería and UNITEC in San Salvador Xochimanca as well as installations related to Universidad Justo Sierra.

Public high schools of the Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal (IEMS) include the Escuela Preparatoria Azcapotzalco &quot;Melchor Ocampo&quot;.

==Transportation==

The municipality area has had a major road linking it to the historic center of Mexico City since the pre Hispanic period, today called the Mexico-Tacuba road. It continues to be a major thoroughfare. The development of industry in the municipality, then extending north and west in to panhandle of neighboring Mexico State has prompted interconnected infrastructure, especially in transportation. Major thoroughfares of this type include Avenida Aquiles Serdán, Calzada Vallejo (Circuito Interior), Eje 3, Eje 4 and Eje 5 Norte especially near the State of Mexico border. Because of its industry and links to other industrial areas in the State of Mexico, Azcapotzalco experiences very heavy traffic flow with an average of 800,000 vehicles transiting in or through it. Traffic jams are common, especially at rush hour and even at off-peak times due to faulty synchronization of traffic lights.

Mass transport options include the Mexico City Metro (with nine stations serving lines 6 and 7), the RTP bus system, the trolleybus system and a number of privately owned buses and taxis. Together they transport and estimated 30,000 people per day. Much of this traffic is commuters coming into the municipality from the State of Mexico through the El Rosario metro station and bus terminal.

<text>Parker and Lee was founded in 1904 by Ivy Lee and George F. Parker in New York City. Parker and Lee was the third ever public relations agency to be established in the United States. Parker had served as President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s press agent through all three of his campaigns.

Parker and Lee had clients such as Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the Rockefeller Family, the American Tobacco Company, the New York Subway System, and some Hollywood Studios. 

== About ==

The firm rose quickly in the years immediately after its founding, gaining lucrative clients like the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in 1906, which was at the time under public scrutiny for denying information and interviews to journalists. Ivy Lee supported a rate hike for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company workers, which the railroad had hired the firm to build support for a 5% rate hike. The firm devised a campaign which included all major stakeholders, media, railroad employees, customers, federally elected officials, etc. 

Parker and Lee also worked for the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company during the controversial 1915 oilmen&#x27;s strike, and later worked to end the American trade embargo on the Soviet Union. The firm came under fire during WWII because it had done consulting work for German industrial giant IG Farben.
