<text>This article lists political parties in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has a multi-party political system. Starting from the early 1950s, Sri Lankan politics was mostly dominated by two political parties and their respective coalitions:
* the centre-left social democratic Sri Lanka Freedom Party 
* the centre-right liberal conservative United National Party

Recently, however, the influence of the two parties has diminished significantly. In 2016, the right-wing populist Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa split from the SLFP, and following an unexpected victory in the 2018 local elections, replaced the SLFP as a main party, before becoming the ruling party following its victories in the 2019 presidential election and 2020 parliamentary election.

Meanwhile, the UNP suffered a split of its own in the lead-up to the 2020 parliamentary election, when deputy leader Sajith Premadasa split from the UNP and formed the Samagi Jana Balawegaya to contest in the election. The SJB-led coalition won the 2nd most seats in the election, thus making the SJB the main opposition party, while the UNP suffered an overwhelming defeat, only winning one national list seat.

Following widespread dissatisfaction with the traditional Sri Lankan political parties amidst the 2022 Sri Lankan protests, in 2024, the left-wing National People&#x27;s Power, a political alliance led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, saw a surge in popular support. Formerly a third party, the NPP emerged as the main left-wing party of Sri Lanka, winning both the presidential and parliamentary elections that year.

Other notable parties include the Tamil nationalist Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and the Islamist Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.

<doc id="409172" wikidata="Q3366922" url="?curid=409172" title="List of political parties in Somalia">
<text>This article lists [[Political party|political parties]] in [[Somalia]]. In 2017 an independent electoral commission was inaugurated with a mandate to oversee the process of registration of political parties in the country, according to Article 47 of the Federal Provisional Constitution which provides for an electoral system. The system guarantees participation of every individual who subscribes to a political party. NIEC has registered over 100 political parties, most of which still operate from outside the country for security reasons. For this reason, political parties still remain relatively weak in the country.

In October 2019 six parties joined to form the Forum for National Parties, an alliance founded by former president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed which has come together to address the political and security issues faced by Somalia. The alliance includes Himilo Qaran party, led by former President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, and Peace and Development Party led by current President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Other key leaders joining the coalition include Ilays party leader Abdulkadir Osoble, former South West President Sharif Hassan and former defense minister Mohamed Abdi, the first interim president of Azania.

==Overview and background==
During the civilian administration which existed prior to the seizure of power by the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) in 1969, there were a number of local political parties. Most notable of these early institutions was the Somali Youth League, the nation&#x27;s first political organization. Upon assuming office, the SRC (led by Siad Barre) outlawed all extant political parties, and established the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party to advocate a form of scientific socialism inspired by 1960s Soviet Union. Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 that saw the ouster of the Barre regime, many of the few remaining political parties gave way to autonomous or semi-autonomous regional states, or fragmented into feuding militia groups. After several unsuccessful national reconciliation efforts, a Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in 2000 with a five-year mandate leading toward the establishment of a new constitution and a transition to a representative government. The Federal Government of Somalia was established on August 20, 2012, concurrent with the end of the TFG&#x27;s interim mandate. It represents the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war.

On 29 May 2017, the Somali Political Parties Registration Office was established in Mogadishu. The office&#x27;s job is to bring the country to the party system and remove it from the current 4.5 clan power-sharing system. On 3 December 2017, the Independent Electoral Commission began registering political parties in Somalia for the first time in 50 years.

==Parties==



=== Current ===
As of 2023, the National Independent Electoral Commission (NIEC) has registered a total of 110 parties. Some of the notable ones include:
=== Former ===
===Puntland===
As of May 2020, there are 17 registered political parties in Puntland.

<text>This article lists political parties in Solomon Islands. Solomon Islands have a multi-party system with numerous political parties.

== Political culture ==
In most elections, no one party has won an absolute majority of seats and so usually parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. The one exception is the 1989 election, when the People&#x27;s Alliance Party (PAP) led by Solomon Mamaloni did win an absolute majority. However, in late 1990, Mamaloni broke away from the PAP and continued ruling in a coalition government until the 1993 election.

Many parties are established immediately prior to an election and most are very short-lived. Some will achieve no parliamentary representation and dissolve within a year. Others will achieve parliamentary representation but, having served their purpose, are then discarded.

The most enduring political parties in the Solomon Islands are the PAP and the Solomon Islands United Party, founded in 1979 and 1980, respectively. The PAP has led three governments and been in coalition in at least three more. The United Party led two governments in the 1980s however its representation has waned in recent years and after the 2006, it no longer had any parliamentary representatives.

<doc id="409176" wikidata="Q1745541" url="?curid=409176" title="List of political parties in Egypt">
<text>Egypt has had differing multi-party systems since independence, with a hiatus between 1953 and 1977, after which the current party law was enacted. Nevertheless, in practice the National Democratic Party was the long-time ruling party and dominated the Egyptian political arena, first under president Anwar Sadat, and then president Hosni Mubarak from its foundation in 1978, up until its dissolution in the wake of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, and the ousting of Mubarak. Under Mubarak, opposition parties were allowed, but were widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. On 28 March 2011, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces amended Political Party Law 40/1977, easing restrictions on the legal establishment of new political parties in Egypt, where many new parties covering the political spectrum were formed. After the 2013 popular coup/revolution, and a further seismic political shift, another wave of new parties were formed, a large number of which were aligned with current non-partisan president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. In December 2020, final results of the parliamentary election confirmed a clear majority of the pro-Sisi Mostaqbal Watan (Nation’s Future) Party.

== Restricted partisan pluralism (1977 – 25 January 2011) ==
Under the new &quot;Infitah&quot; (liberal realignment) of president Anwar Sadat, and in the aftermath of the 1973 October War and the peace process with Israel, Sadat’s decree in March 1976 founded a three-party platform within the framework of the Arab Socialist Union, representing the right, the center and the left, before spinning them off on 22 November of the same year into political parties. These three parties, were the first nucleus of the restricted partisan pluralism allowed by the Political Parties Law 40/1977:

* Egyptian Arab Socialist Party (1976).
* The Socialist Liberal Party (1976–2011).
* National Progressive Unionist Party (&quot;Ḥizb al-Tagammu&#x27; al-Watani al-Taqadomi al-Wahdawi&quot; – 1976).
* Parties established later by declaration by the Parties Affairs Committee (10):
* The New Wafd Party (1978).
* The National Democratic Party (1978–2011).
* The Socialist Labour Party (1978).
* The National Conciliation Party (2000).
* Al-Ghad Party (2004).
* The Free Social Constitutional Party (&quot;Al-Hizb Al-Distouri&quot; – 2004).
* The Democratic Peace Party (2005).
* The Conservative Party (2006).
* The Free Republican Party (&quot;Al-Hizb al-Gomhory al-Ahrar&quot; – 2006).
* The Democratic Front Party (2007).

Parties established by judicial rulings (11):

* The National Umma Party (1983).
* The Democratic Unionist Party (1990).
* The Egyptian Green Party (1990).
* Young Egypt Party (&quot;Misr Al-Fatah&quot; – 1990).
* People&#x27;s Democratic Party (1992).
* The Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (1992).
* Social Justice Party (1993).
* The Solidarity Party (&quot;Hizb Al-Takaful&quot; – 1995).
* Egypt 2000 Party (2001).
* Democratic Generation Party (&quot;Hizb El-Geel Al-Democrati&quot; – 2002).
* Egypt Youth Party (2005)

== Post-2011 revolution (2011–2013) ==
In the wake of the January 2011 uprising in Egypt, the deposition of Hosni Mubarak and dissolution of his National Democratic Party that ruled for over three decades, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces issued a decree-law 12/2011 amending certain provisions of the Political Parties Law 40/1977, after which many parties were formed.

The legislation was however criticized as discriminatory. Under the law new parties are now required to have at least 5,000 members from at least ten of Egypt&#x27;s provinces. Originally, new parties were only required to have 1,000 members. This was cited as a barrier for new parties before parliamentary elections which took place at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012. Also, new party leaders are required to raise at least LE1 million to publish the names of the founding members in two widely circulated dailies, seen as favoring wealthier interests. No parties are able to form on the basis of religion or class, ruling out the formation of Islamic and labor parties. However, in practice, religious parties have been allowed. After first being denied a license by the political parties commission, the Supreme Administrative Court allowed Gamaa Islamiya to form the Building and Development Party. The political parties commission allowed the Al Nour Party to be approved in May 2011, in part because it does not refer to the hudud in their electoral program. An article on the Daily News Egypt website states that religious parties have gone around the ban by not explicitly advocating a state based on Islam in their political programs.

* Freedom and Justice Party (2011–2014)
* Ghad al-Thawra (splintered from Al-Ghad – 2011)
* Free Egyptians party (&quot;Al-Masrieen Al-Ahrar&quot; – 2011)
* The Conference Party (&quot;Al-Mo&#x27;tamar&quot;)
* The Socialist Popular Alliance Party (&quot;Al-Tahaluf al-Sha&#x27;bi&quot; – 2011)
* The Egyptian Social Democratic Party (&quot;Al-Masri El-Democrati,&quot; merger of the Liberal Egyptian Party, and the Egyptian Democratic Party – 2011)
* Al-Nour Party (2011)
* The Justice Party &quot;(Al-Adl&quot; – 2011)
* The Constitution Party (&quot;Al-Dostour&quot; – 2012)
* Republican People&#x27;s Party (A&quot;l Shaab Al-Gomhouri&quot; – 2012)

== Post-2013 popular coup/revolution (2013–present) ==
On July 3, 2013, president Mohamed Morsi, the leader of the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) was removed from power in the aftermath of the June 30 popular coup/revolution, which later resulted in a new (2014) constitution banning parties based on religion, effectively dissolving the dominant FJP.

In June 2014, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became Egypt&#x27;s first president not affiliated with a political party. However, a number of pro-Sisi parties have since formed, and by 2018, 104 political parties were officially registered and approved by the Committee of Parties.

* Bread and Freedom Party (splintered from Social Popular Alliance – 2013, provisional)
* Homeland Defenders Party (&quot;Homat Watan&quot; – 2013)
* Sadat Democratic Party (2014)
* Nation&#x27;s Future Party (&quot;Mostakbal Watan&quot; – 2014)
* Popular Current (&quot;Al-Tayyar al-Shaabi&quot; – 2014)
* June 30 Party (2015)

==List of currently active parties==
Egyptian politics are subject to unique circumstances and often defy simple classification in terms of the political spectrum. Currently, over 100 registered political parties in Egypt exist. Groups are sometimes associated with the political left or right, especially in international circles, according to their stance on issues. While the current Egyptian constitution prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion, there are parties that seek to establish Islamic sharia laws, or uphold the article in the constitution that states that sharia law is the main source of legislation, and others that support the formation of a secular state. The following is a categorization of political parties based on their social, economical, and political orientation, as well as their legal status:

===Parties represented in the House of Representatives or the Senate===

Seychelles has a two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties (SPPF and SNP), with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.

===Parliamentary parties===

===Other parties===

The election of the National Assembly was held on the 22–24 October 2020. The Seychelles National Party, the Seychelles Party for Social Justice and Democracy and the Seychelles United Party formed a coalition, Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS). The coalition won the majority of the seats.

<text>The 4 Lexington Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the A Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it uses the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in Manhattan.

The 4 operates 24 hours a day, although service patterns vary based on the time of day. Daytime service operates between Woodlawn in the Bronx and Utica Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, making all stops in Bronx and express stops in Manhattan and in Brooklyn; limited rush hour service, as well as overnight service, is extended beyond Utica Avenue and originates and terminates at New Lots Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn. During rush hours in the peak direction, the 4 skips 138th Street–Grand Concourse. Overnight service makes all stops along the full route, but skips Hoyt Street in both directions. For up to an hour after evening events that are held at Yankee Stadium, a special downtown-only express service runs between and .

Until 1983, rush hour 4 trains originated and terminated at Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College in Brooklyn.

== Service history ==


===Under the Interborough Rapid Transit===
Service on what was later known as the 4 began on June 2, 1917, as the first portion of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line opened between 149th Street-Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road. Since the extension of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line between 149th Street and Grand Central was not yet open, this section was served by shuttle trains using elevated train cars. On April 15, 1918, with the extension of the Jerome Avenue Line to Woodlawn, shuttle service was also extended. On July 17, 1918, the Lexington Avenue Line local tracks were opened, allowing another shuttle service to run between 149th Street–Grand Concourse and Grand Central. On August 1, 1918, the entire Jerome and Lexington Avenue Lines were completed and the connection to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line at 42nd Street was removed. Trains began running between 167th Street and Bowling Green, with shuttles to Woodlawn.

On December 11, 1921, Lexington Avenue–Jerome Avenue subway trains began running north of 167th Street at all times replacing elevated trains, which ran to Woodlawn during rush hours, but from then on terminated at 167th Street during non-rush hours.

At a hearing of the New York State Transit Commission on October 15, 1924, about where it planned to allocate the second 100 of 350 new steel cars, it was announced that service on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line from Atlantic Avenue to Livonia Avenue was almost certainly going to be increased by 25 to 50% in the coming six to eight weeks. Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line&#x27;s opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of 4 trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.

On November 17, 1924, the Transit Commission ordered the IRT to use 100 new subway cars to increase service by no later than December 1. Among the changes in service ordered was the operation of through service on the 4 between Kingsbridge Road and Woodlawn, eliminating shuttle service. This change was made possible by twenty of the new cars. The Transit Commission heeded the IRT&#x27;s recommendation not to have half of 4 trains run express due to the dangerous operating condition it would have created. The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required minutes to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%. While operating all 4 trains to Utica Avenue would have obviated the problem, the IRT did not have enough cars to run such a service. Instead, the Transit Commission accepted the IRT&#x27;s plan to allocate 70 new cars to West Side express service to Brooklyn. Express service along Eastern Parkway would start at the earliest in February 1925 when additional new cars arrived.

Beginning on November 4, 1925, 4 trains were extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue during rush hours, from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. and 5 to 7 p.m., allowing for the introduction of express service along this section of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line. This extension was made possible by the delivery of the last of 350 new steel cars. The increased service required 80 cars, or eight trains of ten cars each.

On November 23, 1927, evening 4 service was extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue between 7:14 and 8:00 p.m. After the Transit Commission determined that this was not a sufficient increase in service, it announced on November 26 that evening 4 service to Utica Avenue would continue until 1 a.m. This change took place on December 5, and increased service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue by 100%. The following year, midday 4 service also went to Utica Avenue.

In April 1930, service was increased from running every 6 minutes to every 5 minutes heading southbound at 125th Street between 6 and 8 p.m. and from running every 8 minutes to every 6 minutes northbound at 125th Street between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. In addition, trains that had formerly terminated at South Ferry from 7:26 p.m. to 8:44 p.m. were extended to Utica Avenue.

The span of Sunday express service from Utica Avenue was extended by 54 minutes on February 22, 1931, with express service beginning at 12:56 p.m. instead of 1:50 p.m. Effective April 13, 1931, trains that terminated at Atlantic Avenue between 12:45 and 2:45 a.m. on Mondays were extended to Utica Avenue to reduce a transfer for riders at Nevins Street and to provide service from Manhattan&#x27;s East Side to Utica Avenue every ten minutes. On July 12, 1931, Sunday late night trains that terminated at Atlantic Avenue until 2:40 a.m. were extended to Utica Avenue.

As of 1934, 4 trains ran from Woodlawn to Utica Avenue weekday rush and Saturday morning peak and afternoon; to Atlantic Avenue weekday midday, Saturday morning after the peak, and late nights; and to South Ferry evenings and Sundays. Trains ran express in Manhattan, except during late nights, and in Brooklyn. This was the first time the 6 became the Pelham Shuttle between Pelham Bay Park and 125th Street–Lexington Avenue.

On August 20, 1938, Saturday morning after peak service was extended to Utica Avenue.

===Under the New York City Board of Transportation===

Beginning on May 10, 1946, all 4 trains were made express during late nights running on twelve-minute headways as the 6 went back to Brooklyn Bridge during that time. Previously 4 trains ran local from 12:30 to 5:30 a.m. At this time 4 trains terminated at Atlantic Avenue.

Beginning on December 16, 1946, trains were extended from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue during late nights, running express between Atlantic and Franklin Avenues.

The New York City Board of Transportation, a predecessor to the New York City Transit Authority, began to introduce replacements to older subway cars beginning with the R12 cars in 1948. With these cars, numbers were publicly designated to the former IRT lines. Lexington–Jerome trains were assigned the number 4. By 1964, all cars had the route numbers on them.

During 1950, Saturday morning service was cut back to South Ferry.

Starting on December 15, 1950, four 4 trains began operating during rush hours in the peak direction to and from Flatbush Avenue on the Nostrand Avenue Line, with the four trains in the AM rush hour leaving every 16 minutes between 7:59 and 8:47 a.m., and the four trains in the PM rush hour arriving every 16–20 minutes between 5:20 and 6:13 p.m. Also on that day, weekday midday service was cut back from Atlantic Avenue to South Ferry. Additionally, on January 18, 1952, 4 service to Atlantic Avenue during weekday middays was restored.

===Under the New York City Transit Authority===

On March 19, 1954, late-night service in Brooklyn became local, but resumed operating express between Atlantic and Franklin Avenues on June 29, 1956.

On May 3, 1957, the weekday rush trains to Flatbush Avenue were discontinued, while at the same time evening, Saturday, and Sunday afternoon trains were extended to Utica Avenue, while Sunday morning trains were extended to Atlantic Avenue.

Starting on March 1, 1960, late-night 4 trains resumed making all stops in Manhattan; this was the first time the 4 and 6 ran local in Manhattan together late nights. This arrangement ended on October 17, 1965, when the 4 went back express in Manhattan late nights.

Beginning on April 8, 1960, nearly all morning rush hour 4 trains ran to Flatbush Avenue, and evening rush hour 4 trains alternated between Flatbush and Utica Avenues. During weekday evenings and late nights 4 trains also went to Flatbush Avenue, making all stops in Brooklyn. On November 14, 1966, three trains that terminated at Utica Avenue were rerouted to terminate at Flatbush Avenue.

As a result of the opening of the main portion of the Chrystie Street Connection along the Manhattan Bridge on November 26, 1967, the 4 train was color-coded magenta under the first color scheme. The color coding of lines was introduced as a matter of having a universal system of signage and nomenclature.

By 1972, the 4 began to skip 138th Street weekdays during rush hours in the peak direction which it continues to do (mornings to Manhattan and evenings from there). At that time, the 4 went to Atlantic Avenue at all times but was extended to Utica Avenue rush hours running express in Brooklyn along Eastern Parkway. Select 4 trains also ran to Flatbush Avenue rush hours as well running express between Atlantic and Franklin Avenues, and late-night service made all stops in Brooklyn to Flatbush Avenue.

On May 23, 1976, Sunday morning trains were extended to Utica Avenue, running express in Brooklyn.

Effective June 1979, the 4 train assumed its current line color of forest green as a result of a nomenclature update to assign colors to a trunk line, plus line colors not serving Manhattan.

Beginning on January 13, 1980, all 4 trains resumed operating local in Manhattan during late night hours to replace the , which again became the Pelham Shuttle between 125th Street and Pelham Bay Park. This service cut affected 15,000 riders and was criticized by Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein as no public hearing was held.

On July 10, 1983, rush hour 4 trains were rerouted from Flatbush Avenue to Utica Avenue, and late evening and late night and Sunday morning service was rerouted from Flatbush Avenue to New Lots Avenue, making all local stops.

On August 29, 1988, weekday midday 4 trains were extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue, made possible by the termination of 5 service at Bowling Green. In addition, service was increased 50% during evenings between 8 p.m. and midnight, on Saturday afternoon, and on Sunday between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. In January 1989, during middays, southbound service resumed operating express between Franklin Avenue and Utica Avenue following the elimination of 5 train layups.

Late night express service was reinstated from January 21, 1990, to October 5 of that year, as a result of the 6 being extended back to Brooklyn Bridge during that time. While late night 6 service to Brooklyn Bridge was permanently restored on October 3, 1999, the 4 continued to run local at those times, providing Lexington Avenue local stations service every ten minutes.

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Eastern Parkway corridor to remove excess capacity was proposed. Weekend daytime 4 service would be extended beyond its terminal at Utica Avenue and originate and terminate at New Lots Avenue. Trains would operate local in Brooklyn south of Franklin Avenue. This service change would have been implemented in July 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

=== Recent changes ===
From April 2000 to August 2001, midday 4 service was temporarily cut back from Utica Avenue to Atlantic Avenue to accommodate the rebuilding of the IRT New Lots Line. 3 train service was split into two sections to allow for the line to be rebuilt, with transfers available at Utica Avenue. Work took place on weekday middays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., and New Lots service operated in one of three ways: shuttle buses replaced trains, all trains operated in both directions on a single track, or shuttle trains ran. 4 trains terminated at Atlantic Avenue when shuttle or single-track trains were in operation.

From June 8, 2009, to June 26, 2009, New York City Transit conducted a pilot program for express Jerome Avenue Line service. During a one hour period, four morning weekday rush hour trains from Woodlawn only stopped at Mosholu Parkway, Burnside Avenue and 149th Street–Grand Concourse before resuming regular service in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The express was expected to save riders minutes. The pilot was made possible due to signaling upgrades to the line&#x27;s center track made as part of the 2005–2009 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program.

On July 6, 2009, select Bronx-bound 4 trains began running express from 167th Street to Burnside Avenue to terminate at the latter station before running out of service to the Jerome Yard.

On October 26, 2009, another 4 express pilot program was implemented based on the success of the first and ran until December 11, 2009. This program was the same as the one in June except that express trains stopped at Bedford Park Boulevard–Lehman College. This express service was expected to cut runtime by 4 minutes.

As a result of planned repairs to Hurricane Sandy-related damage in the Clark Street Tube, which carries the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, the 4 was extended to New Lots Avenue on weekends from June 17, 2017, to June 24, 2018, making local stops in Brooklyn south of Nevins Street in place of the .

On November 17, 2019, New York City Transit made adjustments to weekday evening 3, 4, and 5 service in order to accommodate planned subway work. Late night 4 service to New Lots Avenue started an hour earlier, at 10:30 p.m. instead of 11:30 p.m., replacing 3 service, which was cut back to Times Square–42nd Street. This change, which was approved by the MTA Board on June 27, 2019, was expected to save the agency $900,000 annually.

<doc id="409184" wikidata="Q230954" url="?curid=409184" title="Shirley Strickland">
<text>Shirley Barbara de la Hunty AO, MBE (née Strickland; 18 July 1925 – 11 February 2004), known as Shirley Strickland during her early career, was an Australian athlete. She won more Olympic medals than any other Australian in running sports.

==Family==
Strickland was the only daughter, the second of five children. She grew up on the family farm east of the wheatbelt town of Pithara, Western Australia.

Her father, Dave Strickland, while working at Menzies in the goldfields of Western Australia, was also an athlete. He was unable to compete in the 1900 Summer Olympics because he lacked the money for a trip to Paris. Instead, in 1900, he directed his efforts to the Stawell Gift 130-yard (120-m) foot-race, winning in 12 seconds off a handicap of 10 yards. His performance was considered to be as good as those of Stan Rowley, who won the Australian amateur sprint titles that season. (Rowley went on to win three bronze medals in the sprints at the 1900 Paris Olympics). Dave Strickland subsequently went on to play one senior game of Australian rules football with Melbourne-based VFL team St Kilda in 1900 and six with WAFL club West Perth spread across the 1901 and 1909 seasons.

Her mother, Violet Edith Merry, was American-born with a British mining engineer father and a Norwegian mother.

==Education==
Strickland&#x27;s early education was by correspondence. From 1934 to 1937 she attended the newly established local East Pithara School, winning a scholarship to attend Northam High School, where, in 1939, she won 47 out of 49 events as a schoolgirl athlete. After high school, she entered the University of Western Australia from where in 1946 she graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Physics. In her spare time she lectured in mathematics and physics to returned servicemen at Perth Technical College, played wing in the university hockey team and gained a reputation as an extremely gifted sprinter and hurdler.

==Athletic career==
The Second World War was disruptive to women&#x27;s athletics in Australia. Some runners, including Strickland, enlisted to help the war effort.

While teaching at Perth Technical College, she was coached by Austin Robertson, a former world professional sprint champion and South Melbourne footballer. She improved her 100 yards time from 11.8 to 11.0 flat. At the 1947 Western Australia state titles, she won the 100 yards, 220 yards, 440 yards, the 90 m yards hurdles and the shot put.

The following year, she took up running seriously, with great success. She won the national title in the 80 m hurdles in 1948 and was part of the Australian delegation to the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. There, Strickland finished third in both the 100 m and 80 m hurdles and won a silver medal in the 4×100 m relay. Despite being awarded 4th place in the 200 m final, a photo finish of the race that was not consulted at the time, when examined in 1975, showed that she had beaten American Audrey Patterson into third place, a discrepancy that has been recognised by many reputable Olympic historians.

After winning three gold medals in the 1950 British Empire Games, she won her first Olympic title at the 1952 Games in Helsinki. She won the 80 m hurdles in world record time (10.9 s). A baton mix-up cost her a second gold medal in the 4×100 m relay. In the 100 m, she again won a bronze medal.

She set a new world record of 11.3 s for the 100 m in Poland in 1955. Further, in the 1956 Olympics, she won again in the 80 m hurdles and with the Australian 4×100 m relay team.

==Post-athletics==

De la Hunty maintained her Olympic involvement in athlete administration, with the Australian teams during the 1968 and 1976 Olympics in Mexico City and Montreal. She also coached sprinter Raelene Boyle for the 1976 Olympic season.

Along with her husband, de la Hunty had a longstanding involvement with the Australian Democrats. She was a founding member, and later served as president of the party&#x27;s branch in Western Australia. From the early 1970s through to the mid-1990s, de la Hunty was a perennial candidate for state and federal political office, although never elected. She stood in six state elections – in 1971, and then in five consecutive from 1983 to 1996. In 1983, 1986, and 1996, she stood for the Australian Democrats, while she stood as an independent candidate in the remaining years. She ran for the Legislative Assembly in 1983 and 1993 (in East Melville and Melville, respectively), and for the Legislative Council in 1971, 1986, 1989, and 1996.

At the federal level, all but one of de la Hunty&#x27;s runs for office were made as a Democrats candidate. In total, she contested seven federal elections—four consecutive from 1977 to 1984, as well as the 1981 by-election in Curtin, and then in 1993 and 1996. She ran for the House of Representatives in 1981 (Curtin), 1984 (Fremantle), and 1993 (Canning), with the latter being her only independent candidacy at federal level. At all other elections, she contested the Senate, where she was generally placed second or third on the Democrats&#x27; group voting ticket. Although never elected to parliament, de la Hunty served two periods as a City of Melville councillor, from 1988 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2003. This political affiliation contrasted with the background of her first coach, Betty Judge, who was the wife of Kim Beazley Sr. and mother of Kim Beazley, both prominent Labor politicians.

De la Hunty was one of several female Australian Olympians who carried the Olympic Flame at the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Games. In 2001, she attracted media attention by auctioning her sporting memorabilia including her Olympic gold medals. She was criticised by some for that but asserted she had a right to do so and the income generated would help pay for her grandchildren&#x27;s education and allow a sizeable donation to assist in securing old-growth forests from use by developers. Her memorabilia were eventually acquired for the National Sports Museum in Melbourne by a group of anonymous businessmen who shared her wish that the memorabilia would stay in Australia.

==Personal life==

In 1950, she married geologist Lawrence Edmund de la Hunty, who had been one of her students at Perth Technical College. They had four children: Phillip (1953), Barbara (1957), Matthew (1960) and David (1963). Matthew was the lead singer in Australian rock band Tall Tales and True. Barbara graduated in Science. Phillip&#x27;s intended medical career was destroyed by heroin addiction though he later graduated with honours in Science. David is an ophthalmologist practising in Rockingham. Lawrence died of a heart attack in 1980, aged 56.

De la Hunty was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) on 26 January 2001 for service to the community, particularly in the areas of conservation, the environment and local government, and to athletics as an athlete, coach and administrator. She had been appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (Civil) (MBE) for services to athletics on 1 January 1957.

Her body was found on 16 February 2004 on her kitchen floor, but the coroner determined that she died on the evening of 11 February. There was no full autopsy and the coroner said the cause of death was &quot;unascertainable&quot;, though not inconsistent with natural causes.

The Western Australian government honoured her with a state funeral, the first ever for a private citizen.

In 2005, some members of her family approached the coroner regarding the circumstances of her death. In 2006 an investigation was conducted by detectives from the major crime squad. In 2008 probate was granted after a dispute over her will was resolved in the state Supreme Court.

Shirley Strickland Reserve in Ardross, a suburb of Perth, is named in her honour.

In 2011, Shirley was posthumously inducted into the WA Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and in 2014, Strickland de la Hunty was inducted into the International Association of Athletics Federations&#x27; Hall of Fame

<doc id="409186" wikidata="Q455674" url="?curid=409186" title="Plymouth-Banjul Challenge">
<text>The Plymouth-Banjul Challenge is run by &#x27;Dakar Challenge&#x27; and self described as &#x27;The original Banger Challenge’ and previously known as the Plymouth-Dakar Challenge, is an annual car event for charity. Established in 2002, the first rally went to Dakar in 2003, and then on to Banjul from 2005. It very roughly follows the route of the more famous Dakar Rally, visiting many of the same countries.

Starting in Plymouth (Devon), participants travel through France and onto Tarifa in Southern Spain. Then the course runs through Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal and finally into the Gambia - a distance of approximately 4,400 Miles. Participants were previously told to be driving a left hand drive cars worth approximately £100, although there are now no formal rules on value and right hand drive cars of any value can be used, on the basis they are donated to the Rotary Club of The Gambia on arrival. 

Participants in the challenge are on their own, meaning that no assistance is rendered to motorists in case of a car breakdown or even if they become stranded. 

Mechanical reliability is the main obstacle to completing the course given that such vehicles are ordinary road cars and are mostly at the end of their useful lifetimes.
Many cars cope very well until they have to go through the desert and then almost all suffer a great deal due to high temperatures and dust.
Once the cars make it to Banjul in Gambia they are auctioned for, or donated to, charity.

==History and notable entrants==
Amongst the many cars that have taken part in the challenge was the fine Peugeot 505 family estate that went on to be auctioned at the end of the rally for several times the amount of money it would have commanded back in the UK. The 2006 rally included a 1983 BMW 732i which appeared to be incapable of making it out of England but in fact did complete the course; a Fiat Uno which performed fantastically and even pushed the previously mentioned BMW up a mountain; some Renault 19s and a VW Beetle. In addition a number of 4x4 vehicles regularly enter ranging from quite reasonable vehicles that &#x27;bend&#x27; the entry rules to vehicles over 40 years old rebuilt from wrecks just for the challenge.

The 2004 event had one team, &quot;The Idiots Abroad&quot;, tow a trailer with two motorbikes on it through the desert - the challenge has now been laid down for another team to get a trailer through the desert and in 2006 two ambulances made it across.

In the 2004/2005 event, a Swiss Team (Team Pintpullers) drove a Mercedes Van and a 125cc motorbike from Switzerland to Banjul. The Bike was ridden the entire time and reached Banjul where it was donated to the local police.

There are even people who cannot drive taking part with one half of a Fiat Uno team learning to drive in the desert where he managed to crash it into a Welsh Ambulance and two Canadians who bought a manual car in France and spent the next few weeks learning to drive it.

Since 2007, the rally also has a group of cars continuing on to Bamako, Mali.
The 2009/2010 Banjul Challenge was called off by its organiser Julian Nowill due to Mauritanian security concerns (French tourist murders and Spanish aid workers kidnappings), but two teams from group 1 and three teams from group 3 pushed on regardless.

<text>The 3 Seventh Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the A Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it uses the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through most of Manhattan.

The 3 operates 24 hours a day, although service patterns vary based on the time of day. Daytime service operates between 148th Street in Harlem, Manhattan and New Lots Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn, making express stops in Manhattan (between 96th and Chambers Streets) and all stops in Brooklyn. Limited rush hour service originates and terminates at 137th Street–City College instead of 148th Street. Overnight service short turns at 34th Street–Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan and does not operate to or from New Lots Avenue.

The 3 train formerly ran to City Hall or South Ferry in Manhattan, and was later rerouted to Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College in Brooklyn. In 1983, it was rerouted to New Lots Avenue.

== Service history ==

=== Early history ===



On November 23, 1904, the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened between 96th Street and 145th Street. 3 trains ran between 145th Street and City Hall, making all stops.

On July 1, 1918, the entire IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line was completed. 3 trains were rerouted south of 42nd Street from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to this new line, making all stops to South Ferry.

As of 1934, 3 service operated between 145th Street and South Ferry except late nights, when service operated between 145th Street and 96th Street, making local stops.

=== Under the New York City Transit Authority ===
On January 3, 1955, late night two-car shuttle service between 145th Street and 96th Street, between 12:12 and 6:57 a.m. was discontinued due to low ridership. As a result, 145th Street was closed overnight. In addition, some 3 trains started running express in Manhattan during rush hours. These trains were extended to Flatbush Avenue; a few layups and put-ins ran to New Lots Avenue. However, from December 20, 1957, 3 trains were rerouted to New Lots Avenue during rush hours. On February 6, 1959, all trains except late nights made express stops in Manhattan as part of the &quot;West Side Improvement&quot; and ran to Flatbush Avenue.

Starting April 8, 1960, 3 trains were rerouted from Flatbush Avenue to New Lots Avenue, and weekday evening service between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. was cut to a shuttle between 145th Street and 135th Street. Before the change, 3 trains had run between 145th Street and Flatbush Avenue between about 5:30 a.m. and 12:45 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays and from about 7:15 a.m. to 12:45 a.m. on Sundays. This service had been supplemented by additional service to and from New Lots Avenue.

However, on April 18, 1965, 3 service started to run to Flatbush Avenue again. On October 17, 1965, weekend evening service was also cut to a shuttle between 145th Street and 135th Street.

On May 13, 1968, trains were extended to the newly completed 148th Street–Lenox Terminal. Later that year, on November 12, late night shuttle service was implemented between 148th Street and 135th Street. On May 23, 1976, the current practice of starting Sunday service late (9 or 10 a.m.) began.

On July 10, 1983, the and 3 trains swapped terminals in Brooklyn, with 2 trains terminating at Flatbush Avenue and 3 trains terminating at New Lots Avenue. These changes were made to reduce non-revenue subway car mileage, to provide a dedicated fleet for each service, and to provide an easily accessible inspection yard for each service. The change allowed the 2 to be dedicated to 239th Street Yard and allowed the 3 to be assigned to Livonia Yard. With the rerouting of 3 trains, train lengths along the New Lots Line were reduced from 10 cars to 9 cars, within acceptable crowding levels, and train lengths along the Nostrand Avenue Line were increased from 9 to 10 cars, reducing crowding.

Beginning on August 5, 1990, late-night shuttles between 148th Street and 135th Street were discontinued and replaced by shuttle buses. On September 4, 1994, late-night shuttles between 148th Street and 135th Street were resumed, but were discontinued again on September 10, 1995. This was a cost-saving measure due to low ridership.

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Eastern Parkway corridor to remove excess capacity was proposed. Weekend daytime 3 service would be rerouted to originate and terminate at South Ferry in Manhattan instead of New Lots Avenue in Brooklyn. Service between Chambers Street and Franklin Avenue would be provided by trains; service between Franklin Avenue and New Lots Avenue would be provided by extended trains. This service change would have been implemented in July 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

From March 2 to October 12, 1998, the IRT Lenox Avenue Line was rehabilitated. Most 3 service was rerouted to 137th Street–City College. From October 4, 1999, to August 3, 2001, Limited AM rush hour 3 trains originated at 137th Street – City College instead of 148th Street; these trains ran local to 96th Street before switching to the express track. From August 6, 2001, to April 25, 2003, limited AM rush hour 3 trains originated at East 180th Street in the Bronx instead of 148th Street.

=== Recent history ===
After September 11, 2001, the 3 service became a local in Manhattan. After a few switching delays at 96th Street, service was changed on September 19, 2001. All 3 trains began to operate express in Manhattan and terminated at 14th Street instead of New Lots Avenue; daytime trains were extended to Brooklyn to cover 3 service. Also on this date, 3 trains began to permanently use consists of 10-car trains as a result of equipment sharing between Livonia Yard (the maintenance facility in Brooklyn where subway cars assigned to the 3 are based from) and 240th Street Yard (the maintenance facility in the Bronx where subway cars assigned to the 1 are based from). Service returned to New Lots Avenue on September 15, 2002.

On July 27, 2008, late night 3 service was restored, operating express between 148th Street and Times Square–42nd Street. In addition, late morning weekday service was increased from running every 6 to 8 minutes to running every 5 to 7 minutes to reduce crowding on the 2. These increases were made as part of an $8.9 million package of systemwide service enhancements.

The Clark Street Tube underwent planned repairs on weekends from June 17, 2017, to June 24, 2018, due to Hurricane Sandy-related damage. The 3 operated only in Manhattan between Harlem-148th Street and 14th Street with trains providing service to New Lots Avenue in Brooklyn.

On November 17, 2019, New York City Transit made adjustments to weekday evening 3, 4, and 5 service in order to accommodate planned subway work. Late night 3 service to Times Square started an hour earlier, at 10:30 p.m. instead of 11:30 p.m.; to replace 3 service, 4 service was extended to New Lots Avenue. This change, which was approved by the MTA Board on June 27, 2019, was expected to save the agency $900,000 annually.

In January 2025, overnight 3 service was quietly extended from Times Square–42nd Street to 34th Street–Penn Station, although a few northbound trips continued to enter service at Times Square. One month later, some weekday early morning and late evening trips were rerouted to and from 137th Street–City College as a result of accessibility improvements taking place at 148th Street.

<doc id="409190" wikidata="Q1252645" url="?curid=409190" title="Stella Gibbons">
<text>Stella Dorothea Gibbons (5 January 1902 – 19 December 1989) was an English author, journalist, and poet. She established her reputation with her first novel, &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1932), which has been reprinted many times. Although she was active as a writer for half a century, none of her later 22 novels or other literary works—which included a sequel to &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;—achieved the same critical or popular success. Much of her work was long out of print before a modest revival in the 21st century.

The daughter of a London doctor, Gibbons had a turbulent and often unhappy childhood. After an indifferent school career she trained as a journalist, and worked as a reporter and features writer, mainly for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;The Lady&quot;. Her first book, published in 1930, was a collection of poems which was well received, and through her life she considered herself primarily a poet rather than a novelist. After &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, a satire on the genre of rural-themed &quot;loam and lovechild&quot; novels popular in the late 1920s, most of Gibbons&#x27;s novels were based within the middle-class suburban world with which she was familiar.

Gibbons became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950. Her style has been praised by critics for its charm, barbed humour and descriptive skill, and has led to comparison with Jane Austen. The impact of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; dominated her career, and she grew to resent her identification with the book to the exclusion of the rest of her output. Widely regarded as a one-work novelist, she and her works have not been accepted into the canon of English literature—partly, other writers have suggested, because of her detachment from the literary world and her tendency to mock it.

==Life==

===Family background and childhood===
The Gibbons family originated from Ireland. Stella&#x27;s grandfather, Charles Preston Gibbons, was a civil engineer who spent long periods in South Africa building bridges. He and his wife Alice had six children, the second of whom—the eldest of four sons—was born in 1869 and was known by his fourth Christian name of &quot;Telford&quot;. The Gibbons household was a turbulent one, with tensions arising from Charles Gibbons&#x27;s frequent adulteries. Telford Gibbons trained as a doctor, and qualified as a physician and surgeon at the London Hospital in 1897. On 29 September 1900 he married Maude Williams, the daughter of a stockbroker. The couple bought a house in Malden Crescent, Kentish Town, a working-class district of North London, where Telford established the medical practice in which he continued for the remainder of his life.

Stella, the couple&#x27;s first child, was born on 5 January 1902; two brothers, Gerald and Lewis, followed in 1905 and 1909 respectively. The atmosphere in the Kentish Town house echoed that of the elder Gibbons&#x27;s household, and was dominated by Telford&#x27;s frequent bouts of ill-temper, drinking, womanising and occasional acts of violence. Stella later described her father as &quot;a bad man, but a good doctor&quot;. He was charitable to his poorer patients and imaginative in finding cures, but made life miserable for his family. Initially Stella was his favourite, but by the time she reached puberty he frequently mocked her looks and size. Fortunately, her mother was a calm and stabilising influence. Until Stella reached the age of 13 she was educated at home by a succession of governesses, who never stayed long. The family&#x27;s bookshelves provided reading material, and she developed a talent for storytelling with which she amused her young brothers.

In 1915 Stella became a pupil at the North London Collegiate School, then situated in Camden Town. The school, founded in 1850 by Frances Buss, was among the first in England to offer girls an academic education, and by 1915 was widely recognised as a model girls&#x27; school. After the haphazard teaching methods of her governesses, Stella initially had difficulty in adjusting to the strict discipline of the school, and found many of its rules and practices oppressive. She shared this attitude with her contemporary Stevie Smith, the future Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry winner, who joined the school in 1917. Although a moderate performer in school subjects, Stella found outlets for her talents by writing stories for her fellow-pupils, becoming vice president of the Senior Dramatic Club, and featuring prominently in the school&#x27;s Debating Society, of which she became the honorary secretary.

===Student years===

While at school, Gibbons formed an ambition to be a writer, and on leaving in 1921 began a two-year Diploma in Journalism at University College, London (UCL). The course had been established for ex-servicemen returning from the First World War, but attracted several women, among them the future novelist Elizabeth Bowen. As well as English Literature, the curriculum covered economics, politics, history, science and languages; practical skills such as shorthand and typing were not included.

After the stifling experience of school, Gibbons found university exhilarating and made numerous friendships, particularly with Ida Affleck Graves, an aspiring poet who, although on a different course, attended some of the same lectures. The two shared a love of literature and a taste for subversive humour. Graves lived until 1999, and recalled in an interview late in life that many of the jokes they shared found their way into &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, as did some of their common acquaintances. Soon after Gibbons began the course she contributed a poem, &quot;The Marshes of My Soul&quot;, to the December 1921 issue of &quot;University College Magazine&quot;. This parody, in the newly fashionable &quot;vers libre&quot; style, was her first published literary work. During the next two years she contributed further poems and prose to the magazine, including &quot;The Doer, a Story in the Russian Manner&quot;, which foreshadows her later novels in both theme and style. Gibbons completed her course in the summer of 1923, and was awarded her diploma.

===Journalism and early writings===
Gibbons&#x27;s first job was with the British United Press (BUP) news agency, where she decoded overseas cables which she rewrote in presentable English. During slack periods she practised at writing articles, stories and poems. She made her first trips abroad, travelling to France in 1924 and Switzerland in 1925. Swiss Alpine scenery inspired several poems, some of which were later published. In 1924 she met Walter Beck, a naturalised German employed by his family&#x27;s cosmetics firm. The couple became engaged, and enjoyed regular weekends together, signing hotel registers as a married couple using false names.

In May 1926 Gibbons&#x27;s mother, Maude, died suddenly at the age of 48. With little reason to remain with her father in the Kentish Town surgery, Gibbons took lodgings in Willow Road, near Hampstead Heath. Five months later, on 15 October, her father died from heart disease aggravated by heavy drinking. Gibbons was now the family&#x27;s principal breadwinner; her youngest brother Lewis was still at school, while the elder, Gerald, was intermittently employed as an actor. The three set up home in a cottage on the Vale of Health, a small settlement in the middle of Hampstead Heath, with literary connections to Keats (whom Gibbons revered), Leigh Hunt and D. H. Lawrence. Later that year, as a result of an error involving the calculation and reporting of foreign exchange rates, Gibbons was sacked from the BUP, but quickly found a new position as secretary to the editor of the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. Within a short time she was promoted, and became a reporter and features writer at the then substantial salary of just under £500 a year, although she was not given a by-line until 1928.

During her &quot;Evening Standard&quot; years, Gibbons persevered with poetry, and in September 1927 her poem &quot;The Giraffes&quot; appeared in &quot;The Criterion&quot;, a literary magazine edited by T. S. Eliot. This work was read and admired by Virginia Woolf, who enquired if Gibbons would write poems for the Woolf publishing house, the Hogarth Press. In January 1928 , a leading voice in the &quot;Georgian&quot; poetry movement, began to publish Gibbons&#x27;s poems in his magazine, &quot;The London Mercury&quot;. Squire also persuaded Longmans to publish the first collection of Gibbons&#x27;s verses, entitled &quot;The Mountain Beast&quot;, which appeared in 1930 to critical approval. By this time her by-line was appearing with increasing frequency in the &quot;Standard&quot;. As part of a series on &quot;Unusual Women&quot; she interviewed, among others, the former royal mistress Lillie Langtry. The paper also published several of Gibbons&#x27;s short stories.

Despite this evident industry, Gibbons was dismissed from the &quot;Standard&quot; in August 1930. This was ostensibly an economy measure although Gibbons, in later life, suspected other reasons, particularly the increasing distraction from work that arose from her relationship with Walter Beck. The engagement had ended painfully in 1928, primarily because Gibbons was looking for a fully committed relationship whereas he wanted something more open. Oliver believes Gibbons never entirely got over Beck, even after 1929 when she met Allan Webb, her future husband. She was not unemployed for long; she quickly accepted a job offer as an editorial assistant at the women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Lady&quot;. Here, according to &quot;The Observer&quot; writer Rachel Cooke, &quot;she applied her versatility as a writer to every subject under the sun bar cookery, which was the province of a certain Mrs Peel.&quot; At the same time she began work on the novel that would become &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;; her colleague and friend Elizabeth Coxhead recorded that Gibbons &quot;neglected her duties disgracefully&quot; to work on this project.

===&quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;===

In her time with &quot;The Lady&quot;, Gibbons established a reputation as a caustic book reviewer, and was particularly critical of the then fashionable &quot;loam and lovechild&quot; rural novels. Novelists such as Mary Webb and Sheila Kaye-Smith had achieved considerable popularity through their depictions of country life; Webb was a favourite of the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Gibbons had first become familiar with the genre when she provided summaries of Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; for the &quot;Evening Standard&#x27;s&quot; 1928 serialisation. She found the writing overblown and the plotting ridiculous, and decided that her own first novel would be a comic parody of the genre. By February 1932 she had completed the manuscript and delivered it to her publishers, Longmans.
Gibbons&#x27;s chosen title for her novel had been &quot;Curse God Farm&quot;, before her friend Elizabeth Coxhead, who had connections in the Hinckley district of Leicestershire, suggested &quot;Cold Comfort&quot; as an alternative, using the name of a farm in the Hinckley area. Gibbons was delighted with the suggestion, and the work was published as &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; in September 1932. The plot concerns the efforts of &quot;a rational, bossy London heroine&quot; to bring order and serenity to her rustic relations, the Starkadders, on their run-down Sussex farm. According to the &quot;Feminist Companion to Literature in English&quot;, Gibbons&#x27;s parody &quot;[demolishes] ... the stock-in-trade of earthy regionalists such as Thomas Hardy, Mary Webb, Sheila Kaye-Smith and D. H. Lawrence&quot;. The literary scholar Faye Hammill describes the work as &quot;an extremely sophisticated and intricate parody whose meaning is produced through its relationship with the literary culture of its day and with the work of such canonical authors as D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, and Emily Brontë&quot;. In her history of the 1930s, Juliet Gardiner ascribes a socio-economic dimension to the book: &quot;a picture of rural gloom caused by government lassitude and urban indifference&quot;.

The work was an immediate critical and popular success. The satire was heightened by Gibbons&#x27;s mockery of purple prose, whereby she marked the most florid and overwritten passages of the book with asterisks, &quot;for the reader&#x27;s delectation and mirth&quot;. One critic found it hard to accept that so well-developed a parody was the work of a scarcely known woman writer, and speculated that &quot;Stella Gibbons&quot; was a pen-name for Evelyn Waugh. Gibbons suddenly found herself in demand in literary circles and from fellow writers, raised to a celebrity status that she found distasteful. She acquired an agent, who advised her that she could confidently expect a regular and comfortable income as a novelist. This assurance prompted her, at the end of 1932, to resign her position with &quot;The Lady&quot; and to embark on a full-time writing career.

In March 1931 Gibbons had become engaged to Allan Webb, a budding actor and opera singer five years her junior. He was the son of a cricketing parson, and the grandson of Allan Becher Webb, a former Bishop of Bloemfontein who served as Dean of Salisbury Cathedral. On 1 April 1933 the couple were married at St Matthew&#x27;s, Bayswater. Later in 1933 she learned that &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; had been awarded the &quot;Prix Étranger&quot;, the foreign novel category of the prestigious French literary prize, the &quot;Prix Femina&quot;. It had won against works by two more experienced writers, Bowen and Rosamond Lehmann. This outcome irritated Virginia Woolf, herself a former &quot;Prix Étranger&quot; winner, who wrote to Bowen: &quot;I was enraged to see they gave the £40 (the cash value of the prize) to Gibbons; still, now you and Rosamond can join in blaming her&quot;. Cooke observes that of all the &quot;Prix Étranger&quot; winners from the inter-war years, only &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; and Woolf&#x27;s &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; are remembered today, and that only the former has bequeathed a phrase that has passed into common usage: &quot;something nasty in the woodshed&quot;.

===Established author===

====1930s====
During the remainder of the 1930s Gibbons produced five more novels, as well as two poetry collections, a children&#x27;s book, and a number of short stories. From November 1936 the family home was in Oakshott Avenue, on the Holly Lodge Estate off Highgate West Hill, where Gibbons regularly worked in the mornings from ten until lunchtime. Her novels were generally well received by critics and the public, though none earned the accolades or attention that had been given to &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;; readers of &quot;The Times&quot; were specifically warned not to expect Gibbons&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Bassett&quot; (1934), to be a repetition of the earlier masterpiece. &quot;Enbury Heath&quot; (1935) is a relatively faithful account of her childhood and early adult life with, according to Oliver, &quot;only the thinnest veil of fictional gauze cover[ing] raw experience&quot;. &quot;Miss Linsey and Pa&quot; (1936) was thought by Nicola Beauman, in her analysis of women writers from 1914 to 1939, to parody Radclyffe Hall&#x27;s 1928 lesbian novel &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;. Gibbons&#x27;s final prewar novels were &quot;Nightingale Wood&quot; (1935)—&quot;Cinderella brought right up to date&quot;—and &quot;My American&quot; (1939), which Oliver considers her most escapist novel, &quot;a variant of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;.&quot;

Gibbons always considered herself a serious poet rather than a comic writer. She published two collections of poetry in the 1930s, the latter of which, &quot;The Lowland Verses&quot; (1938) contains &quot;The Marriage of the Machine&quot;, an early lament on the effects of industrial pollution: &quot;What oil, what poison lulls/Your wings and webs, my cormorants and gulls?&quot; Gibbons&#x27;s single children&#x27;s book was the fairy tale collection &quot;The Untidy Gnome&quot;, published in 1935 and dedicated to her only child Laura, who was born that year.

====War years, 1939–1945====
The advent of war in September 1939 did not diminish Gibbons&#x27;s creative energy. In November she began a series of articles, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Diary of the War&quot;, for &quot;St Martin&#x27;s Review&quot;, the journal of the London church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The series ran until November 1943, and includes many of Gibbons&#x27;s private reflections on the conflict. In October 1941 she wrote: &quot;[T]he war has done me good ... I get a dour satisfaction out of managing the rations, salvaging, fire watching, and feeling that I am trying to work for a better world&quot;. In July 1940 her husband Allan Webb enlisted in the Middlesex Regiment, and the following year was commissioned into the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. He later served overseas, mostly in Cairo.

The title story in Gibbons&#x27;s 1940 collection, &quot;Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, failed to equal the impact of the original. When the collection was reissued many years later it was described as &quot;oddly comforting and amusing ... and possibly a truer depiction of the times than we might think&quot;. Gibbons published three novels during the war: &quot;The Rich House&quot; (1941), &quot;Ticky&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Bachelor&quot; (1944). &quot;Ticky&quot;, a satire on mid-nineteenth century army life, was Gibbons&#x27;s favourite of all her novels, although she acknowledged that hardly anyone liked it. It failed commercially, despite a favourable review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. Oliver surmises that &quot;the middle of the Second World War was perhaps the wrong time to satirise ... the ridiculous and dangerous rituals that surround the male aggressive instinct&quot;. &quot;The Bachelor&quot; won critical praise for its revealing account of life in war-torn Britain—as did several of Gibbons&#x27;s postwar novels.

===Postwar years===
Gibbons&#x27;s first postwar novel was &quot;Westwood&quot; (1946). The book incorporates a comic depiction of the novelist Charles Morgan, whose novel &quot;The Fountain&quot; Gibbons had reviewed before the war and found &quot;offensive as well as wearisome&quot;. In &quot;Westwood&quot;, Morgan appears in the guise of the playwright &quot;Gerard Challis&quot;, a pompous, humourless bore. Oliver considers this characterisation to be one of Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;most enjoyable and vicious&quot; satirical portraits. In her introduction to the book&#x27;s 2011 reprint, Lynne Truss describes it as &quot;a rich, mature novel, romantic and wistful, full of rounded characters and terrific dialogue&quot; that deserved more commercial success than it received. The public&#x27;s expectations were still prejudiced by &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, which by 1949 had sold 28,000 copies in hardback and 315,000 in paperback. Anticipating that a sequel would be popular, that year Gibbons produced &quot;Conference at Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, her shortest novel, in which the farm has become a conference centre and tourist attraction. There is much mockery of contemporary and indeed future artistic and intellectual trends, before the male Starkadders return from overseas, wreck the centre and restore the farm to its original primitive state. The book was moderately successful but, Oliver remarks, does not compare with the original.

In 1950 Gibbons published her &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, and in the same year was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Throughout the 1950s she continued, at roughly two-year intervals, to produce politely received novels, none of which created any particular stir. Among these was &quot;Fort of the Bear&quot; (1953), in which she departed from her familiar London milieu by setting the story largely in the wilder regions of Canada. This was the last of her books handled by Longmans; thereafter her work was published by Hodder and Stoughton. A journey to Austria and Venice in 1953 provided material for her novel &quot;The Shadow of a Sorcerer&quot; (1955). From 1954, having accepted an invitation from Malcolm Muggeridge, the editor of &quot;Punch&quot;, Gibbons provided frequent contributions to the magazine for the following 15 years. Among these was a science fiction story, &quot;Jane in Space&quot;, written in the style of Jane Austen. Gibbons, who wrote the introduction to the 1957 Heritage edition of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, was a long-time admirer of Austen, and had described her in a &quot;Lady&quot; article as &quot;one of the most exquisite&quot; of woman artists.

After the war, Allan Webb resumed his stage career with the role of Count Almaviva in the 1946 Sadler&#x27;s Wells production of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. In 1947 he appeared in the original run of the Vivian Ellis musical &quot;Bless the Bride&quot;, and made several further stage appearances in the following two years. During this time he had a brief affair with the actress Sydney Malcolm, for which Gibbons quickly forgave him. He left the theatre in 1949 to become a director of a book club specialising in special editions, and later bought a bookshop in the Archway district of London. His health failed in the late 1950s and in 1958 he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. He died in July 1959 at Oakshott Avenue.

===Late career===
After Webb&#x27;s death, Gibbons remained at Oakshott Avenue and continued to write novels. From 1961 she rented a summer house at Trevone in Cornwall, which became the setting for her 1962 novel &quot;The Weather at Tregulla&quot;. She returned to literary criticism after many years, when in 1965 she contributed an essay to &quot;Light on C.S. Lewis&quot;, a review of that writer&#x27;s work edited by Jocelyn Gibb. In 1966 she wrote an essay for &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Genesis of a Novel&quot;, in which she mused on the detrimental effect of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; on her long-term career. She likened the book to &quot;some unignorable old uncle, to whom you have to be grateful because he makes you a handsome allowance, but is often an embarrassment and a bore&quot;. Gibbons made her last overseas trip in 1966, to Grenoble in France where she visited her old friend Elizabeth Coxhead. This visit provided material for her 1968 novel &quot;The Snow Woman&quot; in which Gibbons overcame her habitual distaste for emotional excess by opening the book with a melodramatic birth on a sofa. &quot;The Woods in Winter&quot; (1970) was her last published novel; she decided at that point that she was no longer prepared to subject her work to editorial control. In the 1980s she wrote two more novels for private circulation among friends, &quot;The Yellow Houses&quot; and &quot;An Alpha&quot;. These books – &quot;An Alpha&quot; retitled &quot;Pure Juliet&quot; – were published by Vintage Classics in 2016, after the manuscripts were released by Gibbons&#x27;s family.

===Final years===

The last two decades of Gibbons&#x27;s life were uneventful and lived almost entirely beyond the public eye. She kept her health and looks until almost the end of her life—in a biographical sketch, Jill Neville recorded that &quot;her beauty endured, as did her upright carriage, typical of Edwardian ladies who were forced as girls to walk around with a book balanced on their heads.&quot; As well as her unpublished novels she wrote occasional short stories, two of which were rejected by the BBC, and contributed three new poems to Richard Adams&#x27;s 1986 anthology &quot;Occasional Poets&quot;, a work which included verses from part-time poets such as Iris Murdoch, William Golding, Alan Ayckbourn and Quentin Crisp. These were Gibbons&#x27;s last published works. One of Gibbons&#x27;s poems in the anthology was &quot;Writ in Water&quot;, inspired by her love for the poetry of Keats. In 2013 the manuscript of this poem was presented to the Keats-Shelley Memorial House museum in Rome.

Gibbons maintained a wide circle of friends, who in her later years included Adams, the entertainer Barry Humphries and the novelist John Braine. From the mid-1970s she established a pattern of monthly literary tea parties in Oakshott Avenue at which, according to Neville, &quot;she was known to expel guests if they were shrill, dramatic, or wrote tragic novels.&quot; As her own productivity dwindled and finally ceased altogether, she kept a commonplace book in which she was recording her thoughts and opinions on literature as late as 1988.

From the mid-1980s Gibbons experienced recurrent health problems, not helped when she resumed smoking. In her last months she was looked after at home by her grandson and his girlfriend. She died there on 19 December 1989, after collapsing the previous day, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, alongside her husband. At her funeral, her nephew and future biographer Reggie Oliver read two of her poems, the latter of which, &quot;Fairford Church&quot;, concludes with the words: &quot;Little is sure. Life is hard./We love, we suffer and die./But the beauty of the earth is real/And the Spirit is nigh.&quot;

==Writing==

===Style===
Gibbons&#x27;s writing has been praised by critics for its perspicacity, sense of fun, charm, wit and descriptive skill—the last a product of her journalistic training—which she used to convey both atmosphere and character. Although Beauman refers to &quot;malicious wit&quot;, Truss sees no cruelty in the often barbed humour, which reflected Gibbons&#x27;s detestation of pomposity and pretence. Truss has described Gibbons as &quot;the Jane Austen of the 20th century&quot;, a parallel which the novelist Malcolm Bradbury thought apt; Flora Poste in &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, with her &quot;higher common sense&quot;, is &quot;a Jane-ite heroine transformed into a clear-eyed modern woman&quot;. Bradbury also observed that many of Gibbons&#x27;s novels end in Austen-like nuptials.

Truss highlights the importance that Gibbons places on detachment as a necessary adjunct to effective writing: &quot;Like many a good doctor, she seems to have considered sympathy a peculiar and redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time.&quot; This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot; obituarist Richard Boston, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, &quot;were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders&quot;. It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated melodrama that Gibbons most disliked was at the heart of her one great success; Gibbons&#x27;s writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as &quot;a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental.&quot; While short of sentimentality, Gibbons&#x27;s writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as &quot;a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable&quot;.

Some of Gibbons&#x27;s poetry expressed her love of nature and a prophetic awareness for environmental issues such as sea pollution, decades before such concerns became fashionable. In a critical summary of Gibbons&#x27;s poems, Loralee MacPike has described them as &quot;slight lyrics ... [which] tend toward classic, even archaic, diction, and only occasionally ... show flashes of the novels&#x27; wit&quot;. Such lines as &quot;my thoughts, like purple parrots / Brood / In the sick light&quot; come dangerously close indeed to the overblown rhetoric she satirized in &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;: &quot;How like yaks were your drowsy thoughts&quot;.

===Reception and reputation===
The immediate and enduring success of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; dominated the rest of Gibbons&#x27;s career. Neville thought that after so singular a success at the start of her career, the rest was something of an anticlimax, despite her considerable industry and undoubted skills. The 1985 edition of &quot;The Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; defines Gibbons solely in terms of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;; it mentions none of her other works—while providing her &quot;bêtes noires&quot; Morgan and Mary Webb with full entries. To Gibbons, &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; became &quot;That Book&quot; or &quot;You-Know-What&quot;, its title never mentioned. Despite her growing irritation and expressed distaste for it, the book continued to be lauded by successive generations of critics, Boston described it as &quot;one of those rare books of comic genius that imprints itself on the brain and can never afterwards be eradicated&quot;. A more negative view of the book has been expressed by the literary critic Mary Beard, who considers it &quot;a rather controlling victory of modern order, cleanliness, contraception and medicine over these messy, different, rural types ... I found myself screaming for the rights of these poor country folk NOT to fall into the hands of people like Flora&quot;.

Although Boston suggested that Gibbons&#x27;s rating in the academic English Literature world ought to be high, her literary status is indeterminate. She did not promote herself, and was indifferent to the attractions of public life: &quot;I&#x27;m not shy&quot;, she told Oliver, &quot;I&#x27;m just unsociable&quot;. Truss records that Gibbons had &quot;overtly rejected the literary world ... she didn&#x27;t move in literary circles, or even visit literary squares, or love in literary triangles&quot;. Truss posits further reasons why Gibbons did not become a literary canon. Because she was a woman who wrote amusingly, she was classified as &quot;middlebrow&quot;; furthermore, she was published by Longmans, a non-literary publisher. Her lampooning of the literary establishment in the spoof dedication of &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; to one &quot;Anthony Pookworthy&quot; did not amuse that establishment, who were further offended by the book&#x27;s mockery of the writing of such canonical figures as Lawrence and Hardy—hence Virginia Woolf&#x27;s reaction to the &quot;Prix Étranger&quot; award. Her belief in what she called &quot;the gentle powers (Pity, Affection, Time, Beauty, Laughter)&quot; also flew in the face of a disillusioned modernism.

The literary critic John Carey suggests that the abandonment by intellectuals of &quot;the clerks and the suburbs&quot; as subjects of literary interest provided an opening for writers prepared to exploit this underexplored area. He considers John Betjeman and Stevie Smith as two writers who successfully achieved this. Hammill believes that Gibbons should be named alongside these two, since in her writings she rejects the stereotypical view of suburbia as unexciting, conventional and limited. Instead, says Hammill, &quot;Gibbons&#x27;s fictional suburbs are socially and architecturally diverse, and her characters—who range from experimental writers to shopkeepers—read and interpret suburban styles and values in varying and incompatible ways&quot;. Hammill adds that Gibbons&#x27;s strong identification with her own suburban home, in which she lived for 53 years, may have influenced her preference to stay outside the mainstream of metropolitan literary life, and from time to time mock it.

After many years in which almost all of Gibbons&#x27;s output has been out of print, in 2011 the publishers Vintage Classics reissued paperback versions of &quot;Westwood&quot;, &quot;Starlight&quot;, and &quot;Conference at Cold Comfort Farm&quot;. They also announced plans to publish 11 of the other novels, on a print-on-demand basis.

<text>The new chronology is a pseudohistorical theory proposed by Anatoly Fomenko who argues that events of antiquity generally attributed to the ancient civilizations of Rome, Greece and Egypt actually occurred during the Middle Ages, more than a thousand years later.

The theory further proposes that world history prior to AD 1600 has been widely falsified to suit the interests of a number of different conspirators including the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Russian House of Romanov, all working to obscure the &quot;true&quot; history of the world centered around a global empire called the &quot;Russian Horde&quot;.

Reception from mainstream scholars has been universally negative, and the ideas were first widely disseminated in the 1990s by Russian chess master Garry Kasparov.

==Central concepts==
The concepts that constitute the new chronology has its origins in the work of Russian scholar Nikolai Morozov (1854–1946), although the earlier work of the French scholar Jean Hardouin (1646–1729) can be seen as an intellectual progenitor. The &quot;new chronology&quot; &quot;per se&quot; is most commonly associated with Anatoly Fomenko, a Russian mathematician by trade, though he has collaborated extensively (usually with fellow mathematicians) in his writing on the subject. The theory is most fully explained in &quot;History: Fiction or Science?&quot;, originally published in Russian.

The new chronology features a totally reconstructed timeline, portraying a history that is radically shorter than what is universally accepted, based on a thesis that in effect compresses all of recorded history from the Neolithic to the Early Middle Ages into a period less than a millennium long. According to Fomenko&#x27;s claims, the practice of written history only emerged , with there being almost no real information about events that occurred between 800 and 1000 AD, and most recorded historical events actually having taken place between 1000 and 1500AD.

The new chronology is universally rejected by the scientific and historiographical communities, being totally inconsistent with the accepted methodology used in the relevant fields, including absolute and relative dating techniques. It is considered to be pseudoarchaeological, pseudohistorical, and pseudoscientific. Interest in the theory from historians and scientists has primarily stemmed from its popularity among laypeople: in addition to formulating refutations of its methods and conclusions, academics have also tried to understand the social forces underlying its resonance: Halperin (2011) estimates that as many as 30% of Russians may have sympathy for the new chronology. However, it is not known what levels of veracity or salience are generally ascribed to new chronology texts by readers, whether the texts are generally regarded as history or as fiction, or what the demographics of their readership tend to be.

The theory emerged alongside numerous other pseudohistorical and conspiracy-minded literature in a period of heightened nationalism and more lax restrictions on freedom of press following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. While other authors have written on the new chronology theory, such as Russian Gleb Nosovsky and Bulgarian Yordan Tabov (who expanded the theory relating to the Balkans), the theory is mostly understood in terms of Fomenko&#x27;s writings.

==History of new chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the second half of the 17th century. Jean Hardouin then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by Benedictine monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks&#x27; reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers. In the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton, examining the current chronology of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt and the Ancient Near East, expressed discontent with prevailing theories and in &quot;The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended&quot; proposed one of his own, which, basing its study on Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, changed the traditional dating of the Argonautic Expedition, the Trojan War, and the Founding of Rome.

In 1887, Edwin Johnson expressed the opinion that early Christian history was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.

In 1909 Otto Rank made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.

Fomenko became interested in Morozov&#x27;s theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of Moscow State University, he published several articles on &quot;new mathematical methods in history&quot; in peer-reviewed journals. The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Alex Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to &quot;a brief period of renown&quot;; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal &quot;Questions of History&quot; complained, &quot;Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science.&quot;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.

==Fomenko&#x27;s claims==
Central to Fomenko&#x27;s new chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, called the &quot;Russian Horde&quot;, which played a dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the Scythians, Huns, Goths and Bulgars, through the Polans, Dulebes, Drevlians and Pechenegs, to in more recent times, the Cossacks, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde.

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was Andronikos I Komnenos (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms, his traits and deeds reflected in &#x27;biographies&#x27; of many real and imaginary persons. The historical Jesus is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet Elisha (850–800 BC?), Pope Gregory VII (1020?–1085), Saint Basil of Caesarea (330–379), and even Li Yuanhao (also known as Emperor Jingzong or &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; – emperor of Western Xia, who reigned in 1032–1048), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus was born in Cape Fiolent, Crimea, on December 25, 1152 A.D. and was crucified on March 20, 1185 A.D., on Joshua&#x27;s Hill, overlooking the Bosphorus.

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into &quot;New Rome&quot; = Gospel Jerusalem (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = Troy = Yoros Castle. To the south of Yoros Castle is Joshua&#x27;s Hill which Fomenko alleges is the hill Calvary depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the Hagia Sophia is actually the biblical Temple of Solomon. He identifies Solomon as sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1494–1566).

However, according to Fomenko the word &quot;Rome&quot; is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims: the &quot;First Rome&quot; or &quot;Ancient Rome&quot; or &quot;Mizraim&quot; is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the Nile with its capital in Alexandria, that the second and most famous &quot;New Rome&quot; is Constantinople, and that the third &quot;Rome&quot; is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. Also according to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by Aeneas and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great &quot;Russian Horde&quot;.

==Fomenko&#x27;s methods==
===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually medieval. For example:
* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D&quot; (&quot;a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon&quot;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer Robert Newton had explained in terms of &quot;non-gravitational&quot; forces. By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the new chronology produces a constant value of D&quot; beginning around AD 1000. Newton&#x27;s analysis has since been criticized as suffering &quot;from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions.&quot;
* He associates initially the Star of Bethlehem with the AD 1140 (±20) supernova (now Crab Nebula) and the Crucifixion Eclipse with the total solar eclipse of May 1, AD 1185. He also believes that Crab Nebula supernova could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He doubts the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the star catalog in the &quot;Almagest&quot;, ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer Ptolemy, was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the &quot;Almagest&quot; is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity is well taken into account.
* He further develops Morozov&#x27;s analysis of some ancient horoscopes, including the so-called Dendera Zodiacs—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the temple of Hathor—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. In his &quot;History: Fiction or Science&quot; series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe. Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren&#x27;t meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek Thucydides in &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the Peloponnesian War between the Spartans and Athenians he was actually describing the conflict when the Duchy of Athens and the Duchy of Neopatras in Greece, held by the Catalan Company, were attacked by the Navarrese Company in the late 14th century.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

==Reception==

Fomenko&#x27;s historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scientists, historians, and scholars, who brand them as pseudohistory, pseudoarchaeology, and pseudoscience, but were popularized by former world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Billington writes that the theory &quot;might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia&quot; if not for Kasparov&#x27;s writing in support of it in the magazine &quot;Ogoniok&quot;. Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko&#x27;s conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that art and culture died during the Dark Ages and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of Byzantium could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left to them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the new chronology.

According to Sheiko, &quot;Fomenko and his allies are unrepentant, noting that the Mongolian, Turkic, and Ukrainian peoples are sadly mistaken in the delusion that they were ever anything other than elements of the Russian Horde&quot;, and remarks that for Russian critics, Fomenko represents both an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk amid the diverse societal misfortunes heaped upon Russia since the fall of Communism. Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, &quot;keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia&quot;.

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor Gleb Nosovsky were awarded for their books on &quot;new chronology&quot; the anti-prize called &quot;Abzatz&quot; (literally &#x27;paragraph&#x27;, a Russian slang word meaning &#x27;disaster&#x27; or &#x27;fiasco&#x27;) in the category &quot;Pochotnaya bezgramota&quot; (the term is a pun upon &quot;Pochotnaya gramota&quot; (Certificate of Honor) and may be translated as either &quot;Certificate of Dishonor&quot; or literally, &quot;Respectable Illiteracy&quot;) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he violates a key rule of statistics by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko&#x27;s statistical arguments. The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on &quot;The &#x27;Myths&#x27; of New Chronology&quot; chaired by the dean of the department of history of Moscow State University in December 1999. One of the participants in that round table, the distinguished Russian archaeologist, Valentin Yanin, compared Fomenko&#x27;s work to &quot;the sleight of hand trickery of a David Copperfield&quot;. Linguist Andrey Zaliznyak argued that by using Fomenko&#x27;s approaches one can &quot;prove&quot; any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.

James Billington, formerly professor of Russian history at Harvard and Princeton and the Librarian of Congress from 1987 to 2015 placed Fomenko&#x27;s work within the context of the political movement of Eurasianism, which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko&#x27;s chronology, &quot;Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire.&quot; A French reviewer of Billington&#x27;s book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global &quot;new chronology&quot;.

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Utrecht, concluded his scathing review of Fomenko&#x27;s work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
In September 2020, major Russian politician and academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Sergey Glazyev publicly proposed Fomenko&#x27;s New Chronology as a &quot;reliable support for the formation of modern ideology that consolidates Russian society&quot;:

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, most archaeologists, conservators, and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques, which are expected to have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.

In the specific case of dendrochronology, Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. Independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of North America and Europe extend back 12,400 years into the past. Furthermore, the mutual consistency of these independent dendrochronological sequences has been confirmed by comparing their radiocarbon and dendrochronological ages. These and other data have provided a calibration curve for radiocarbon dating whose internal error does not exceed ±163 years over the entire 26,000 years of the curve.

In fact, archaeologists have developed a &quot;fully anchored&quot; dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE. &quot;The absolutely dated tree-ring chronology now extends back to 12,410 cal BP (10,461 BC).&quot;

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko&#x27;s theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.
They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of &quot;importance&quot;. They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of &quot;important events&quot;, make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. Further, Fomenko&#x27;s critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data – rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of Jesus with Pope Gregory VII he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with John the Baptist. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko&#x27;s John-the-Baptist equivalent John Crescentius.)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text. Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an ad hoc hypothesis.

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko&#x27;s discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the new chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. According to astronomer Yuri N. Efremov, for his dating of the Almagest star catalog Fomenko&#x27;s selection of just eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog is arbitrary, and on grounds related to one of them (Arcturus) having a large systematic error, raised the opinion that this star has a dominant effect on Fomenko&#x27;s dating. Statistical analysis using the same method for all &quot;fast&quot; stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog. Dennis Rawlins further points out that Fomenko&#x27;s statistical analysis got the wrong date for the &quot;Almagest&quot;, because Fomenko considered Earth&#x27;s obliquity to be a constant when it is actually a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.

Fomenko&#x27;s studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia. Among these texts is a series of Babylonian astronomical diaries, which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow dating these observations, and consequently the rulers&#x27; reigns, to within a single day. The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology. In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of Babylonian, Ancient and Medieval European, and Chinese records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE. In contrast to Fomenko&#x27;s missing centuries, Stephenson&#x27;s studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with new chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German Romanov dynasty. New chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric, diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant &quot;Russian Horde&quot; empire and eliminating historical time before its existence. The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated. Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not antisemitic &quot;per se&quot;, but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the Old Testament is newer than the New Testament, placing Jerusalem in Constantinople and projecting stereotypes of Jews by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and not the other way round.

The theory provides an alternate history account of the &quot;true&quot; history centered around a world empire called the &quot;Russian Horde&quot;. The scope of the new chronology has been compared to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy world. Thousands of pages have been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native Russia. Many Internet forums have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research. His critics have suggested that Fomenko&#x27;s version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and post-Communist corporate oligarchies.

Levashovism has been inspired by this pseudohistory, taking the form of a racial occultist narrative about the Slavic Aryan &quot;Great Tartaria&quot;. Another off-shoot on online forums has been the Tartaria conspiracy theory, which draws inspiration from historic architectural photography of demolished buildings as evidence of a long-lost civilization.

<text>The 2 Seventh Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the A Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it uses the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through most of Manhattan.

The 2 operates 24 hours a day between 241st Street in Wakefield, Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College in Flatbush, Brooklyn; limited rush hour service in the reverse-peak direction originates and terminates at New Lots Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn instead of Flatbush Avenue. Daytime service makes express stops in Manhattan (between 96th and Chambers Streets) and all stops in the Bronx and Brooklyn; overnight service makes all stops along the full route.

Historically, 2 trains have also run to Crown Heights–Utica Avenue or New Lots Avenue. They ran exclusively on the IRT New Lots Line until 1983, when the 2 was routed to Flatbush Avenue. This is still the case with some rush-hour trains, albeit just to New Lots Avenue.

== Service history ==
=== Early history ===
The first section of what became the current 2 entered service on November 26, 1904, from the temporary 180th Street–Bronx Park terminal via the West Farms El to 149th Street–3rd Avenue. On July 10, 1905, the connection between the IRT Lenox Avenue Line and IRT White Plains Road Line (which was previously served by the Third Avenue El) opened, allowing subway service from Manhattan to the Bronx.

On January 9, 1908, the Joralemon Street Tunnel opened, connecting the current IRT Lexington Avenue Line to Brooklyn. At this time, trains ran from East 180th Street to Borough Hall. On May 1, 1908, trains were extended to Nevins Street and Atlantic Avenue.

The IRT White Plains Road Line was extended to 219th Street on March 3, 1917, to 238th Street–Nereid Avenue on March 31, 1917, and to Wakefield–241st Street on December 13, 1920. On August 1, 1918, the entire IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line was completed. On April 15, 1919, the Clark Street Tunnel opened, connecting the line to Brooklyn as well.

Beginning on December 19, 1919, trains ran to South Ferry with some rush hour trains to Atlantic Avenue. In 1923, during rush hours, 2 trains alternated between South Ferry and Utica Avenue. Beginning December 1, 1924, 2 trains that had previously ended at South Ferry were extended to New Lots Avenue.

On January 16, 1928, the New York State Transit Commission announced that it had reached an agreement with the IRT to increase service on its lines by 8,000,000 car miles a year; the greatest increase since 1922. As part of the changes, on January 30, all West Farms trains were extended from Atlantic Avenue to Flatbush Avenue during middays.

As of 1934, 2 trains ran from 180th Street-Bronx Park to Flatbush Avenue weekdays and Saturday during daytime and to South Ferry evenings and Sundays, running express in Manhattan. Late-night service was from 241st St to South Ferry, making all stops. There were occasional lay-up/put-ins from New Lots Avenue, and four weekday evening trains turned at Atlantic Avenue. On September 5, 1937, some evening rush hour trains started running to Flatbush Avenue.

As of July 1, 1938, weekday and Saturday evening service was extended to Flatbush Avenue from South Ferry.

Sunday service was extended to Flatbush Avenue on March 5, 1950.

Beginning on December 26, 1950, alternate weekday rush trains were extended to 241st Street in the peak direction, but PM rush service to 241st Street was discontinued on June 26, 1952. Beginning on August 4, 1952, the 180th Street—Bronx Park station was closed, with trains rerouted to East 180th Street.

=== Under the New York City Transit Authority ===
Morning rush hour service to 241st Street was cut back to Gun Hill Road on October 2, 1953. On March 19, 1954, weekend service was rerouted to New Lots Avenue at all times except late nights. On May 4, 1957, a track connection to the IRT Dyre Avenue Line was completed and daytime 2 trains were rerouted to Dyre Avenue. Evening service remained a shuttle between Dyre Avenue and East 180th Street, and morning rush service from Gun Hill Road was discontinued.

On December 20, 1957, weekday trains were rerouted to New Lots Avenue at all times except late nights. On June 26, 1958, late night service began between Dyre Avenue and East 180th Street. Beginning on December 12, 1958, late night service was extended to Flatbush Avenue and the 2 began running express at all times. Beginning February 6, 1959, trains ran between Wakefield–241st Street and Flatbush Avenue at all times except late nights, when they ran between East 180th Street and New Lots Avenue.

Beginning on April 8, 1960, daytime service was rerouted from Dyre Avenue to 241st Street and service in Brooklyn was rerouted from New Lots Avenue to Flatbush Avenue. At the same time, late night service was rerouted from Flatbush Avenue to New Lots Avenue.
Beginning on April 18, 1965, evening service was extended from East 180th Street to 241st Street and daytime service was rerouted from Flatbush Avenue to New Lots Avenue.

On July 10, 1983, the 2 and trains swapped terminals in Brooklyn, with 2 trains terminating at Flatbush Avenue and 3 trains terminating at New Lots Avenue. These changes were made to reduce non-revenue subway car mileage, to provide a dedicated fleet for each service, and to provide an easily accessible inspection yard for each service. The change allowed the 2 to be dedicated to 239th Street Yard and allowed the 3 to be assigned to Livonia Yard. With the rerouting of 3 trains, train lengths along the New Lots Line were reduced from 10 cars to 9 cars, within acceptable crowding levels, and train lengths along the Nostrand Avenue Line were increased from 9 to 10 cars, reducing crowding.

In Spring 1995, rush hour 5 service to 241st Street was cut back to Nereid Avenue. 241st Street had insufficient capacity to terminate all 2 and 5 trains during rush hours, requiring some 2 and 5 trips to terminate at Nereid Avenue. To ease passenger confusion regarding which trips terminate where and to provide more reliable service, it was decided to have all 2 trips terminate at 241st Street and have all 5 trains terminate at Nereid Avenue. This recommendation was made in response to comments made as part of the Northeast Bronx Comprehensive Study.

=== Recent history ===
From March 2 to October 12, 1998, the IRT Lenox Avenue Line was rehabilitated. On weekdays, 2 trains ran via the IRT Lexington Avenue Line between 149th Street–Grand Concourse and Nevins Street uptown from 5:00 a.m. to midnight and downtown from midnight to 5:00 a.m. On October 3, 1999, the 2 began running local in Manhattan during late night hours so local stations would receive service every ten minutes.

On December 9, 1999, New York City Transit released a proposal revising 2 and 5 service in the Bronx to eliminate a merge north of the East 180th Street station, increasing capacity and reducing delays, to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Board. Dyre Avenue-bound 5 trains would start running local along the White Plains Road Line while 2 trains would run express. Nereid Avenue-bound 5 trains would continue to run express in the Bronx. As part of the change, the frequency of service at White Plains Road Line local stations would decrease from 12 trains per hour to 7 trains per hour. Market research showed that riders at these stations preferred Lexington Avenue Line service. In addition, riders on the line north of East 180th Street would gain express service. This change would have been revenue neutral.

Shortly after the proposal was more widely announced in April 2000, Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein collected 2,000 signatures for a petition opposing the change. The MTA delayed the change&#x27;s planned implementation by a month after receiving the petition. Opponents of the change also argued that it would have increased subway crowding on the 2 train, especially at the 72nd Street station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. The change was also opposed by State Senator Eric Schneiderman, Assemblyman Scott Stringer, and Public Advocate Mark Green. New York City Transit expected the passenger volume of downtown 2 trains in the morning rush hour to increase from 92% of capacity to 108% at 72nd Street. After Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver put pressure on the MTA, the change was pushed back for an additional three months in May 2000. On September 24, 2000, a spokesperson for New York City Transit said that MTA Chairman E. Virgil Conway told planners to drop the change until service on the 5 was increased with the arrival of new R142 subway cars by early 2002; the swap proposal was canceled the next day.

After September 11, 2001, 2 trains ran local in Manhattan at all times so they would not be delayed behind trains terminating at 14th Street. Daytime express service resumed on September 15, 2002.

Due to repairs to Hurricane Sandy-related damage on the Clark Street Tube, on weekends between June 17, 2017, and June 24, 2018, the 2 ran between Eastchester–Dyre Avenue in the Bronx and South Ferry in Lower Manhattan, with 5 trains replacing it in Brooklyn and the Bronx north of East 180th Street. Trains ran express only between 96th Street and Times Square–42nd Street during the daytime.

<doc id="409204" wikidata="Q959455" url="?curid=409204" title="Lacy Clay">
<text>William Lacy Clay Jr. (born July 27, 1956) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative from from 2001 to 2021. His congressional career ended after he lost in a Democratic primary to Cori Bush in 2020, after successfully defeating her in the 2018 primary.

The district Clay represented is based in the city of St. Louis and includes most of northern St. Louis County (North County), including the cities of Maryland Heights, University City, Ferguson and Florissant.

== Early life and education ==
William Lacy Clay Jr. was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His family moved to Washington, D.C., when his father, Bill Clay, was elected to Congress. His mother was Carol Ann (nee Johnson).

In his teenage years, Clay attended public schools in Silver Spring, Maryland, and graduated from Springbrook High School in 1974. He subsequently attended the University of Maryland, College Park, earning a degree in political science and a paralegal certificate. Clay is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He attended Howard University School of Law, worked as an Assistant Doorkeeper of the United States House of Representatives, and worked on his father&#x27;s Congressional campaigns.

==Missouri Legislature==
Clay entered the Missouri House of Representatives in 1983, winning a special election to complete the term of Nathaniel J. &quot;Nat&quot; Rivers. In 1991, he was elected to the Missouri Senate.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2000, Bill Clay announced his retirement after 32 years in Congress. His son, Lacy Clay, faced a three-way Democratic primary to succeed his father. Clay Jr. prevailed with 62% of the vote. He breezed to victory in the general election. He was reelected nine times, winning Democratic primaries by an average margin of 30 points. In ten general elections, Clay Jr. has received an average of 73.5% of the general election vote.

For his first six terms, Clay represented the northern two-thirds of St. Louis, while the southern third was in Missouri&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, represented by Russ Carnahan. After Missouri lost a congressional district as a result of the 2010 census, the final map resulted in the 3rd district being eliminated and the 1st district absorbing all of St. Louis, a decision in which then-U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said Clay was involved for his self-interest. Clay beat Carnahan in the August 7, 2012, primary, 63% to 34%.

In the 2018 Democratic primary, he defeated Cori Bush, a Justice Democrat, and two other challengers with 56.7% of the vote. In the general election, Clay beat Republican Robert Vroman with 80% of the vote.

In the 2020 Democratic primary, he lost to Bush, with 45% of the vote to her 48%.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance (Chairman)
* United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform
** United States House Natural Resources Committee

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Black Caucus
* Congressional Progressive Caucus
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus

===Capitol painting===
In January 2017, Clay argued with Republican lawmakers over the right to hang a controversial painting in the Capitol building. The winner of an art competition, the painting represents the violent Ferguson unrest of 2014 and ensuing police-community relations in Ferguson, Missouri, depicting police officers as pigs while apprehending suspects. The painting is displayed near the police security checkpoint. Representative Duncan Hunter removed the painting and Clay rehung it. Several Republicans, including Doug Lamborn, Dana Rohrabacher, and Brian Babin, repeatedly removed the painting, and Clay rehung it each time. Clay then attempted to file a complaint with the Capitol Police accusing Hunter of theft. After the Architect of the Capitol ruled that the winning painting had violated the rules of the competition and ordered its permanent removal, Clay sued to overturn the decision, but the suit was dismissed by a federal judge. Clay continued to assert a First Amendment argument on behalf of his young constituent, asking, &quot;How is it possible that we stand for freedom of speech and freedom of expression every place across this country, except the U.S. Capitol?&quot;

===Federal legislation to curb gun violence===
In the 116th Congress, Clay introduced HR 3435, the Local Public Health and Safety Protection Act, legislation that would, for the first time at the federal level, give local communities the freedom to enact regulations to curb gun violence without seeking permission from their state legislatures. The legislation grants local control over the issue via the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and by tying the law to future public safety grant funding to states from the U.S. Department of Justice. Support across the nation for Clay&#x27;s bill is growing, with endorsements from Moms Demand Action Against Gun Violence, Newtown Action, Giffords Courage, Brady, and many other gun control advocates.

===Environment===
While in his role as a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, Clay was an advocate for renewable energy, acting on climate change, cosponsoring the Green New Deal, protecting National Parks, national seashores, wildlife refuges, forests, and rivers. He was also an outspoken champion for cleaning up hazardous waste sites in largely minority communities, which are often the victims of environmental racism. Clay led the effort to clean up three dangerous, hazardous sites in his district: $5 million for the former St. Louis Army Ammunition Plant in North St. Louis, $33 million for the former Carter Carburetor plant site in North St. Louis, and $266 million for the radiologically contaminated West Lake Landfill Superfund site in Northwest St. Louis County.

==Political positions==
During Clay&#x27;s 17 years in the Missouri legislature, he authored Missouri&#x27;s Hate Crimes Law, which included gender, sexual orientation and sexual identity in the criteria for what constitutes a hate crime.

He was one of the 31 United States Representatives who voted not to count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.

Clay voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

Clay is a supporter of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s program of quantitative easing, claiming it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

On December 18, 2019, Clay voted for both articles in the first impeachment of Donald Trump.

==Electoral history==




































==Personal life==
Clay married his first wife, Ivie, in 1992, when he was a state senator. He filed for divorce in 2009. Ivie initially found out about the divorce &quot;only through the media.&quot; Through her lawyer, she stated: &quot;“I and my children are devastated and embarrassed that my husband let us find out from the children’s friends and the media that he had filed for divorce, and mostly that he still has not contacted our children. I would have wanted to prepare the children.&quot; The divorce was finalized in 2011.

Clay later remarried and he and his wife, Patricia, reside in University City, in St Louis County, Missouri. He is the father of two children, Carol and Will III.

He is Catholic.

<text>Harper&#x27;s Weekly, A Journal of Civilization was an American political magazine based in New York City. Published by Harper &amp; Brothers from 1857 until 1916, it featured foreign and domestic news, fiction, essays on many subjects, and humor, alongside illustrations. It carried extensive coverage of the American Civil War, including many illustrations of events from the war. During its most influential period, it was the forum of the political cartoonist Thomas Nast.

==History==
===Inception===

Along with his brothers James, John, and Wesley, Fletcher Harper began the publishing company Harper &amp; Brothers in 1825. Following the successful example of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, Harper started publishing &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1850. The monthly publication featured established authors such as Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, and within several years, demand for the magazine was great enough to sustain a weekly edition.

In 1857, his company began publishing &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in New York City. By 1860, the circulation of the &quot;Weekly&quot; had reached 200,000. Illustrations were an important part of the &quot;Weekly&quot;&#x27;s content, and it developed a reputation for using some of the most renowned illustrators of the time, notably Winslow Homer, Granville Perkins, Porte Crayon, and Livingston Hopkins.

Among the recurring features were the political cartoons of Thomas Nast, who was recruited in 1862 and worked with the &quot;Weekly&quot; for more than 20 years. Nast was a feared caricaturist, and is often called the father of American political cartooning. He was the first to use an elephant as the symbol of the Republican Party. He also drew the legendary character of Santa Claus; his version became strongly associated with the figure, who was popularized as part of Christmas customs in the late nineteenth century.

===Civil War coverage===
&quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; was the most widely read journal in the United States during the American Civil War era of the mid-19th century. &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; took a moderate editorial position on the issue of slavery prior to the Civil War&#x27;s outbreak in 1861, earning it the label &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weakly&quot; by critics.

===19th century===
During the 1860 U.S. presidential campaign, the magazine supported Stephen A. Douglas in his campaign against Abraham Lincoln. But as the American Civil War broke out, the magazine fully supported Lincoln and the Union. A July 1863 article in &quot;The Weekly&quot; on the escaped slave Gordon included an illustration taken from a photograph of his back, severely scarred from whippings. The image provided many readers in the North their first visual evidence of slavery&#x27;s brutality. The image and story inspired many free blacks in the North to enlist in the Union Army.

Many of the most important articles and illustrations in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; were related to the American Civil War. Besides illustrations by Homer and Nast, the magazine published illustrations by Theodore R. Davis, Henry Mosler, and the brothers Alfred and William Waud.

Beginning in 1863 until his death in 1892, George William Curtis, one of the founders of the Republican Party, served as the magazine&#x27;s political editor. His editorials advocated civil service reform, low tariffs, and adherence to the gold standard.

===President maker===
After the end of the Civil War, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; more openly supported the Republican Party in its editorial positions, and supported the presidential candidacy of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 and again in 1872. It supported the Radical Republican position on Reconstruction. In the 1870s, the cartoonist Thomas Nast began an aggressive campaign in the journal against the corrupt New York political leader William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed. Nast turned down a $500,000 bribe to end his attack. Tweed was arrested in 1873 and convicted of fraud.

Nast and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; also played an important part in securing Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; 1876 presidential election. Later on Hayes remarked that Nast was &quot;the most powerful, single-handed aid [he] had&quot;. After the election, Nast&#x27;s role in the magazine diminished considerably. Since the late 1860s, Nast and George W. Curtis had frequently differed on political matters and particularly on the role of cartoons in political discourse. Curtis believed that mockery by caricature should be reserved for Democrats, and did not approve of Nast&#x27;s cartoons assailing Republicans such as Carl Schurz and Charles Sumner, who opposed policies of the Grant administration. &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; publisher Fletcher Harper strongly supported Nast in his disputes with Curtis. In 1877, Harper died, and his nephews, Joseph W. Harper Jr. and John Henry Harper, assumed control of the magazine. They were more sympathetic to Curtis&#x27; arguments for rejecting cartoons that contradicted his editorial positions.

In 1884, however, Curtis and Nast agreed that they could not support the Republican candidate James G. Blaine, whose association with corruption was anathema to them. Instead they supported the Democratic candidate, Grover Cleveland. Nast&#x27;s cartoons helped Cleveland become the first Democrat to be elected president since 1856. In the words of the artist&#x27;s grandson, Thomas Nast St Hill, &quot;it was generally conceded that Nast&#x27;s support won Cleveland the small margin by which he was elected. In his last national political campaign, Nast had, in fact, &#x27;made a president.

Nast&#x27;s final contribution to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; was his Christmas illustration in December 1886. Journalist Henry Watterson said that &quot;in quitting &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, Nast lost his forum: in losing him, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; lost its political importance.&quot; Nast&#x27;s biographer Fiona Deans Halloran says &quot;the former is true to a certain extent, the latter unlikely. Readers may have missed Nast&#x27;s cartoons, but &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; remained influential.&quot;

On January 14, 1893, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; became the first American magazine to publish a Sherlock Holmes story, &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;.

===20th century===
After 1900, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; devoted more print to political and social issues, and featured articles by some of the more prominent political figures of the time, such as Theodore Roosevelt. &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; editor George Harvey was an early supporter of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s candidacy, proposing him for the Presidency at a Lotos Club dinner in 1906. After that dinner, Harvey would make sure that he &quot;emblazoned each issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; with the words &#x27;For President—Woodrow Wilson.

Roderic C. Penfield served as the managing editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from 1912 to 1914. The magazine published its final issue on May 13, 1916. It was absorbed by &quot;The Independent&quot;, which in turn merged with &quot;The Outlook&quot; in 1928.

In the mid-1970s, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; used the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; title for a spinoff publication, which was published biweekly from its New York City headquarters and depended on contributions from readers for much of its content.

<doc id="409210" wikidata="Q5115568" url="?curid=409210" title="Chuck Knipp">
<text>Chuck Knipp (born 1961) is a Canadian comedian and nurse best known for his vocal characters. His best known character is Shirley Q. Liquor. Knipp also performed as spirituality seeker Betty Butterfield. Knipp&#x27;s performance of the Liquor character were controversial, and garnered protests. 

Knipp was known for his radio advertisements in Southeast Texas. He retired from live performances in 2010 and now is a volunteer registered nurse with the American Red Cross.

==Reactions to Knipp&#x27;s characters==
=== Criticism ===
There have been a number of articles in the media that have taken issue with Knipp&#x27;s performance of Shirley Q. Liquor - a white comedian voicing a Black female character.

* To Knipp&#x27;s declaration that Liquor &quot;was created in celebration of, not to downgrade, black women&quot;, Jasmyne Cannick countered in her blog: &quot;...it is not possible for Charles Knipp, a white man, to help heal years of mistreatment and racism at the hands of his people by putting on a wig, speaking Ebonics, and in blackface...There is nothing remotely uplifting about Knipp&#x27;s act and I wish people would stop defending his character with the tired argument that he&#x27;s trying to heal the nation. The only thing Knipp is trying to heal is the hole in his pocket by filling it with all of the money he makes off of degrading Black people.&quot;

Knipp was profiled in an article by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and dubbed &quot;The Most Dangerous Comedian in America.&quot;

===Support===
* The entertainer RuPaul has long been a fan and supporter of Knipp. &quot;Critics who think that Shirley Q. Liquor is offensive are idiots. Listen, I&#x27;ve been discriminated against by everybody in the world: gay people, black people, whatever. I know discrimination, I know racism, I know it very intimately. She&#x27;s not racist, and if she were, she wouldn&#x27;t be on my new CD.&quot; In his blog, RuPaul adds: &quot;I am very sensitive to issues of racism, sexism and discrimination. I am a gay black man, who started my career as a professional transvestite in Georgia, twenty years ago.&quot;
* The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; journalist Dan Kennedy awarded Boston government official Jerome Smith the dubious Muzzle Award for his part in the cancellation of Knipp&#x27;s scheduled performance in Boston in 2004.
* The writer David Holthouse, the anti-racist investigator for the Southern Poverty Law Center&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;, stated that &quot;Knipp is in no way a white supremacist&quot; and that Knipp &quot;invites the audience to sympathize with a single Black mother&quot;. An in-depth article was printed in the June, 2007, edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.
* The &quot;New York Blade&quot; criticized GLAAD for condemning Knipp, stating, &quot;We commend GLAAD for condemning racism, but we question whether the organization&#x27;s goal is best attained by joining this particular fight.&quot;
* John Strausbaugh, the author of &quot;Blackface, Whiteface, Insult &amp; Imitation in American Popular Culture&quot;, explores Liquor&#x27;s act in his book.
* Syndicated radio host Michael Berry, a native of Orange, Texas, plays frequent clips and often live phone interviews with Knipp&#x27;s characters. 
* Louisville, KY radio and television personality Terry Meiners, a long time presence on the local airwaves, frequently features clips and recorded skits with Shirley Q. Liquor as she visits some of our local businesses with Terry&#x27;s own character &quot;Trouble Man&quot; on iHeartRadio&#x27;s local radio station WHAS AM.
Knipp concedes that his performances should make people uncomfortable because &quot;we all are used to treating African Americans as if their skin colour is a disease&quot; and that black people are &quot;more than intelligent enough to discern the nuance&quot; of his performances. He has also said that &quot;many people thought that Harriet Beecher-Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was and still is perceived as racist, despite being the probable artistic genesis of emotional support against slavery in the 19th century.&quot;

<doc id="409213" wikidata="Q5599282" url="?curid=409213" title="Great Hacker War">
<text>The Great Hacker War was a purported conflict between the Masters of Deception (MOD), an unsanctioned splinter faction of the older hacker group Legion of Doom (LOD), and several smaller associated groups. Both primary groups involved made attempts to hack into the opposing group&#x27;s networks, across the Internet, X.25, and telephone networks. In a panel debate of The Next HOPE conference, Phiber Optik re-iterated that the rumored &quot;gang war in cyberspace&quot; between Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception never happened, and that it was &quot;a complete fabrication&quot; by the U.S attorney&#x27;s office and some sensationalist media. Furthermore, two other high-ranking members of the LOD confirmed that the &quot;Great Hacker War&quot; never occurred, reinforcing the idea that this was just a competition of one-upmanship and not a war.

==Timeline==
The Great Hacker War escalated in the space of only a few days with four key events.

===Event One===
The Great Hacker War began with the closing of an invite-only bulletin board called &quot;Fifth Amendment,&quot; whose participants were some of the world&#x27;s most successful hackers. 

Said board was run by members of the newly reformed LOD under the leadership of Chris Goggans (aka Erik Bloodaxe) and Loyd Blankenship (aka The Mentor).

The board&#x27;s closing had been blamed on John Lee (&quot;Corrupt&quot;) of the MOD in a cryptic message left to users. Chris Goggans (LOD) had claimed that Lee had been distributing information that was discussed on the board. MOD had discovered that Chris Goggans and his friends had decided to use the information being posted on the board to start a security company and contact all companies being discussed about the security flaws posted on Fifth Amendment.

===Event Two===
A few prank phone calls to the home number of the new LOD upset Goggans and prompted him to put out a call to find the personal information of the members of the MOD. Peacemakers intervened, and a conference call was arranged on an unnamed RBOC telephone bridge in the Midwest. As members of the MOD silently joined the conference call, they overheard the members of the LOD using racial slurs to describe the ethnicity of members of the MOD. The peace conference quickly degenerated into threats and prank calls to members of the LOD, whose personal information had already been uncovered by the MOD.

===Event Three===
A last-minute, late-night peace talk was held between Chris Goggans (LOD) and Mark Abene (&quot;Phiber Optik&quot;) of MOD. Unknown to Goggans, John Lee (&quot;Corrupt&quot;) was listening in on three-way. Goggans became angry that Abene would not fulfill his numerous demands for the personal information of MOD members, and for the MOD&#x27;s hacking information that he considered the property of LOD.

Abene refused to meet Goggans&#x27;s demands, and Goggans uttered his infamous phrase that began the war in earnest &quot;MOD is nothing but niggers, spics, and white trash.&quot; That night, prank phone calls began to flood Abene&#x27;s house.

===Event Four===
The members of the MOD decided to eavesdrop on Chris Goggans&#x27;s phone calls to determine his motives. Using the undocumented remote headset feature on a DMS-100 phone switch local to Goggans, the MOD overheard what they had suspected earlier. Goggans, Scott Chasin (&quot;Doc Holiday&quot;), and Jake Kenyon Shulman (&quot;Malefactor&quot;) had decided to form a security company called ComSec.

=== Epilogue ===
In 1991, Phiber Optik, while attending the first CFP conference in San Francisco with Craig Neidorf, was invited to join a telephone conference bridge by fellow hackers where an apologetic Shulman expressed his remorse at how the situation had been blown out of proportion and his view that Goggans had crossed the line in informing on other hackers to law enforcement to increase the prestige of ComSec. Further, it was suspected by other LOD members that Goggans had baited Phoenix of the Australian hacker group The Realm, and was instrumental in providing evidence to Australian federal authorities. As a result, Phiber, a friend of Phoenix&#x27;s, received a conference call from several original LOD members now suspicious of Goggans, wondering if they had been implicated by Goggans or other informants in Abene&#x27;s pending legal case, in addition to expressing their general distaste and distrust of Goggans. In 1993 at the third CFP conference, also in San Francisco, Phiber/Abene met a small handful of his old LOD friends (minus Goggans) for the first time in person despite having been friends for nearly ten years by that point, and briefly reminisced about old times. Some years later in a public statement, Goggans would show some regret that he involved Abene in his testimonials to law enforcement. Perhaps the one thing in all this that Phiber and Lex Luthor agree on is that in reality, there simply was no &quot;Great Hacker War&quot;, and that the notion of &quot;warring hacker gangs&quot; was an invention of overzealous law enforcement which was latched onto by irresponsible mass media because the imagery made for good copy.

<doc id="409215" wikidata="Q6779356" url="?curid=409215" title="Mary Durack">
<text>Mary Durack (20 February 1913 – 16 December 1994) was an Australian author and historian. She wrote &quot;Kings in Grass Castles&quot; and &quot;Keep Him My Country&quot;.

==Childhood==
Mary Durack, born in Adelaide, South Australia, to Michael Patrick Durack (1865–1950) and Bessie Durack (née Johnstone), and her siblings lived at the remote Argyle Downs and Ivanhoe cattle stations in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. In the late 1920s and early 1930s Mary and her sister Elizabeth would manage the Ivanhoe cattle station, whilst their brother would leave to manage Argyle Downs. During these times they would live and work very closely with the indigenous people who worked on, and lived near the station. They learnt from the local indigenous women everything from how to cook to how to muster cattle. The Durack family were pioneers in the settlement of the area by Europeans. The story of her family&#x27;s history, beginning with the mid-19th century migration from Ireland, is presented by Durack in &quot;Kings in Grass Castles&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Sons in the Saddle&quot;.

==Writing==

&quot;Little Poems of Sunshine-by an Australian Child.&quot; This is the name of a small book of verses composed by Mary Durack as a 10-year-old in 1923. 

In 1935, Mary and her sister, Elizabeth, were to publish their first collaboration. The text in &quot;All About: The Story of a Black Community on Argyle Station&quot; was supplied by Mary and the illustrations were by Elizabeth. The collaboration was to produce a number of children&#x27;s books: &quot;Chunuma&quot; in 1936; &quot;Son of Djaro&quot; and the &quot;Way of the Whirlwind&quot; in 1940–1941;&quot;The Magic Trumpet&quot; in 1946 and &quot;To Ride a Fine Horse&quot; (1963).

Mary Durack wrote under the name &quot;Virgilia&quot; for The Western Mail between 1934 and 1938, in a column for women and children in rural areas called Virgilians&#x27; Friendly Corner. The column represented some of the first work Durack published as a paid writer, however, she felt limited by the demands of her readers and would often hide in her office to avoid meeting with fans of &#x27;The Corner&#x27;. In 1950 she wrote the novel &quot;Keep Him My Country&quot;. Other important works include the saga of the Durack family, &quot;Kings in Grass Castles&quot; (1959) and its sequel, &quot;Sons in the Saddle&quot;; and a play, &quot;Swan River Saga: Life of Early Pioneer Eliza Shaw&quot; (1976). A biography, &quot;To Be Heirs Forever&quot;, also used Eliza Shaw as a subject. Durack also continued to write children&#x27;s literature, most notably the story of the Nyungar man, Yagan, which was published in 1964 as &quot;The Courteous Savage: Yagan of the Bibbulmun&quot; and &quot;Tjakamarra: Boy between two worlds.&quot;

Other works by Mary Durack included a two–act play, &quot;Ship of Dreams&quot;; an Australian Settler (1968); &quot;The Rock and the Sand&quot; (1969) is a history of missionaries in the state; &quot;The Aborigines in Australian Literature&quot; (1978) is part of the non-fiction component of her work, a subject often forming the basis of many of her works of fiction.

Durack adapted &quot;Keep Him My Country&quot; into the libretto for a one-act opera, &quot;Dalgerie&quot;, by James Penberthy; it premiered in Perth on 22 January 1959. On 25 July 1973, along with Larry Sitsky&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, it was one of the first two operas to be given an evening performance at the Sydney Opera House.

Her literary works include the editing of &quot;The Fifth Sparrow&quot; (1972), a posthumously published autobiography of the Western Australian author Mollie Skinner.

She contributed to the Australian Dictionary of Biography.

==Personal life==

On 2 December 1938, she married the aviator, Captain Horrie C. Miller, OBE, who died in 1980. They had two sons and four daughters, including Robin Miller, a famous aviator and nurse who was known as &quot;The Sugarbird Lady&quot; after her work fighting polio. Two of Mary Durack&#x27;s daughters predeceased her.

==Honours and distinctions==

Durack was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her services to literature on 31 December 1977. On 12 June 1989, she was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

<doc id="409218" wikidata="Q56707502" url="?curid=409218" title="Variations of ordinaries">
<text>Ordinaries in heraldry are sometimes embellished with stripes of colour alongside them, have lumps added to them, shown with their edges arciform instead of straight, have their peaks and tops chopped off, pushed up and down out of the usual positions, or even broken apart.

==Cottices==

Cottices, also spelled &quot;cottises&quot;, &quot;cotises&quot;, &quot;cotices&quot;, &quot;cotizes&quot;, are narrow stripes beside and parallel to an ordinary.

Cottices can take exotic line variations and even charge-like shapes.
==Nowy==

An ordinary with a circular boss in the middle is described as &quot;nowy&quot;.

An ordinary with a square boss is called &quot;quadrate&quot; or, more fully, &quot;nowy quadrate&quot;.
A saltire quadrate has the square boss turned &quot;lozengeways&quot;, with edges parallel to those of the saltire.
An ordinary with a lozenge-shaped boss is called &quot;nowy lozengy&quot; or &quot;nowy of a lozenge&quot; (applies also to saltires)

Nowy and quadrate are usually applied only to the cross, saltire, pale, fess and bend.

==Facetting==

An ordinary, perhaps especially a cross, might, like diamonds and mullets, be &quot;facetted&quot;, but examples of facetted ordinaries in actual heraldry are extremely hard to find. 

==Embowed==
An ordinary &quot;embowed&quot; has the edges bowed inwards producing a concavity; this is sometimes more explicitly blazoned &quot;inwardly embowed&quot;. Its opposite is &quot;enarched&quot;.

This variation is most often applied to the chevron and pile.

The term &quot;embowed&quot; is also applied to bent arms and legs, arched fish, and serpents in circles.

==Ecimé and other modified chevrons==

The chevron &quot;ecimé&quot; has its peak &quot;blunted&quot;, i.e. squared off rather than meeting in a point. Much more common is &quot;couped at the peak (or point)&quot; or even truncated. In the Canadian Public Register truncated is used in the Anglophone versions of blazons, and ecimé in the Francophone ones.

The chevron disjointed or disjoined has the central, pointed portion missing.[5] The chevron éclaté has each end with roughly-made points or spikes on it.[6]. The chevron brisy (or brisé) as in the Scots Public Register, vol 52, p54 also has the point part removed though in this case the two remaining sections are squared off and &#x27;lean&#x27; against each other, as can be seen in the French coat of Meaudre de la Pouyade.[7]

The Armorial de Gelre shows Bernard v.d. Wilten as bearing a &quot;fasce palissée&quot; (similar to a fess embattled with long merlons and the ends rounded).

==Enhanced and abased==

An ordinary &quot;enhanced&quot; is placed higher in the field than its usual position.

When an ordinary is shown lower down the shield than its usual position, it is described as debased or abased or abaisse or dehanced.

==Rompu==

An ordinary &quot;rompu&quot; is &quot;broken&quot; in some way, though the form of the breaking may vary considerably and may perhaps need further description to avoid confusion.

An example is the chevronels rompu in the arms of Danzé, Loir et Cher, France. A chevron &#x27;rompu&#x27; has the central section shifted vertically upward, as in the coat of the US 278th Armored Infantry Battalion. (There is an example of a &quot;chevron double rompu reversed&quot; in the arms of USCGC Biscayne Bay.) A &quot;bend rompu arraswise&quot; of an unusual form can be found in the arms of the 99th Air Base Wing of the United States Air Force. &quot;Rompu&quot; should be distinguished from &quot;fracted&quot;. The arms of the Roossenekal Local Area Committee are &quot;Per chevron Gules and Azure, a chevron fracted and embattled to chief Or, between in chief a rose Argent, barbed and seeded, and in base a cross fleuretty, Or&quot;. The form of the &quot;fracting&quot; can be specified.

An ordinary affaissée, in French heraldry, is wavy in the form of a depression in its middle.

The word &quot;rompu&quot; is also applied to a common charge which is broken, e.g. &quot;a circular chain with link rompu at the top&quot;, although this is more usually blazoned as &quot;fracted&quot;.

<text>Knole () is a British country house and former archbishop&#x27;s palace owned by the National Trust. It is situated within Knole Park, a park located immediately to the south-east of Sevenoaks in west Kent. The house ranks in the top five of England&#x27;s largest houses, under any measure used, occupying a total of .

The current house dates back to the mid-15th century, with major additions in the 16th and, particularly, the early 17th centuries. Its Grade I listing reflects its mix of late-medieval to Stuart structures and particularly its central façade and state rooms. In 2019, an extensive conservation project, &quot;Inspired by Knole&quot;, was completed to restore and develop the structures of the buildings and thus help to conserve its important collections. The surrounding deer park has also survived with varying degrees of management in the 400 years since 1600.

==History==
===Location===
Knole is located at the southern end of Sevenoaks, in the Weald of west Kent. To the north, the land slopes down to the Darenth valley and the narrow fertile &quot;pays&quot; of Holmesdale, at the foot of the North Downs. The land around Sevenoaks itself has sandy soils, with woodland that was used in the Middle Ages in the traditional Wealden way, for pannage, rough pasture and timber. The Knole estate is located on well-drained soils of the Lower Greensand. It was close enough to London to allow easy access for owners who were involved with affairs of state, and it was on &quot;sounde, parfaite, holesome grounde&quot;, in the words of Henry VIII. It also had a plentiful supply of spring water. The knoll of land in front of the house gives it a sheltered position. The wooded nature of the landscape could provide not only timber but also grazing for the meat needs of a grand household. Moreover, it made an excellent deer park, being emparked before the end of the 15th century. The dry valley between the house and the settlement of Sevenoaks also makes a natural deer course, for a combined race and hunt between two dogs and fallow deer.

===Early history===
The earliest recorded owner of the core of the estate, in the 1290s, was Robert de Knole. However, nothing is known of any property he had on the estate. Two other families, the Grovehursts and the Ashburnhams, are known to have held the estate in succession until the 1360s, and the manor of Knole is first mentioned in 1364. In 1419, the estate, which then spread over 800 acres, had been bought by Thomas Langley, Bishop of Durham, and by 1429, he had extended it to 1,500 acres. The estate remained in the hands of the Langley family, it seems, until the mid-1440s when it had been acquired by James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele. The circumstances of this transfer are not known, but it is clear that Lord Saye and Sele was also enlarging the estate by further, sometimes forcible, purchases of adjoining parcels of land. For example, in 1448 one Reginald Peckham was forced to sell land at Seal (at the north-eastern end of the current estate) to Saye &quot;on threat of death&quot;. Forcible land transfers recur in the later history of the house, including that between Archbishop Thomas Cranmer and Henry VIII.

Lord Saye and Sele seems to have begun a building project at Knole, but it was incomplete by his death in 1450. His ruthless exploitation of his powerful position in Kent was a motivating factor in the Jack Cade Rebellion. Saye and Sele was executed on the authority of a hastily assembled commission initiated by Henry VI in response to the demands of Cade&#x27;s rebels when they arrived in London.

=== Archbishop Bourchier&#x27;s House ===
James Fiennes&#x27;s heir, William, second Baron Saye and Sele, sold the property for 400 marks (£266 13s 4d) in 1456 to Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury. He already had a substantial property in the area, Otford Palace, but the drier, healthier site of Knole attracted him. Archbishop Bourchier probably began building work by making substantial renovations of an existing house. Between 1456 and 1486, Bourchier and his bailiff for the Otford bailiwick, John Grymesdyche, oversaw substantial building work on the current house. The remodelled house must have been suitable for the archbishop by 1459, when he first stayed there, but he based himself there increasingly in his later years, particularly after 1480, when, at the age of about 69, he appointed a suffragan. In 1480, Thomas Cardinal Bourchier, as he had become in 1473, gave the house to the Archdiocese of Canterbury.

In subsequent years, Knole House continued to be enlarged, with the addition of a large courtyard, now known as Green Court, and a new entrance tower. These were long thought to be the work of one of Bourchier&#x27;s successors, but the detailed study by Alden Gregory suggests that Bourchier was responsible. He took advantage of the political stability that followed the restoration of Edward IV in 1471 to invest further in his property.

=== Knole in the Tudor period ===
After Cardinal Bourchier&#x27;s death in 1486, Knole was occupied by the next four archbishops: John Morton (1487–1500), Henry Deane (1501–1503), William Warham (1504–1532) and finally Thomas Cranmer. Sir Thomas More appeared in revels there at the court of Archbishop Morton, whose cognizance (motto) of &quot;Benedictus Deus&quot; appears above and to either side of a large late Tudor fireplace there. Henry VII was an occasional visitor, as in early October and midwinter 1490.

Cardinal Bourchier had enclosed the park with a pale to make a deer park and it seems that Henry VIII used to visit Archbishop Warham to hunt deer. After the death of Warham and before the appointment of his successor, Henry found his properties in nearby Otford and Knole useful residences for his daughter Mary, at the time of the protracted divorce from her mother, Catherine of Aragon. She was at Knole from 27 November 1532 to 5 March 1533.

Warham&#x27;s successor as archbishop, Thomas Cranmer, acquired all the temporalities of the See of Canterbury. However, these brought with them substantial debts and complex demands of land management, set against a backdrop of massive land transfers associated with the dissolution of the monasteries and broader assaults on church wealth. Cranmer was, therefore, unable to withstand repeated demands from Henry VIII for exchanges of land. This was a long-term process stretching between 1536 and 1546, so that there is no need to imagine that Henry wanted Knole, specifically, for example as a deer park. In 1537 the manor of Knole, and five other manors and a number of advowsons and chantries largely forming the archbishop&#x27;s bailiwick of Otford, were &#x27;exchanged&#x27; with Henry VIII. In return, Cranmer received a package primarily consisting of former abbeys and priories between Canterbury and Dover.

Knole was granted to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, in August 1547 at the start of his nephew Edward VI&#x27;s reign, but following Somerset&#x27;s execution in 1549 it reverted to the Crown. Mary gave the residence back to her Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Reginald Pole, but with their deaths in 1558 the house reverted to the Crown.

In the early 1560s, Elizabeth I gave Knole to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, but he returned it in 1566. However, he had already granted a lease (1 February 1566) to one Thomas Rolf. Under this the &#x27;manor and mansion-house&#x27; of Knole and the park, with the deer, and also Panthurst Park and other lands, were demised to the latter for the term of ninety-nine years at a rent of £200. The landlord was to do all repairs, and reserved the very unusual right (to himself and his heirs and assigns) to occupy the mansion-house as often as he or they chose to do so, but this right did not extend to the gate-house, nor to certain other premises. The tenant was given power to alter or rebuild the mansion-house at his pleasure. Meanwhile, Elizabeth had possibly granted the estate to her cousin Thomas Sackville who, at that time, had the title of Lord Buckhurst.

There was competition at that time for the Knole estate. Rolf died very soon after, and the residue of the lease was bought by a wealthy local lawyer, John Lennard (of Chevening). He had gradually built up a network of properties around Sevenoaks, including the manor of Chevening, and adjoining property in the parishes of Knockholt and Halstead, all just to the north of Sevenoaks. Lennard had already pressurised Rolf to sell the lease before his sudden death but, at the same point, Lord Buckhurst was also competing for the lease. Knole was a significant addition to Lennard&#x27;s local land-holdings when it was confirmed, around 1570. However, Buckhurst was still able to insist upon some rights on the estate, including the ownership of at least some of the deer in the park. John moved to Knole, but gave his son Sampson, Lord Dacre&#x27;s son-in-law, a sub-lease. The Knole estate was worth a great deal to Sampson, bringing him in 1599 rents worth £218, 6s and 8d.

One of Sampson Lennard&#x27;s daughters, Margaret, married Sir Thomas Waller, at one time lieutenant of Dover Castle and the younger son of an important Kent family, with their seat at Groombridge. An unusual term in the marriage covenant stipulated that Margaret and Thomas should live at Knole which is where Margaret gave birth to her son William, probably in 1598. The baptism is recorded in the Sevenoaks parish register for 3 December. In 1613, William inherited his father&#x27;s baronetcy, becoming Sir William Waller. He later commanded a parliamentary army with some distinction during the English Civil War.

=== Early-Stuart Knole and the Sackvilles ===
Since Dudley had originally granted a 99-year lease, Thomas Sackville could only take it back by buying out the remaining 51 years of the lease for £4,000, which he did in 1603. Lennard was happy to sell, not only because of his mounting debts but also because he wished to gain the Dacre title, which he did in 1604 from a commission headed by the Lord Treasurer, Thomas Sackville. This is unlikely to have been a coincidence. Sackville&#x27;s descendants, the Earls and Dukes of Dorset and Barons Sackville, have owned or lived in the property ever since. 

Thomas Sackville, at that time Lord Buckhurst, had considered a number of other sites to build a house commensurate with his elevated status in court and government. However, he could not overlook the multiple advantages of Knole: a good supply of spring water (rare for a house on a hill), plentiful timber, a deer park and close enough proximity to London. He immediately began a large building programme. This was supposed to have been completed within two years, employing some 200 workmen, but the partially-surviving accounts show that there was continuing, vast expenditure even in 1608–1609. Since Sackville had had a distinguished career at court under Elizabeth and then been appointed Lord High Treasurer to James VI and I, he had the resources to undertake such a programme. Perhaps, with his renovations to the state rooms at Knole, Sackville hoped to receive a visit by the King, but this does not seem to have occurred and the lord treasurer himself died during the building work, in April 1608, at the age of about 72.

Thomas Sackville&#x27;s Jacobean great house, like others such as Hatfield and Audley End, have been called &quot;monuments to private greed&quot;. Unlike any surviving English great house apart from Haddon Hall, Knole today still looks as it did when Thomas died, having managed &quot;to remain motionless like this since the early 17th century, balanced between growth and decay.&quot;

Thomas&#x27;s son, Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset, took over the titles and estates, gave a description of his father&#x27;s work on re-modelling Knole: &quot;late re-edified wth a barne, stable, dovehouse and other edifices, together wth divers Courts, the gardens orchards and wilderness invironed wth a stone wall, well planted wth choise frute, and beawtified wth ponds, and manie other pleasureable delights and devises are situate wthin the Parke of knoll, the charge of new building of the said house and making planting and furnishing of the said ponds yards gardens orchards and wilderness about Seaven yeares past Thirty thosand pounds at the least yet exstant uppon Accounpts. All wch are now in the Earle of dorsetts owne occupacon and are worth to bee sold.&quot;

The 2nd earl did not enjoy Knole for long, since he died in January 1609. His two sons, in turn, inherited the title and estates, first Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset (1589–1624) and then the much more politically significant Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset (1590–1652). None of these earls lived permanently at Knole. In the first earl&#x27;s case, this was no doubt due to the renovations. The third earl lived mostly at court, though he is known to have kept his hunting horses and hounds there.

The wife of the 3rd Earl, Lady Anne Clifford, lived at Knole for a time during the couple&#x27;s conflict over her inheritance from her father, George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. A catalogue of the household of the Earl and Countess of Dorset at Knole from this time survives. It records the names and roles of servants and indicates where they sat at dinner. The list includes two African servants, Grace Robinson, a maid in the laundry, and John Morockoe, who worked in the kitchen. Both are described as &quot;Blackamoors&quot;. In 1623, a large part of Knole House burnt down.

=== Knole during the Civil War, Commonwealth and Restoration ===

Edward, a relatively moderate royalist, was away from Knole in the summer of 1642, when he and his cousin and factotum Sir John Sackville fell under suspicion of stockpiling arms and preparing local men to fight for Charles I during the Civil War. The rumours of the cache of arms reached Parliament in an intercepted letter for which Sir John was notionally the source. On Sunday 14 August 1642, Parliament sent three troops of horse under Colonel Edwin Sandys, a member of a Kentish puritan family, to seize these arms from Knole. Sir John was in the congregation for the parish Sunday service and Sandys waited with his troops outside the church until it had finished. Local people tried to rescue him but they quickly judged that the troops were too strong for them, and Sir John was arrested and taken to the Fleet prison.

Sandys&#x27;s troops then moved to Knole where, according to the earl of Dorset&#x27;s steward, they caused damage to the value of £186, and &#x27;The Armes they have wholie taken awaie there being five wagenloads of them (&quot;sic passim&quot;).&#x27; In fact, the arms were largely of more interest to antiquarians than to soldiers; they included, for example, thirteen &#x27;old French pistolls whereof four have locks [and] the other nine have none&#x27;. Sandys claimed that he had seized &#x27; armes for 500 or 600 men&#x27;, but this is untrue. Nevertheless, the House of Lords resolved that &#x27;such [arms] as are fit to be made use of for the Service of the Kingdom are to be employed&#x27;. In addition, the House was sequestrated. Edward accepted the seizures and damage to Knole as an inevitable part of the Civil War, as he explained in a speech to Charles I and his peers in Oxford, in 1642: &#x27;For my particular, in these wars I have suffered as much as any, my Houses have been searcht, my Armes taken thence, and my sonne and heire committed to prison; yet I shall wave these discourtesies, because I know there was a necessity they should be so.&#x27; 

Parliament established County Committees to govern the counties under its control. For the first 12 to 18 months of its operation, the Kent Committee was based at Knole, until its obvious disadvantage, being at one end of a very large county, led to its removal first to Aylesford and then to Maidstone. Apart from the committee, the county treasury was based here, along with a bodyguard of between 75 and 150 men and the so-called &#x27;Household&#x27;. To provision its varied occupants, the Committee not only used the Knole estate but also rented fields from local landowners, including, surprisingly, Lady Sackville (Sir John&#x27;s wife). Some accounts for the period survive. They show, for example, a gift of a few pounds to goodman Skinner for &#x27;looking to Knole Parkgate.&#x27; Other expenditure was seen as much more extravagant, including £3091 for the Household, called the &#x27;seraglio&#x27; by local enemies. Committee meetings were held in the room now known as Poets&#x27; Parlour where, in addition to using the existing furnishings, £153 was spent on sheets, table linen and carpets and £22 on silverware, candlesticks, glasses, jugs and drinking horns. Additional beds were also brought from Kippington, Thomas Farnaby&#x27;s sequestered house from the other side of Sevenoaks. One indication of the religious issues involved in the War is shown from the expenditure of £1 17s 4d for the &#x27;carpenters and others employed in taking away the rails and levelling the ground in the chapel at Knole&#x27;. Nevertheless, the committee had moved to Aylesford Priory before April 1645.

When Edward Sackville died in 1652, his son Richard inherited not only the earldom, but estates in substantial debt, not least owing to fines imposed by Parliament for his father&#x27;s role in the Civil War. He practised quiet retrenchment, despite taking part in some public work following the Restoration of Charles II, including membership of the commission for the trial of the regicides. However, his marriage to Lady Frances Cranfield, daughter of Lionel Cranfield, was important for Knole. When her brother died, she inherited the Middlesex estates, including Copt Hall in Essex. Richard died at Knole on 27 August 1677. but his son, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset (1643–1706), sold Copt Hall in 1701. Many of the contents were then moved to Knole, substantially enriching the collection. These include the copies by Daniel Mytens of the Raphael Cartoons and many portraits and pieces of furniture. Along with John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset (1745–1799), Charles can now be seen as one of the two principal collectors responsible for the remarkable holdings of Knole House.

Charles was an important figure in the late Stuart court; Vita Sackville-West calls him &#x27;one of the most jovial and debonair figures in the Knole portrait-gallery.&#x27; He was a poet and patron who became Charles II&#x27;s lord chamberlain and &#x27;unofficial minister of the arts&#x27;, with the &#x27;poets&#x27; parlour&#x27; in Knole becoming a venue for literary society to converse. After 1688, John Dryden ceased to be poet laureate, owing to his catholic views which meant he refused the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. Charles stood by him with generous gifts of money, despite Dryden&#x27;s bitterness about his treatment at court. On one occasion, dining at Knole, Dryden found a hundred-pound note under his plate. Not only Dryden but several other poets of the age appear to have been guests at Knole. The so-called &#x27;Poet&#x27;s Parlour&#x27; is today part of the private Sackville-West family apartments at Knole.

As the heir to the earl of Middlesex&#x27;s estates, he obtained the new creation earl of Middlesex in 1674. In January 1688, his son, Lionel Sackville, was born at Knole. When Charles died in 1706, Lionel inherited.

===Knole since 1700===

Lionel Sackville was a key supporter of the Hanoverian Succession and was rewarded by George I with the Order of the Garter in 1714 and the dukedom of Dorset in 1720. In 1730, Sir Robert Walpole appointed him lord lieutenant of Ireland. Much later, in 1757, he was attacked in Knole Park by a mob protesting against the Militia Bill. However, he was saved by the arrival of a small cavalry force and died peacefully in Knole House in 1765. His wife, Elizabeth, had been a maid of honour to Queen Anne. Her great friend, Lady Elizabeth Germain, lived at Knole for such a long time that her bedroom, sitting room and china closet are, to this day, named after her.

Lionel&#x27;s son, Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset, only survived his father by four years, but his grandson John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset was a much more significant character for Knole. An avid collector with the means to satisfy his acquisitiveness, he not only brought back various old masters from his Grand Tour in 1770, but also became a discerning patron for contemporary artists. Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a full-length portrait and the Duke also acquired several other paintings by Reynolds, eleven of which are still on display in the Reynolds Room.

John Frederick&#x27;s only son, George Sackville, 4th Duke of Dorset, died in 1815 aged 21, and Knole was then left by the third Duke&#x27;s widow in 1825 to their daughter Mary, Countess of Plymouth. She died childless in 1864, leaving it to her sister Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr and her heirs male. It ultimately passed to the latter&#x27;s fourth son, Mortimer Sackville-West, 1st Baron Sackville, and thence to his successors. However, Lord Sackville&#x27;s resources were insufficient to maintain the house and its possessions. He began selling a number of the heirlooms to enable him to keep the estate going.

The Sackville-West descendants included writer Vita Sackville-West. Her &quot;Knole and the Sackvilles&quot;, published 1922, is regarded as a classic in the literature of English country houses. Its rather romantic style is sometimes of dubious historical accuracy but it is based upon full access to the manuscripts and books at that time in the House&#x27;s collection, though many are now in the Kent County Archives (originally at the Centre for Kentish Studies; hence CKS in some catalogue records, and now at the Kent History and Library Centre) in Maidstone.

It was soon after this book&#x27;s publication, in December 1922, that Vita first met Virginia Woolf who, became a friend and, for a while in the later 1920s, her lover. Woolf wrote &quot;&quot; over the winter of 1927–1928, an experimental, though accessible, novel which drew on the history of the house and Sackville-West&#x27;s ancestors, particularly as presented in Vita&#x27;s book. The Sackville family custom of following the Salic rules of primogeniture was to prevent Vita from inheriting Knole upon the death of her father Lionel Sackville-West, 3rd Baron Sackville (1867–1928). As she was not philoprogenitive, this was as well, but the thought hung heavily on her at this time. Woolf gave her a fantastical version of Knole and, when Vita had read it, she wrote to Virginia, &#x27;You made me cry with your passages about Knole, you wretch.&#x27; This sentiment may be heightened by the uses of Vita as a historical model for some of the photos in the original Hogarth edition. Three of these are, in fact, adapted from pictures at Knole: &#x27;Orlando as a boy&#x27; from the young Edward Sackville in the double portrait; &#x27;Archduchess Harriet&#x27; from a picture of Mary, fourth countess of Somerset in Lord Sackville&#x27;s private collection and &#x27;Orlando as Ambassador&#x27; from a portrait of Lionel Sackville, the first duke of Dorset by Rosalba Carriera. On her father&#x27;s death in 1928, the house and estate went to Lionel&#x27;s younger brother, Charles (1870–1962). However, if Vita had to leave Knole, &quot;Orlando&quot; remained; the original manuscript of what Vita&#x27;s son, Nigel Nicolson called, &#x27;the longest and most charming love-letter in literature&#x27; is there. It is perhaps fairer to see it as a work of consolation to Vita, though it is one that also contains a number of barbed comments about &quot;Knole and the Sackvilles&quot;, with its altered versions of letters and lists:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Already – it is an effect lists have upon us – we are beginning to yawn. But if we stop, it is only that the catalogue is tedious, not that it is finished. There are ninety-nine pages more of it ... . And so on and so on.&quot;

==Art and architecture==

===House===
Although its complex history reveals Knole to have been the result of many periods of development, its national importance is primarily for its 17th-century structure. As A. P. Newton puts it:
:Knole is neither sublime nor picturesque. It is, however, especially in the distant view, authentic, looking almost exactly now as it did in the year Thomas Sackville died... . No English great house but Haddon has managed to remain motionless like this since the early-seventeenth century, balanced between growth and decay.
At the time of Sackville&#x27;s rebuilding, little notice was taken of his work. It was not at the forefront of architectural development and, in 1673, John Evelyn called it &#x27;‘a great old fashioned house&#x27;, quite unlike the classical style favoured by Inigo Jones and also illustrated by Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk&#x27;s almost contemporary rebuilding of Audley End. Knole may no longer look much like Bourchier&#x27;s late-medieval house, but it can still give the impression of a sombre, squat, complex of houses, not least thanks to its use of the dark Kentish ragstone. However, Edward Town asserts its importance, arguing that &#x27;what Sackville achieved at Knole was a remarkable synthesis of what was inherited from the existing fabric and what was newly built.&#x27; He had taken a great, late-medieval house for a series of archbishops of Canterbury, usually among the most powerful men in the state, which had already experienced other changes of function and occupancy during the sixteenth century, and made it a Jacobean country house. Sackville recommended the &quot;very excellent surveyor&quot; John Thorpe to survey and make &quot;plots&quot; in 1605 for the rebuilding of Ampthill for Anne of Denmark and Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and may have employed him on his own building projects.

Beyond the Jacobean façade, plentiful evidence still exists of the earlier house. One of the main surviving elements is the northern range of Stone Court. The upper floors contain a series of high-status apartments, and these are demonstrated by a number of structural features, such as the series of large garderobe towers protruding on the north side and the cellars below, which contain some late-15th-century wall paintings.

In 2013, Knole was granted £7.75m by the Heritage Lottery Fund for conservation and repair work to the House. As part of this work, in 2014, archaeologists found that the late-medieval wall and roof timbers, and the oak beams beneath floors, particularly near fireplaces, had been scorched and carved with scratched marks. Initial media coverage focused on these being apotropaic marks, or &quot;witch marks&quot;, to prevent witches and demons from coming down the chimney. This is one of a series of possible interpretations of such marks, which are now being found increasingly on medieval and renaissance building across England, including at Sissinghurst. However, all interpretations suggest they were apotropaic rituals to ward off fire damage or evil spirits. Since many of these are late-medieval marks, covered up during the early-17th-century rebuilding of Knole, it is fanciful to link them to James I&#x27;s interest in witchcraft, particularly since, after the publication of his book &quot;Daemonologie&quot; (1597), he later became much more sceptical about the existence of witches.

===Rooms===
The many state rooms open to the public contain a collection of 17th-century royal Stuart furniture, perquisites from the 6th Earl&#x27;s service as Lord Chamberlain to William III in the royal court. These include three state beds, silver furniture (comprising a pair of torchieres, mirror and dressing table, being rare survivors of this type), outstanding tapestries and textiles, and the Knole Settee. The art collection includes portraits by Anthony van Dyck, Thomas Gainsborough, Sir Peter Lely, Sir Godfrey Kneller and Sir Joshua Reynolds (the last being a personal friend of the 3rd Duke), and a copy of the Raphael Cartoons. Reynolds&#x27;s portraits in the house include a late self-portrait in doctoral robes and depictions of Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith and Wang-y-tong, a Chinese page boy who was taken into the Sackville household. There are also survivals from the English Renaissance: an Italianate staircase of great delicacy and the vividly carved overmantel and fireplace in the Great Chamber. The &#x27;Sackville leopards&#x27;, holding heraldic shields in their paws and forming finials on the balusters of the principal stair (constructed 1605–1608) of the house, are derived from the Sackville coat of arms. The chapel-room with its crypt seems to pre-date this period and has contemporary pews.

The organ, in the late medieval private chapel at Knole, is arguably the oldest playable organ in England. The organ has four ranks of oak pipes (Stopped Diapason 8, Principal 4, Twelfth 22/3 and Fifteenth 2) contained in a rectangular ornamented chest with the keyboard at the top. Its date of construction is not known, but an early guidebook refers to a marked date of 1623 (although no such date mark is still apparent) – a date in the 1620s has been suggested. The pitch of the organ is sharp (A460 Hz) and the foot-pumped bellows remain in working order.

===Collections===
The National Trust has a digital record of most of its Knole collection. It contains internationally important collections, particularly of 17th-century state furniture.

The house is cared for and opened by the National Trust, which has owned the house since it was donated by Charles Sackville-West, 4th Baron Sackville in 1947; however, the Trust owns only the house and an adjoining modest park – overall . Much of the house is lived in by the Sackville-Wests: the Sackville family or the family trust own the remainder of the deer park but permit commercialised access and certain charitable and sporting community events.

There is an oft repeated myth that Knole is a calendar house, which had 365 rooms, 52 staircases, 12 entrances and seven courtyards. While the number of rooms is approximately correct, the number of staircases has been reduced by internal renovations and changes. Traditionally, there have been seven spaces called courts – Green Court, Stable Court, Stone Court, Water Court, Queen&#x27;s Court, Pheasant Court and Men&#x27;s Court. This definition is somewhat loose, with additional courtyards such as Brewhouse Yard and Carpenters Yard not included.

 In January 2012, the National Trust launched a seven-year plan to conserve and restore the house, including a public appeal for £2.7M.

===Gardens===
Knole has a walled garden (30 including the &#x27;footprint&#x27; of the house). It has the unusual – and essentially medieval feature of a smaller walled garden inside the outer one (&quot;Hortus Conclusus&quot;). It contains many other features from earlier ages which have been taken out of most country-house gardens: various landscapers have been employed to elaborate the design of its large gardens with distinctive features. These features include &quot;clair-voies&quot;, a &quot;patte d&#x27;oie&quot;, two avenues, and bosquet hedges. The herb garden by the orangery was designed in 1963 by Margaret Brownlow.

===Remainder of the park===

Overall the house is set in its deer park. This has generally been kept in traditional condition; however, the controlled deer population does not have access to all parts. Due to the rich woodland, Knole Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The park hosts the annual Knole Run, a schools cross-country race.

===Commercial and cultural uses===
Knole was the setting for the filming in January 1967 of the Beatles&#x27; videos that accompanied the release of &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. The stone archway through which the four Beatles rode on horses can still be seen on the southeastern side of the Bird House, which itself is on the southeastern side of Knole House. The same visit to Knole Park inspired another Beatles song, &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, which John Lennon wrote after buying an 1843 poster in a nearby antiques shop that advertised Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal.

Knole also appears in the 2008 film &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, along with nearby Penshurst Place and Dover Castle. It has been featured in several other films including &quot;Burke and Hare&quot; (2010), &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;.

The British Film Institute has a freely-available, family home film from 1961, showing how the park looked at that time. A 1950 film made by the Sevenoaks Ciné Society, an amateur group, features the house in &quot;Hikers&#x27; Haunt&quot;.

<doc id="409222" wikidata="Q712359" url="?curid=409222" title="Roger Miller">
<text>Roger Dean Miller Sr. (January 2, 1936 – October 25, 1992) was an American singer-songwriter, widely known for his honky-tonk-influenced novelty songs and his chart-topping country hits &quot;King of the Road&quot;, &quot;Dang Me&quot;, and &quot;England Swings&quot;.

After growing up in Oklahoma and serving in the U.S. Army, Miller began his musical career as a songwriter in the late 1950s, writing such hits as &quot;Billy Bayou&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; for Jim Reeves and &quot;Invitation to the Blues&quot; for Ray Price. He later began a recording career and reached the peak of his fame in the mid-1960s, continuing to record and tour into the 1990s, charting his final top 20 country hit &quot;Old Friends&quot; with Price and Willie Nelson in 1982. He also wrote and performed several of the songs for the 1973 Disney animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. Later in his life, he wrote the music and lyrics for the 1985 Tony Award−winning Broadway musical &quot;Big River&quot;, in which he played Pap Finn in 1986.

Miller died from lung cancer in 1992 and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame three years later. His songs continued to be recorded by other singers, with covers of &quot;Tall, Tall Trees&quot; by Alan Jackson and &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; by Brooks &amp; Dunn; both reached the number one spot on country charts in the 1990s. The Roger Miller Museum — now closed — in his home town of Erick, Oklahoma, was a tribute to Miller.

== Early life ==
Roger Miller was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the third son of Jean and Laudene (Holt) Miller. Jean Miller died from spinal meningitis when Miller was a year old. Unable to support the family during the Great Depression, Laudene sent her three sons to live with three of Jean&#x27;s brothers. Thus, Miller grew up on a farm outside Erick, Oklahoma, with Elmer and Armelia Miller.

As a boy, Miller did farm work, such as picking cotton and plowing. He later said he was &quot;dirt poor&quot; and that as late as 1951 the family did not own a telephone. He received his primary education at a one-room schoolhouse. Miller was an introverted child who often daydreamed or composed songs. One of his earliest compositions went: &quot;There&#x27;s a picture on the wall. It&#x27;s the dearest of them all, Mother.&quot;

Miller was a member of the FFA in high school. He listened to the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; and Light Crust Doughboys on a Fort Worth station with his cousin&#x27;s husband, Sheb Wooley. Wooley taught Miller his first guitar chords and bought him a fiddle. Wooley, Hank Williams, and Bob Wills were the influences that led to Miller&#x27;s desire to be a singer-songwriter. He began to run away and perform in Oklahoma and Texas. At 17, he stole a guitar out of desperation to write songs; however, he turned himself in the next day. He chose to enlist in the U.S. Army to avoid jail. He later quipped, &quot;My education was Korea, Clash of &#x27;52.&quot; Near the end of his military service, while stationed in Atlanta, Georgia, Miller played fiddle in the &quot;Circle A Wranglers&quot;, a military musical group started by Faron Young. While Miller was stationed in South Carolina, an army sergeant whose brother was Kenneth C. &quot;Jethro&quot; Burns, from the musical duo Homer and Jethro, persuaded him to head to Nashville after his discharge.

== Career ==
=== Nashville songwriter ===
On leaving the Army, Miller traveled to Nashville to begin his musical career. He met with Chet Atkins, who asked to hear him sing, loaning him a guitar since Miller did not own one. Out of nervousness, Miller played the guitar and sang a song in two different keys. Atkins advised him to come back later, when he had more experience. Miller found work as a bellhop at Nashville&#x27;s Andrew Jackson Hotel, and he was soon known as the &quot;singing bellhop.&quot; He was finally hired by Minnie Pearl to play the fiddle in her band. He then met George Jones, who introduced him to music executives from the Starday Records label who scheduled an audition. Impressed, the executives set up a recording session with Jones in Houston. Jones and Miller collaborated to write &quot;Tall, Tall Trees&quot; and &quot;Happy Child.&quot;
After marrying and becoming a father, Miller put aside his music career to be a fireman in Amarillo, Texas. A fireman by day, he performed at night. Miller said that as a fireman he saw only two fires, one in a &quot;chicken coop&quot; and another he &quot;slept through&quot;, after which the department &quot;suggested that...[he] seek other employment.&quot; Miller met Ray Price and became a member of his Cherokee Cowboys. He returned to Nashville and wrote &quot;Invitation to the Blues&quot;, which was covered by Rex Allen and later by Ray Price, whose recording was a number three hit on country charts. Miller then signed with Tree Publishing on a salary of $50 a week. He wrote: &quot;Half a Mind&quot; for Ernest Tubb, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I Feel&quot; for Faron Young; and his first number one, &quot;Billy Bayou&quot;, which along with &quot;Home&quot; was recorded by Jim Reeves. Miller became one of the biggest songwriters of the 1950s. Bill Anderson later remarked that &quot;Roger was the most talented, and least disciplined, person that you could imagine&quot;, citing the attempts of Miller&#x27;s Tree Publishing boss, Buddy Killen to force him to finish a piece. He was known to give away lines, inciting many Nashville songwriters to follow him around since, according to Killen, &quot;everything he said was a potential song.&quot;

=== Recording career ===
Miller signed a recording deal with Decca Records in 1958. He was paired with singer Donny Lytle, who later gained fame under the name Johnny Paycheck, to perform the Miller-written &quot;A Man Like Me&quot;, and later &quot;The Wrong Kind of Girl&quot;. Neither of these honky-tonk-style songs charted. His second single with the label, featuring the B-side &quot;Jason Fleming&quot;, foreshadowed Miller&#x27;s future style. To make money, Miller went on tour with Faron Young&#x27;s band as a drummer, although he had never drummed. During this period, he signed a record deal with Chet Atkins at RCA Victor, for whom Miller recorded &quot;You Don&#x27;t Want My Love&quot; (also known as &quot;In the Summertime&quot;) in 1960, which marked his first appearance on country charts, peaking at No. 14. The next year he made an even bigger impact, breaking through the top 10 with his single &quot;When Two Worlds Collide&quot;, cowritten with Bill Anderson. But Miller soon tired of writing songs, divorced his wife, and began a party lifestyle that earned him the moniker &quot;wild child.&quot; He was dropped from his record label and began to pursue other interests.

After numerous appearances on late night comedy shows, Miller decided that he might have a chance in Hollywood as an actor. Short of money, he signed with the up-and-coming label Smash Records, asked the label for $1,600 in cash in exchange for recording 16 sides. Smash agreed to the proposal, and Miller performed his first session for the company early in 1964, when he recorded the hits &quot;Dang Me&quot; and &quot;Chug-a-Lug&quot;. Both were released as singles, peaking at No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on country charts; both fared well on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 reaching No. 7 and No. 9. The songs transformed Miller&#x27;s career, although the former was penned by Miller in just four minutes. Later that year, he recorded the No. 15 hit &quot;Do-Wacka-Do&quot;, and soon after, the biggest hit of his career &quot;King of the Road&quot;, which topped Country and Adult Contemporary charts while peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard 100. It also reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for one week in May 1965. The song was inspired by a sign in Chicago that read &quot;Trailers for Sale or Rent&quot; and a hobo who happened upon Miller at an airport in Boise, but Miller needed months to write the song, which was certified gold in May 1965 after selling a million copies. It won numerous awards and earned a royalty check of $160,000 that summer. 

Later in 1965, Miller scored hits with &quot;Engine Engine No. 9&quot;, &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; (a Top Ten country hit about a local television children&#x27;s show personality who would rather stay in the safety and security of his success in Kansas City than become a bigger star – or risk failure – in Omaha), and &quot;England Swings&quot; (an adult contemporary No. 1). He began 1966 with the hit &quot;Husbands and Wives, a mid-tempo waltz reflecting on issues that affect marriages.&quot;

Miller was given his own TV show on NBC in September 1966. It lasted for 13 weeks, and it ended its run in January 1967. During this period, Miller recorded songs written by other songwriters. The final hit of his own composition was &quot;Walkin in the Sunshine&quot;, which reached No. 7 and No. 6 on the country and adult contemporary charts in 1967. Later in the year he scored his final top 10 hit with the first recording of Bobby Russell&#x27;s &quot;Little Green Apples&quot;. The next year, he was first to cover Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s &quot;Me and Bobby McGee,&quot; taking the song to No. 12 on country charts. In 1970, Miller recorded the album &quot;A Trip in the Country&quot;, honky-tonk-style standards penned by Miller, including &quot;Tall, Tall Trees.&quot; Later that year, after Smash Records folded, Miller was signed by Columbia Records, for whom he released &quot;Dear Folks: Sorry I Haven&#x27;t Written Lately&quot; in 1973. Later that year, Miller wrote and performed three songs in the Walt Disney animated feature &quot;Robin Hood&quot; as the rooster and minstrel Allan-a-Dale: &quot;Oo-De-Lally&quot;, &quot;Not in Nottingham&quot;, and &quot;Whistle-Stop&quot; (which was sampled for use in the popular Hampster Dance web site). He provided the voice of Speiltoe, the equine narrator of the Rankin/Bass holiday special &quot;Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey&quot; in 1977. Miller collaborated with Willie Nelson on an album titled &quot;Old Friends.&quot; The title track was based on a song he had previously penned for his family in Oklahoma. The song, with guest vocals from Ray Price, was the last hit of Miller&#x27;s career, peaking at No. 19 on country charts in 1982.

=== Late career ===
In 1970, Miller opened the King of the Road Inn, a Nashville hotel. As Brian Carpenter wrote in &quot;Southern Cultures&quot;, &quot;With its rooftop lounge and accompanying penthouse suite (complete with a swinging double bed), Miller&#x27;s King of the Road Inn was, for a time, the unofficial center of Nashville&#x27;s thriving music scene.&quot; It is now called the Clarion Hotel Downtown Nashville-Stadium.

Miller continued to record for different record labels and charted a few songs, but stopped writing in 1978, feeling that his more &quot;artistic&quot; works were not appreciated. He was absent from the entertainment business following the release of &quot;Old Friends&quot; in 1981, but returned after receiving an offer to write a Broadway score for a musical based upon Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Although he had not read the novel, Miller accepted the offer after discovering how the story brought him back to his childhood in rural Oklahoma. It took a year and a half to write the opening, but he eventually finished it. The work, titled &quot;Big River&quot;, premiered at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre in New York on April 25, 1985. The musical received glowing reviews, earning seven Tony Awards including &quot;Best Score&quot; for Miller. He acted the part of Huck Finn&#x27;s father Pap for three months after the exit of actor John Goodman, who left for Hollywood. In 1983 Miller played a dramatic role on an episode of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; He played a country and western singer who is severely burned while freebasing cocaine.

Miller left for Santa Fe to live with his family following the success of &quot;Big River&quot;. He co-wrote Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s hit &quot;It Only Hurts When I Cry&quot; from his 1990 album &quot;If There Was a Way&quot;, and supplied background vocals. The song was released as a single in 1991, peaking at No. 7 on country charts. He began a solo guitar tour in 1990, ending the following year after being diagnosed with lung cancer. His last performance on television occurred on a special tribute to Minnie Pearl which aired on TNN on October 26, 1992, the day after Miller&#x27;s death.

== Style ==
Although he is usually grouped with country music singers, Miller&#x27;s unique style defies easy classification. Many of his recordings were humorous novelty songs with whimsical lyrics, coupled with scat singing or vocalese riffs filled with nonsense syllables. Others were sincere ballads which caught the public&#x27;s fancy, like his signature song, &quot;King of the Road&quot;. The biographical book &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No Cigarettes&quot; described Miller as an &quot;uncategorizable talent&quot; and stated that many regarded him as a genius.

Miller&#x27;s whimsical lyrics and nonsense-sounding style led to him writing and performing songs for children&#x27;s films such as &quot;Oo-de-Lally&quot; for the Disney animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. During his most successful years as a songwriter and singer, Miller&#x27;s music was placed in the country genre due to his somewhat country or folk sounding voice and the use of an acoustic guitar. &quot;AllMusic&quot; wrote that in blending country with jazz, blues, and pop, Miller &quot;utilized unusual harmonic and rhythmic devices in his sophisticated songcraft&quot; and was an important influence on progressive country.

On his own style, Miller remarked that he &quot;tried to do&quot; things like other artists but that it &quot;always came out different&quot; so he got &quot;frustrated&quot; until realizing &quot;I&#x27;m the only one that knows what I&#x27;m thinking.&quot; He commented that the favorite song that he wrote was &quot;You Can&#x27;t Rollerskate in a Buffalo Herd.&quot; Johnny Cash discussed Miller&#x27;s bass vocal range in his . He stated that it was the closest to his own that he had heard.

== Personal life and death ==
Miller was married three times and fathered eight children. Miller married Barbara Crow, from Shamrock, Texas, when they were both 17. Together the couple had four children, the first of whom died shortly after birth. As Miller&#x27;s young family grew, his desire for fame and success continued to grow as well. After moving the family to California for a short time, Miller and Barbara divorced. Subsequent public interest in Miller led to the success he had long hoped for, but it also brought struggles that are often associated with life in the entertainment business: periods of burnout as well as alcohol and substance abuse. His amphetamine use in the 1960s has been described as both damaging of his career and helpful to his songwriting. In 1972, he referred to amphetamines as &quot;a snake pit I got into&quot; and supported a ban on the drug in Oklahoma.

Miller married Leah Kendrick of San Antonio in 1964. Together the couple had two children, Dean and Shannon.

After 14 years of marriage, Leah and Miller divorced in the mid-1970s. Miller eventually married Mary Arnold, whom he met through Kenny Rogers. Arnold was a replacement member in The First Edition, a band led by Rogers. After the breakup of The First Edition, she performed with her husband Miller on tours as a backup singer, including a performance at the White House before President Gerald Ford. In 2009 she was inducted into the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame. Since Miller&#x27;s death, she has managed his estate. She sued Sony for copyright infringement in the 2007 case , which went to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Arnold was ultimately awarded nearly $1 million in royalties and rights to the songs Miller wrote in 1964.

Miller was a lifelong cigarette smoker. During a television interview, Miller explained how he composed his songs from &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of ideas he wrote on scraps of paper. When asked what he did with the unused bits and pieces, he half-joked, &quot;I smoke &#x27;em!&quot; He also wrote a song about his habit, titled &quot;Dad Blame Anything a Man Can&#x27;t Quit&quot;. Miller died of lung and throat cancer in 1992, at age 56, shortly after the discovery of a malignant tumor beneath his vocal cords.

<text>Great Brickhill is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the border with the City of Milton Keynes, located south-east of Central Milton Keynes, and in the same direction from Fenny Stratford.

==History==
The village name is a compound of Brythonic and Anglo Saxon origins, which is a common occurrence in this part of the country. The Brythonic &quot;breg&quot; means &#x27;hill&#x27;, and the Anglo Saxon &quot;hyll&quot; also means &#x27;hill&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Brichelle&quot;. The affix &#x27;Great&#x27; was added in the 12th century to differentiate from nearby Bow Brickhill and Little Brickhill.

Robert Merydale was parson of the parish church of Great Brickhill in 1470, according to a legal record, in which Edward Lucy &amp; Thomas Hampden claim that he owed them £20.

Great Brickhill was described in 1806 in &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; as follows:

:Great-Brickhill, in the hundred and deanery of Newport, lies about two miles and a half to the south-east of Fenny Stratford. The manor was anciently in the Beauchamps, from whom it passed by female heirs to the Bassets and Greys. Richard Grey, Earl of Kent, sold it in 1514 to Sir Charles Somerset, of whose son, Sir George it was purchased in 1549, by the Duncombes: from this family it passed, by female heirs, to the Bartons and Paunceforts, and is now the property of Philip Duncombe Pauncefort esq.
:The manor of Smewnes-Grange, in this parish, became the property of Woburn Abbey, in 1293. King Edward VI granted it to Edward Stanton esq. of whose descendant it was purchased in 1792, (under an act of parliament which had passed the preceding year,) by the present proprietor, Edward Hanmer esq. of Stockgrove. This manor extends into the parish of Soulbury: the manor-house, which was built by Edward Stanton, the grantee, within a moated site near the River Ouzel, has long been suffered to go to decay.
:In the parish church are memorials of the families of Duncombe, Barton, Pauncefort, and Chase. The advowson of the rectory is annexed to the manor. This parish was inclosed by an act of parliament, passed in 1776, when an allotment of land was assigned to the rector, in lieu of tithes, and an allotment to the poor in lieu of their right of cutting furze.

The Victoria History of the Counties of England provides substantially more detail on the manorial record, but does not mention the Beauchamps (apart from one mention of &#x27;the wife of the Earl of Warwick&#x27;).


In 1643 Great Brickhill was touched by the English Civil War. The Parliamentarian Earl of Essex and his army camped in the village for a month. Great Brickhill was considered a strategic site due to its elevation and proximity to Watling Street (now the A5 road), at the time the main approach road to London from the north. However, there were no battles or even skirmishes here.

==Modern Great Brickhill==

That Great Brickhill survives today as a village is due in no small part to the objections of its residents to the ever-increasing development of Milton Keynes. The expansion of this large urban area has led to parts of the civil parish being swallowed up.

The high brick wall, reminiscent of that at nearby Woburn, which runs for some distance adjacent to the road, now neglected and ruined in places, surrounds the 70-acre (280,000 m2) park which once housed the principal seat of the Duncombe family, Great Brickhill Manor. The last manor house to occupy this park was built circa 1835, a large square brick stuccoed building of no particular architectural merit – old photographs show a slight Italianate influence in the design, a style later made popular by Queen Victoria at Osborne House. This house was demolished in 1937 after serving for a time as Stratton Park Preparatory School.

The Duncombe family (the head of whom since 1859 has been a Baronet) continue to live in the village and own the estate; however, they now reside at what used to be the old Rectory near the church. Ironically the rectory is shielded from the empty site of the family&#x27;s former more splendid home by a battlemented folly wall, built by a former Duncombe who disliked the vicar so much that he did not wish to see him or his home!

The parish church of St. Mary the Virgin is a Grade II* listed building, dating back to the 13th century.

Another large house in the area was Stockgrove, built in the 1920s on the site of a much older mansion (see &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; above) this Georgian-style house was built by the industrialist Sir Ferdinand Kroyer-Kielberg. The estate was divided and sold in the 1950s. The house for a time became a &#x27;Special School&#x27; and in the 1990s was divided into luxury apartments.

Great Brickhill no longer has a shop, like so many other villages its bakery and post office are long closed. It has a local public house, the &#x27;Old Red Lion&#x27;.

The village primary school is High Ash Church of England Combined School, which is a mixed, voluntary controlled, Church of England school. It takes children from the age of four through to the age of twelve and has approximately 240 pupils. It is one of several Buckinghamshire schools which host mobile phone masts. Contracts between Buckinghamshire County Council and various mobile phone operators generate an income of £145,000 per annum, of which about £59,000 comes from contracts for masts that are installed in schools.

<text>This article lists political parties in El Salvador.

== Political culture ==
El Salvador has a multi-party system. Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), had traditionally dominated politics. ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of Mauricio Funes of the FMLN in March 2009.

Geographically, the departments of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative.

In February 2021, El Salvador&#x27;s legislative election was an important breakthrough. The new party, founded by President Nayib Bukele, Nuevas Ideas, won around two-thirds of votes with its allies (GANA-New Ideas). His party won supermajority 56 seats in the 84-seat parliament. Bukele became the country’s most powerful leader in three decades.

The territory of the current province had been inhabited by indigenous people for more than 12,000 years, since they migrated south of the mainland. It was first encountered by a European in 1520 when spotted by Ferdinand Magellan. Even after Argentina achieved independence, this territory remained under indigenous control until the nation&#x27;s campaign known as the Conquest of the Desert in the 1870s, after which Argentina organised this section in 1885 as a territory. European immigration followed due to a gold rush and rapid expansion of sheep farming on large ranches in the area. Tierra del Fuego is the most recent Argentine territory to gain provincial status, which occurred in 1990.

==Extent==


The effective extent of the province is the eastern part of the island of Tierra del Fuego, Isla de los Estados and adjacent islands.

The province nominally includes Argentina&#x27;s claims to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (which are British Overseas Territories) and to a segment of Antarctica that overlaps with the British and Chilean claims on that continent. Argentina has no effective control in these territories beyond its own Antarctic bases.

==History==

Tierra del Fuego was first settled by indigenous peoples around 12,000 years ago. First discovered by Europeans via Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s expedition in 1520, he named the area &quot;Land of Smokes&quot; (later changed to &quot;Land of Fire&quot;), likely referring to the smoke emitted by fires produced by the local Fuegian peoples for heating. When the first Europeans arrived, they encountered a population of about 10,000 indigenous people belonging to four tribes: Yámana, Alakaluf (now known by their autonym of Kawésqar), Selk&#x27;nam (Ona) and Manek&#x27;enk (Haush). European attempts at settling the island began in 1555 by Juan de Alderete and later Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa. Neither was successful, however, due to the region&#x27;s harsh weather and constant attacks by British pirates, who took Sarmiento de Gamboa prisoner.

Between the 16th and 19th centuries Spanish, Dutch, British and French explorers visited Tierra del Fuego and the nearby seas. Gabriel de Castilla passed through before exploring the Antarctic islands. In the early 1830s, Commander Robert FitzRoy, and Charles Darwin explored the island and other parts of Patagonia via . This included the Falkland Islands, claimed by the British since 1690, though controlled by Argentina since its establishment of a penal colony at &quot;Puerto Luis&quot; in 1828. In 1833 the British re-established their rule on the Falklands via the deployment of naval task force. The Argentinian representative of the islands, José María Pinedo, and Argentinian forces subsequently left the islands.

Luis Piedrabuena installed a base in &quot;San Juan de Salvamento&quot; on Isla de los Estados. The British South American Mission Society Patagonia Mission, under its superintendent Waite Stirling, founded Ushuaia as an Anglican mission in southern Tierra del Fuego in 1869. Shortly after, Salesian missionaries founded Río Grande. In the 1880s the Argentine government took a more active interest in Tierra del Fuego. In 1881, the meridian 68°36&#x27;38 W was defined as the boundary between the Chilean and the Argentine portions of the island. In 1884 the &quot;Government of Tierra del Fuego&quot; was created, and a subprefecture was established at Ushuaia. The southern part of the Beagle Channel was an issue of conflict between both states, which competed for control of three small islands, Picton, Lennox and Nueva. Finally in 1977, these were awarded to Chile by decision of the mediating British Crown, revised by Pope John Paul II and ratified by treaty in 1985.

When the crews of sailing-ships told of the notoriously dangerous voyage round the tip of South America, Tierra del Fuego became a byword in Europe for an inhospitable land, where life would be impossibly harsh for settlers. But, it is not the most sparsely populated province of Argentina. Its population density of 4.75/ km2 is higher than five other provinces, due to various waves of immigration.

Gold fever started in Tierra del Fuego around 1883. Many Croatians from the Dalmatian coast arrived in search of gold. In addition, the gold rush inspired new technologies and innovations, such as the telegraph. Although by 1910 the gold had run out, most of the pioneers stayed. The inauspicious-looking northern plains proved ideal sheep-farming country, and vast ranches were developed. Croatian, Scottish, Basque, Italian, Galician and Chilean immigrants arrived to work on the estancias, with the hope of eventually buying their own land and stock.

The Amerindians suffered high fatalities from diseases (including measles and smallpox) and the outright warfare waged by ranchers and bounty hunters; by 1916 their population on the island had dropped to only 900. In addition, in the late 19th century, ranchers and settlers committed genocide against the Selk&#x27;nam. News of the atrocities and genocide reached the Federal Congress in Buenos Aires. It sent aid and tried to help the Salesian mission, the only institution working in the island to protect the indigenous peoples.

With the creation of the &quot;Gobernación Marítima de Tierra del Fuego&quot; in 1943, construction of naval bases began in Ushuaia and Río Grande. An airport and other infrastructure were also built. These projects attracted immigrants from other countries as well as other parts of Argentina. In 1990 the &quot;National Territory of Tierra del Fuego, the Antarctic and the South Atlantic Islands&quot; was declared a province, with its first governor appointed two years later.

==Geography==


There are low mountains and sandy beaches at the north of the island, ascending to the south. The north is somewhat similar to the steppe of Santa Cruz Province. In the middle of the island, the end of the Andes mountain system becomes flattened, and its highest peak, Mount Cornú, rises only . There are a number of short rivers (the &quot;Grande&quot;, &quot;Moneta&quot;, &quot;Ona&quot;, &quot;Lasifashaj&quot;, etc.), and as a result of the low temperature there are many small glaciers that flow to the sea.

Due to its latitude, the island has a cold oceanic climate. The influences from the surrounding ocean and the predominant winds from the west result in the climate being uniform throughout the province. Mean annual temperatures are low, with winter temperatures averaging close to and summer temperatures averaging around . The strong westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean decrease the perception of the temperature (wind chill). In the extreme south in the Beagle Channel which is surrounded by hills rising above , winds can exceed . The island averages around of precipitation per year which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with a slight maximum in autumn. Snowfall is abundant throughout the island. Much of this island can be classified as within the Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Tierra del Fuego has 190,641 inhabitants. Per Argentine census data, the province&#x27;s population has grown substantially in recent decades, with an average annual growth rate of 3.3% between 2010 and 2022.

== Government ==

The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Tierra del Fuego Provincial Police.
==Administrative divisions==
The province is divided into five departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;), only the first three of which are under the effective control of Argentina:

# Ushuaia (seat Ushuaia)
# Tolhuin (seat Tolhuin)
# Río Grande (seat Río Grande)
# Islas del Atlántico Sur: consists of the Argentine claim to the Falkland Islands (&quot;Malvinas&quot; in Spanish) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, both of which are self-governing overseas territories of the United Kingdom.
# Antártida Argentina: the Argentine claim to Antarctica lies between 25°W and 74°W (overlapping both Chilean and British claims) and is uninhabited apart from the staff of scientific bases. Being south of 60°S, the Argentine claim to the entire department is suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.
==Economy==
Tierra del Fuego has since the 1970s benefited from government subsidies to local industry and from its natural wealth. Its estimated 2006 output of US$2.6 billion gave the province a &quot;per capita&quot; income of US$25,719, the second highest in Argentina, behind Buenos Aires.

Manufacturing, despite the province&#x27;s remoteness, contributes about 20% to output owing partly to generous certain tax incentives to local industry, a policy Buenos Aires has pursued to encourage immigration to less populated areas. A number of sizable factories have opened on Tierra del Fuego Island to take advantage of the tax benefits legislated in 1972, mainly home appliance and electronics manufacturers.

Recently, in the city of Río Grande, many international and Argentine companies, most notably the Korean company Samsung and the Argentine company Teltron, have set up factories that produce high-definition televisions (HDTV), CD-ROM-related articles, and low-cost GSM cell phones, built mainly from Argentine components.


Sheep ranching is the leading source of the province&#x27;s modest agricultural income (5% of output). It provides wool, mutton and hides throughout the province and the wider Argentine market, whose taste for these products has been growing strongly.

As in Patagonia to the north, petroleum and natural gas extraction are important to Tierra del Fuego&#x27;s economy, generating over 20% of total output. Exploration efforts continue. The government of the Falkland Islands has issued exploration licenses within its waters. This competition has caused anger in Argentina. The activity has also intruded into some of the area&#x27;s lucrative crab and shrimp fishing industry.

Tourism is gaining importance on Tierra del Fuego island. The region offers mountains, glaciers, forests, fast rivers, waterfalls, ski centres (the most important is Cerro Castor), and the sea, all within short distances.

The most visited destinations in Argentine Tierra del Fuego include Ushuaia, the Tierra del Fuego National Park and the &quot;Tren del Fin del Mundo&quot;, Fagnano Lake, the &quot;Museum of the End of the World&quot;, the Beagle Channel, the &quot;Les Eclaireurs&quot; lighthouse, the old jail, and South Staten Island.

The Antarctic Peninsula is a tourist destination. Tourists can see wildlife at the Argentine Marambio Base during the summer.

<text>Alexander Forrest CMG (22 September 1849 – 20 June 1901) was an explorer and surveyor of Western Australia, and later also a member of parliament.

As a government surveyor, Forrest explored many areas of remote Western Australia, particularly the Kimberley region. Several of his expeditions were conducted alongside his brother, John Forrest, who became the first Premier of Western Australia. In later life, Forrest served in the unicameral Legislative Council from 1887 to 1890, representing the seat of Kimberley. Following the advent of responsible government, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly, representing the seat of West Kimberley from 1890 until his death. He was also mayor of Perth on two occasions, from 1892 to 1895 and from 1897 to 1900.

==Early life==
Forrest was born at Picton, near Bunbury in Western Australia, the fourth of nine sons of William and Margaret Forrest. He was educated at the government school in Bunbury under John Hislop, then completed his education at Hale School in Perth.

==Exploring career==
Forrest explored areas of Western Australia under contract to the Survey Department, particularly the Kimberley region, during the 1870s and 1880s. 
Much of his exploration was done with his brother John Forrest who became the first Premier of Western Australia.

In 1870, a party of six men including Alexander and his brother John left Perth. Five months later they reached Adelaide. In 1874, Alexander was part of another party again including brother John which took a more northerly route from Geraldton to the east to the Murchison River.

In 1879, Alexander led his own expedition of eight men from De Grey River to the telegraph line into the area now known as the Kimberley. The expedition left on 25 February 1879 and reached Beagle Bay on 10 April 1879. The coast was then skirted to the Fitzroy River which was followed for 240 miles (390 km); but Forrest&#x27;s progress was then stopped by mountains which appeared to be impassable. He eventually worked round the southern end of the range and discovered some valuable country. Good water was found until the Victoria River was reached on 18 August 1879, but great difficulties were met with before reaching the telegraph line 13 days later. From there they made their way to Palmerston, then the capital of the Northern Territory, and they arrived on 7 October 1879. The party was often in danger of starvation, on more than one occasion a packhorse had to be killed for food, and in the last dash for the telegraph line, Forrest and one companion who had gone on ahead almost perished from thirst. The two Aboriginal assistants were quite helpless for the last 300 miles (480 km) of the journey, and one of them never recovered from its effects, dying a few months later. The expedition ranks among the most valuable pieces of Australian exploration as large tracts of good pasturage were discovered. Forrest published his &quot;Journal of Expedition from De Grey to Port Darwin&quot; in Perth in 1880.

In 1891, through a syndicate comprising Charles Crossland and George Leake, Alexander Forrest commenced the subdivision of what would later become the affluent Perth suburb of Peppermint Grove. He was also associated with the first of three quarries that exist on the edge of Greenmount Hill. In 1893, he negotiated the contract with the Adelaide Steamship Company for serving Western Australian ports.
==Political career==
In 1887, Forrest became a politician, entering the Western Australian Legislative Council as the first (and only) member for the seat of Kimberley. He was then elected to the Legislative Assembly for West Kimberley in 1890, and held the seat until his death. He was also Mayor of Perth 1893–95 and 1898–1900, and later an investor. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 15 May 1901, in preparation of the forthcoming royal visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary).

Forrest died on 20 June 1901 at Perth of complications arising from kidney trouble. He was survived by four of his five children (his son Anthony Alexander Forrest having been killed the month before in the Second Boer War), and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

<doc id="409233" wikidata="Q2641444" url="?curid=409233" title="Great Horwood">
<text>Great Horwood is a small village and is also a civil parish within the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England with a population of about 1025 people (2001 Census). It is about five miles ESE of Buckingham, six miles WSW of Milton Keynes.

== History and locale ==
The village name &#x27;Horwood&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;muddy wood&#x27;. The affix &#x27;Great&#x27; was added later to differentiate it from the adjacent village Little Horwood. In the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 792 the village was recorded as &quot;Horwudu&quot;.

The village was from ancient times on the periphery of the Whaddon Chase: royal hunting land that stretched across the north part of the Aylesbury Vale. In 1447 the village was granted Royal charter to hold a weekly market, thus becoming a market town. The rents from the market were collected by New College, Oxford. Great Horwood is no longer a market town. In 1996, the lordship of the manor of Great Horwood was sold by New College to D. Jackson &quot;Jack&quot; Smith, an American lawyer and former member of the Tennessee House of Representatives.

A hamlet within the parish border of Great Horwood is Singleborough.

== Notable buildings ==
Both Great Horwood village itself and Singleborough have Conservation Areas and there are 46 Grade II listed buildings in the Parish. Great Horwood has two historic pubs: The Crown is situated on the village green and The Swan Inn on Winslow Road. As of January 2019 both pubs are no longer open to the public.

The parish church is dedicated to St James.

The village is also home to Great Horwood Church of England Combined School, which is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary controlled school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 160 pupils. Its catchment area also includes the villages of Thornborough, Nash, Beachampton and Whaddon.

<text>The Pasadena Bowl, known as the Junior Rose Bowl or Little Rose Bowl from 1946 to 1966 and again in 1976 and 1977, was a college football bowl game. 

Between 1946 and 1966 and again in 1976 and 1977, the game pitted the California Junior College football champions against National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) football teams (not always the champion). It was organized by the Pasadena Junior Chamber of Commerce. 

The Junior Rose Bowl became the Pasadena Bowl from 1967 to 1971. It was billed as the Junior Rose Bowl the first two years, but now featured teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s College and University Divisions. The bowl featured the champion of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA) from 1969 to 1970 and the champion of the Missouri Valley Conference in 1970 and 1971.

<text>Heather Ann Wilson (born December 30, 1960) is the 11th President of the University of Texas at El Paso. She previously served as the 24th Secretary of the United States Air Force from 2017 through 2019, as the 12th president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology from 2013 to 2017, and as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives for from 1998 to 2009. Wilson was the first female military veteran elected to a full term in Congress.

While in the U.S. House of Representatives, Wilson served on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce. She did not run for re-election in 2008, instead seeking the U.S. Senate seat of retiring senator Pete Domenici; she finished second in the Republican primary to Congressman Steve Pearce. On March 7, 2011, she announced another run for Senate in 2012 to replace retiring senator Jeff Bingaman, but lost the general election to Democrat Martin Heinrich, her successor in the House of Representatives.

In April 2013 she was selected was president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, making her the first female president of the school. President Donald Trump announced on January 23, 2017, that he would nominate Wilson as Secretary of the Air Force. The U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination on May 8, 2017. On March 8, 2019, Wilson announced that she would resign as Secretary, effective May 31, in order to assume the office of President of the University of Texas at El Paso. On March 2, 2020, Trump appointed Wilson to the National Science Board.

== Early life and education ==
Wilson was born on December 30, 1960, in Keene, New Hampshire, the daughter of Martha Lou, nurse, and George Douglas Wilson, a commercial pilot and member of the Experimental Aircraft Association. Wilson grew up around aviation and hoped to become a pilot like her father and grandfather before her. Her paternal grandparents were born in Scotland. Her grandfather, George Gordon &quot;Scotty&quot; Wilson, flew for the Royal Air Force in World War I and emigrated to America in 1922 where he was a barnstormer and airport operator in the 1920s and 1930s. He served as a courier pilot during World War II and started the New Hampshire Civil Air Patrol where he was a Wing Commander. Her father started flying at age 13 and enlisted in the United States Air Force after high school.

The United States Air Force Academy began admitting women during Wilson&#x27;s junior year at Keene High School (Keene, New Hampshire). She applied and was appointed to the Academy. At the Academy, she was the first woman to command basic training and the first woman Vice Wing Commander. She graduated in 1982 as a Distinguished Graduate (&quot;magna cum laude&quot; equivalent). Wilson earned a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford and continued her education at Jesus College, earning an M.Phil. and D.Phil. in international relations by 1985.

In 1990, Oxford University Press published her book, &quot;International Law and the Use of Force by National Liberation Movements&quot;, which won the 1988 Paul Reuter Prize of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Paul Reuter Prize is awarded for a major work in the sphere of international humanitarian law. Wilson won the second Reuter prize ever awarded.

An Air Force officer for seven years, Wilson was a negotiator and political adviser to the U.S. Air Force in the United Kingdom, and a defense planning officer for NATO in Belgium, where her work included arms control negotiations.

== Career ==

=== National Security Council ===
Wilson served in the United States Air Force until 1989 when she was chosen to serve as director for European Defense Policy and Arms Control on the National Security Council staff. She worked for Republican president George H. W. Bush. Her principal responsibilities included guiding the U.S. position on the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) negotiations and NATO affairs during the period of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.

=== Keystone International ===
After leaving government in 1991, Wilson founded Keystone International, Inc. in Albuquerque, New Mexico to promote business development in the United States and Russia.

=== Governor Johnson administration ===
In 1995, Governor Gary Johnson appointed Wilson to be Cabinet Secretary of the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department. During her tenure, Wilson made efforts to reform child welfare laws, modernize the juvenile justice system, and improve early childhood education. The department opened a juvenile work camp and a secure facility for young, non-violent offenders, as well as streamlining the foster care system. She also was an architect and the chief lobbyist for the governor&#x27;s education agenda, including a law allowing charter schools, annual testing, and more budget authority for local school boards.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
;1998 special election
Five-term Republican Congressman Steven Schiff declared he would not run for re-election in February 1998 because of his battle with squamous cell carcinoma. Wilson resigned her cabinet post to enter the Republican primary. She won the support of Schiff and U.S. Senator Pete Domenici. Domenici called Wilson &quot;the most brilliantly qualified House candidate anywhere in the country.&quot; After Congressman Schiff&#x27;s death in March, a special election on June 23 was announced. Wilson won the Republican primary for the general election with 62 percent of the vote.

Three weeks after winning the primary, Wilson won the special election with 44 percent of the vote in a four-way race against Democratic state senator Phil Maloof, Green Party candidate Robert L. Anderson, and Libertarian Party candidation Bruce Bush. She was sworn into office on June 25, 1998, making her the first woman since Georgia Lusk in 1946, and the first Republican woman ever, to represent New Mexico.

The special election set a record for the infusion of party money. For the June 23 special election, Maloof spent $3.1 million, approximately $1.5 million of which came from the Maloof family fortune and $1 million from committees. Wilson received $1 million from various GOP committees and raised an additional $1.5 million herself.

In the special election, it was discovered that Wilson in her Cabinet role had removed sensitive department files relating to her husband from the agency&#x27;s central database and later lied about doing so. After completing an investigation, former district attorney Bob Schwartz determined that Wilson had not broken the law.

;1998 general election
Less than five months later in the general election, Wilson faced Phil Maloof again. This time, she won a full term, defeating Maloof 48 percent to 41 percent. Maloof far outspent Wilson again, spending an additional $5 million to Wilson&#x27;s $1.1 million, making it, at that time, the most expensive House race in New Mexico&#x27;s history.

;2000
Wilson defeated her Democratic opponent, former U.S. Attorney John J. Kelly, by five points.

;2002
Wilson defeated State Senate President Pro Tem Richard M. Romero by 10 points.

;2004
In 2004, Wilson faced Romero again. Outside spending on the election was the 15th highest of all House races that year, totaling $2,499,980. The National Republican Congressional Committee spent $1,085,956 in the race. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $1,296,402.

Wilson and 66 other candidates received $10,000 donations from then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay&#x27;s Americans for a Republican Majority (ARMPAC) political action committee. ARMPAC filed termination papers with the Federal Election Commission on April 24, 2007. Wilson returned the $10,000 donation from ARMPAC.

During Wilson&#x27;s reelection campaign in 2004, Romero ran advertisements criticizing Wilson&#x27;s vote in Congress against a bill to require the screening of cargo holds, suggesting that they had aided Osama bin Laden. Wilson&#x27;s campaign countered with a policy ad stating Romero &quot;voted against the death penalty for child molesters who murder their victims.&quot;

Wilson won the election by eight points.

;2006
In the 2006 elections, Heather Wilson faced New Mexico Attorney General Patricia A. Madrid, and a poll taken from October 24–29 prior to the election by Reuters/Zogby showed Madrid leading Wilson 53–44. Wilson won the election by 875 (out of 211,000) votes, or 0.4%

=== Tenure ===
Wilson was the first woman to represent New Mexico since Georgia Lusk in the 1940s. She served as a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a coalition of centrist Republican leaders. Wilson has appeared on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;.

On October 10, 2002, together with 213 other Republicans and 81 Democrats, Wilson voted in favor of authorizing the use of military force against Iraq.

The &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; reported several instances in 2004 when Wilson acted in opposition to Republican interests: requiring the Bush administration to release cost figures for his prescription drug plan, criticizing Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about the failure to properly respond to violations of the Geneva Conventions during an Abu Ghraib hearing, and opposing a move by House Republicans to protect Tom DeLay from his fundraising scandal. While critics said these were calculated moves to moderate her image for her upcoming election, Wilson later lost her seat on the House Armed Services Committee due to the actions of Republican Joe Barton, an ally of DeLay.

;Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 Motion to Recommit
In 2003, Wilson joined 221 Republicans and 1 Democrat in voting against a Motion to Recommit the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (HR 1). The motion would have deleted entire sections of the joint House and Senate compromise bill and replaced them with the respective Senate version.

;Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act

On January 21, 2004, legislation was introduced by Congressman Fred Upton to increase the fines and penalties for violating the prohibitions against the broadcast of obscene, indecent, or profane language. On February 11, 2004, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet held a hearing on the bill, at which representatives of the Federal Communications Commission, major broadcasting corporations, and the National Football League testified. During the hearing, Wilson denounced executive Mel Karmazin saying, &quot;You knew what you were doing. You knew what kind of entertainment you&#x27;re selling, and you wanted us all to be abuzz, here in this room and on the playground in my kids&#x27; school, because it improves your ratings. It improves your market share, and it lines your pockets.&quot; The bill, H.R. 3717, passed the House of Representatives on March 26, 2004, by a vote of 391–22–1.

;NSA warrantless domestic surveillance
On February 7, 2006, Wilson, while serving as Chairwoman of the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, called for a full congressional inquiry into the NSA warrantless surveillance. Eric Lichtblau of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;the congresswoman&#x27;s discomfort with the operation appears to reflect deepening fissures among Republicans over the program&#x27;s legal basis and political liabilities.&quot; In an interview for the article, Wilson said, &quot;The president has his duty to do, but I have mine too, and I feel strongly about that.&quot;

;Terminated U.S. attorney

Wilson was accused of and later cleared of influencing the termination of a U.S. Attorney. In February 2007, former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias alleged that Wilson&#x27;s competitive 2006 campaign for re-election to the House was a significant reason for his dismissal from the Justice Department. In a March 2007 statement, Wilson said an October call to Iglesias was to resolve an allegation of ethical impropriety made against Iglesias, which Iglesias denied. Iglesias never reported the contact, as he was required to do by DOJ rules. In July 2007, the United States House Committee on Ethics decided not to proceed with any investigation of Wilson. The Justice Department also did a review and the matter was thereafter closed.

;Environmental record
Wilson was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, the chairs of which introduced legislation to make the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a cabinet department.

Wilson, along with 80 Democrats and 215 other Republicans, supported House passage of the conference report on the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, which opponents argued would &quot;reduce and expedite environmental and judicial reviews of forest thinning projects.

Wilson, 36 Democrats, and 192 other Republicans supported House passage of the Threatened and Endangered Species Recovery Act of 2005, which would have amended and reauthorized the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to provide greater results conserving and recovering listed species, and for other purposes.

The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, the political advocacy group&#x27;s Political Action Committee (PAC), named Wilson to its 2006 &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; list of members of Congress targeted for defeat by the LCV in the 2006 elections. The LCVAF also issued a press release in which Wilson was criticized for voting against a $58 million fund for voluntary conservation measures in the state.

== Business career ==
Wilson was the head of the consulting firm, Heather Wilson &amp; Company after leaving Congress.

The report criticized the labs for maintaining unsatisfactory documentation on the work performed. The labs disagreed with the report.

Sandia Corp., one of the laboratories, reimbursed the federal government for the fees paid to Heather Wilson &amp; Company. There was a settlement agreement with the Justice Department, and Wilson was not mentioned in that agreement. In addition, Wilson stated that she &quot;was not a lobbyist for Sandia and [she] was not a member of the Contract Strategy Team criticized by the Inspector General&#x27;s report.&quot;

<doc id="409242" wikidata="Q202351" url="?curid=409242" title="Giurgiu">
<text>Giurgiu (; ) is a city in southern Romania. The seat of Giurgiu County, it lies in the historical region of Muntenia. It is situated amongst mud-flats and marshes on the left bank of the Danube facing the Bulgarian city of Ruse on the opposite bank. It is one of six Romanian county seats lying on the Danube river. Three small islands face the city, and a larger one shelters its port, Smarda. The rich grain-growing land to the north is traversed by a railway to Bucharest, the first line opened in Romania, which was built in 1869 and afterwards extended to Smarda. In the past, Giurgiu exported timber, grain, salt and petroleum, and imported coal, iron, and textiles.

The Giurgiu-Ruse Friendship Bridge, in the shared Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river in the outskirts of the city.

==History==

The area around Giurgiu was densely populated at the time of the Dacians (1st century BC) as archeological evidence shows, and Burebista&#x27;s capital was in this area (it is thought to be in Popești on the Argeș River). During Roman times this was the site of Theodorapolis, a city built by the Roman emperor Justinian (483–565).

The city of Giurgiu was probably established in the 14th century as a port on the Danube by the Genoese merchant adventurers, who established a bank and traded in silks and velvets.

One theory is that they called the city after the patron saint of Genoa, San Giorgio (Saint George), however Nicolae Iorga disputes this theory, arguing that Giurgiu is just an old Romanian form of George.

It was first mentioned in Codex Latinus Parisinus in 1395, during the reign of Mircea the Elder, and was conquered by the Ottomans in 1420 as a way to control the Danube traffic. The Ottomans named the city &quot;Yergöğü&quot;, as if from &quot;yer&quot; &#x27;earth&#x27; + &quot;gök&quot; &#x27;sky,&#x27; but the name was probably given because of the similarity between the pronunciations of &quot;(San) Giorgio&quot; and &quot;Yergöğü&quot;.

As a fortified city, Giurgiu figured often in the wars for the conquest of the lower Danube. It was the site of the October 1595 Battle of Giurgiu, and figured in the struggle of Michael the Brave (1593–1601) against the Turks and in the later Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). It was burned in 1659. In 1771, the Ottomans built the historic Giurgiu Clocktower as a surveillance tower for Danube traffic. In 1829, its fortifications were finally razed, the only defence left being a castle on the island of Slobozia, connected to the shore by a bridge.

In 1952–1954, during the Communist regime, the Soviet Union helped build the bridge between Giurgiu and Ruse, The Friendship Bridge, a bridge on the Danube linking Romania and Bulgaria.

===Jewish history===
Sephardi Jewish merchants came to Giurgiu from the Balkans in the 1820s and Ashkenazi Jews settled later, leading to communal disputes. A 70-member Zionist group was formed in 1899. A joint Jewish school opened in 1878, with 60 pupils in 1910. The Jewish population by that point was 533, or 4% of the total. By 1930, their number had fallen to 207, or 0.7%. Jews were forced to forfeit their property to the Iron Guard in 1941 and at least half of the 113 Jews living there that year left. A community existed after World War II.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, Giurgiu has a population of 54,551.

<text>Great Kingshill is a small village in the parish of Hughenden in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills, about five miles west of Amersham and two and a half miles south of Great Missenden.

==Village==
The village name &#x27;Kingshill&#x27; is fairly self-explanatory, meaning a hill in possession of the king. Local folklore suggests it was King John who provided the name; there is certainly evidence of King John granting the manor at Kingshill to Hugh de Gournay in 1213, although this same document states that the land was previously possessed by Geoffrey fitzPeter. The affix &#x27;Great&#x27; was added later to differentiate between Great Kingshill and neighbouring Little Kingshill. There is some evidence of a settlement called &quot;Pirenore&quot; that was granted to Missenden Abbey in 1275. The settlement was discovered in Brand&#x27;s Fee in Great Kingshill, and evidence suggests it was settled between the 11th and 16th centuries. It is possible that the settlement was wiped out by bubonic plague.

Great Kingshill has a small local common, forming the heart of the village. It contains a younger children&#x27;s playground, an older children&#x27;s playground, football goals and a cricket area which is use by the Great Kingshill Cricket Club in the summer. There are also small festivals held here on evenings during the summer.

The village has its own primary school. Many of the village children attend Great Kingshill school, as do children from a wide surrounding area. The school&#x27;s most recent Ofsted report judged the school to be &quot;Good&quot; overall and &quot;Outstanding&quot; in some areas. Great Kingshill school is geographically located in the neighbouring hamlet of Cryers Hill. Great Kingshill is also home to Pipers Corner School, an all girl private school.

According to the 2001 census by the Hughenden Parish Council (a parish of the Wycombe District Council), Great Kingshill had a population of 1,170 in an area of 35 hectares.

<text>Little Kingshill is a small Chilterns village in the parish of Little Missenden in Buckinghamshire, England, with the closest amenities being in its post town of Great Missenden. It is approximately five miles west of Amersham, about four and a half miles north west of High Wycombe and just under two miles south of Great Missenden, with its fast train to London Marylebone.

The hamlet name &#x27;Kingshill&#x27; means a hill in possession of the king, which local folklore suggests was King John; there is certainly evidence of King John granting the manor at Kingshill to Hugh de Gournay in 1213, although this same document states that the land was previously possessed by Geoffrey fitzPeter. The affix &#x27;Little&#x27; was added later to differentiate between the hamlet and neighbouring village Great Kingshill, although the two are in separate parishes and, indeed, separate districts, with Little Kingshill, in effect, an extension of Great Missenden.

Little Kingshill has one pub: The Full Moon in Hare Lane. The main road, Windsor Lane, is home to the playing fields, the playground, the Baptist church, which is home to a coffee shop, and the village school. This Chiltern village is surrounded by Metropolitan Green Belt countryside.

Little Kingshill has its own primary school with a nursery, catering for children from 3–11 years. It is controlled by Buckinghamshire County Council.

== Political camps based on foreign policy orientation==
Civilizational and geostrategic orientations play a significant role in Georgian politics. They often determine political groupings and are more important than economic or socio-political agendas for the parties. Main civilizational and geostrategic debate in Georgia revolves around siding with the West or Russia. Based on their foreign policy orientations, Georgian political parties can be divided into several camps:

* This group of parties supports Euro-Atlanticism and opposes any rapprochement towards Russia. They claim that the West is &quot;civilizational choice&quot; of Georgian people and that Georgia should join the EU and NATO. They view Russia as the biggest, imperialistic threat to Georgia and argue that the only way for Georgia to survive is to join EU and NATO, in other case, they claim that Georgia will be annexed by Russia. They consider that no negotiation with Russia is possible as Russia is imperialistic and its only goal is to subjugate former Soviet Union. Therefore, because of this, they argue that any political position which does not supports uncompromising pro-Western and anti-Russian policy, benefits Russia and is therefore pro-Russian. This group of parties considers all their opponents on foreign policy matters to be pro-Russian, whether they actually support Russia or not.

This group includes following parties: United National Movement, For Georgia, Progress and Freedom, Strategy Aghmashenebeli, Lelo for Georgia, European Georgia, Girchi – More Freedom, Droa, Law and Justice, Republican Party, Citizens, State for the People, National Democratic Party, For the People, Victorious Georgia

*This group of parties also shares the view that Russia is the greatest threat to Georgia and considers joining EU and NATO as foreign policy priorities. They also claim that the alignment with the West is civilizational choice of Georgian people. However, they argue that the reality of Russia being the large and powerful neighbor of Georgia can not be ignored and Georgia&#x27;s foreign policy should be shaped based on this reality. Georgia, as other small states, must play sophisticated games with its large and powerful neighbor to survive in such environment. They often appeal to national interests, claiming that maintaining some ties with Russia, such as economic relations, is beneficial to Georgia because of Russia&#x27;s proximity and economic resources. Therefore, domestic and foreign policies of Georgia in these areas should be shaped by interests rather than ideological notions. They say that Georgia&#x27;s policy towards Russia should be pragmatic, flexible and cautious. They usually condemn Russia politically, but have relatively soft rhetoric compared to first group of parties – they claim that too radical and uncompromising policy towards Russia can lead to confrontation with Russia, which will have dire consequences for Georgia. These parties oppose imposing visa regime for Russian citizens, ban on Russian tourists visiting Georgia, banning capital flow from Russia etc. – claiming that such actions don&#x27;t reflect Georgian interests and will harm Georgian economy and Georgian citizens. These parties fully support Georgia&#x27;s membership into EU and NATO, but maybe sometimes critical of these organizations when they feel that certain policies contradict Georgia&#x27;s interests.

This group includes following parties: Georgian Dream, People&#x27;s Power, Girchi, European Socialists, Social Democrats for the Development of Georgia, Greens Party, Democratic Movement – United Georgia,

*This group of parties, on the other hand, although does not necessarily opposes Georgia&#x27;s membership in the EU, argues that Georgia should reorient its foreign policy towards building friendly relations with Russia. They claim that the only way Georgia can restore its sovereignty over Abkhazia and South Ossetia is to normalize its relations with Russia. They oppose Georgia&#x27;s proposed membership in the NATO, saying that it provokes Russia to engage into hostilities with Georgia. This group thinks that successful negotiation with Russia is possible, and often blames the Saakashvili administration for pursuing pro-NATO foreign policy which led to the strained relations with Moscow. They claim that Georgia should be &quot;neutral country&quot;, which they think reflects Georgian interests better than pro-NATO foreign orientation. Although this group does not vehemently opposes Georgia&#x27;s membership in the EU, they do not view it possible in the foreseeable future and oppose certain (mostly liberal) EU policies, which they claim are incompatible with Georgian culture and traditions.

This group includes following parties: Alliance of Patriots, Georgian Troupe, Christian-Democrats, Left-wing alliance, Georgian March, Political Movement of Veterans and Patriots, Industry Will Save Georgia

*This group of parties supports full alignment with Russia and views the West as a primary threat to the country. They support joining Eurasian Economic Union and Collective Security Treaty Organization and claim that allying with Christian Russia is a civilization choice of Georgian people. They support Russian military presence in Georgia and view the West, which they equate with the liberal ideology, which is anti-Christian, pro-LGBT, pro-immigration and cosmopolitan, as the greatest threat to Georgian culture and national identity. They also are skeptical towards Western involvement in Georgia, claiming that the West uses Georgia only for its own purposes to &quot;encircle&quot; Russia and weaken it by provoking its neighbors to wage war with it. 

This group includes following parties: Conservative Movement/Alt-Info, Georgian Idea, Unity of Iberians

<doc id="409249" wikidata="Q2885492" url="?curid=409249" title="Seattle Bowl">
<text>The Seattle Bowl was a college football bowl game played in 2001 and 2002 between teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference in Seattle. This bowl game was a continuation of the Oahu Bowl which had moved to Seattle. The 2001 game was played at Safeco Field and the 2002 game was played at Seahawks Stadium. The game was discontinued in 2003 when financing could not be secured.

== Bowl history ==
Although December in Seattle is traditionally home to an average temperature of 41° and 2/3 of the days have rain, Oahu Bowl officials sought to move their game to the west coast mainland after the 2000 season. Hawai&#x27;i had already hosted the long-standing Aloha Bowl (which also lost its certification after the 2000 season after an aborted attempt to move the bowl to San Francisco) and bowl officials felt that a game with a west coast tie-in could work in the football-friendly city of Seattle. The committee and city also had hoped that the game would add tourist dollars to what is normally the slowest tourism week of the year. The game would match the fifth place teams from the ACC and Pac-10 at Safeco Field.

In 2001 the game was able to secure sponsorship from Jeep and matched the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets of the ACC against the then 11th ranked nationally Stanford University Cardinal. The Yellow Jackets pulled off the upset win by a score of 24–14 in front of 30,144 fans.

The 2002 game would almost not happen at all. The Seattle Bowl beat an NCAA mandated deadline for a letter of credit for $1.5 million by less than one hour to insure a second game. The game was moved to its intended home at Seahawks Stadium and would match Oregon against Wake Forest. Wake Forest would win the game by a score of 38–17. The attendance of the game would improve to 38,241, helped by the nearby Oregon Ducks bringing a large contingent of fans. However, the game had increased its payout to $1 million per team and was unable to attract a title sponsor resulting in heavy losses.

After the 2002 game&#x27;s financial losses it was clear that a 2003 game would be a longshot. Bowl president Terry Daw relinquished ownership of the game and the bowl would miss two deadlines imposed by the NCAA to provide a $1.5 million letter of credit. Further in April, 2003 it was reported that the bowl game was being sued by the Mountain West Conference and the company who purchased the bowl game from Daw, known as Pro Sports &amp; Entertainment Inc., was discovered to not have had a valid business since 2001. The Mountain West had originally contracted to send its Number 4 team to the bowl in 2002 and pledged $250,000 to the bowl to secure its spot. The Conference did not produce a 4th bowl eligible team for the season and as such Oregon was picked as a replacement. The lawsuit claims that the $250,000 was never returned to the Conference as per the terms of the contract.

After Pro Sports &amp; Entertainment was unable to secure a primary sponsor for the game, the bowl was not renewed by the NCAA for the 2003 bowl season.

<text>This article lists [[political party|political parties]] in [[Ghana]].

Ghana has a multi-party system. However, there are two dominant political parties: the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party. It is extremely difficult for anyone to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.

==Regulation==
Political parties in Ghana are regulated under the Political Parties Act 574 passed in 2000. This spells out how political parties may be founded, registered and operated. It also specifies how political parties may be funded in Ghana.

==The parties in Ghana==
===Fourth Republic (1992-present)===
As at January 2025, there are 15 political parties according to the Electoral Commission of Ghana. Of these, a total of 11 parties indicated their willingness to participate in the political programmes by the state broadcaster, Ghana Broadcasting Corporation leading up to the 2020 Ghanaian general election. In 2018, there were 24 political parties listed on the website. There were 30 registered political parties on the list of the Electoral Commission of Ghana during the Fourth Republic in 2012.

====Parliamentary parties====
====Other active parties====
The following parties were on the list of parties of the Electoral Commission of Ghana but not represented in parliament.

During the Third Republic, the following list of parties contested the 1979 general election. The All People&#x27;s Party was a merger of the opposition parties in parliament formed later. All parties in the Third Republic were banned following the military coup d&#x27;etat on 31 December 1981. There would be continuous military rule until after the 1992 general election.

===Second Republic (1969-1972)===
The Second Republic spanned the period from October 1969 to 13 January 1972. This was the period when the Progress Party came to power with Kofi Busia as Prime Minister and Akufo-Addo as ceremonial President. It ended with the military coup d&#x27;état which brought the National Redemption Council military government into power. All political parties were banned.

===Independent State within the Commonwealth (1957-1960)/First Republic (1960-1966)===

===Pre-Independence===
Ghanaian natives were allowed to stand for elections into the Legislative Assembly. There were elections held in 1951, 1954 and 1956 prior to the United Kingdom granting Ghana independence.

<doc id="409251" wikidata="Q187945" url="?curid=409251" title="Piatra Neamț">
<text>Piatra Neamț (; ; ) is the capital city of Neamț County, in the historical region of Western Moldavia, in northeastern Romania. Because of its very privileged location in the Eastern Carpathian mountains, it is considered one of the most picturesque cities in Romania. The Nord-Est Regional Development Agency is located in Piatra Neamț.

==Etymology==
The toponym &quot;piatra&quot; (meaning ‘rock’) was always part of the settlement&#x27;s name throughout its history. It is also called Piatra lui (‘Christmas Rock’, thus also corresponding to the Hungarian name of the city, &quot;-&quot;). It is also simply called Piatra, to which the county name &quot;Neamț&quot; (meaning ‘German’) was added.

== Geography and access ==
Piatra Neamț lies in the Bistrița River valley, surrounded by mountains — Pietricica (530 m), Cozla (679 m), Cernegura (852 m), Bâtca Doamnei (462 m) and Cârloman (617 m) — at an average height of . The river Doamna is a right tributary of the Bistrița; it flows into the Bâtca Doamnei Reservoir near Piatra Neamț.

The city is located north of Bucharest, in the historical region of Moldavia. The nearest airport is Bacău, situated south. Piatra Neamț is linked by Romanian railways trunk number 509 to Bacău (and from there by Line 500 to Bucharest), and by national road to Bacău (and from there by DN2 to Bucharest), Iași, Suceava, and Târgu Mureș in the Transylvania region.

The city is informally divided in several districts (in Romanian: &quot;cartiere&quot;):
* 1 Mai
* Băcioaia
* Centru
* Ciritei
* Dărmănești
* Doamna
* Gara Veche
* Mărăței
* Precista
* Sarata
* Speranța
* Valea Viei
* Văleni
* Vânători

Of these, Ciritei, Doamna, and Văleni are formally separate villages administered by the municipality. There are plans to build two new districts, the larger of which will be on the site of the former &quot;Reconstrucția&quot; factory.

==History==

The area around Piatra Neamț is one of the oldest inhabited areas in Romania. The oldest traces of human civilisation in the present territory date back to the higher Paleolithic, about 100,000 years BCE. The Cucuteni culture, whose development lasted approximately one thousand years ( 3600–2600 BCE) was attested in the territory of Neamţ county by a remarkable number of settlements (approx. 150), archaeological diggings unearthing important museum collections of Aeneolithic artifacts. Archaeologists have also discovered objects here dating back to the Neolithic Period and the Bronze Age (about 1900–1700 BCE).

Excavations just outside the city revealed the ruins of a large Dacian city, Petrodava, mentioned by Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. The whole compound had its heyday between the first century BCE and the first century CE. Standing out is the citadel at Bâtca Doamnei which contains shrines resembling those identified in the Orăștie Mountains. As far as the existence of a local leader is concerned, historians tend to suggest the identification of the Kingdom of Dicomes in the very political centre at Petrodava. The complex of strongholds without peer in Moldavia and Wallachia is evidence as to a powerful political and military centre both in Burebista’s time and in the period that preceded the reign of Decebalus. The settlement was documented in the 15th century as Piatra lui Crăciun, or Camena, a market town.

The first urban settlements, which emerged under Petru I Mușat (1375–1391), were Piatra lui Crăciun, Roman, and Neamț. The Neamț citadel, whose documentary attestation dates back to 2 February 1395, was also erected during the same consolidation period of the Moldavian principality east of the Carpathians. The Princely Court of Piatra Neamț is mentioned for the first time in a document dated 20 April 1491, to have been founded between 1468 and 1475, under Stephen the Great, the Princely Cathedral being built in 1497–1498, and the tall Bell Tower in 1499.

In 2020, ten people were killed in a hospital fire.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census data, Piatra Neamț has a population of 85,055, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 24th largest city in Romania. The 2002 census recorded 104,914 people living within the city of Piatra Neamț. The ethnic makeup was as follows:

* Romanians: 98.08%
* Roma: 1.3%
* Lipovans: 0.16%
* Hungarians: 0.14%
* Other: 0.32%

==Economy==
The city&#x27;s industries include a fertilizer plant, a pulp and paper mill, and several food-processing plants. In the city are also located an agricultural machinery plant (&quot;Mecanica Ceahlău&quot;), a pharmaceutical plant (&quot;Plantavorel&quot;) and two paper manufacturers.

The city&#x27;s main industrial park is situated south, in the Săvinești area. During the communist period, the &quot;Săvinești platform&quot; was one of the most important chemical plants in Romania and the site of a research institute. Today, the industrial facility is part of the Italian company Radici Group, and it operates at low capacity.

In recent times, the most important Romanian commercial brands originating from Piatra Neamț are &quot;Rifil&quot; (synthetic fibers manufacturer), &quot;Altex&quot; (&quot;Media Galaxy&quot;) (TV, hi-fi, home appliances national dealer), (paints manufacturer), &quot;Amicii-Kubo Ice Cream&quot; (ice cream producer) and &quot;Dasimpex&quot; (mobile phones dealer).

There are 4 local TV stations (TV M, 1TV, TeleM, Actual TV), 3 FM radio stations, and several newspapers, including online newspapers such as CityNeamț and Ziar Piatra Neamț.

==Transport==
===Public transport===

Public transport in Piatra Neamț is managed mainly by S.C. Troleibuzul SA. Until 2019, the company operated both trolleybuses and motorbuses.

<text>In agriculture, a green manure is a crop specifically cultivated to be incorporated into the soil while still green. Typically, the green manure&#x27;s biomass is incorporated with a plow or disk, as is often done with (brown) manure. The primary goal is to add organic matter to the soil for its benefits. Green manuring is often used with legume crops to add nitrogen to the soil for following crops, especially in organic farming, but is also used in conventional farming.

== Method of application ==
Farmers apply green manure by blending available plant discards into the soil. Farmers begin the process of green manuring by growing legumes or collecting tree/shrub clippings. Harvesters gather the green manure crops and mix the plant material into the soil. The un-decomposed plants prepare the ground for cash crops by slowly releasing nutrients like nitrogen into the soil. 

Farmers may decide to add the green manure into the soil before or after cash crop planting. This variety in planting schedules can be seen in rice farming.

==Functions==

Green manures usually perform multiple functions that include soil improvement and soil protection:

Leguminous green manures such as clover and vetch contain nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria in root nodules that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use. This performs the vital function of fertilization.

Depending on the species of cover crop grown, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil lies between 40 and 200 pounds per acre. With green manure use, the amount of nitrogen that is available to the succeeding crop is usually in the range of 40-60% of the total amount of nitrogen that is contained within the green manure crop.

Green manure acts mainly as soil-acidifying matter to decrease the alkalinity/pH of alkali soils by generating humic acid and acetic acid.

Incorporation of cover crops into the soil allows the nutrients held within the green manure to be released and made available to the succeeding crops. This results immediately from an increase in abundance of soil microorganisms from the degradation of plant material that aid in the decomposition of this fresh material. This additional decomposition also allows for the re-incorporation of nutrients that are found in the soil in a particular form such as nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S).

Microbial activity from incorporation of cover crops into the soil leads to the formation of mycelium and viscous materials which benefit the health of the soil by increasing its soil structure (i.e. by aggregation). The increased percentage of organic matter (biomass) improves water infiltration and retention, aeration, and other soil characteristics. The soil is more easily turned or tilled than non-aggregated soil. Further aeration of the soil results from the ability of the root systems of many green manure crops to efficiently penetrate compact soils. The amount of humus found in the soil also increases with higher rates of decomposition, which is beneficial for the growth of the crop succeeding the green manure crop. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used to increase biomass.

The root systems of some varieties of green manure grow deep in the soil and bring up nutrient resources unavailable to shallower-rooted crops.

Common cover crop functions of weed suppression. Non-leguminous crops are primarily used (e.g. buckwheat). The deep rooting properties of many green manure crops make them efficient at suppressing weeds.

Some green manure crops, when allowed to flower, provide forage for pollinating insects. Green manure crops also often provide habitat for predatory beneficial insects, which allow for a reduction in the application of insecticides where cover crops are planted.

Some green manure crops (e.g. winter wheat and winter rye) can also be used for grazing.

Erosion control is often also taken into account when selecting which green manure cover crop to plant.

Some green crops reduce plant insect pests and diseases. Verticillium wilt is especially reduced in potato plants.

Incorporation of green manures into a farming system can drastically reduce the need for additional products such as supplemental fertilizers and pesticides.

Limitations to consider in the use of green manure are time, energy, and resources (monetary and natural) required to successfully grow and utilize these cover crops. Consequently, it is important to choose green manure crops based on the growing region and annual precipitation amounts to ensure efficient growth and use of the cover crop(s).

==Nutrient release==
Green manure is broken down into plant nutrient components by heterotrophic bacteria that consumes organic matter. Warmth and moisture contribute to this process, similar to creating compost fertilizer. The plant matter releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and weak acids that react with insoluble soil minerals to release beneficial nutrients. Soils that are high in calcium minerals, for example, can be given green manure to generate a higher phosphate content in the soil, which in turn acts as a fertilizer.
The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in a plant is a crucial factor to consider, since it will impact the nutrient content of the soil and may starve a crop of nitrogen, if the incorrect plants are used to make green manure. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen will differ from species to species, and depending upon the age of the plant. The ratio is referred to as C:N. The value of N is always one, whereas the value of carbon or carbohydrates is expressed in a value of about 10 up to 90; the ratio must be less than 30:1 to prevent the manure bacteria from depleting existing nitrogen in the soil. Rhizobium are soil organisms that interact with green manure to retain atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. Legumes, such as beans, alfalfa, clover and lupines, have root systems rich in rhizobium, often making them the preferred source of green manure material.

==Crops==
Many green manures are planted in autumn or winter to cover the ground before spring or summer sowing.

* Alfalfa, which sends roots deep to bring nutrients to the surface.
* Buckwheat in temperate regions
* Cowpea
* Clover (e.g. annual sweet clover)
* Fava beans
* Fenugreek
*Ferns of the genus &quot;Azolla&quot; have been used as a green manure in southeast Asia.
* Lupin
* Millet
* Mustard
* Peanut
* &quot;Phacelia tanacetifolia&quot;
* Radish such as tillage radish or daikon radish.
* Sesbania
* Sorghum
* Soybean
* Sudangrass
* Sunn hemp, a legume widely grown throughout the tropics and subtropics
* Velvet bean (&quot;Mucuna pruriens&quot;), common in the southern US during the early part of the 20th century, before being replaced by soybeans, popular today in most tropical countries, especially in Central America, where it is the main green manure used in slash/mulch farming practices
* Vetch (&quot;Vicia sativa&quot;, &quot;Vicia villosa&quot;) 
* Winter field bean
==History==
Green manures have been used since ancient times. Farmers could only use organic fertilizers before the invention of chemical nitrogen fertilizer. There is evidence for the Greeks plowing broad beans and faba beans into the soil around 300 B.C. The Romans also used green manures like faba beans and lupines to make their soil more fertile. Chinese agricultural texts dating back hundreds of years refer to the importance of grasses and weeds in providing nutrients for farm soil. It was also known to early North American colonists arriving from Europe. Common colonial green manure crops were rye, buckwheat and oats. 

Traditionally, the incorporation of green manure into the soil is known as the fallow cycle of crop rotation, which was used to allow the soil to regain its fertility after the harvest.

== Limitations of green manure ==
Managing green manure improperly or without additional chemical inputs may limit crop production. Mixing green manures into the soil without enough time before crop planting could stop the flow of nitrogen (nitrogen immobilization). When nitrogen stops flowing there won&#x27;t be enough nutrients for the next crop planting. Farming systems with short growth spans for green manure are not usually efficient. Farmers must weigh the cost of green manures with their productivity to determine suitability.

<doc id="409256" wikidata="Q4350438" url="?curid=409256" title="Human rights in Uzbekistan">
<text>Human rights in [[Uzbekistan]] have been described as &quot;abysmal&quot; by Human Rights Watch, and the country has received heavy criticism from the UK and the US for alleged arbitrary arrests, religious persecution and torture employed by the government on a regional and national level. Amnesty International stated that freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly continue to be restricted, and that relations between gay men are illegal.

==Overview==
Human Rights Watch stated that &quot;Uzbekistan&#x27;s record of cooperation with UN human rights mechanisms is arguably among the worst in the world. For the past 12 years, it has ignored requests for access by all 11 UN human rights experts, and has rejected virtually all recommendations that international bodies have made for human rights improvements.&quot; IHF have expressed profound concern about &quot;wide-scale violation of virtually all basic human rights&quot;.

Also, religious freedom is one of the country&#x27;s greatest issues.

The U.S. Department of State has designated Uzbekistan a Country of Particular Concern for the religious persecution practiced in the country, and have defined Uzbekistan as &quot;an authoritarian state with limited civil rights&quot;.
Human Rights Watch, however, says that the US government has &quot;resisted imposing any serious policy or consequences for Uzbekistan&#x27;s dismal rights record, viewing Tashkent as a key ally along the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) that it is using to withdraw supplies from the war in Afghanistan&quot;.

According to reports, the most widespread violations of human rights are torture, arbitrary arrests, and various restrictions of freedoms of religion, of speech and press, of free association and assembly. The reports maintain that the violations are most often committed against members of religious organizations, independent journalists, human right activists and political activists, including members of banned opposition parties.
In 2005, Uzbekistan was included into Freedom House&#x27;s &quot;The Worst of the Worst: The World&#x27;s Most Repressive Societies&quot;.

The official position of the Uzbek government is summarized in a memorandum titled &quot;The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights&quot; and amounts to the following. The government does everything that is in its power to protect and to guarantee the human rights of Uzbekistan&#x27;s citizens. Uzbekistan continuously improves its laws and institutions in order to create a more humane society. Over 300 laws regulating the rights and basic freedoms of the people have been passed by the parliament. For instance, an office of Ombudsman was established in 1996. On August 2, 2005, President Islom Karimov signed a decree that will abolish capital punishment in Uzbekistan on January 1, 2008.

Craig Murray, British ambassador 2002–2004, investigated human rights abuses, and, when his bosses at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ignored his reports, he went public, bringing international attention to the situation. He was dismissed from his post, but continued to speak out against human rights abuses in the country. He also claimed there was extraordinary rendition by the United States of America to Uzbekistan, with surreptitious use of information obtained under torture as a result. Murray was removed from his post in October 2004, shortly after a leaked report in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; quoted him as claiming that MI6 used intelligence provided by Uzbek authorities that was acquired through torture. The FCO denied there was any direct connection and stated that Murray had been removed for &quot;operational&quot; reasons. In his book &quot;Murder in Samarkand&quot; (2006), Murray speculates that his anti-torture memos caused two problems for the US &amp; UK governments. First, the CIA&#x27;s extraordinary rendition program was secretly using Uzbekistan as a destination country to fly people to be tortured. Second, the transcripts of the torture sessions were then shared with Britain&#x27;s MI6 because of the UK-US intelligence sharing agreements of World War II. By objecting to the UK&#x27;s acceptance of CIA torture-obtained information, he was interfering with the secret rendition program as well as threatening the MI6&#x27;s relationship with the CIA.

The 2005 civil unrest in Uzbekistan, which resulted in several hundred people being killed is viewed by many as a landmark event in the history of human rights abuse in Uzbekistan,
A concern has been expressed and a request for an independent investigation of the events has been made by the United States, European Union, the UN, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.
The government of Uzbekistan is accused of unlawful termination of human life, denying its citizens freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The government vehemently tried to rebuff the accusations, maintaining that it merely conducted an anti-terrorist operation, exercising only necessary force. In addition, some officials claim that &quot;an information war on Uzbekistan has been declared&quot; and the human rights violations in Andijan are invented by the enemies of Uzbekistan as a convenient pretext for intervention into the country&#x27;s internal affairs.

The Constitution of Uzbekistan asserts that &quot;democracy in the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be based upon common human principles, according to which the highest value shall be the human being, his life, freedom, honor, dignity and other inalienable rights&quot;.

Uzbekistan has abolished the death penalty. The abolition, initiated by the August 2005 decrees of President Karimov, became effective on January 1, 2008. Capital punishment has been substituted by longer term deprivation of liberty and life sentencing (see Death penalty in Uzbekistan).

In 2015 Human Rights Watch reported that:
===Freedom of religion===

Religious literature which is not state-approved, including the Bible, is often confiscated and destroyed.

Forum 18, a human rights organisation based in Norway, has documented raids by Uzbek police in which participants in unregistered religious services were beaten, fined, threatened and intimidated. In August 2005 one of the organisation&#x27;s reporters was detained and deported by the authorities at Tashkent airport in Uzbekistan.

The Office of Public Information of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses has documented several cases with imprisonment for teaching religion. The Barnabas Fund also states that Pastor Dmitri Shestakov was imprisoned for 4 years for Christian activities.

===Torture===

U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in November 2007 that Uzbek prison authorities routinely beat prisoners and use electric shocks, asphyxiation and sexual humiliation to extract information and confessions. According to a forensic report commissioned by the British embassy, in August 2002 two prisoners were boiled to death. According to a report by the Human Rights Watch, Muslim prisoners have been tortured for praying.

===Women&#x27;s rights===

====Compulsory sterilization====

It is reported that Uzbekistan has been pursuing a policy of forced sterilizations, hysterectomies and IUD insertions since the late 1990s in order to impose population control.

====Domestic violence====
Domestic violence against women is a serious problem in Uzbekistan. A survey by UNICEF found that 69.6% of women agreed that a husband is justified to beat or hit his wife under certain circumstances (including 61.2% if the wife goes out without telling him, and 47.9% if she argues with him).

===Internet===
Uzbekistan&#x27;s &quot;freedom on the net status&quot; is &quot;not free&quot; in the 2012 and 2013 &quot;Freedom on the Net&quot; reports from Freedom House. Uzbekistan maintains the most extensive and pervasive filtering system among the CIS countries and has been listed as an Internet enemy by Reporters Without Borders since the list was created in 2006. The OpenNet Initiative found evidence that Internet filtering was pervasive in the political area and selective in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas during testing that was reported in 2008 and 2010.

Uzbekistan prevents access to websites regarding banned Islamic movements, independent media, NGOs, and material critical of the government&#x27;s human rights violations. Some Internet cafes in the capital have posted warnings that users will be fined for viewing pornographic websites or website containing banned political material. The main VoIP protocols SIP and IAX used to be blocked for individual users; however, as of July 2010, blocks were no longer in place. Facebook was blocked for a few days in 2010.

Internet censorship in Uzbekistan increased following the events of the Arab Spring in 2011. Additional websites are blocked, contributors to online discussion of the events in Egypt, Tunisia, and Bahrain have been arrested, and news about demonstrations and protest movements have been blocked. The BBC website was unblocked in late 2011, but since January 2012, specific pages dealing with the Arab Spring have been inaccessible. ISPs and mobile phone operators are required to report mass mailings of &quot;suspicious content&quot; and to disconnect networks upon authorities’ requests.

The principal intelligence agency in Uzbekistan, the National Security Service (SNB), monitors the Uzbek segment of the Internet and works with the main regulatory body to impose censorship. As all ISPs must rent channels from the state monopoly provider, available evidence strongly suggests that Internet traffic is recorded and monitored by means of a centralized system. SNB officers frequently visit ISPs and Internet cafés to monitor compliance.

In 2014, the entire country&#x27;s internet and mobile messaging networks were stopped over a three- to four-hour window for &#x27;urgent repairs&#x27; coinciding almost precisely with national university entry exams.

==History==
===2004===
The U.S. State Department&#x27;s 2004 report on human rights in Uzbekistan found limited improvement. While no detainees died while in police custody, police negligence led to the deaths of four prisoners. National Security Service officials &quot;tortured, beat, and harassed&quot; citizens but human rights activists were allowed to investigate instances in which prisoners died and activists suspected torture as the cause of death. Security forces did not arrest journalists and three were released. Some non-governmental organizations, most notably the Open Society Institute, were not allowed to register with the government, and thus prevented from work in Uzbekistan.

===2005===
In 2005 the Uzbek government arrested Sanjar Umarov, an opposition politician, and raided the office of Sunshine Uzbekistan, an opposition political alliance. United States Senators Bill Frist and Richard Lugar introduced a resolution calling on the Uzbek government to make sure Umarov &quot;is accorded the full measure of his rights under the Uzbekistan constitution to defend himself against all charges that may be brought against him in a fair and transparent process, so that individual justice may be done&quot;.

Tashkent citizens found the body of Kim Khen Pen Khin, a Pentecostal, on 11 June 2005. According to one another Pentecostal church member police treated church members worse than animals, several beating three of them. One, a pastor, had a concussion. Police initially accused Kural Bekjanov, another church member, of murdering Khin, but dropped the charges against him two days later. When police discovered his religion they broke his ribs and put needles under his fingernails to get him to renounce Christianity.

In August the Uzbek government detained Elena Urlayeva, a human rights activist, on charges of disseminating anti-government leaflets. In October a Tashkent court ordered Urlayeva to undergo psychiatric treatment in a mental health facility in a legal preceding in which neither she nor her lawyer were present. The government released Urlayeva on 27 October after officials abused and beat her.

The Immigration Service and Border Guards of the Government of Uzbekistan detained Igor Rotar, a human rights activist who works for Forum 18 and &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;, on 11 August. Rotar&#x27;s plane took off from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan and arrived at Tashkent Airport at 10:25AM. Amnesty International condemned the incident, saying his &quot;detention is part of a wave of intimidation and harassment of journalists and human rights defenders by the Uzbek authorities that escalated following the events in Andijan in May this year&quot;. Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said, &quot;We are deeply concerned for Rotar&#x27;s safety. He should be allowed to contact his organization and a lawyer, and should be released immediately.&quot;

===2006===
An unknown individual strangled Karina Rivka Loiper, secretary to Rabbi Abe David Gurevich, and her mother on 12 June in Tashkent. While police ruled it a robbery, the Federation of Jewish Communities of the Commonwealth of Independent States called for an investigation. Jewish community leaders said a spokesman for the Committee on Religious Affairs warned them against &quot;politicizing&quot; Loiper&#x27;s death.

On 29 April 2006, human rights workers Azam Farmonov and Alisher Karamatov were arrested and allegedly tortured by state security forces. They are currently serving prison terms on charges of extortion that Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Front Line have condemned as politically motivated.

On 25 October the Karshi-Khanabad court fined two Baptists from Ferghana and Tashkent US$438 while four others were given smaller fines for participating in unregistered religious activity after police raided a Baptist church in the city. 30 police raided a Pentecostal church in Tashkent on 13 November. Another raid on 27 August yielded 38 unapproved pieces of literature.

Uzbek state television played a show entitled &quot;Hypocrites&quot; on 30 November and 1 December, in which Protestant missionaries were said to have engaged in plagiarism and drug use. The program said, &quot;On the pretext of financially helping people in need, [missionaries] instill their own teachings in these people&#x27;s minds&quot;. Converts are &quot;zombies&quot;. Begzot Kadyrov, specialist of the State&#x27;s Religious Affairs Committee, commenting on the program, said, &quot;Turning away from the religion of one&#x27;s ancestors is not only one&#x27;s own mistake but could also lead to very bad situations between brothers, sisters and between parents and their children&quot;. Converts to Christianity are &quot;lost to family, friends and society&quot;.

===2007===
The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHF), Human Rights Watch, and the International Federation for Human Rights International asked the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to continue monitoring human rights in Uzbekistan on 22 March 2007. Aaron Rhodes, executive director of the International Helsinki Federation, criticized the suggestion, saying, &quot;What that would really imply would be that the United Nations would reward the Uzbek government for its repressive policies and its refusal to cooperate with the Council. If the Human Rights Council can&#x27;t take up the problems in Uzbekistan, then what is it for?&quot;.

====Umida Niazova case====
Uzbek police detained Umida Niazova, a human rights activist who worked for local group Veritas and Human Rights Watch in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on 21 December 2006 in the Tashkent airport. Fearing criminal prosecution, she left the country for Kyrgyzstan, returning on the advice of her lawyer who said that no criminal case would be brought against her. At the border, she was arrested and stood trial on charges of illegally crossing the border, smuggling and distribution of illegal content. Holly Cartner, a director at Human Rights Watch alleges that &quot;Niazova was threatened with these charges for... her human rights work&quot;.

On May 1, 2007, an Uzbek court convicted Niazova and sentenced her to seven years in prison, on charges of &quot;preparing or disseminating material containing a threat to security and order&quot;. The Uzbek government alleged she was storing on her laptop literature by an Islamist extremist group. Niazova had written news stories about deadly protests in Andijan, Uzbekistan in 2005. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the United States government, and Human Rights Watch criticized the sentence. On May 8, she confessed in court and she was given a suspended sentence and released.

<text>Great Linford is a historic village, district and wider civil parish in the north of Milton Keynes, England, between Wolverton and Newport Pagnell, and roughly north of Central Milton Keynes.

==Great Linford village==
Great Linford was one of the North Buckinghamshire villages incorporated into Milton Keynes at its designation in 1967.

===History===
The origin of the name Linford is not recorded. The first reference to Linford occurs in 944, when &quot;King Edmund gave to his thegn Aelfheah, land at Linforda with liberty to leave it to whom he wished&quot;; it appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Linforda&quot;. Archaeological investigations at the parish church indicate that the site was a Saxon settlement in the seventh century.

In the early sixteenth century, the rector of this parish Dr Richard Napier was widely known as a medical practitioner, astrologer and curer of souls. He was referred to by many in the upper classes, including the Earl of Sunderland who lived under his care for some time in 1629.

Great Linford Manor was originally built on the hill where the South Pavilion now stands. It was the home of Sir Richard Napier from 1633 to 1676. The manor was the country seat of Sir William Prichard (or Pritchard) in the later part of the seventeenth century, who was Lord Mayor of London, a merchant and slave trader. He bought the Manor of Great Linford in 1682, demolished the original manor house and built the present house below it. In 1702, he founded the group of almshouses and school-house beside the church, which are still there today.

The village grew in importance following construction in 1800 of the Grand Junction Canal and associated wharf to serve Newport Pagnell; in 1817 an arm, the Newport Pagnell Canal, was built out from here but was unsuccessful and closed in 1867. For a hundred years (1867 to 1967) Great Linford was served by Great Linford railway station on the Wolverton to Newport Pagnell branch line.

===Education===
St. Andrews C. of E. Infant School, on the High Street, was founded in 1901. As part of the development of Milton Keynes, a new primary and middle school was opened in 1977, originally known as Great Linford County Combined School, and more recently as Great Linford Primary School.

===Parish church===
The parish church of Saint Andrew is a Grade II* listed building, dating from about 1250. By 1708, the church had become dilapidated and Prichard&#x27;s widow, Sarah, paid for it to be restored; the church was restored again in 1884–5.

===Other===
Great Linford has two pubs: &quot;The Nag&#x27;s Head&quot;, on the High Street and &quot;The Black Horse&quot; at the edge of Great Linford on Wolverton Road, by the Grand Union Canal. There is a new Memorial Hall and a Community Hall off Marsh Drive behind the manor house.

Linford Manor is now owned by Pete Winkelman who is chairman of Milton Keynes Dons F.C. The former stables and associated gate houses are now an Arts Centre. , the former almshouses are not in use but in February 2022, Milton Keynes Council transferred them into the care of the Parks Trust and they are scheduled to be restored.

==Civil parish==
In addition to Great Linford district itself (with the historic village at its core), the civil parish also includes the districts of Bolbeck Park/Giffard Park, Blakelands, Neath Hill, Pennyland, Tongwell, Conniburrow, Downs Barn, Downhead Park and Redhouse Park.

The parish is bounded to the north by Newport Road, to the west by the B4034/V8 Marlborough Street (as far as H4 Dansteed Way), then along Dansteed Way as far as V7 Saxon Street, south along Saxon Street as far as the A509/H5 Portway, then east along Portway to the M1, then north along the motorway until it reaches Newport Road again. The Grand Union Canal bisects the parish.

The parish increased in population from 263 in the 1971 census to 11,882 in the 1981 census, an increase of some 4,400%. At the 2011 census, the population had reached 19,350, and the 2021 census is expected to show a further increase because of construction of Redhouse Park in the intervening period.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has four Grade II* listed buildings (the parish church, the Almshouses, the Manor House, and the Pavilions), a further 20 Grade II listings, and one scheduled monument (two small brick kilns).

<text>This article lists political parties in Guyana. 
Guyana has a two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties. The main schism is not of ideology, but ethnicity; the People&#x27;s Progressive Party is supported primarily by Indo-Guyanese people, while the People&#x27;s National Congress is supported primarily by Afro-Guyanese people.

<text>Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr. (born February 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who has served as vice president of player programs and development for the Miami Heat since June 2009. Mourning played most of his 15-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career for the Heat.

Nicknamed &quot;Zo&quot;, Mourning played the center position. Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired. In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr. was born on February 8, 1970, in Chesapeake, Virginia. He attended Indian River High School, where he excelled in basketball. He led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Christian Laettner, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, Stanley Roberts, Rick Fox, and Malik Sealy, among others.

==College career==
Mourning played college basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown University. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.

Mourning&#x27;s scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).

Mourning finished his college career with 2,001 points and 1,032 rebounds, reaching the exclusive 2,000-point and 1,000-rebound milestone. More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career, but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.

==Professional career==

===Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)===
Mourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and before Christian Laettner. Mourning was named to the league&#x27;s all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in rookie of the year voting. He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O&#x27;Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte&#x27;s blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets&#x27; all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning&#x27;s rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.

In the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.

===Miami Heat (1995–2003)===
On November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte&#x27;s contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis to the Miami Heat in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.

Mourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.

In July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat. In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. The Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4 as the Heat won 87–80. However, with a 100–87 loss in Game 5, the Heat were eliminated by the Bulls.

In the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4. The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning&#x27;s leg in an attempt to break up the fight. The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat once again fell short to the Knicks in the first round, with Allan Houston securing the series victory with a last-second jumper in Game 5. Mourning again led the NBA in blocks in the 1999–2000 season, this time with a 3.7 average, and won Defensive Player of the Year. Miami finished the regular season with 52 wins and faced the Knicks in the second round. But for a third straight season, the Heat lost to the Knicks in a winner-take-all game, this time in Game 7.

Shortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease. Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets. In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.

===New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)===
Mourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent. On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease. On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant. In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team&#x27;s regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin. After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams (and two first-round draft picks) were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004. Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team. Mourning then finished the season with the Heat being paid a second salary, the veteran&#x27;s minimum.

===Return to the Heat (2005–2008)===
Mourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005. His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O&#x27;Neal missing stretches due to injury. O&#x27;Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning&#x27;s tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. In the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O&#x27;Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.

On June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning, as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton. Mourning continued to serve as the Heat&#x27;s backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team&#x27;s starting center after O&#x27;Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. After a 2–0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of Dwyane Wade, and in Game 6 in Dallas, Mourning came off the bench to score eight points with six rebounds and a team-high five blocks to help Miami win its first NBA championship in franchise history.

After winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in the 2006–07 season to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the San Antonio Spurs. In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. &quot;It will definitely be my last year&quot;, Mourning said. After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games, Mourning tore his patellar tendon in his right knee on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of the 117–111 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.

During the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat&#x27;s all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).

==Retirement==
Mourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, &quot;At 38 I feel like I&#x27;ve physically done all I can for this game.&quot; One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning&#x27;s number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored. The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.

In May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.

Mourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.

Mourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama&#x27;s 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011. In addition to Mourning, the game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose and Obama&#x27;s friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators.

On April 7, 2014, it was announced that Mourning would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 8.

On March 26, 2019, Mourning was named to the FIBA Hall of Fame, and was inducted on August 30.

In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Mourning as the 69th greatest player in NBA history.

Mourning told ESPN on June 4, 2024, that he is cancer-free after his March prostatectomy following a February medical diagnosis of high-grade stage 3 cancer.

==Charitable work==


In 1997, Mourning established Alonzo Mourning Charities Inc. to aid in the development of children and families living in at-risk situations and provides support and services that enhance the lives of youth of promise.

After being diagnosed with focal glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Mourning launched Zo&#x27;s Fund for Life, a campaign which seeks to raise funds for research, education, and testing to fight focal glomerulosclerosis. Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.

In 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.

In 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.

In 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.

==Personal life==
Mourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children. Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father&#x27;s signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012. On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League, and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.

In July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh&#x27;s wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.

In 2015, Mourning was one of eight Virginians honored in the Library of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Strong Men &amp; Women in Virginia History&quot; for his charitable work and for his contributions to the sport of basketball.

===Kidney transplant===
On November 25, 2003, Mourning&#x27;s cousin and a retired U. S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning&#x27;s gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning&#x27;s father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother&#x27;s funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.

Mourning received Cooper&#x27;s left kidney on December 19, 2003.

<doc id="409264" wikidata="Q8033959" url="?curid=409264" title="Woolstone, Milton Keynes">
<text>Great Woolstone and Little Woolstone are two historic villages in modern Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire that are now called jointly Woolstone or The Woolstones and form the heart of a new district of that name, in the Campbell Park civil parish. At the 2011 Census, the population of the district was included in the figure for the civil parish and not reported separately.

==History==
The name &#x27;Woolstone&#x27; is an Old English language word, and means &#x27;Wulfsige&#x27;s farm&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Great Woolstone was recorded as &quot;Ulsiestone&quot;. and Little Woolstone as &quot;Wlsiestone&quot;. Little Woolstone was enclosed by the &#x27; (31 Geo. 3. c. &quot;21&quot; ), and Great Woolstone by the &#x27; (36 Geo. 3. c. &quot;12&quot; ).

Until shortly after the turn of the 19th century, Little Woolstone was named Parva Woolstone. The area is now collectively known simply as &quot;Woolstone&quot; or &quot;The Woolstones&quot;. The land between the two villages is now occupied by the village cricket green. 

They are both linear villages, being hemmed in by and along the north–south line of both the River Ouzel (to the east of the villages) and of the Grand Union Canal to the west. They form part of a chain of three villages along this line, the next about a mile further south being Woughton-on-the-Green.

==The Woolstones today==
Today, Great Woolstone still has its own village pub, the thatched-roof &quot;Cross Keys&quot;, which can trace its history back to 1560. Little Woolstone is the larger of the two Woolstones, having benefited from the building of the canal. Its village pub, &quot;The Barge Inn&quot;, dates from this time, being opened to meet the needs of the canal labourers, but is now mainly a restaurant. The Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity in Little Woolstone now serves both villages; the church in Great Woolstone closed in the 1970s and has served various purposes since then including being used as a music rehearsal room.

The old village centre seems only a little changed from its description in &quot;Buckinghamshire Footpaths&quot; in 1949:
==People==
*Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison (&quot;Sister Dora&quot;) was village schoolmistress in the parish of Little Woolston for three years from 1861; Pattison Lane, the main road through Woolstone, is named after her.

<doc id="409267" wikidata="Q3626197" url="?curid=409267" title="List of political parties in Jamaica">
<text>Jamaica has two traditional parties from the old colonial era: the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP). The United Independents&#x27; Congress of Jamaica (UIC) became the first new (post colonial) registered political party on December 7, 2019. Other parties have cropped up and disintegrated in the past due mostly to a lack of funding and effective differentiation from the major parties. Since 2018, political parties are now required to be registered by the ECJ or Electoral Commission of Jamaica. This has eliminated all the other minor parties that have not been able to meet registration requirements.

<doc id="409277" wikidata="Q672553" url="?curid=409277" title="Foreign relations of Tuvalu">
<text>From 1916 to 1975, Tuvalu was part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony of the United Kingdom. A referendum was held in 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum, the separate British colonies of Kiribati and Tuvalu were formed. Tuvalu became fully independent as a sovereign state within the Commonwealth on 1 October 1978. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.

Tuvalu is a very small island country of . In terms of physical land size, Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City—0.44 km2; Monaco—1.95 km2 and Nauru—21 km2. it is the third-least populated independent country in the world, with a population of 10,507 (2017 Census). Because of the small size of the economy of Tuvalu, its foreign relations are limited to its most important partners. Tuvalu maintains close relations with Fiji, New Zealand, Australia (which has maintained a High Commission in Tuvalu since 2018), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union.

As a small Pacific Island nation, a major concern is the effect of climate change on the atolls. Tuvalu is a developing country and works with other island states, which tend to share similar sustainable development challenges, such as the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS).

Tuvalu participates in the work of the Pacific Community (SPC) and is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. It has maintained a mission at the United Nations in New York City since 2000. 

==International organisational participation==

===Tuvalu and the Commonwealth of Nations===

On 1 September 2000, Tuvalu became a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Since its independence in 1978, Tuvalu had been a special member, but without having any voting rights in the organisation that brings together 54 countries that are mostly former colonies of the United Kingdom. Tuvalu&#x27;s admission as a full member was approved by the members of the Commonwealth unanimously earlier in the year. 

===Membership of the United Nations===

Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations on 17 September 2000. 

Ambassador Tapugao Falefou took up his appointment as the permanent representative of Tuvalu to the United Nations on 13 February 2023. He was also appointed as the Ambassador to the United States of America. 

Tuvalu notably played an active role in the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, attracting media and public attention with a proposed protocol which would have imposed deeper, legally binding emission cuts, including on developing nations. Following Tuvaluan delegate Ian Fry&#x27;s &quot;tear-jerking [speech] that prompted wild applause among the crowded Copenhagen conference floor&quot;, &quot;The Australian&quot;&#x27;s political editor commented that Tuvalu was &quot;no longer small fry on the world stage&quot;.

The United Nations designates Tuvalu as a least developed country (LDC) because of its limited potential for economic development, absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks. Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (EIF), which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. In 2013 Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status to a Developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations&#x27;s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as &quot;Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs&quot;. Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister, Enele Sopoaga wants the United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like Tuvalu in the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI).

===Regional organisational relations===
Tuvalu is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, the South Pacific Tourism Organisation, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Pacific Community.

Tuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). The Tuvaluan government, the US government, and the governments of other Pacific islands, are parties to the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT), entered into force in 1988. The current SPTT agreement expires on 14 June 2013. Tuvalu is one of the eight signatories of the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest (Nauru Agreement) which collectively controls 25–30% of the world&#x27;s tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply . In May 2013 representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty and Nauru Agreement) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats for 18 months.

In 1993, Tuvalu became a member of the Asian Development Bank. Tuvalu endorsed the Treaty of Rarotonga joining itself to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty in 1985.

In 2004, Tuvalu provided police officers to the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Tuvaluan Police officers served as part of RAMSI&#x27;s Participating Police Force (PPF).

In November 2011, Tuvalu was one of the eight founding members of Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment. Tuvalu participates in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change. Under the Majuro Declaration, which was signed on 5 September 2013, Tuvalu committed to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy, which was proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand). The feasibility of wind power generation will be considered as part of the commitment to increase the use of renewable energy in Tuvalu.

On 18 February 2016 Tuvalu signed the Pacific Islands Development Forum Charter and formally joined the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF). In June 2017, Tuvalu signed the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER).

===International organisations===

In addition to its membership in the UN and the Commonwealth of Nations, outside the region, Tuvalu is a member or participant of the ACP (Lomé Convention), the Alliance of Small Island States, Asian Development Bank, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the G-77, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the IMF, the International Maritime Organization, the International Olympic Committee, the ITU and the Universal Postal Union. While Tuvalu is not currently a member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, it has observer status with admission and recognition still pending.

In July 2013 Tuvalu signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish the Pacific Regional Trade and Development Facility, which Facility originated in 2006, in the context of negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Pacific ACP States and the European Union. The rationale for the creation of the Facility being to improve the delivery of aid to Pacific island countries in support of the Aid-for-Trade (AfT) requirements. The Pacific ACP States are the countries in the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement with the European Union (which succeeded the Lomé Convention). On 31 May 2017 the first enhanced High Level Political Dialogue between Tuvalu and the European Union under the Cotonou Agreement was held in Funafuti.

Tuvalu is also a member of the following organisations:

ACP, ADB, AOSIS, Commonwealth of Nations, FAO, IBRD (also known as the World Bank), ICAO, IDA, IFRCS (observer), ILO, IMF, IMO, IOC, ITU, OPCW, PIF, Sparteca, SPC, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UPU, WHO, World Meteorological Organization.

Tuvalu became a member of the Asian Development Bank in 1993, and became a member of the World Bank in 2010.

Tuvalu is notable for its absence of membership in several major international organisations. For example, it is one of only four UN members that do not belong to the Specialized Agencies. Tuvalu is one of only 13 UN members that are not members of the International Finance Corporation and is one of only 16 UN members that are neither a member nor an observer of the World Trade Organization. Finally, as with many other nations in Oceania, Tuvalu is not a member of Interpol or of the International Hydrographic Organization.

==Relations with other nations==

===Consulates and honorary consulates===

Tuvalu has only five diplomatic missions abroad: a High Commission in Suva, Fiji, (opened in 1976), its office at the United Nations (opened in 2001), an embassy in the Republic of China (opened in March 2013), a High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand (opened in February 2015). and an embassy to the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi (opened in April 2022).

Tuvalu maintains honorary consulates in Australia, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Republic of China (Taiwan) has a resident embassy in Tuvalu. France maintains an honorary consulate in Tuvalu. In 2018 Australia upgraded its representation in Tuvalu from a representative office of AusAid to a High Commission. All three of these are located in Funafuti.
In 2021 Tuvalu appointed Ambassador Shivshankar Nair GCEG as its Envoy to The Commonwealth to lead the campaign of Sir Italeli Iakoba, the former Governor General to become the SG of the Commonwealth.
Subsequently, Ambassador Nair was appointed Special Envoy in charge of Oceans and Climate change

===Support to the right of self-determination===
In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Tuvalu and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in the Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963, and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report. Indonesia rejected Vanuatu&#x27;s allegations. More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict. In September 2017, at the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, the Prime Ministers of Tuvalu, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands once again raised human rights abuses in Indonesian-occupied West Papua.

===Recognition of Palestine===
On 10 September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly passed a Palestinian resolution to allow its flag to fly in front of the United Nations headquarters in New York. The vote was passed with 119 votes in support, 8 opposing, and 45 abstentions. Tuvalu was one of the eight opposing votes. Palestine had previously been granted UN &quot;non-member observer state&quot; status in 2012.

<text>Grendon Underwood is a village and civil parish in west Buckinghamshire, England, near the border with Oxfordshire. The village sits between Woodham and Edgcott, near the Roman road Akeman Street (now part of the A41), and around north-west of Aylesbury. At the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish was 1,625.

==History==

The toponym is derived from the Old English for &#x27;green hill near a wood&#x27;, though the &#x27;Underwood&#x27; part of the name was only added in the medieval period to differentiate the village from nearby Long Crendon and to signify the village&#x27;s position close to the Bernwood Forest. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Grennedone&quot;. The manor of Grendon anciently belonged to the St Amand family. Almeric de St Amand of this family was one of the godfathers of King Edward I, who was baptised in 1239.

In 1642, Grendon Underwood lay on the forest tracks used by gypsies and strolling players (travelling performers) and was visited more than once by William Shakespeare, who stayed at the house, formerly an inn, now known as Shakespeare House, currently (2012) a five star guest house and Grade II listed, part Elizabethan former coaching inn. 
Built in 1906, Grendon Underwood Junction was the point at Greatmoor, just east of Grendon Underwood village, at which the Alternative Route of the London Extension of the Great Central Railway left the original main line. This was a little north of the former Quainton Road railway station. The lines were closed to passenger trains in 1966 but subsequently used by freight trains.
During the Second World War Grendon Hall was Station 53a of the Special Operations Executive (SOE).

Sofie Magdalene Dahl, the mother of author Roald Dahl, moved with her daughters into a cottage in Grendon Underwood after they were bombed out of their home in Bexley, Kent during the Blitz. When Roald returned home from Royal Air Force duty in Greece and Palestine in the autumn of 1941, he at first had no idea where to find his family. Their eventual reunion is described by Dahl on the last page of his autobiography &quot;Going Solo&quot;.

==Current village==

The Church of England parish church of Saint Leonard dates from the 12th or early 13th century. The village has a public house, &quot;The Swan&quot; specializing in Thai cuisine (correct at 2015). Grendon Underwood Combined School is a community school with about 280 pupils. The village has a single village shop. The Grendon Garage operated in the village until 2015, when it relocated to Tingewick, near Buckingham. The former premises were demolished for redevelopment.

Grendon Underwood once bordered Bernwood Forest, the nearest remnants of which are now Grendon and Doddershall Woods, which are detached from the village itself by approx 500 metres. Both woods are now silvicultural and classified as ancient forest and are sites of special scientific interest (SSSI&#x27;s). This offers protected status to some of the endangered species of animals residing therein such as Bechstein&#x27;s bats, and nightingales. There are also 35 species of butterflies such as purple emperor, brown hairstreak, black hairstreak, wood white, the silver washed fritillary, high brown fritillary, marsh fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearly-bordered fritillary.

==Grendon prisons==
Grendon Underwood has two prisons, both are remotely located one mile away from the church and main village. The B-Category prison HMP Grendon is the UK&#x27;s only therapeutic community for the treatment of serious offenders. HMP Grendon opened in 1962 as an experimental prison for inmates with psychiatric antisocial personality disorder. The facility holds approx 238 cat B male prisoners (April 2012).
HMP Spring Hill is a D-Category open prison with an operational capacity of 335(April 2013) Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoners (ISP&#x27;s). The prison building, Springhill House was a former MI6 Secret Service base during the Second World War.

==The Grendon Festival (GrendON)==
This a Biennial event (every 2 years), with live music, comedians and a CAMRA supported real ale festival. The Grendon festival has a series of live tribute bands such as Kazabian, Noasis, Killerz, and Kings of Lyon, national and local bands such as Stoke Mandville Band, 48Krash. The festival, which takes place every other year, started out in 2006 with 300 people attending. In 2010 it attracted 2,000 and in 2012 organisers expected 4,000 attendees. However the event was postponed in May 2012 due to severe flooding and was successfully rescheduled to September 2012. The event was down-scaled for 2014 to include just 2 acts: &quot;The Vinyls&quot; and &quot;Not the Rolling Stones&quot;, the event was expected to return to a mega-festival format in 2016, but was once again postponed.

<text>Political parties in Kyrgyzstan now have greater political power and freedom to campaign than at any previous time in the history of the nation. During the Akayev administration&#x27;s rule, opposition parties were allowed, but were widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. The Tulip Revolution brought an authentic multi-party system to Kyrgyzstan.

Political parties in Kyrgyzstan are mainly focused around the ideologies and personality of the party leaders rather than a static party-wide set of ideologies, so party programmes are subject to change if the party leadership changes.

<doc id="409281" wikidata="Q1382495" url="?curid=409281" title="Kevin Shields">
<text>Kevin Patrick Shields (born 21 May 1963) is an Irish-American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer, who achieved international fame as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine. Their studio albums &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; (1988) and &quot;Loveless&quot; (1991) established Shields as a pioneering figure in the shoegaze genre. His texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars&#x27; tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the &quot;glide guitar&quot; technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s sound, along with his meticulous production techniques.

Following My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s dissolution in the late 1990s, Shields became a frequent guest musician, producer, engineer, and remixer with various bands and artists, including Experimental Audio Research, Yo La Tengo, Dinosaur Jr, and Mogwai. In 1998 he became a touring member of Primal Scream. Shields contributed several original compositions to the soundtrack of Sofia Coppola″s 2003 film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, which earned him nominations for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) awards. In 2008, Shields released a collaborative live album together with Patti Smith entitled &quot;The Coral Sea&quot;.

My Bloody Valentine reunited in 2007; the band released their third studio album, &quot;m b v,&quot; in February 2013. The album was composed entirely by Shields and had been in production since the late 1990s, when Shields was rumoured to have been suffering from writer&#x27;s block. Shields has since been featured in several publications&#x27; best-of-lists, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 100 Greatest Guitarists and &quot;Spin&quot;″s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Multiple musicians have also cited him as an influence, including Billy Corgan and J Mascis.

==Early life==
Kevin Patrick Shields was born on 21 May 1963 in Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, United States. He is the eldest of five siblings born to Irish parents; his mother was a nurse and his father was an executive in the food industry. Shields&#x27; parents had emigrated from Ireland to the United States in the 1950s, when the couple were teenagers. Shields attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic primary school which he described as &quot;a really horrible school run by psychopathic nuns&quot;. They lived in Flushing, a neighbourhood in north-central Queens, relocating to Commack, Long Island, when Shields was four, where he lived until the age of ten. In 1973, Shields moved to Dublin, Ireland, with his parents and siblings due to financial conditions and in order to remain close to their extended family.

Shields was raised in Cabinteely, a suburb in Dublin&#x27;s Southside. He has described the experience of moving to Ireland as a culture shock, &quot;going from, as far as I was concerned, the modern world to some distant past.&quot; According to Shields, the main difference between the US and Ireland that affected him was the attitude towards music culture: &quot;[in the US] there was no &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, there was nothing like that, there was no MTV; and over in [Ireland], everything was completely catered to for teenagers.&quot; He said that the change was &quot;what got [him] into music in a really big way.&quot;

==Music career==

===1979–1982: Early projects===
Shields received his first electric guitar, a Hondo SG, as a Christmas present from his parents in 1979. Shields befriended drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig in south Dublin during the summer of 1978, and together they answered an advertisement placed by a 12-year-old musician to form punk rock band The Complex. Ó Cíosóig&#x27;s schoolfriend Liam Ó Maonlaí from Coláiste Eoin in Booterstown was recruited as lead vocalist, and the band began rehearsing. Shields later said that The Complex had formed out of &quot;what all the nerds and weirdos actually do as opposed to the cool people with the leather jackets,&quot; who were forming fictional groups around Dublin in the late 1970s. According to Shields, the band played &quot;a handful of gigs&quot; during their short-lived career, the first of which included covers of songs by the Sex Pistols and Ramones.

The Complex disbanded when Ó Maonlaí left to form Hothouse Flowers, and Shields and Ó Cíosóig began rehearsing with another bassist. In 1981, the trio formed A Life in the Day, a band that focused on a more post-punk sound influenced by Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division. The band recorded a demo tape, which features Shields&#x27; first experimentation with pitch bending, and performed at local venues to crowds of no more than a hundred people.

===1983–1997: My Bloody Valentine===

A Life in the Day disbanded in 1981, and Shields and Ó Cíosóig went on to form My Bloody Valentine in early 1983 with lead vocalist David Conway. Conway suggested a number of potential band names (including The Burning Peacocks) before the trio settled for My Bloody Valentine. Shields has since claimed that he was unaware at the time that My Bloody Valentine was the title of a 1981 Canadian slasher film.

On Shields&#x27;s suggestion, Conway contacted Gavin Friday, lead vocalist of the Dublin post-punk band, the Virgin Prunes. Friday&#x27;s contacts secured them a show in Tilburg, Netherlands, in early 1984, and the band relocated to the Netherlands. They lived there for a further nine months, squatting in Amsterdam and later in a more rural area, where Shields worked on a farm. Due to a lack of opportunities and correct documentation, the band relocated to West Berlin, Germany, in late 1984 and recorded their debut mini album, &quot;This Is Your Bloody Valentine&quot; (1985). The album, which features Shields on bass, failed to receive much attention, and the band returned temporarily to the Netherlands before settling in London in 1985.
The band recruited bassist Debbie Googe and released their debut extended play &quot;Geek!&quot; in December 1985. The EP received little attention, and due to the band&#x27;s slow progress Shields contemplated relocating to New York, where members of his family were living. The band&#x27;s two successive releases, &quot;The New Record by My Bloody Valentine&quot; (1986) and &quot;Sunny Sundae Smile&quot; (1987), brought minor success, peaking at number 22 and number 6 respectively on the UK Independent Albums Chart and Singles Chart. During a supporting tour in March 1987, David Conway announced his decision to leave the band due to his gastric illness, disillusionment with music and ambitions to become a writer. Conway was replaced by vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, with whom Shields split (and often shared) vocal duties. Shields was initially reluctant to take on a vocal role within the band, but said that he had &quot;always sung in the rehearsal room... and made up the melodies.&quot; With the new line up in place, the band intended to drop the My Bloody Valentine moniker, but were unable to decide on a replacement and so kept the name &quot;for better or for worse&quot;.

A series of successful releases followed including three-track single &quot;Strawberry Wine&quot; and the band&#x27;s second mini album &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1987), both featuring Shields on lead vocal duties. Whilst touring in support of &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records, who described the band as &quot;the Irish equivalent to Hüsker Dü&quot;. The band&#x27;s first release for Creation was the EP &quot;You Made Me Realise&quot; (1988), followed by the band&#x27;s hugely influential debut studio album &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; (1988), which is regarded as having &quot;virtually created&quot; shoegaze genre, establishing the template which a number of bands would work off.

My Bloody Valentine commenced the recording sessions for their second album in February 1989. Creation Records had believed that the album could be recorded in five days, but several unproductive months followed during which Shields took control of the musical and technical aspects of the sessions. Shields relocated to a total of 19 other studios and hired a number of engineers, including Alan Moulder, Anjali Dutt and Guy Fixsen. As the recording was taking so long, Shields and Creation agreed to release two interim EPs, &quot;Glider&quot; (1990) and &quot;Tremolo&quot; (1991). The &quot;Loveless&quot; album was eventually released in November 1991, and was rumoured to have cost over £250,000 and to have bankrupted Creation (claims which Shields has denied). Critical reception to &quot;Loveless&quot; was almost unanimous with praise, although the album was not a commercial success, peaking at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failing to chart internationally. Creation Records founder Alan McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from the label soon after the release of &quot;Loveless&quot;, due to the album&#x27;s excessive recording time and interpersonal problems with Shields.

In October 1992, My Bloody Valentine signed to Island Records for a reported £250,000. The band&#x27;s advance went towards the construction of a home studio in Streatham, South London, which was completed in April 1993. Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into &quot;semi-meltdown&quot;, according to Shields, who was rumoured to have been suffering from writer&#x27;s block. Googe and Ó Cíosóig left the band in 1995, whilst Shields and Butcher attempted to record a third studio album; Shields had said that this would be released in 1998, but My Bloody Valentine disbanded in 1997. Unable to finalise a third album, Shields isolated himself, and in his own words &quot;went crazy&quot;, drawing comparisons in the music press to the eccentric behaviour of musicians like Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd.

Rumours spread amongst fans that several albums worth of material had been recorded and shelved prior to the band&#x27;s break up. In 1999, it was reported that Shields had delivered 60 hours of material to Island Records, and Butcher confirmed that there existed &quot;probably enough songs to fill two albums.&quot; Shields later admitted that at least one full album of &quot;half-finished&quot; material was abandoned, stating &quot;it was dead. It hadn&#x27;t got that spirit, that life in it.&quot;

===1997–2006: Collaborations and &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;===
Following My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s disbandment, Shields embarked on a number of collaborations with other artists, both as a guest musician and producing, engineering, mixing and remixing other acts. Shields contributed guitar loops to two Experimental Audio Research albums: 1996&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot; (which was recorded at Shields&#x27; home studio in Streatham and credits him with &quot;special thanks&quot; on the album sleeve) and 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Köner Experiment&quot;. He was a frequent collaborator with indie rock band Dinosaur Jr, appearing on and producing &quot;Hand It Over&quot; (1997) and &quot;Ear-Bleeding Country: The Best of Dinosaur Jr.&quot; (2001), as well as frontman J Mascis″ &quot;More Light&quot; (2000) and &quot;The John Peel Sessions&quot; (2003). Shields has lent his services as a guest musician to releases by Russell Mills &amp; Undark, DJ Spooky, Curve, Manic Street Preachers, Le Volume Courbe, Gemma Hayes and Paul Weller. In a live capacity, Shields has performed with the Canadian contemporary dance company La La La Human Steps (contributing the song &quot;2&quot; to the 1995 performance of the same name), Gemma Hayes, The Charlatans and Spacemen 3 (appearing at their 2010 reunion show).
Shields has also remained active as a producer outside of My Bloody Valentine: his first credits were The Impossible&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot;; and &quot;Tunnel&quot;, a track from GOD″s remix album &quot;Appeal to Human Greed&quot; (1995). He also produced Dot Allison″s &quot;Afterglow&quot; (1997), Joy Zipper″s &quot;American Whip&quot; (2003) and The Beat Up&#x27;s &quot;Blackrays Defence&quot; (2005). Shields has also mixed and remixed material by The Pastels, Yo La Tengo, Damian O&#x27;Neill, Mogwai, Hurricane #1, The Go! Team, Bow Wow Wow and Wounded Knees.

Between 1998 and 2006, Shields became a frequent collaborator and semi-permanent touring member of Primal Scream. He contributed guitar, produced and mixed tracks on two of the band&#x27;s studio albums: &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; (2000), and &quot;Evil Heat&quot; (2002). Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie has said that &quot;[Shields] brings something that nobody else in the world can bring. He plays guitar the way that nobody else in the world plays guitar,&quot; adding that Primal Scream considered Shields to be &quot;part of the family, very much so.&quot; Shields has remained close to the band following his departure in 2006, remastering Primal Scream&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Screamadelica&quot; (1991) in 2010 and contributing guitar to &quot;2013&quot;, the lead single from &quot;More Light&quot; (2013). Gillespie has since commented on Shields&#x27; absence, noting that &quot;there&#x27;s always room for Kevin Shields—always.&quot;
In 2003, Shields contributed four original compositions to the soundtrack for Sofia Coppola&#x27;s 2003 film, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. Shields became involved with the score after being contacted by the film&#x27;s music co-ordinator Brian Reitzell while in Tokyo, Japan. During summer 2002, Reitzell and Shields began impromptu jam sessions in London where the duo &quot;adopted a late-night recording schedule,&quot; resulting in the single &quot;City Girl.&quot; Released in August 2003 on V2 Records, the &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; soundtrack included three other ambient pieces which Shields had composed for the film: &quot;Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Ikebana,&quot; and &quot;Are You Awake?&quot;. His contributions to the soundtrack earned Shields nominations for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Best Film Music, an Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) award for Best Music in a Film, and an Online Film Critics Society award for Best Original Score.

In July 2008, Shields collaborated with the American musician Patti Smith to release the live album &quot;The Coral Sea&quot; on the PASK label (which the duo had also founded together). The double album features two performances at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, recorded on 22 June 2005 and 12 September 2006, wherein Smith reads the book of the name same (which she wrote in tribute to her friend, the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe) over Shields&#x27; instrumental accompaniment.

===2007–present: My Bloody Valentine reunion===
In August 2007, reports emerged that My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States; this was later confirmed by Shields, along with the announcement that the band&#x27;s third studio album (which he had begun recording in 1996) was near completion. In June 2008, My Bloody Valentine played two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, their first public performances in 16 years. They began an extensive worldwide tour in summer 2008 (their first since their 1992 tour in support of &quot;Loveless&quot;) including appearances at Øyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Ireland, and the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata, Japan. The band reportedly spent £200,000 on equipment for their world tour.

In October 2011, Shields launched the independent record label Pickpocket together with Le Volume Courbe frontwoman Charlotte Marionneau, and considered releasing a collaborative &quot;ten minutes of noise&quot; single on the imprint. In May 2012 remastered versions of &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot; and &quot;Loveless&quot; were released as well as the &quot;EP&#x27;s 1988–1991&quot; collection, which featured the band&#x27;s Shields-remastered Creation Records extended plays, singles and unreleased tracks.

In November, Shields announced plans to release My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s third album online before the end of the year, before announcing during a warm-up show at Electric Brixton in London on 27 January 2013 that the album &quot;might be out in two or three days.&quot; The &quot;m b v&quot; album was eventually released through the band&#x27;s official website on 2 February 2013, crashing the site on its launch due to high traffic. According to Metacritic, &quot;m b v&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, and the band began a worldwide tour upon its release.

Shields has since announced intentions to release remastered analogue cuts of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s back catalogue followed by two releases of new material that were most recently expected to release in 2019.

In April 2018, Shields released &quot;The Weight Of History / Only Once Away My Son&quot;, a collaborative double A-side with Brian Eno, for Record Store Day.

In June 2023, he released the Fender Shields Blender, which he co-developed with Fender (company).

==Artistry==

===Influences===
Shields has referred to The Beatles and the Ramones as his favourite bands of all time. Upon moving to Ireland in 1973, he became a fan of &quot;the energy, androgyny and otherworldy production style&quot; of glam rock and has said Johnny Ramone inspired him to begin playing guitar. Speaking about Ramone, Shields said &quot;I realised [Johnny] wasn&#x27;t playing guitar—he was generating the sound ... it was just a noise generator.&quot; He later remarked seeing the Ramones perform in a North Dublin cinema &quot;changed his life&quot;. Other guitarists he admired were Public Image Ltd guitarist Keith Levene and Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker. Some of his earlier influences included local Dublin punk band DC Nien, The Birthday Party, The Cramps and Einstürzende Neubauten. In the mid-to-late 1980s, he was influenced by The Byrds, Hüsker Dü, Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth—particularly two of the band&#x27;s albums: &quot;EVOL&quot; (1986) and &quot;Sister&quot; (1987). He was also influenced by hip hop music, in particular Public Enemy, whose track &quot;Security in the First World&quot; Shields sampled on the 1988 My Bloody Valentine track &quot;Instrumental No 2&quot;. Later Shields has cited The Beach Boys as an influence and expressed admiration for modern artists like Tame Impala.

Shields&#x27; production techniques were influenced by a range of producers and artists. He has stated a dislike for the &quot;wet and ... liquid&quot; production values of 1980s music and shoegaze artists; he instead favours the &quot;dry ... and upfront&quot; sound used by Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth. He said that the use of stereo in the 1980s was part of a &quot;weak, corporate sound&quot;. Shields records and produces largely in mono, an approach influenced by Brian Wilson″s production on The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966) and veteran pop producer Phil Spector. He has also expressed admiration for producer Joe Meek and the French electronic duo Daft Punk.

===Guitar sound===
Shields&#x27; guitar sound has been cited as one of the most recognisable aspects of My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s music. His sound uses &quot;texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes&quot;. He has been listed at number 95 and 2 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s and &quot;Spin&quot;″s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list. During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmaster guitars; he extended the tremolo arm and loosened it considerably, to allow him to manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in significant pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Michael Azerrad, achieved &quot;a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus&quot;.

Among Shields&#x27; notable effects is digital reverse reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as &quot;glide guitar&quot;. Shields&#x27; effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalisers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals, although on most songs he only has two to four activated when playing live. His rig is connected to a large number of amplifiers which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances with My Bloody Valentine – particularly during the closing number &quot;You Made Me Realise&quot; – Shields creates a blend of white noise, which often lasts for half an hour and can reach 130db. &quot;It was so loud it was like sensory deprivation,&quot; he remarked. &quot;We just liked the fact that we could see a change in the audience at a certain point.&quot;

===Legacy===
Shields&#x27; sound and performance have been regarded as influential, with musicians including Billy Corgan, J Mascis, and Greg Puciato citing him as an influence; the last revealed that his most desired collaboration would be with Shields.

&quot;Kevin Shields achieved something on &quot;Loveless&quot; that only the great guitarists achieve: he achieved a wholeness and a unity,&quot; observed Living Colour&#x27;s Vernon Reid. &quot;He created his own sound.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Health===
Shields has mild dyslexia, &quot;mild to extreme&quot; tinnitus, and tendonitis in his left hand. He contracted tinnitus during the mixing of &quot;Loveless&quot; in 1991. Though initially worried about the condition, Shields has said he has &quot;come to treat the tinnitus as a friend. It filters unwanted sounds and actually protects my ears. It becomes your first line of defence against audible stress.&quot; He said his tendonitis, which he has had since 1988, is relieved &quot;once you start to immerse yourself in the sound, any discomfort just disappears.&quot;

===Views on music industry===
Shields has been outspoken about the corporate influence in the music industry. He has said that Sony Music Entertainment, upon inheriting My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records, deliberately hid the master tapes of the band&#x27;s original recordings in an attempt to delay the release of &quot;EP&#x27;s 1988–1991&quot; (2012). Shields threatened to involve Scotland Yard in the dispute and then said the tapes &quot;magically, suddenly reappear[ed].&quot; He has since called for reorganisation of the record industry, which he has referred to as &quot;psychopathic&quot;. As a result, My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s third album, &quot;m b v&quot; (2013), was self-released. Reflecting on his decision, Shields said it was &quot;great to release the record without any industry interaction at all, but it also meant that it was a bit too expensive to buy, so we&#x27;re going to try to make it cheaper by working with various record companies in the future,&quot; though ruling out agreements with major labels. In 2013, following the release of &quot;m b v&quot;, he accused the organisers of the Mercury Prize of &quot;banning&quot; the album for the nominated shortlist. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Shields said My Bloody Valentine were &quot;banned by [the Mercury Prize]&quot; due to not having a major digital distribution deal in the United Kingdom. He added &quot;because we&#x27;re not on Amazon or iTunes ...it&#x27;s not a real record. Our album&#x27;s not a real album because it&#x27;s independent. The corporateness has got to such a point where we&#x27;ve essentially been told that we don&#x27;t exist.&quot;

===Relationships and family===

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Shields and Bilinda Butcher were in a relationship. His brother Jimi was a founding member and drummer of the indie rock band Rollerskate Skinny, who has since formed Wounded Knees and become co-director of TTT (thirtythreetrees), a Dublin landscape design practice. His sister Ann Marie has worked extensively in the music industry and has managed tours for both My Bloody Valentine and Rollerskate Skinny, as well as being credited for coordination on &quot;Loveless&quot;. His youngest sister, Eileen, is a shoe designer who has designed for Bono, Drew Barrymore and PJ Harvey.

<text>A partners desk, partner&#x27;s desk or partners&#x27; desk (also known as a double desk) is a mostly historical form of desk, a large pedestal desk designed and constructed for two users working while facing each other. The defining features of a partner&#x27;s desk are a deep top and two sets of drawers, one at each end of the pedestal.

The design evolved from 18th-century library writing tables with drawers on two or more sides.

<text>[[Lebanon]] has hundreds of registered political parties. After 2005, when the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri precipitated the Cedar Revolution, the political landscape became polarized between two rival alliances, the March 8 Alliance and the March 14 Alliance. Both names refer to dates of mass demonstrations during the revolution. 

The March 8 Alliance was supportive of continued Syrian intervention in Lebanon, and includes Hezbollah, the Amal Movement (both majority Shia), and the Free Patriotic Movement (majority Christian). The March 14 Alliance contained parties who advocated for the end of Syrian involvement. Major partners include the Future Movement (majority Sunni), the Lebanese Forces, and Ketaeb (both majority Christian). This alliance dissolved in 2016, and the Future Movement withdrew from the 2022 election, but the remaining partners have maintained their opposition to Hezbollah. 

The Progressive Socialist Party, the main representative of the Druze community, has supported both blocs at different points. 

After the Revolution of 17 October 2019, a series of large-scale protests against the country&#x27;s economic situation and political elites, a third bloc has emerged, of non-sectarian groups advocating for wide-scale reform. These groups first gained parliamentary representation in the 2022 elections.
The following list places political parties within the two major alliances. Although most parties maintain that they are secular, the major political parties in Lebanon are loosely representative of a certain faith community.

<text>An erotic dance is a dance that provides erotic entertainment with the objective to erotically stimulate or sexually arouse viewers. Erotic dance is one of several major dance categories based on purpose, such as ceremonial, competitive, performance and social dance.

The erotic dancer&#x27;s clothing is often minimal and may be gradually removed to be partially or completely naked. In some areas of the United States where exposure of nipples or genitals is illegal, a dancer may respectively wear pasties or a g-string to stay within the law.

Nudity, though a common feature, is not a requirement of erotic dance. The culture and the ability of the human body is a significant aesthetic component in many dance styles.

<text>This article lists political parties in Liberia. 
Liberia has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. Membership in parties tends to be fluid, as the party leader at the time holds significant influence over the ideology the party follows. As such, switching parties is more common than in other countries.
==Represented parties==
==Unrepresented parties==
*All Liberia Coalition Party
*Grassroots Development Movement
*Liberia National Union
*Liberia Transformation Party
*Liberian People&#x27;s Party

<text>A factorial prime is a prime number that is one less or one more than a factorial (all factorials greater than 1 are even).

The first 10 factorial primes (for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14) are :
:2 (0! + 1 or 1! + 1), 3 (2! + 1), 5 (3! − 1), 7 (3! + 1), 23 (4! − 1), 719 (6! − 1), 5039 (7! − 1), 39916801 (11! + 1), 479001599 (12! − 1), 87178291199 (14! − 1), ...

&quot;n&quot;! − 1 is prime for :
:&quot;n&quot; = 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 30, 32, 33, 38, 94, 166, 324, 379, 469, 546, 974, 1963, 3507, 3610, 6917, 21480, 34790, 94550, 103040, 147855, 208003, 632760, ... (resulting in 28 factorial primes)

&quot;n&quot;! + 1 is prime for :
:&quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, 11, 27, 37, 41, 73, 77, 116, 154, 320, 340, 399, 427, 872, 1477, 6380, 26951, 110059, 150209, 288465, 308084, 422429, ... (resulting in 24 factorial primes - the prime 2 is repeated)

No other factorial primes are known .

When both &quot;n&quot;! + 1 and &quot;n&quot;! − 1 are composite, there must be at least 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 consecutive composite numbers around &quot;n&quot;!, since besides &quot;n&quot;! ± 1 and &quot;n&quot;! itself, also, each number of form &quot;n&quot;! ± &quot;k&quot; is divisible by &quot;k&quot; for 2 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. However, the necessary length of this gap is asymptotically smaller than the average composite run for integers of similar size (see prime gap).

Liechtenstein has a two-party system where the two largest political parties—the Patriotic Union (VU) and the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party (FBP)— dominate politics within the Landtag of Liechtenstein, frequently in coalition. There are currently two minor parties forming the opposition in the Landtag, Democrats for Liechtenstein (DpL) and the Free List (FL), and one minor party not represented in the Landtag, The Independents (DU).

<text>Grove is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Slapton, Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the border with Bedfordshire, just to the north of Mentmore. It is the size of some hamlets, but it is distinct as a village because it had its own parish church. The place name is fairly self-explanatory, as it means &#x27;grove&#x27;, or a copse of trees. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Grova&quot;, and was considered a separate village even then. In 1961 the parish had a population of 12. On 1 April 1982 the parish was abolished and merged with Slapton.

In medieval times there was an abbey or priory of nuns in the parish, founded in 1169 by Henry II and attached to Fontevrault Abbey in France. Following the wars with France it was given to the dean and Canons of Windsor. The remains of this abbey were fully excavated in the late 1960s just before they were lost forever in connection with the sand-quarrying industry of Leighton Buzzard. It has been suggested that before this Grove may once have been an important place of worship in even more ancient times, thus leading to its establishment as a separate parish. The parish church was dedicated to St. Michael, the dragon slayer.

There was also in addition to the priory, a house of Cistercian monks, subordinate to Woburn Abbey.

Immediately adjoining Grove was the lost hamlet known as South Waddon, today this remains only as the name of a nearby farm; however earth workings in the area suggest a substantial settlement if not fortifications.

Grove Church was converted into a small private house in the late 1970s. The area that has become the sitting room of the house has the macabre feature of a Medieval human skeleton buried under a glass panel. The skull is surrounded in turn by the skeletons of small birds, thought to have been put there to ward off evil spirits. Part of the churchyard containing the newest graves was retained by the church authorities, following their controversial decision to sell the church. It remains today but is closed for further burials.

A large farmhouse dominating the village, was during the early 1960s turned into a Victorian gothic mansion complete with clock tower when it was the property of the Shand-Kydd family. The house overlooks and indeed is a landmark for the boats on The Grand Union Canal which actually flows through the centre of the village. A former lock-keeper&#x27;s cottage at nearby Grove Lock was in 2001 converted into a public house and restaurant.

<doc id="409305" wikidata="Q289364" url="?curid=409305" title="Rachel Kempson">
<text>Rachel, Lady Redgrave (28 May 1910 – 24 May 2003), known primarily by her birth name Rachel Kempson, was an English actress. She married Sir Michael Redgrave, and was the matriarch of the famous acting dynasty.

== Early life ==
Kempson was born in Dartmouth, Devon, the daughter of Beatrice Hamilton (née Ashwell) and Eric William Edward Kempson, who became headmaster of the Royal Naval College.

==Career==
Kempson trained at RADA before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company. She married Michael Redgrave in 1935 and the couple appeared together many times on stage. She also appeared many times on film and television, most notably in the films &quot;The Captive Heart&quot;, &quot;The Sea Shall Not Have Them&quot; (both opposite her husband Michael), &quot;The Jokers&quot;, &quot;Two Gentlemen Sharing&quot;, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;; and the television series &quot;Tales of Unease&quot;, (&#x27;It&#x27;s too Late Now&#x27;, episode, 1970), &quot;&quot; (1974) , and &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;. She made three films with her daughter Lynn (&quot;Tom Jones&quot;, &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; and &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot;), and two films with her other daughter Vanessa (&quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; – which also starred her son Corin – and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;). Her 1986 autobiography, &quot;Life Among the Redgraves&quot; was published by Dutton. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Lady Redgrave writes with candour, wit, restraint and some sadness about her background, beginnings in the theatre in 1932, marriage and motherhood, the trials of moving and the problems of being married to a handsome matinee idol.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Kempson married fellow actor Michael Redgrave in 1935, and became the daughter-in-law of Roy Redgrave and Margaret Scudamore. Kempson was the mother of Vanessa (born 1937), Corin (1939–2010) and Lynn Redgrave (1943–2010) and the grandmother of Joely and Natasha Richardson (1963–2009), Jemma Redgrave, Luke Redgrave, Arden Redgrave, Harvey Redgrave, Carlo Gabriel Nero, Benjamin B. Clark, Kelly B. Clark and Annabel Lucy Clark.

In 1959, her husband was knighted and she formally became Lady Redgrave. However, she refused to use her title professionally. In 2003, four days before what would have been her 93rd birthday, she died of a stroke at the home of her granddaughter, Natasha Richardson, in Millbrook, New York. Richardson died on 18 March 2009 in a skiing accident and was buried near Kempson. Kempson&#x27;s youngest daughter, Lynn Redgrave, was buried in the same cemetery on 8 May 2010, near Kempson and Richardson.

<doc id="409309" wikidata="Q721237" url="?curid=409309" title="Alcohol by volume">
<text>Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as alc/vol or ABV) is a standard measure of the volume of alcohol contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage, expressed as a volume percent. It is defined as the number of millilitres (mL) of pure ethanol present in of solution at . The number of millilitres of pure ethanol is the mass of the ethanol divided by its density at , which is . The alc/vol standard is used worldwide. The International Organization of Legal Metrology has tables of density of water–ethanol mixtures at different concentrations and temperatures.

In some countries, e.g. France, alcohol by volume is often referred to as degrees Gay-Lussac (after the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac), although there is a slight difference since the Gay-Lussac convention uses the International Standard Atmosphere value for temperature, .

==Volume change==

Mixing two solutions of alcohol of different strengths usually causes a change in volume. Mixing pure water with a solution less than 24% by mass causes a slight increase in total volume, whereas the mixing of two solutions above 24% causes a decrease in volume. The phenomenon of volume changes due to mixing dissimilar solutions is called &quot;partial molar volume&quot;. Water and ethanol are both polar solvents. When water is added to ethanol, the smaller water molecules are attracted to the ethanol&#x27;s hydroxyl group, and each molecule alters the polarity field of the other. The attraction allows closer spacing between molecules than is usually found in non-polar mixtures.

Thus, alc/vol is not the same as volume fraction expressed as a percentage. Volume fraction, which is widely used in chemistry (commonly denoted as v/v), is defined as the volume of a particular component divided by the sum of all components in the mixture when they are measured separately. For example, to make 100 mL of 50% alc/vol ethanol solution, water would be added to 50 mL of ethanol to make up exactly 100 mL. Whereas to make a 50% v/v ethanol solution, 50 mL of ethanol and 50 mL of water could be mixed but the resulting volume of solution will measure less than 100 mL due to the change of volume on mixing, and will contain a higher concentration of ethanol. The difference is not large, with the maximum difference being less than 2.5%, and less than 0.5% difference for concentrations under 20%.

== Threshold levels ==
=== Legal thresholds ===
Some drinks have requirements of alcoholic content in order to be certified as a certain alcohol brand or label.

Low-alcohol beers (&lt;0.5) are considered in some countries such as Iran as permitted (or &quot;halal&quot; under Muslim vocabulary) despite alcohol being banned. However, the level of alcohol-free beers is typically the lowest commercially sold 0.05.

=== Biological thresholds ===
It is near impossible for a healthy person to become intoxicated drinking low-alcohol drinks. The low concentration severely limits the rate of intake, which is easily dispatched by human metabolism. Quickly drinking 1.5 L of 0.4% alc/vol beer in an hour resulted in a maximum of 0.0056% BAC in a study of German volunteers. Healthy human kidneys can only excrete 0.8–1.0 L of water per hour, making water intoxication likely to set in before any alcoholic intoxication.

The process of ethanol fermentation will slow down and eventually come to a halt as the alcohol produced becomes too concentrated for the yeast to tolerate, defining an upper limit of alc/vol for non-distilled alcoholic drinks. The typical tolerance for beer yeasts is at 8–12%, while wine yeasts typically range from 14–18%, with speciality ones reaching 20% alc/vol. Any higher would require distillation, producing liquor.

== Typical levels ==
Details about typical amounts of alcohol contained in various beverages can be found in the articles about them.

==Practical estimation of alcohol content==
During the production of wine and beer, yeast is added to a sugary solution. During fermentation, the yeasts consume the sugars and produce alcohol. The density of sugar in water is greater than the density of alcohol in water. A hydrometer is used to measure the change in specific gravity (SG) of the solution before and after fermentation. The volume of alcohol in the solution can then be estimated. There are a number of empirical formulae which brewers and winemakers use to estimate the alcohol content of the liquor made.

Specific gravity is the density of a liquid relative to that of water, i.e., if the density of the liquid is 1.05 times that of water, it has a specific gravity of 1.05. In UK brewing usage, it is customary to regard the reference value for water to be 1000, so the specific gravity of the same example beer would be quoted as 1050. The formulas here assume that the former definition is used for specific gravity.

=== General ===

During ethanol fermentation the yeast converts one mole of sugar into two moles of alcohol. A general formula for calculating the resulting alcohol concentration by volume can be written:

:formula_1

where SBV fermented is sugar by volume (g/dL) converted to alcohol during fermentation and GECF is the glucose-ethanol conversion factor:

:formula_2

where 46.069 is the molar mass of ethanol and 180.156 is the molar mass of glucose and fructose.

:formula_3
:formula_4

Sugar by volume can be calculated from Brix (sugar by weight) and SG (relative density):

:formula_5

SG can be measured using an hydrometer and Brix can be calculated from SG. A simple formula for calculating Brix from SG is (SG 1.000 - 1.179):

:formula_6

By substituting Brix in the SBV formula above, we get a formula for calculating SBV from SG only:

:formula_7

By further substitution, we get a formula for calculating ABV from SG only:

:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10

The factor 135 is most accurate in the center of the SG drop range of 0.000 to 0.179. Since the correlation of SG and Brix is non-linear it is common to divide the range to increase accuracy when using the simple ABV formula:

:formula_11

=== Advanced ===

Advanced formula derived from Carl Balling empirical formulas. The formula compensates for changes in SG with changes in alcohol concentration and for the fact that not all sugar is converted into alcohol. All values are measured at 20 degree C.

formula_12

where SG final is the specific gravity when fermentation ends, Plato start is the sugar by weight when fermentation begins, Plato final is the sugar by weight when fermentation ends. Brix can be used instead of Plato as they are nearly identical.

=== Wine ===
The simplest method for wine has been described by English author Cyril Berry:

formula_13

===Beer===

One calculation for beer is:

formula_14

For higher ABV above 6% many brewers use this formula:

formula_15

==Other methods of specifying alcohol content==

===Alcohol proof ===

Another way of specifying the amount of alcohol content is alcohol &quot;proof&quot;, which in the United States is twice the alcohol-by-volume (alc/vol) number. This may lead to confusion over similar products bought in varying regions that have different names on country-specific labels. For example, Stroh rum that is 80% ABV is advertised and labeled as &quot;Stroh 80&quot; when sold in Europe, but is named &quot;Stroh 160&quot; when sold in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, proof is 1.75 times the number (expressed as a percentage). For example, 40% alc/vol is 80 proof in the US and 70 proof in the UK. However, since 1980, alcohol proof in the UK has been replaced by alc/vol as a measure of alcohol content, avoiding confusion between the UK and US proof standards.

===Alcohol by weight===
In the United States, Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee regulate and tax alcoholic beverages according to alcohol by weight (ABW), expressed as a percentage of total mass. The alc/vol value of a beverage is always higher than the ABW.

Because ABW measures the proportion of the drink&#x27;s mass which is alcohol, while alc/vol is the proportion of the drink&#x27;s volume which is alcohol, the two values are in the same proportion as the drink&#x27;s density is with the density of alcohol. Therefore, one can use the following equation to convert between ABV and ABW:

formula_16

At relatively low alc/vol, the alcohol percentage by weight is about 4/5 of the alc/vol (e.g., 3.2% ABW is about 4% alc/vol). However, because of the miscibility of alcohol and water, the conversion factor is not constant but rather depends upon the concentration of alcohol.

<text>Brian James (born Brian Robertson, 18 February 1955) is an English punk rock guitarist, who is best known for being a founding member of The Damned as well as of The Lords of the New Church.

== Biography ==
He began his musical career playing in several proto-punk bands including London SS and The Subterraneans, in addition to glam rock band Bastard. James moved on to The Damned, writing almost all the material on their first two albums (&quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; and &quot;Music for Pleasure&quot;) before leaving at the end of 1977. 

In the following years James formed the short-lived Tanz Der Youth together with Andy Colqhoun on bass, Hawkwind and Chicken Shack&#x27;s Alan Powell on drums and Tony Moore ( previously of Iron Maiden ) on keyboards. They toured with Black Sabbath on the Never Say Die! Tour (Black Sabbath) and released the single &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; / &quot;Delay&quot; in 1978. James then played in Iggy Pop&#x27;s solo touring band (1979) and recorded his first two solo singles, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; (1979) and &quot;Why? Why? Why?&quot; (1982), both with Stewart Copeland on drums. He also guested on proto punk forerunners The Saints&#x27; 1982 album, &quot;Out in the Jungle&quot;.

He would later co-found and play in The Lords of the New Church with Stiv Bators. The band recorded three studio albums and one EP, along with several live albums, from 1982 until their break-up in 1989.

James reunited with The Damned for two shows at The London Town and Country Club UK ( now renamed O2 Forum Kentish Town ) in June 1988 .

Over a decade after his first solo single, he used the time without a band to record his eponymous solo debut album for the New Rose label in 1990. It featured long-time collaborators Malcolm Mortimore on drums and Alan Lee Shaw on bass.

From 1992 to 1996, James then played guitar with the Brussels-based band the Dripping Lips. In 1992 he was invited by Scottish vocalist Robbie Kelman to co-write the soundtrack for the film Abracadabra, directed by Harry Cleven. The subsequent soundtrack album, produced by Kelman, was released in Benelux by EMI/INDISC. The band was composed by Robbie Kelman on vocals, James on guitar, Alan Lee Shaw on bass and Paul Zahl (ex-Flamin&#x27; Groovies) on drums. Kelman brought in his friend and record producer Jimmy Miller to helm their second album, &quot;Ready to Crack&quot;. Shaw had moved on to play guitar in The Damned, and Nico Mansy replaced him on bass.

In 2001 James recorded the album &quot;Mad for the Racket&quot; with MC5&#x27;s Wayne Kramer (guitar), Duff McKagan (bass), Stewart Copeland and Clem Burke (drums) as Racketeers. Following that, James, together with Dave Tregunna, reformed The Lords of the New Church in 2002–2003 with vocalist Adam Becvare. The lineup recorded the ten-song unreleased CD &quot;Hang On&quot; and toured Europe in spring of that year.

When this incarnation of the Lords was over and done, Brian formed another solo outfit: &quot;The Brian James Gang&quot;. With Brian James on vocals and guitar, the remaining rhythm section of Dave Tregunna (bass) and Steve Murray (drums), the band was completed by Austen Gayton as additional guitarist. Within a year they released the Single &quot;New Rose 2006&quot; and a self-titled full length album.

In 2012 he released a solo acoustic album &quot;Chateau Brian&quot; with former Lords of the New Church touring keyboard player Mark Taylor. In 2013 he revisited the material he played in his Damned years, both live by performing throughout the UK with Damned bandmate Rat Scabies and by re-recording nine Damned songs for his third solo album, &quot;Damned If I Do&quot;. 2015 saw the release of a new studio album, &quot;The Guitar That Dripped Blood&quot;, which featured guest appearances from Cheetah Chrome and Adam Becvare.

October 2022 saw James reunite with Scabies, Sensible and Vanian for five Damned Shows in the UK.

<text>Henri Charrière (; 16 November 1906  – 29 July 1973) was a French writer, convicted of murder in 1931 by the French courts and pardoned in 1970. He wrote the 1969 novel &quot;Papillon&quot;, a memoir of his incarceration in and escape from a penal colony in French Guiana. While Charrière claimed that &quot;Papillon&quot; was largely true, modern researchers believe that much of the book’s material came from other inmates, rather than Charrière himself. Charrière denied committing the murder, although he freely admitted to having committed various other petty crimes (notably when he was a procurer) prior to his incarceration.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Charrière was born on 16 November 1906 at Saint-Étienne-de-Lugdarès, Ardèche, France. He had two older sisters. His mother died when he was ten. In 1923 at seventeen, he enlisted in the French Navy and served for two years. After that, he became a member of the Paris underworld. He later married and had a daughter.

===Imprisonment===

The version of his life presented in his semi-biographical novel, &quot;Papillon&quot;, claimed that Charrière was convicted on 26 October 1931 of the murder of a pimp named Roland Le Petit, a charge that he strongly denied. He was sentenced to life in prison and ten years of hard labour. He had married Georgette Fourel at the town hall of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, on December 22, 1929. (They divorced on 8 July 1930 by decision of the Paris High Court.) After a brief imprisonment at the transit prison of Beaulieu in Caen, France, he was transported in 1933 to the prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni on the Maroni River, in the penal settlement of mainland French Guiana.

According to the book, he made his first escape on 28 November 1933 and was joined by fellow prisoners André Maturette and Joanes Clousiot, who would accompany him throughout much of his time on the run. 37 days later, the trio were captured by Colombian police near the village of Riohacha, northern Caribbean Region of Colombia, and were imprisoned. Charrière subsequently escaped during a rainy night and fled to the La Guajira Peninsula, where he was adopted by an indigenous tribe. He spent several months living with the natives, but felt that he had to move on, which was a decision he would ultimately regret. After leaving, he was quickly recaptured and sent back to French Guiana to be put into solitary confinement for the next two years.

After his release from solitary confinement, he spent another seven years in prison. During this period he attempted to escape several more times, resulting in increasingly brutal responses from his captors. He stated that he was then confined to Devil&#x27;s Island, a labour camp (Devil&#x27;s Island was not a labour camp so much as an internment camp) that, at the time, was notorious for being inescapable. French authorities later released penal colony records that contradicted this amongst other details, Charrière had never been imprisoned on Devil&#x27;s Island. However, he finally achieved his permanent liberation in 1941 by using a bag of coconuts as a makeshift raft and, riding the tide out from the island, he escaped with another convict. However, his companion drowned in quicksand when they reached the shore of French Guiana.

After meeting up with some escaped Chinese prisoners on the mainland, they bought a boat and sailed to Georgetown, British Guiana. After almost a year, a bored Charrière then joined another group of escaped convicts in a new boat with the intent of reaching British Honduras. However, after sailing into a cyclone, they only managed to reach Venezuela. They were all arrested and sent to a brutal penal settlement in El Dorado, Bolivar State. After a year of imprisonment, Charrière was released with identity papers on 3 July 1944. Five years later he was given Venezuelan citizenship.

French records of his life from 1933–1944 present a different account: He left the citadel of Saint-Martin-de-Ré on 29 September 1933 aboard the Martinière and landed on 14 October with the status of &quot;transported&quot; to Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. There was little time left in the transportation camp, as he was assigned as a nursing assistant to the André-Bouron Colonial Hospital, where he saw many inmates returning from the run who told him their escape stories, from which he drew inspiration. This place spared him from the work of logging sites or agricultural concessions that annihilated convicts in a few months. He escaped for the first time on September 5, 1934, but failed in Colombia, a country that returned escaped convicts to France. Judged by the Special Maritime Court, he spent two years in the cells of the St. Joseph&#x27;s Island Seclusion. Several times transferred, he ended up as chief nurse in an Indochinese camp on the Guyanese mainland, the Cascades forest camp, from which he escaped on the night of March 18–19, 1944, along with four companions.

===Later life===
After Charrière had served a year&#x27;s probationary freedom, he was given his total liberty in 1945. He remained in Venezuela and became a naturalized citizen. He married a Venezuelan woman identified as Rita Bensimon. He opened restaurants in Caracas and Maracaibo. He was subsequently treated as a minor celebrity, even being invited frequently to appear on local television programmes. He finally returned to France, visiting Paris in conjunction with the publication of his memoir &quot;Papillon&quot; (1969). The book sold over 1.5 million copies in France, prompting a French minister to attribute &quot;the moral decline of France&quot; to miniskirts and &quot;Papillon&quot;. &quot;Papillon&quot; was first published in the United Kingdom in 1970, in a translation by the novelist Patrick O&#x27;Brian. Charrière played the part of a jewel thief in a 1970 film called &quot;Popsy Pop&quot; directed by the French director Jean Vautrin, and released internationally in English as &quot;The Butterfly Affair&quot;. He also wrote a sequel to &quot;Papillon&quot; entitled &quot;Banco&quot;, in which he describes his life after being released from prison.

In 1970, the French justice system issued a pardon to Charrière for his 1931 murder conviction.

===Death===
On 29 July 1973, Charrière died of throat cancer in Madrid, Spain.

==Works==

He wrote two autobiographical novels in the &quot;Papillon&quot; series: &quot;Papillon&quot; (1969) and &quot;Banco&quot; (1973). 

Charrière&#x27;s best-selling book &quot;Papillon&quot;, which he said was &quot;75 percent true&quot;, details his alleged numerous escapes, attempted escapes, adventures, and recaptures, from his imprisonment in 1932 to his final escape to Venezuela. The book&#x27;s title is Charrière&#x27;s nickname, derived from a butterfly tattoo on his chest (&quot;papillon&quot; being French for butterfly). Modern researchers, however, believe that Charrière got much of his story material from other inmates, and so see the work as more of a work of fiction than a true autobiography.

In his book &quot;Les quatre vérités de Papillon&quot; ( &quot;The Four Truths of Papillon&quot;), Georges Ménager, a former &quot;Paris Match&quot; reporter, claims that Charrière was in fact a police informer and a pimp before his incarceration, and lived off the proceeds of his girlfriend&#x27;s prostitution, and that he later tried to blame her for the murder of Roland Legrande. Charrière claims to have been incarcerated in Saint Laurent and may have escaped from there, but according to French officials, he never served any time on Devil&#x27;s Island.

The book and movie both present Devil&#x27;s Island as having rocky cliffs, when, in fact, although the entire island is rocky, it gently slopes into the surrounding sea. A French justice ministry report said Charrière&#x27;s book included episodes that were imagined or involved others and &quot;should be divided by at least 10 to get near the truth&quot;.

In 2005, a 104-year-old man in Paris, Charles Brunier, claimed to be the real Papillon. He also had a butterfly tattoo, on his left arm.

Critics tend to agree that Charrière&#x27;s depictions included events that happened to others and that Brunier was at the prison at the same time. Critics claim that the heroic rescue of a guard&#x27;s young daughter from sharks, which Charrière describes graphically in his book, was in fact carried out by another convict named Alfred Steffen who lost both legs and subsequently died. When some critics questioned the veracity of his story and said he erred on some of the dates, Charrière replied: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a typewriter with me.&quot; French journalist Gerard de Villiers, author of &quot;Papillon Épinglé&quot; (&quot;Butterfly Pinned&quot;), maintains: &quot;Only about 10 percent of Charrière&#x27;s book represents the truth.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
* &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, based on novel &quot;Papillon&quot;. Charrière served as a location consultant and was portrayed by Steve McQueen, who received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.
* &quot;Papillon&quot; (2017), film directed by Michael Noer, based on novels &quot;Papillon&quot; and &quot;Banco&quot;. Charrière was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam.

<text>This article lists political parties in Madagascar.

In Madagascar, most of the constituencies elect one member of the national assembly; however, several elect two. This means that the political party with most votes may get an absolute majority in the national assembly without an absolute majority of the votes. This system makes coalition governments less likely.

<text>This article lists political parties in Malawi. Malawi has a multi-party system with over 40 registered political parties. The political process in Malawi is such that parties are voted into power. Parties participate in an electoral process. The parties with the most representation in the National Assembly are the People&#x27;s Party (PP), Malawi Congress Party (MCP), United Democratic Front (UDF), and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

==The rise of multi-party rule in Malawi ==
The Nyasaland African Congress led the anti-colonial movements in Malawi under the leadership of Kamuzu Banda. When the NAC was banned it changed its name to the Malawi Congress Party which led Malawi to independence and continued to rule from 1964 until 1994, under a one party state system. This system was challenged by political activists throughout the years, however Banda&#x27;s dictatorship suppressed opposition, creating a culture of silence.

By 1992, Chakufwa Chihana, a trade unionist, lecturer and activist, became the catalyst for a multi-party system in Malawi. He led an underground political movement that aimed at democratic multi-party rule. He was the first person to openly challenge the system. He was arrested in 1992 when he returned to Malawi and his arrest heightened both domestic and international pressure. Chihana&#x27;s freedom was supported by Amnesty International as well as the Robert F. Kennedy Association. Due to growing pressure, Banda agreed to hold a referendum to let the public decide on the issue of multi-party rule. During the 1993 referendum, Malawians voted for a multi-party system and it became legal to form political parties in Malawi. Chihana&#x27;s movement lead to the formation of his party, Alliance for Democracy (AFORD). Other prominent parties formed and emerged as well, notably the United Democratic Front which was founded by Bakili Muluzi. Malawi&#x27;s first multi-party elections were held in 1994. The MCP contested in these elections as well. The UDF under the charismatic Bakili Muluzi won these elections becoming the first party that was democratically voted into power in Malawi. Chihana&#x27;s party came third, and he was awarded the position of second Vice-President. However, Chihana has made his mark on Malawi&#x27;s history and is known as the &quot;father of democracy&quot; in Malawi. Malawi had peacefully ushered in multi-party rule which continues until today.

<text>Marye Anne Payne Fox (9 December 1947 – 9 May 2021) was an American physical organic chemist and university administrator. She was the first female chief executive of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. In April 2004, Fox was named chancellor of the University of California, San Diego. In 2010 Fox received the National Medal of Science.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Fox was born in Canton, Ohio, and received her B.S. from Notre Dame College and her PhD from Dartmouth College, both in chemistry. She held a postdoctoral appointment at the University of Maryland from 1974 to 1976. In the later year, she joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin, and in 1994 she became vice president of research there.

===Career===
A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Fox served as president of the scientific research society Sigma Xi. She earned a B.S. in chemistry from Notre Dame College in 1969 and a PhD from Dartmouth College in 1974. In 1976 she joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin, where she rose to direct the Center for Fast Kinetics Research and, in 1994, was appointed the university&#x27;s vice president for research. Even as a university administrator, she maintained an active research program in the fields of organic photochemistry and electrochemistry. In 1985, Fox was the first woman to give a plenary lecture at the National Organic Symposium.

She was appointed the twelfth chancellor of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, in August 1998, succeeding Dr. Larry K. Monteith. She was the university&#x27;s first female chief executive, serving until July 2004. During her tenure as Chancellor, the UNC system and its board of governors successfully campaigned for a taxpayer-funded bond referendum leading to a significant period of growth of the physical facilities of the campus, particularly Centennial Campus. Her tenure was also marked by controversy over excessive pay raises for members of her administration and the firing of two prominent vice provosts that led to the resignation of the provost and a formal censuring by the NC State Faculty Senate.

In June 2003, Fox played a role in the expansion of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Reached in Switzerland at a conference, she cast an unexpected and deciding &quot;no&quot; vote against Boston College in the first round of Atlantic Coast Conference expansion. Her unanticipated vote at the 11th hour resulted in months of turmoil in college sports. Miami President Donna Shalala delayed her university&#x27;s acceptance of the ACC invitation to the last possible day explaining &quot;We had numbers on Boston College-Virginia Tech. We had done numbers on Miami alone. But we had not anticipated that Virginia Tech and Miami would be the only two invitees.&quot; The ensuing delay forced the ACC to spend the 2004–5 academic year as an 11-team conference, one shy of the dozen required by the NCAA for the ACC to hold a lucrative championship football game, and resulted in Boston College playing a &quot;lame duck&quot; year in the Big East. Media reports suggested Chancellor Fox, a University of Notre Dame trustee, may have cast her vote against Boston College to provide time for the ACC to consider extending membership to the Fighting Irish.

In 2004, Fox accepted the position of Chancellor at the University of California, San Diego. In the same year, and in spite of the faculty&#x27;s censure vote, the NCSU Board of Trustees named a building after her, the Marye Anne Fox Science Teaching Laboratory. On 5 July 2011, she announced her intention to resign as Chancellor, effective June 2012, and return to her research and teaching.

Fox served as a science advisor to George W. Bush during his tenure as governor of Texas. She also served on President Bush&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and was on the short list of candidates to head the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in Bush&#x27;s presidential administration.

Fox served as a trustee on the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College from 2011 to 2013.

===Personal life===
Fox was married to chemistry professor James K. Whitesell, with whom she had five sons from their previous marriages.

Fox died at her home on May 9th, 2021 after a long illness.

<text>Matthew Stewart FRS FRSE (1717–1785) was a Scottish mathematician and minister of the Church of Scotland.

==Life==

He was born in the manse at Rothesay, on the Isle of Bute, on 15 January 1717, the son of Rev Dugald Stewart, the local minister, and his wife, Janet Bannantyne.

He was educated at Rothesay Grammar School, then entered the University of Glasgow in 1734, where he studied under the philosopher Francis Hutcheson and the mathematician Robert Simson, the latter from whom he studied ancient geometry. A close friendship developed between Simson and Stewart, in part because of their mutual admiration of Pappus of Alexandria, which resulted in many curious communications with respect to the De Locis Planis of Apollonius of Perga and the Porisms of Euclid over the years. This correspondence suggests that Stewart spent several weeks in Glasgow starting May 1743 assisting Robert Simson in the production of his &quot;Apollonii Pergaei locorum planorum libri II&quot;, which was published in 1749.

However, his father persuaded him to enter the ministry (this was a normal father-son expectation in the ministry). He studied Divinity at Edinburgh University in the year 1742/43 also attending maths lectures under Colin Maclaurin. He was licensed by the Presbytery of the Church of Scotland of Dunoon in May 1744, and became a minister at Rosneath in Dumbartonshire one year later.

In 1746, following the death of Colin Maclaurin, the chair as Professor of Mathematics became vacant at Edinburgh University and just over one year later Stewart left the ministry to become Professor of Mathematics. Publication of his best known work, &quot;Some General Theorems of Considerable use in the Higher Parts of Mathematics&quot; may have helped him secure the post. This book extended some ideas of Robert Simson and is best known for proposition II, or what is now known as Stewart&#x27;s theorem, which relates measurements on a triangle to an additional line through a vertex. Stewart also provided a solution to Kepler&#x27;s problem using geometrical methods in 1756, and a book describing planetary motion and the perturbation of one planet on another in 1761, along with a supplement on the distance between the Sun and Earth in 1763, &quot;Tracts Physical and Mathematical&quot; and &quot;The Distance of the Sun from the Earth determined by the Theory of Gravity&quot; respectively. The latter work overestimated the distance by more than 25%, for which his geometrical method received some criticism for being oversimplified.

In 1772 his health began to deteriorate and his duties as professor at Edinburgh were initially shared, then taken over by, his son Dugald Stewart, who later became a prominent Scottish philosopher. Matthew ceased teaching in 1775 but continued to play a role in Edinburgh society, most notably being a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783.

==Family==

He married Marjory Stewart, a cousin.

He was father of the philosopher Dugald Stewart.

He was the father-in-law of the physician Patrick Miller FRSE (1782-1871) and grandfather of Colonel Matthew Stewart (c.1784-1851).

==Freemasonry==
Stewart was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, on 28 November 1835. His son, the noted philosopher, Dugald Stewart was also a member of this Lodge (1775).

==Death==
He died at Catrine, Ayrshire on 23 January 1785, but was buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh. As the burial was during a period of strict regulation of stones (effectively a ban) the grave is unmarked.

<text>Tonga, by a modification of its treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom in July 1970, is responsible for its own external affairs. It maintains cordial relations with most countries and has close relations with its Pacific neighbours and the United Kingdom. In 1998, it recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China and broke relations with Taiwan.

== Diplomatic relations ==
List of countries which Tonga maintains diplomatic relations with:
==Regional relations==

Tonga maintains strong regional ties in the Pacific. It is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, the South Pacific Tourism Organisation, the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. Tonga endorsed the Treaty of Rarotonga (the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty) in 1996.

Tonga is, however, notably not one of the eight signatories of the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest which collectively controls 25–30% of the world&#x27;s tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply.

Since November 2011, Tonga has been one of the eight founding members of Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment.

==Extra-regional relations==

Tonga was admitted to full membership of the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970, upon regaining its independence from British protection.

Since it has always had its own monarch, its position in the Commonwealth was rather unusual.

Tonga is an independent native Commonwealth monarchy like Brunei, Lesotho, Malaysia, and Swaziland.
Tonga was admitted to the United Nations in 1999.

Additionally outside the region, Tonga is a member or participant of the ACP, Asian Development Bank, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the G-77, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, International Hydrographic Organization, the IMF, the International Maritime Organization, Interpol, the International Olympic Committee, the ITU, the NAM, the UPU, the World Meteorological Organization and the World Trade Organization.

==Bilateral relations==

==Commonwealth of Nations==

Tonga has been a member of the Commonwealth of Nations since 4 June 1970.

Tonga was a British protected monarchy from 1900 to 1970, when it became an independent native monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations, a status shared by Brunei, Lesotho, Malaysia, and Eswatini, which also have their own native monarchs.

==Current foreign policy==

Tonga&#x27;s foreign policy as of January 2009 has been described by Matangi Tonga as &quot;Look East&quot; – namely, as establishing closer diplomatic and economic relations with Asia (which actually lies to the north-west of the Pacific kingdom). Tonga retains cordial relations with the United States. Although it remains on good terms with the United Kingdom, the two countries do not maintain particularly close relations, and the United Kingdom closed its High Commission in Tonga in 2006. Tonga&#x27;s relations with Oceania&#x27;s regional powers, Australia and New Zealand, are very good.

== International disputes ==

In 1972, Tonga laid claim to, and invaded, the tide-washed, isolated Minerva Reefs, some 480 kilometres southwest of Nuku&#x27;olofa, to thwart efforts by a private group, Ocean Life Research Foundation, to establish an independent Republic of Minerva (now the Principality of Minerva) on the reefs and surrounding quays. In November 2005, Fiji laid a complaint with the International Seabed Authority claiming ownership of the reefs.

<text>This article lists political parties in Mauritania. 

After the Independence of the country in 1960, President Moktar Ould Daddah merged his Mauritanian Regroupment Party with other opposition parties to form the Mauritanian People&#x27;s Party (PPM), which ruled the country as the sole legal party from 1961 to 1978. Following the July 1978 coup led by Mustafa Ould Salek, the party was abolished and banned, and Mauritania&#x27;s civilian leadership was replaced with military rule until President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya established the Democratic and Social Republican Party (PRDS) in 1992. Opposition political parties were allowed, but had no real chance of gaining power. 

After the 2005 coup d&#x27;état, a transitional military junta was established, which liberalized the political arena, leading to an open and plural political system for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. The junta organized a constitutional referendum that established term limits to then organize the 2006 parliamentary election and 2007 presidential election, in which members of the junta weren&#x27;t allowed to run, to then hand power to the newly elected civilian government of Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. 

This government was couped in 2008 by General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. The National Assembly continued to meet even if its powers were restricted, and Aziz won the 2009 presidential election after forming the Union for the Republic (UPR), which became the ruling party and won an absolute majority of seats in the 2013 parliamentary election, even if the &quot;radical opposition&quot;, united in the National Front for the Defense of Democracy (FNDD) was boycotting the election. Aziz won re-election in 2014, which were also boycotted by the &quot;radical opposition&quot;. The opposition decided to run in the 2018 parliamentary election (with Mauritania then having 105 parties, most of them were disbanded by 2019) and in the 2019 presidential election since Aziz wasn&#x27;t constitutionally allowed to seek a third term. The UPR, Aziz and their allies in the soon-to-be-formed Coordination of Parties of the Majority endorsed Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, a general that also participated in the 2005 and 2008 coups and was a close figure to Aziz, in the 2019 presidential election, which Ghazouani won with 52% of the vote. He then distanced himself with Aziz, who left the UPR, and oversaw the party&#x27;s rebranding into the Equity Party (El Insaf).
