<text>Waddesdon Manor is a country house in the village of Waddesdon, in Buckinghamshire, England. Owned by the National Trust and managed by the Rothschild Foundation, it is one of the National Trust&#x27;s most visited properties, with over 463,000 visitors in 2019.

The Grade I listed house was built in a mostly Neo-Renaissance style, copying individual features of several French châteaux, between 1874 and 1889 for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839–1898) as a weekend residence for entertaining and to house his collection of arts and antiquities. As the manor and estate have passed through three generations of the Rothschild family, the contents of the house have expanded to become one of the most rare and valuable collections in the world. In 1957, James de Rothschild bequeathed the house and its contents to the National Trust, opening the house and gardens for the benefit of the general public. Unusually for a National Trust property, the family of James Rothschild, the donor, manage the house. The Rothschild Foundation, chaired by Dame Hannah Rothschild continues to invest in the property.

==History==
===1874–1898===

In 1874, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bought the Waddesdon agricultural estate from the Duke of Marlborough with money inherited from his father Anselm. Rothschild was familiar with the estate from fox hunting in the locality. At the time of purchase, the estate had no house, park or garden. The site of the future Manor House was a bare hill. Known as Lodge Hill, it had been stripped of its timber by the impoverished Duke of Marlborough prior to the sale. Over the following three years, the summit of the hill was levelled; eventually, on 18 August 1877, the foundation stone was laid.

The first house party was held in May 1880 with seven of Rothschild&#x27;s close male friends enjoying a fireworks display. When, finally, the main house was ready in 1883, Rothschild invited 20 guests to stay. Before his premature death in 1898, on weekends between May and September Rothschild was host to many important guests including the future king Edward VII. House parties usually involved 14 to 20 guests.

Guests commented on the level of luxury service provided by the 24 house staff. In 1890, Queen Victoria unusually requested to pay a visit. She was impressed with the beauty of the house and grounds as well as Rothschild&#x27;s ability to quietly manage the day&#x27;s events. She was struck by the newly installed electric lights designed to look like candles in the chandeliers, and it is reported that she asked for the room to be darkened to fully witness the effect.

===1898–1957===
When Baron Ferdinand died in 1898, the house passed to his sister Alice de Rothschild. She saw Waddesdon as a memorial for her brother and was committed to preserving it. She did add significant items to the collection, particularly furniture and carpets with French royal provenances, Meissen porcelain, textiles and armour.
Following Alice de Rothschild&#x27;s death in 1922, the property and collections passed to her French great-nephew James A. &quot;Jimmy&quot; de Rothschild, who was married to an English woman, Dorothy Pinto. James further enriched the Manor with objects from the collections of his late father Baron Edmond James de Rothschild of Paris.

James and Dorothy hosted a Liberal Party rally at Waddesdon in 1928, where David Lloyd George addressed the crowd. During World War II, children under the age of five were evacuated from Croydon and lived at Waddesdon Manor, the only time children lived in the house. James and Dorothy also provided asylum at Waddesdon for a group of Jewish boys from Frankfurt.

===1957–1997===

When James de Rothschild died in 1957, he bequeathed Waddesdon Manor, of grounds and its contents to the National Trust, to be preserved for posterity. Dorothy moved to nearby Eythrope and the Manor was never again used as a residence. It opened to the public in 1959, with around 27,000 visitors in the first year. Dorothy chaired the new management committee in close collaboration with the National Trust and took a very keen interest in Waddesdon for the remainder of her long life.
At Dorothy&#x27;s death, in 1989, her nephew Jacob Rothschild inherited her position and responsibilities. At his initiative, the Manor underwent a major restoration from 1990 to 1997, and the visitor attractions were enhanced, including the creation of the Waddesdon Wine Cellars.

===1997–2019===
Until his death in February 2024, Jacob Rothschild chaired the family charity handling Waddesdon&#x27;s management, the Rothschild Foundation. Waddesdon Manor operates as an independent organisation within the National Trust.

From 2004 to 2006, the Baron&#x27;s Room and Green Boudoir were restored to reflect Baron Ferdinand&#x27;s original arrangements. In 2003 a burglary was committed involving the Johnson Gang, when approximately 100 gold snuff boxes and other items were stolen from the collection prompting the installation of new security measures. In 2021 one small sweet-box from this theft was identified at auction and returned to Waddesdon.

Since 2004, there has been an exhibitions programme. Notable exhibitions include the Lod Mosaic in 2014. Waddesdon was one venue celebrating the work of Henry Moore in 2015 and Eliot Hodgkin in 2019.

New works of art have been acquired by the Rothschild Foundation to complement the existing collections at Waddesdon, such as &quot;Le Faiseur de Châteaux de Cartes&quot; by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, added in 2007.

There has also been a programme of engagement with contemporary artists, beginning with Angus Fairhurst represented by Arnolfini in 2009. Works have been sited near the Manor and on the wider estate including by Richard Long, Sarah Lucas. In 2012, Christie&#x27;s chose the Manor to exhibit sculptures by leading contemporary artists.

Between 2013 and 2017, Bruce Munro had a residency at Waddesdon Manor, beginning with the music and light piece &quot;Cantus Arcticus&quot; in the Coach House Gallery in 2013. &quot;Winter Light&quot; (2013), with its distinctive wigwam-type structures sited in the gardens of the Manor, was Munro&#x27;s first solo exhibition of his large-scale pieces; &quot;Winter Light&quot; returned in 2016–2017. In 2014, Munro developed his pod-like structures, adding elements of language in &quot;Snow Code&quot;, shown in the Manor. In &quot;...---...SOS&quot;, Munro&#x27;s winter exhibition of 2015–2016, tents were lit up in tune with sound, in response to images of disaster relief.
In 2012, Edmund de Waal exhibited work in the Manor, creating a dialogue between his work and the historical interiors. In 2015, artist Joana Vasconcelos was commissioned to install two sculptures entitled &quot;Lafite&quot; in front of the Manor. In 2016, Kate Malone exhibited a collection of new work inspired by the people, gardens, collections, and archive. Two portrait pots of Baron Ferdinand and Alice de Rothschild by Malone remain on display at the Manor.

==Architecture==
Prior to the construction of Waddesdon Manor, no house existed on the site. Ferdinand de Rothschild wanted a house in the style of the great Renaissance châteaux of the Loire Valley. Ferdinand chose as his architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur. Destailleur was already experienced in working in this style, having overseen the restoration of many châteaux in that region, in particular that of the Château de Mouchy.
Through Destailleur&#x27;s vision, Waddesdon embodied an eclectic style based on the châteaux so admired by his patron, Baron Ferdinand. The towers at Waddesdon were based on those of the Château de Maintenon, and the twin staircase towers, on the north facade, were inspired by the staircase tower at the Château de Chambord. However, following the theme of unparalleled luxury at Waddesdon, the windows of the towers at Waddesdon were glazed, unlike those of the staircase at Chambord. They are also far more ornate.

The structural design of Waddesdon was not entirely retrospective. Hidden from view were the most modern innovations of the late 19th century including a steel frame, which took the strain of walls on the upper floors, and which consequently permitted the layout of these floors to differ completely from the lower floors. The house also had hot and cold running water in its bathrooms, central heating, and an electric bell system to summon the numerous servants. The building contractor was Edward Conder &amp; Son.

After the Manor was completed in 1883, Ferdinand quickly decided it was too small, as his architect had prophesied. The Bachelors&#x27; Wing to the east was extended after 1885 and the Morning Room, built in late-Gothic style, was added to the west after 1888. The stables to the west of the Manor were built in 1884. Ferdinand and his stud groom devised the plan, working with Conder. Destailleur designed the façades in a French 17th-century style.

===Wine Cellars===

The Wine Cellars in the Manor were created during the Centenary Restoration and opened in 1994. They are modelled on the private cellars at Château Lafite Rothschild. More than 15,000 bottles are stored in the Cellars, some 150 years old, the majority from the Château Lafite Rothschild and Château Mouton Rothschild estates. It is the largest private collection of Rothschild wines in the world. There are also wine labels designed by artists such as Salvador Dalí and Andy Warhol.

==Collections==

Once his château was complete, Baron Ferdinand installed his extensive collections of English 18th-century portraits by artists like Gainsborough and Reynolds, as well as French 18th-century boiseries, Savonnerie carpets, Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries, furniture, Sèvres ceramics, books, Dutch paintings and Renaissance treasures. 
Works were acquired for their exquisite quality and fine provenance, particularly those belonging to French royalty of the Ancien Régime. One of the highlights of the collection is the extraordinary musical automaton elephant, dating from 1774 and made by the French clockmaker H Martinet.
Of the ten surviving examples of the Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship from the 1760s, three are at Waddesdon, including one with a very rare scene of a battle connected to the Seven Years&#x27; War.
In the 1890s, Baron Ferdinand focused on the Renaissance collection for his small museum in the New Smoking Room. This collection was bequeathed to the British Museum and is now known as the Waddesdon Bequest.

The interior of Waddesdon Manor was photographed in 1897 for Baron Ferdinand&#x27;s privately published &quot;The Red Book&quot;.

Subsequent members of the family added noted collections of paintings, Limoges enamel, arms and armour, maiolica, manuscripts, prints and drawings.

Waddesdon&#x27;s internationally famous collection has thus been formed principally by four members of the Rothschild family: Baron Ferdinand (1839–1898), his sister Alice de Rothschild (1847–1922), their cousin Edmond James de Rothschild (1845–1934) and Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild (1936–2024).

==Gardens==
Baron Ferdinand wanted a garden to entertain his guests during his weekend house parties. To make the gardens, extensive landscaping of the hill was carried out, including leveling the top of the hill. The gardens and landscape park were laid out by the French landscape architect Elie Lainé. An attempt was made to transplant full-grown trees by chloroforming their roots, to limit the shock. While this novel idea was unsuccessful, many very large trees were successfully transplanted. Elaborate flower beds were planted, centred on the south Parterre. Several artificial rock formations were created by James Pulham, including to house mountain goats and llamas, part of Ferdinand&#x27;s zoo. Altogether, the creation of his garden cost £153,000, which (in terms of average wages then and in 2015) equates to £68.8 million.

After her brother&#x27;s death Alice brought the care she had taken with her garden at Eythrope to Waddesdon. Alice was a keen gardener with a good understanding of flowers and plants; she would often walk around and weed the paths. With her head gardener, George Frederick Johnson who worked at Waddesdon from 1905 to 1954, Alice grew flowers for competition. Alice was responsible for introducing three-dimensional bedding in the shape of a bird, recreated in the gardens today.

Under James, the gardens were less impressive. The South Parterre was grassed over in the 1930s. It was replanted with flowers for the opening of the house under the National Trust in 1959.

As part of the 1990s restoration, Beth Rothschild led a team reintroducing Ferdinand&#x27;s colour scheme of trees, shrubs and bedding plants. The carpet bedding is now designed on computer allowing the schemes to be quickly installed. The patterns change each year to reflect different themes.

The gardens are listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===Garden trees===
Though the trees are not of a great age there are many specimens of deciduous and coniferous trees that have now reached maturity creating the desired effect in the Waddesdon landscape. Some of these trees were planted in the 1870s and responsibility for this fell to William Barron whose job it was to transplant trees from the surrounding countryside to give the grounds of Waddesdon a sense of maturity, creating vistas and focal points under the instructions from Elie Lainé.
Deciduous trees were selected on their form, flowering and array of autumnal colour. Conifers were selected for their evergreen nature, cones and berries. Today many species such as chestnuts, limes and maples as well as yew, cedars and redwoods can be seen.
From Baron Ferdinand&#x27;s time to today, distinguished visitors have been invited to plant memorial trees. Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V and Queen Mary were early royal visitors. Charles III (as Prince of Wales) and Prime Ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair have also planted trees.

===Garden sculptures===
Baron Ferdinand acquired many fine statues and fountains to add interest to the gardens. A notable feature is his love of 18th-century Italian pieces. The fountains to the north and south of the house include sculptures of Pluto, Proserpina, tritons and nereids originally made by Giuliano Mozani around 1720 for the Ducal Palace of Colorno. A bust of the muse Erato has been recently attributed to Filippo Parodi.

A fine example of French early 18th-century sculpture is sited near the Aviary: Apollo by Jean Raon, 1699, associated with a commission at Versailles. There are also Dutch vases in the style of Albert Jansz Vinckenbrinck and sculptures by Jan van Logteren, the latter were originally displayed at Aston Clinton House.

In 2001, Stephen Cox&#x27;s tomb-like sculpture &quot;Interior Space: Terra degli Etruschi&quot; was installed at the end of the Baron&#x27;s Walk. Inscribed on a nearby marble slab are the names of the Rothschilds who built and have cared for Waddesdon.

===Aviary===
Baron Ferdinand also created a cast-iron aviary, inspired by 18th-century pavilions at the Palace of Versailles and Château de Chantilly, as well as his childhood home at Grüneburg. It was completed in 1889. Like other members of his family, such as Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, Ferdinand was also a keen animal lover. He stocked the aviary with exotic birds and enjoyed feeding them for his guests. 

The aviary&#x27;s paint and gilding were restored in 2003 and it now houses endangered species with a focus on breeding programs. It is a registered zoo.

==Estate==
In Ferdinand&#x27;s time, there was a large kitchen garden and extensive glass houses growing fruit and flowers, including Ferdinand&#x27;s beloved orchids. They were near the Dairy Water garden which has elaborate rock formations by James Pulham. As part of the day&#x27;s entertainments, Ferdinand&#x27;s guests were taken to the ornamental Dairy to taste milk from cows who wore Meissen porcelain name tags.

In recent years, commissions to contemporary architects have occurred on the wider estate. Windmill Hill Archive (2011) was designed by Stephen Marshall. Flint House (2015) was designed by Skene Catling de la Peña. It won RIBA House of the Year in 2015.

In 2012, it was announced that Waddesdon Manor would be one of the sites for Jubilee Woodlands, designated by the Woodland Trust to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

==Film and television==
Many films have been shot at Waddesdon Manor, including the &quot;Carry On&quot; film &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; (1966); &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983); &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1999); (2001), &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot; (2004); &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; (2005); &quot;The Queen&quot; (2006); &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008); &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; (2011); &quot;A Little Chaos&quot; (2014); &quot;Victor Frankenstein&quot; (2015), &quot;Our Kind of Traitor&quot; (2016); &quot;The Infiltrator&quot; (2016); &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2021); and Back In Action (2025).

Waddesdon Manor has also been used as a location for a number of television programmes. These include &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; (1985), &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2011), &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (BBC One, 2015), &quot;The Crown&quot; (2016), &quot;Endeavour&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story&quot; (2023).

<text>Waddesdon is a village in Buckinghamshire, England, west-north-west of Aylesbury on the A41 road. The village also includes the hamlets of Eythrope and Wormstone. Waddesdon was an agricultural settlement with milling, silk weaving and lace making enterprises.

==History==
The name &#x27;Waddesdon&#x27; means &#x27;hill of a man named Wott&#x27;.

The parish church of St Michael and All Angels dates from 1190 with medieval and Victorian additions.

Waddesdon was involved in the marriage of Maud Holland in the 1360s. Edward the Black Prince agreed with Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd/10th Earl of Devon that Maud would marry Devon&#x27;s grandson Hugh Courtenay. Devon promised to award Maud an annuity of 200 marks and the manors of Sutton Courtenay and in Buckinghamshire. The arrangements were approved by Pope Urban V and Edward III. The wedding had taken place by February 1365, when the manors were granted to Maud.

Between 1897 and 1936, Waddesdon had train services on the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (later part of the Metropolitan) at Waddesdon railway station, two miles from the village. There was also a halt on the Brill Tramway.

In 1874, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bought a large estate in the area and built the mansion of Waddesdon Manor on a hill-top above the village. He transformed Waddesdon into an estate village, with new houses for employees and tenants, a school, a public house, cricket pavilion and village hall.

Waddesdon Manor and grounds are now the property of the National Trust, and Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild retains the estate and a house at nearby Eythrope.

On 17 November 2017, near Waddesdon, there was a mid-air collision between an aeroplane and a helicopter, with four fatalities.

==Education==
Waddesdon Village Primary School is a mixed, community, primary school, which has approximately 200 pupils from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The village is also home to Waddesdon Church of England School, a secondary school which holds over 1000 students and staff. It has over 600 students.

==Notable residents==
* Peter Palmer (died 1621), justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), was born in Waddesdon, where his family leased the main  mansion house.
*Alice Shalvi

<text>Tina Darragh (born 1950) is an American poet who was one of the original members of the Language group of poets.

==Biography==
Darragh was born in Pittsburgh and grew up in the south suburb of McDonald, Pennsylvania. She began writing in 1968 and studied poetry in Washington, D.C. at Trinity University from 1970 to 1972. Between 1974 and 1976, she worked with Some of Us Press and at the Mass Transit community bookstore and writing workshop.

Mass Transit, and after it Folio bookshop, became focal points for much of the poetic activity that was to result in the East Coast wing of the &quot;Language&quot; group, and here Darragh met other poets, including Susan Howe, Diane Ward, Doug Lang, Joan Retallack, and P. Inman, all of whom were also to become key members of the group.

She and Inman are married and live in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Darragh&#x27;s extensive list of publications include &quot;on the corner to off the corner&quot; (1981), &quot;Striking Resemblance&quot; (Burning Deck, 1988), &quot;a(gain)2 st the odds&quot; (1989), and &quot;adv. fans - the 1968 series&quot; (1993). Her work has been included in numerous anthologies, including the important &quot;Language&quot;-oriented anthology, &quot;In the American Tree&quot; (edited by Ron Silliman). In 1998, her work was published in the anthology &quot;etruscan reader VIII&quot; (with Douglas Oliver &amp; Randolph Healy) and included selections from &quot;The Dream Rim Instructions + SEE References&quot; and &quot;fractals «—» l-in-error&quot;. Darragh has also been involved in numerous collaborative efforts with others including the recent &quot;Belladonna Elders Series No. 8: Jane Sprague / Tina Darragh / Diane Ward&quot; published by Belladonna Books in 2009.

<text>In number theory, an Euler product is an expansion of a Dirichlet series into an infinite product indexed by prime numbers. The original such product was given for the sum of all positive integers raised to a certain power as proven by Leonhard Euler. This series and its continuation to the entire complex plane would later become known as the Riemann zeta function.

==Definition==
In general, if is a bounded multiplicative function, then the Dirichlet series

:formula_1

is equal to

:formula_2

where the product is taken over prime numbers , and is the sum

:formula_3

In fact, if we consider these as formal generating functions, the existence of such a &quot;formal&quot; Euler product expansion is a necessary and sufficient condition that be multiplicative: this says exactly that is the product of the whenever factors as the product of the powers of distinct primes .

An important special case is that in which is totally multiplicative, so that is a geometric series. Then

:formula_4

as is the case for the Riemann zeta function, where , and more generally for Dirichlet characters.

==Convergence==
In practice all the important cases are such that the infinite series and infinite product expansions are absolutely convergent in some region

:formula_5

that is, in some right half-plane in the complex numbers. This already gives some information, since the infinite product, to converge, must give a non-zero value; hence the function given by the infinite series is not zero in such a half-plane.

In the theory of modular forms it is typical to have Euler products with quadratic polynomials in the denominator here. The general Langlands philosophy includes a comparable explanation of the connection of polynomials of degree , and the representation theory for .

==Examples==
The following examples will use the notation formula_6 for the set of all primes, that is:
:formula_7

The Euler product attached to the Riemann zeta function , also using the sum of the geometric series, is

:formula_8

while for the Liouville function , it is

:formula_9

Using their reciprocals, two Euler products for the Möbius function are

:formula_10

and

:formula_11

Taking the ratio of these two gives

:formula_12

Since for even values of the Riemann zeta function has an analytic expression in terms of a &quot;rational&quot; multiple of , then for even exponents, this infinite product evaluates to a rational number. For example, since , , and , then

:formula_13

and so on, with the first result known by Ramanujan. This family of infinite products is also equivalent to

:formula_14

where counts the number of distinct prime factors of , and is the number of square-free divisors.

If is a Dirichlet character of conductor , so that is totally multiplicative and only depends on , and if is not coprime to , then

:formula_15

Here it is convenient to omit the primes dividing the conductor from the product. In his notebooks, Ramanujan generalized the Euler product for the zeta function as

:formula_16

for where is the polylogarithm. For the product above is just .

==Notable constants==
Many well known constants have Euler product expansions.

The Leibniz formula for

:formula_17

can be interpreted as a Dirichlet series using the (unique) Dirichlet character modulo 4, and converted to an Euler product of superparticular ratios (fractions where numerator and denominator differ by 1):

:formula_18

where each numerator is a prime number and each denominator is the nearest multiple of 4.

*The Hardy–Littlewood twin prime constant:

<text>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) is an American non-profit medical research organization headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland with additional facilities in Ashburn, Virginia. It was founded in 1953 by Howard Hughes, an American business magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, engineer, film director, and philanthropist, known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world. It is one of the largest private funding organizations for biological and medical research in the United States. HHMI spends about $1 million per HHMI Investigator per year, which amounts to annual investment in biomedical research of about $825 million.

The institute has an endowment of $22.6 billion, making it the second-wealthiest philanthropic organization in the United States and the second-best-endowed medical research foundation in the world. HHMI is the former owner of the Hughes Aircraft Company, an American aerospace firm that was divested to various firms over time.

== History ==
The institute was formed with the goal of basic research including trying to understand, in Hughes&#x27;s words, &quot;the genesis of life itself.&quot; Despite its principles, in the early days it was generally viewed as a tax haven for Hughes&#x27;s huge personal fortune. Hughes was HHMI&#x27;s sole trustee and he transferred his stock of Hughes Aircraft to the institute, in effect turning the large defense contractor into a tax-exempt charity. For many years the Institute grappled with maintaining its non-profit status; the Internal Revenue Service challenged its &quot;charitable&quot; status which made it tax exempt. Partly in response to such claims, starting in the late 1950s it began funding 47 investigators doing research at eight different institutions; however, it remained a modest enterprise for several decades.

The institute was initially located in Miami, Florida, in 1953. Hughes&#x27;s internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 plane crash, was chairman of the institute&#x27;s medical advisory committee. By 1975, Hughes was sole trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which in turn owned all the stock of the Hughes Aircraft Company.

In 1969, United States Congressman Wright Patman &quot;complained that the Hughes foundation was a tax‐evasion device,&quot; noting that the institute spent only $5.7 million for its operations between 1954 and 1961, a period during which Hughes Aircraft accumulated $76.9 million in profits. By 1975, it had also avoided certain stipulations of the 1969 reform act for charitable institutions due to legal filings by Hughes to change its operational status, with his objections going directly to the White House.

The institute moved to Coconut Grove, Florida, in the mid-1970s and then to Bethesda, Maryland, in 1976.

In 1993, the institute moved to its headquarters in Chevy Chase, Maryland.It was not until after Hughes&#x27;s death in 1976 that the institute&#x27;s profile increased from an annual budget of $4 million in 1975 to $15 million in 1978 and prior to Hughes Aircraft sale the number had peaked to $200 million per year. At the time of the sale Hughes Aircraft employed 75,000 people and vast amounts of money from the approximate annual revenue of $6 billion were put into Hughes Aircraft internal research and development rather than the medical institute. Most of the money for the medical institute came from the operations at Ground System Group responsible for providing Air Defense Systems to NATO, Pacific Rim, and the USA. In this period it focused its mission on genetics, immunology, and molecular biology. Since Hughes died without a will as the sole trustee of the HHMI, the institute was involved in lengthy court proceedings to determine whether it would benefit from Hughes&#x27;s fortune. In April 1984, a court appointed new trustees for the institute&#x27;s holdings.

In January 1985 the trustees announced they would sell Hughes Aircraft by private sale or public stock offering. On June 5, 1985 General Motors (GM) was announced as the winner of a secretive five-month, sealed-bid auction. The purchase was completed on December 20, 1985, for an estimated $5.2 billion, $2.7 billion in cash and the rest in 50 million shares of GM Class H stock. The proceeds caused the institute to grow dramatically.

HHMI completed the building of the Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia in October 2006. It is modeled after AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Labs and the Medical Research Council&#x27;s Laboratory of Molecular Biology. With a main laboratory building nearly long, it contains of enclosed space, used primarily for research. The campus also features apartments for researchers.

In 2007, HHMI and the publisher Elsevier announced they have established an agreement to make author manuscripts of HHMI research articles published in Elsevier and Cell Press journals publicly available six months following final publication. The agreement takes effect for articles published after September 1, 2007.

In 2008, the Trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute selected Robert Tjian its new president.

In 2009, HHMI awarded fifty researchers, as part of the HHMI Early Career Scientist Competition.

In 2014, the institute created a new round of its primary award competition, for a total of $150 million in award money from 2015 to 2012. The institute is expanding the Ashburn campus in 2019.

In 2016, the HHMI Trustees selected Erin K. O&#x27;Shea, a previous Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at the institute, the new president of HHMI.

In 2022, HHMI began to require immediate open access to publications from its research.

In 2023, HHMI was sued by Vivian Cheung for disability discrimination. HHMI won the suit in Maryland State Court and Dr. Cheung appealed to the Maryland Appellate Court.

In 2025, HHMI cancelled their Inclusive Excellence 3 (IE3) program, which was a 6-year (2022-2028) $8.8 million award they had committed to the IMPACT STEM Network, which sought to enhance undergraduate science education and research.

<doc id="398553" wikidata="Q6247090" url="?curid=398553" title="John Mason School">
<text>John Mason School (JMS) is a secondary school with sixth form in the town of Abingdon-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Named after English diplomat and spy Sir John Mason, the school opened in September 1960. It shares its sixth from, JMF6 Abingdon, with Fitzharrys School, another secondary school in Abingdon. the school has an enrollment of 1002 students.

==History==
John Mason School, located on Wootton Road, opened as a grammar school in September 1960, to 69 students. The school is named after sixteenth-century intellectual, diplomat and spy Sir John Mason. He was born in Abingdon and educated at the nearby Abingdon School. Coincidentally, the first Headteacher of John Mason School, Derrick Hurd, went on to become Head at Easthampstead Park School based on the estate of which Sir John Mason was the keeper in 1548.

The school was previously in a four-way partnership of Abingdon schools known as 14:19 Abingdon. The other members were Larkmead School, Fitzharrys School and Abingdon and Witney College. The four partners shared sixth form lessons. John Mason is now part of the Abingdon Learning Trust, together with Fitzharrys School, Rush Common School, and St Michael&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, and shares its sixth form, JMF6 Abingdon, with Fitzharrys. John Mason has approximately 1002 students as of December 2024, of which 133 are part of its shared sixth form.

Sarah Brinkley, previously the deputy headteacher, became the school&#x27;s new headteacher in September 2015. On 20 April 2020, she was succeeded as headteacher by Adrian Rees, and instead became the Executive Headteacher and Director of Secondary Education at the Abingdon Learning Trust. In 2022, Brinkley left her role as Executive Headteacher, and remained the Director of Secondary Education until she resigned on 2 July 2023. Rees&#x27; departure from the school was announced in February 2023, and he officially left the school in March, being replaced by Kirsty Rogers, who was the school&#x27;s deputy head teacher and worked as acting headteacher until September, when, after eight years at the school, she left John Mason School to become headteacher at Aureus School in Didcot, and Alastair West became the new headteacher.

JMS is part of the OX14 Partnership, along with Fitzharrys School, Larkmead School, Radley College, Abingdon School, and St Helen and St Katharine. The partnership was officially launched on 19 November 2021, and allows the seven schools to coordinate opportunities, extra-curricular activities, and support with mental health.

Because of the discovery of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) in the school&#x27;s main block, John Mason School announced on 8 September 2023 that the school was to be fully closed to all students on Monday 11th, and that the school would have a reduced capacity for the rest of the week, with many students set to work from home. The United Kingdom government stated earlier in 2023 that areas where RAAC was identified should be evacuated and shut down until remedies could be put in place. The school had had multiple surveys for the material in 2022, and found no RAAC within any of the buildings. Despite this, the school stated on 8 September that it had been given &quot;further information&quot;, and that there was indeed RAAC on the site. The reduced capacity restrictions continued for another week, though with more students on site. On Friday 22nd, it was announced that, after an additional survey from a surveyor commissioned by the Department for Education, the school was to reopen to all students from Monday 25th.

===Specialist school and academy status===
The school was granted specialist school status for visual and performing arts in 2004. In 2006, JMS built and opened the 06 Gallery using funding provided after receiving its specialist status. The 06 Gallery contains much of the students&#x27; artwork.

Previously run by the Oxfordshire County Council (OCC), on 1 February 2014, John Mason School became the first school in Abingdon to convert to an academy, giving it more control over its admissions, finances, and curriculum. While now directly funded by the Department for Education, JMS continues to work with the Oxfordshire County Council for certain aspects of education.

== Abingdon Learning Trust ==

John Mason School, along with Fitzharrys School, Rush Common School, and St Michael&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, belongs to the multi-academy trust, the Abingdon Learning Trust (ALT). Formed in 2012 as the Rush Common Academy Trust, it was in 2016 it was announced that the three schools planned to join as the ALT, and officially changed their name.

==Houses==
The school has three houses, Stert, Ock, and Thames, of the colours red, green and blue respectively. The houses are named after watercourses in the town of Abingdon.

==Academic performance==
According to the Department of Education 2011 breakdown of A-level results, John Mason were the sixth best in the UK for performance in mathematics, with 38% of students getting A* grade. In 2013, then-Education Secretary Michael Gove praised John Mason as &quot;a school that, under a particularly inspirational head, is taking very very positive steps to provide students with a range of qualifications and the type of education that is relevant to the modern world.&quot;

In 2017, Ofsted reported its quality of teaching, learning and assessment, outcomes for pupils and overall effectiveness all required improvement; the second lowest grade. The school was inspected again in 2019, and was rated good in all categories, except its sixth from - which was rated outstanding, the highest grade. Ofsted returned in December 2023 and performed an ungraded inspeciton. They stated that &quot;aspects of the school’s work may not be as strong as at the time of the previous inspection&quot;, and that they would return to the school and perfom a graded inspection.

==The Welsh Farm==
The school owns a farm, generally known as the Welsh Farm, at Troedyrhiwgellifawr near the village of Pumsaint and the town of Llandovery in Wales. Students commonly undertake a four-day trip. The John Mason Association owns and runs the farm.

==Notable former staff and pupils==
Paul Mayhew-Archer (a writer on &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; and &quot;My Hero&quot;) was formerly a teacher at JMS.

Famous former pupils include West End actor and singer Oliver Tompsett, BBC and Channel 5 news presenter Katie Ledger, and Dr Mike Leahy, who presents his own TV programme &quot;Invasion of the Bodyscratchers&quot; and has appeared in many other medical programmes.

<doc id="398555" wikidata="Q6924526" url="?curid=398555" title="Mount Waverley Secondary College">
<text>Mount Waverley Secondary College is a public secondary school located in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley. The school consists of roughly 1900 students and is one of the largest in the state.
The school consists of two campuses (junior and senior) both situated on Stephensons Road in Mount Waverley. The Junior Campus holds years 7 and 8, with year levels 9 to 12 at the Senior Campus. The campuses are a short walking distance apart.

==History==
Mount Waverley Secondary College officially opened in 1964 as Mount Waverley High School with seventy-three Form 1 pupils, six teaching staff and one staff member in the office. The school&#x27;s emblem, the unicorn, represents Sir Walter Scott who authored the Waverley Novels.

The three Light Timber Construction (LTC) buildings, which were clad in orange brick, were constructed in various stages after the school&#x27;s opening. The school changed name to Mount Waverley Secondary College in the early 1990s and later occupied the site of the former Waverley North Primary School (also constructed in LTC) after that school was closed, thus forming a &quot;junior campus&quot; from the site.

Mount Waverley Secondary College (formerly Mount Waverley High School) has no association with Waverley High School which was located in Chadstone, Victoria and was permanently closed in the 1990s.

On Tuesday, 28 January 2003 (the day before the commencement of the school year), much of the Middle/Senior campus LTC buildings were destroyed by a deliberately lit fire causing an estimated $4 million in damage. Classrooms damaged in the fire included five IT classrooms, three science rooms, one fabrics room and 11 general purpose classrooms. A further two science rooms and three home economics rooms were also damaged in the fire.

All staff and students were relocated to Deakin University&#x27;s Burwood campus for three weeks immediately after the fire. The rebuilt school was officially opened in December 2004, after $5.6 million was spent on rebuilding.

== Facilities==

The senior site has a modern two-story building, which was constructed after the fire of 2003, along with a number of art buildings and portables. (Most of the Light Timber Construction buildings were demolished after the fire). The junior site consisted of 3 blocks and one school oval, all were connected with covered walkways. But in 2009 Mount Waverley Secondary College was given 10.1 million dollars from the government, allowing the build of two brand new buildings on the Junior site. The Junior Campus is now positioned as a flagship school. It has received international attention for design and learning capacity. The Junior Campus design has won the following awards:

*International CEFPI Award – Best new construction of a major facility
* Australian Chapter of the Council of Education – Award for Facilities Design
* The Project of Distinction Award by the Council of Educational Facility Planners International (CEFPI) for Best Middle School/Junior High

The Senior Campus also hosts the 200 seat Unicorn Theatre facility, two libraries, and two gymnasiums. The school once leased a school camp, from the historic trust the historic Lower Homebush State School #2258 in Avoca, Western Victoria. The school was closed in 1967, and reopened as the Lower Homebush Campus in 1996 as a school camp.

== Curriculum ==
In the Junior and Middle Schools (Years 7–8 and 9–10 respectively), the College offers a comprehensive curriculum based on the Victorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS). Students are allowed greater choice in their subjects beginning in Year 9, where they can choose their electives (which are separate from the core curriculum).

For the Senior School (Years 11–12), the students can study for their Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). The College offers a wide range of subjects from all learning areas. Students also have access to Vocational Education and Training (VET) subjects as part of their VCE program.

== Co-curriculum ==

=== Student Leadership ===
The student body is represented by Student Leadership Teams (SLT) that operate at each year level from Years 8–11. Students in Year 12 have the opportunity to become prefects or captains. Recently, Mount Waverley Secondary College&#x27;s SLT have won numerous awards, including:
* Australia&#x27;s Team Leadership Award for Students (ATLAS) from Halogen Australia 
* Department of Education and Training SRC of the Year award from the Victorian Student Representative Council (VicSRC)
* Group Action Award from the Victorian Student Representative Council (VicSRC) &quot;(second runner-up)&quot;

Every year, the College runs a school-wide production. Previous productions include &quot;Mamma Mia (2024), Chicago (2023), Matilda (2022), Seussical The Musical (2021), The Addams Family (2019), Bring It On The Musical (2018), Legally Blonde The Musical (2017), Beauty and the Beast (2016), Fame (2015), Footloose (2014), The Writer (2012), Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and &quot;Grease.&quot; Due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the College&#x27;s production of &quot;Seussical The Musical&quot; was delayed, being pushed into 2021.

=== Music ===
Year 7 students at the college have the opportunity to learn an instrument as part of the classroom music program. Instruments taught include those in the brass, woodwind and string families. Outside the classroom, students of all year levels have the opportunity to join ensembles at the College, including wind bands, big bands and string orchestras. Ensembles at the college frequently engage in inter-school festivals and competitions, including the annual Generations in Jazz competition. In 2019, the College&#x27;s Symphonic Band and Stage Band traveled to Sydney to participate in the Australian International Music Festival.

=== Sports ===
Students have the opportunity to participate in a range of inter-school sports competitions, including basketball, badminton, netball, AFL football, cross country, soccer, softball, baseball, cricket, swimming, hockey, volleyball, tennis, athletics, and table tennis. The College boasts a strong reputation in its sporting achievements, particularly within competitions between local schools. Many of the students go on to compete at a state level.

<text>Ernest Christopher Dowson (2 August 186723 February 1900) was an English poet, novelist, and short-story writer who is often associated with the Decadent movement.

==Biography==
Ernest Dowson was born in Lee, then in Kent, in 1867. His great-uncle was Alfred Domett, a Prime Minister of New Zealand. Dowson attended The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, but left in March 1888 without obtaining a degree.

In November 1888 Dowson started work at Dowson &amp; Son, his father&#x27;s dry-docking business in Limehouse, East London. He led an active social life, carousing with medical students and law pupils, visiting music halls, and taking the performers to dinner.

Dowson was a member of the Rhymers&#x27; Club, and a contributor to literary magazines such as &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; and &quot;The Savoy&quot;. He collaborated with Arthur Moore on two unsuccessful novels, worked on a novel of his own, &quot;Madame de Viole&quot;, and wrote reviews for &quot;The Critic&quot;. Later in his career Dowson became a translator of French fiction, including novels by Balzac and the Goncourt brothers, and &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; by Choderlos de Laclos.

In 1889 Dowson became infatuated with an 11-year-old girl, Adelaide &quot;Missie&quot; Foltinowicz, the daughter of a Polish restaurant-owner. In 1891 Dowson converted to Roman Catholicism and in 1893 he proposed to Foltinowicz, who was then aged 15. She rejected his proposal and later married a tailor.

In August 1894 Dowson&#x27;s father, suffering from tuberculosis, died of an overdose of Chlorodyne. In February 1895 his mother, who also had tuberculosis, hanged herself. Soon after her death Dowson&#x27;s health began to decline rapidly. Leonard Smithers gave Dowson an allowance to live in France and make translations for him. However, in 1897 Dowson returned to London to live with the Foltinowicz family.
In 1899 Robert Sherard found Dowson almost penniless in a wine bar. Sherard took him to his cottage in Catford, where Dowson spent his last six weeks.

On 23 February 1900 Dowson died in Catford at the age of 32. He was interred in the Roman Catholic section of Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries in London.

==Works==

Dowson is best remembered for three phrases from his poems:

* &quot;Days of wine and roses&quot;, from the poem &quot;Vitae Summa Brevis&quot;
* &quot;Gone with the wind&quot;, from the poem &quot;Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae&quot;
* &quot;I have been faithful ... in my fashion&quot;, from &quot;Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae&quot;

J. P. Miller called a television play &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1958) and the film of the same title was based on the play. The phrase also inspired the song &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;.

Margaret Mitchell, touched by the &quot;far away, faintly sad sound I wanted&quot; in the first line of the third stanza of &quot;Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae&quot;, chose the line as the title of her novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

&quot;Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae&quot; is also the source of the phrase &quot;I have been faithful ... in my fashion&quot;, as in the title of the film &quot;Faithful in My Fashion&quot; (1946). Cole Porter paraphrased Dowson in the song &quot;Always True to You in My Fashion&quot; in the musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;. Morrissey uses the lines, &quot;In my own strange way, / I&#x27;ve always been true to you. / In my own sick way, / I&#x27;ll always stay true to you&quot; in the song &quot;Speedway&quot; on the album &quot;Vauxhall &amp; I&quot;.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, Dowson provides the earliest recorded use of the word &quot;soccer&quot; in written language, although he spelled it &quot;socca&quot;.

Dowson&#x27;s prose works include the short stories collected as &quot;Dilemmas&quot; (1895), and the two novels &quot;A Comedy of Masks&quot; (1893) and &quot;Adrian Rome&quot; (each co-written with Arthur Moore).

&quot;Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae&quot; was first published in &quot;The Second Book of the Rhymer&#x27;s Club&quot; in 1894, and was noticed by Richard Le Gallienne in his &quot;Wanderings in Bookland&quot; column in &quot;The Idler&quot;, Volume 9.

===Books===
* &quot;A Comedy of Masks: A Novel&quot; (1893) With Arthur Moore.
* &quot;Dilemmas, Stories and Studies in Sentiment&quot; (1895)
* &quot;Verses&quot; (1896)
* &quot;The Pierrot of the Minute: A Dramatic Phantasy in One Act&quot; (1897)
* &quot;Decorations in Verse and Prose&quot; (1899)
* &quot;Adrian Rome&quot; (1899), with Arthur Moore
* &quot;Cynara: A Little Book of Verse&quot; (1907)
* &quot;Studies in Sentiment&quot; (1915)
* &quot;The Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson, with a Memoir by Arthur Symons&quot; (1919)
* &quot;Letters of Ernest Dowson&quot; (1968)
* &quot;Collected Shorter Fiction&quot; (2003)

==Legacy==

* In a letter to Leonard Smithers, Oscar Wilde wrote of the death of Dowson: &quot;Poor wounded wonderful fellow that he was, a tragic reproduction of all tragic poetry, like a symbol, or a scene. I hope bay leaves will be laid on his tomb, and rue and myrtle too, for he knew what love is.&quot;
* Arthur Moore wrote several comic novels about the young adult duo of Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Wilder and Paul Morrow. Tony is based on Dowson, while Paul is based on Moore. Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;The Eyes of Light&quot; is mentioned by E. Nesbit in her novel &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot;. 
* In a memoir included in &quot;Poems and Prose of Ernest Dowson&quot; (1919) Arthur Symons describes Dowson as &quot;a man who was undoubtedly a man of genius ... There never was a poet to whom verse came more naturally. ... He had the pure lyric gift, unweighed or unballasted by any other quality of mind or emotion.&quot;
* Frederick Delius set several of Dowson&#x27;s poems to music in his &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot; and &quot;Cynara&quot;.
* John Ireland set Dowson&#x27;s poem &quot;I Was Not Sorrowful (Spleen)&quot; from &quot;Verses&quot; (1896) in his 1912 song cycle &quot;Songs of a Wayfarer&quot;.
* T. E. Lawrence quotes from Dowson&#x27;s poem &quot;Impenitentia Ultima&quot; in &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; (Chapter 54).
* Eugene O&quot;Neill quotes from both &quot;Vitae Summa Brevis&quot; and &quot;Cynarae&quot; in his play &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1941).
* Dowson&#x27;s poem &quot;Vitae Summa Brevis&quot; a/k/a &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; is recited by the character Waldo Lydecker in the 1944 Otto Preminger-directed film noir &quot;Laura&quot; and in the UK-produced TV series &quot;The Durrells in Corfu&quot; (series 2, episode 4).
* In anticipation of the anniversary of Dowson&#x27;s birth on 2 August 2010 his grave, which had fallen derelict and been vandalised, was restored. The unveiling and memorial service were publicised in the &quot;South London Press&quot;, on BBC Radio 4 and in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and dozens of people paid tribute to the poet 110 years after his death.
* Jack London quotes from Dowson&#x27;s poem &quot;Impenitentia Ultima&quot; in &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; (Chapter XXVI).
* The lyrics of The Cure’s 2024 song “Alone” from the album “Songs of a Lost World” heavily reference Dowson’s poem “Dregs”.

<text>Villajoyosa (), in Valencian: (), meaning &quot;The Joyful Town&quot;, and officially / , is a coastal town and municipality in the south of the Valencian Community, Spain, by the Mediterranean Sea. It is the historic and administrative capital of Marina Baixa county, and is located in the province of Alicante. The town is known locally simply as .

It is the historic and administrative capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Marina Baixa and is located 32 km from the city of Alicante, in the coastal area known as Costa Blanca (&quot;White Coast&quot;). It has over three kilometers of beaches, including the &quot;Platja Centre&quot; (Central Beach), close to the town centre. The river of La Vila (incorrectly also known as Amadòrio) runs through the town.

The area is famous for its chocolate industry and tourism. One of the most popular tourist attractions is its Gothic Catholic church of the Assumption, with a Baroque altar piece. Another popular destination, the Royal Palm Casino (formerly Casino Costa Blanca), is now closed. The town&#x27;s festival of &quot;Moros i Cristians&quot;, celebrated at the end of July, was declared an International Tourist Interest Festival. Currently, this festivity commemorates a boat landing from the Berber pirates that was repelled by the population of the town.

<text>General anaesthesia (UK) or general anesthesia (US) is medically induced loss of consciousness that renders a patient unarousable even by painful stimuli. It is achieved through medications, which can be injected or inhaled, often with an analgesic and neuromuscular blocking agent. 

General anaesthesia is usually performed in an operating theatre to allow surgical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for a patient, or in an intensive care unit or emergency department to facilitate endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. Depending on the procedure, general anaesthesia may be optional or required. No matter whether the patient prefers to be unconscious or not, certain pain stimuli can lead to involuntary responses from the patient, such as movement or muscle contractions, that make the operation extremely difficult. Thus, for many procedures, general anaesthesia is necessary from a practical point of view.

The patient&#x27;s natural breathing may be inadequate during the procedure and intervention is often necessary to protect the airway.

Various drugs are used to achieve unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, loss of reflexes of the autonomic nervous system, and in some cases paralysis of skeletal muscles. The best combination of anaesthetics for a given patient and procedure is chosen by an anaesthetist or other specialist in consultation with the patient and the surgeon or practitioner performing the procedure.

== History ==

Attempts at producing general anaesthesia can be traced throughout recorded history in the writings of the ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Indians, and Chinese. During the Middle Ages, scholars made advances in the Eastern world and Europe.

The Renaissance saw advances in anatomy and surgical technique. However, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated pain, many patients chose certain death over surgery. Although there has been debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anaesthesia, scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anaesthetic techniques.

Two enormous leaps occurred in the late 19th century, which allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the germ theory of disease led to the development of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to asepsis, reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate. Concurrently, significant advances in pharmacology and physiology led to the development of general anaesthesia. On 14 November 1804, Hanaoka Seishū, a Japanese surgeon, became the first person on record to perform successful surgery using general anaesthesia.

In the 20th century, general anaesthesia&#x27;s safety and efficacy improved with routine tracheal intubation and other advanced airway management techniques. Advances in monitoring and new anaesthetic agents with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics also contributed to this trend, and standardized training programs for anaesthesiologists and nurse anaesthetists emerged.

== Purpose ==
General anaesthesia has many purposes and is routinely used in many surgical procedures. An appropriate surgical anaesthesia should include the following goals: 
# Hypnosis/Unconsciousness (loss of awareness)
# Analgesia (loss of response to pain)
# Amnesia (loss of memory)
# Immobility (loss of motor reflexes)
# Paralysis (skeletal muscle relaxation and normal muscle relaxation)

Instead of receiving continuous deep sedation, such as via benzodiazepines, dying patients may choose to be completely unconscious as they die.

== Biochemical mechanism of action ==
The biochemical mechanism of action of general anaesthetics is not fully understood. Anaesthetics have myriad sites of action and affect the central nervous system (CNS) at several levels. General anaesthesia interrupts or changes the functions of CNS components including the cerebral cortex, thalamus, reticular activating system, and spinal cord. Theories of anaesthesia identify target sites in the CNS, neural networks and arousal circuits linked with unconsciousness, and some anaesthetics can potentially activate specific sleep-active regions. 

Two non-exclusionary mechanisms include membrane-mediated and direct protein-mediated anesthesia. Potential protein-mediated molecular targets are GABAA,and NMDA glutamate receptors. General anaesthesia was thought to enhance the inhibitory transmission or to reduce the excitatory transmission of neuro signaling. Most volatile anaesthetics have been found to be a GABAA agonist, although the site of action on the receptor remains unknown. Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.

The chemical structure and properties of anaesthetics, as first noted by Meyer and Overton, suggest they could target the plasma membrane. A membrane-mediated mechanism that could account for the activation of an ion channel remained elusive until recently. A study from 2020 showed that inhaled anaesthetics (chloroform and isoflurane) could displace phospholipase D2 from ordered lipid domains in the plasma membrane, which led to the production of the signaling molecule phosphatidic acid (PA). The signaling molecule activated TWIK-related K+ channels (TREK-1), a channel involved in anaesthesia. PLDnull fruit flies were shown to resist anaesthesia. The results established a membrane mediated target for inhaled anaesthetics.

== Preoperative evaluation ==
Before a procedure, the anaesthesiologist reviews medical records, interviews the patient, and examines them to determine an appropriate anaesthetic plan and decide what combination of drugs and dosages will be needed for the patient&#x27;s comfort and safety during the procedure. A variety of non-invasive and invasive monitoring devices may be necessary to ensure a safe and effective procedure. Key factors in this evaluation are the patient&#x27;s age, gender, body mass index, medical and surgical history, current medications, exercise capacity, and fasting time. Thorough and accurate preoperative evaluation is crucial for the effective safety of the anaesthetic plan. For example, a patient who consumes significant quantities of alcohol or illicit drugs could be undermedicated during the procedure if they fail to disclose this fact, and this could lead to anaesthesia awareness or intraoperative hypertension. Commonly used medications can also interact with anaesthetics, and failure to disclose such usage can increase the risk during the operation. Inaccurate timing of last meal can also increase the risk for aspiration of food, and lead to serious complications.

An important aspect of pre-anaesthetic evaluation is an assessment of the patient&#x27;s airway, involving inspection of the mouth opening and visualisation of the soft tissues of the pharynx. The condition of teeth and location of dental crowns are checked, and neck flexibility and head extension are observed. The most commonly performed airway assessment is the Mallampati score, which evaluates the airway base on the ability to view airway structures with the mouth open and the tongue protruding. Mallampati tests alone have limited accuracy, and other evaluations are routinely performed addition to the Mallampati test including mouth opening, thyromental distance, neck range of motion, and mandibular protrusion. In a patient with suspected distorted airway anatomy, endoscopy or ultrasound is sometimes used to evaluate the airway before planning for the airway management.

== Premedication ==
Prior to administration of a general anaesthetic, the anaesthetist may administer one or more drugs that complement or improve the quality or safety of the anaesthetic or simply provide anxiolysis. Premedication also often has mild sedative effects and may reduce the amount of anaesthetic agent required during the case.

One commonly used premedication is clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. It reduces postoperative shivering, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and emergence delirium. However, a randomized controlled trial from 2021 demonstrated that clonidine is less effective at providing anxiolysis and more sedative in children of preschool age. Oral clonidine can take up to 45 minutes to take full effect, The drawbacks of clonidine include hypotension and bradycardia, but these can be advantageous in patients with hypertension and tachycardia. Another commonly used alpha-2 adrenergic agonist is dexmedetomidine, which is commonly used to provide a short term sedative effect (&lt;24 hours). Dexmedetomidine and certain atypical antipsychotic agents may be also used in uncooperative children.

Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used class of drugs for premedication. The most commonly utilized benzodiazepine is Midazolam, which is characterized by a rapid onset and short duration. Midazolam is effective in reducing preoperative anxiety, including separation anxiety in children. It also provides mild sedation, sympathicolysis, and anterograde amnesia.

Melatonin has been found to be effective as an anaesthetic premedication in both adults and children because of its hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic, and anticonvulsant properties. Recovery is more rapid after premedication with melatonin than with midazolam, and there is also a reduced incidence of post-operative agitation and delirium. Melatonin has been shown to have a similar effect in reducing perioperative anxiety in adult patients compared to benzodiazepine.

Another example of anaesthetic premedication is the preoperative administration of beta adrenergic antagonists, which reduce the burden of arrhythmias after cardiac surgery. However, evidence also has shown an association of increased adverse events with beta-blockers in non-cardiac surgery. Anaesthesiologists may administer one or more antiemetic agents such as ondansetron, droperidol, or dexamethasone to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. NSAIDs are commonly used analgesic premedication agent, and often reduce need for opioids such as fentanyl or sufentanil. Also gastrokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, and histamine antagonists such as famotidine.

Non-pharmacologic preanaesthetic interventions include playing cognitive behavioral therapy, music therapy, aromatherapy, hypnosis massage, pre-operative preparation video, and guided imagery relaxation therapy, etc. These techniques are particularly useful for children and patients with intellectual disabilities. Minimizing sensory stimulation or distraction by video games may help to reduce anxiety prior to or during induction of general anaesthesia. Larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm the most effective non-pharmacological approaches for reducing this type of anxiety. Parental presence during premedication and induction of anaesthesia has not been shown to reduce anxiety in children. It is suggested that parents who wish to attend should not be actively discouraged, and parents who prefer not to be present should not be actively encouraged to attend.

== Anaesthesia and the brain ==
 Anaesthesia has little to no effect on brain function, unless there is an existing brain disruption. Barbiturates, or the drugs used to administer anaesthesia, do not affect auditory brain stem response. An example of a brain disruption would be a concussion. It can be risky and lead to further brain injury if anaesthesia is used on a concussed person. Concussions create ionic shifts in the brain that adjust the neuronal transmembrane potential. In order to restore this potential more glucose has to be made to equal the potential that is lost. This can be very dangerous and lead to cell death. This makes the brain very vulnerable in surgery. There are also changes to cerebral blood flow. The injury complicates the oxygen blood flow and supply to the brain.

== Stages of anaesthesia ==
Guedel&#x27;s classification, described by Arthur Ernest Guedel in 1937, describes four stages of anaesthesia. Despite newer anaesthetic agents and delivery techniques, which have led to more rapid onset of—and recovery from—anaesthesia (in some cases bypassing some of the stages entirely), the principles remain.

;Stage 1: Stage 1, also known as &quot;induction&quot;, is the period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at this time, and may complain about visual disturbance.
;Stage 2: Stage 2, also known as the &quot;excitement or delirium stage&quot;, is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, the patient&#x27;s respiration and heart rate may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, suspension of breathing, and pupillary dilation. Because the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respiration may compromise the patient&#x27;s airway, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach Stage 3 as fast as possible.

;Stage 3: In Stage 3, also known as &quot;surgical anaesthesia&quot;, the skeletal muscles relax, vomiting stops. Respiratory depression and cessation of eye movements are the hallmarks of this stage. The patient is unconscious and ready for surgery. This stage is divided into four planes:
:# The eyes roll, then become fixed; eyelid and swallow reflexes are lost. Still have regular spontaneous breathing;
:# Corneal and laryngeal reflexes are lost; 
:# The pupillary light reflex is lost; and the process is marked by complete relaxation of abdominal and intercostal muscles. Ideal level of anesthesia for most surgeries. 
:# Full diaphragm paralysis and irregular shallow abdominal respiration occur.
;Stage 4: Stage 4, also known as &quot;overdose&quot;, occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation and the patient has severe brainstem or medullary depression, resulting in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.

== Induction ==
General anaesthesia is usually induced in an operating theatre or in an anaesthetic room next to the theatre. It may also be induced in an endoscopy suite, intensive care unit, radiology or cardiology department, emergency department, ambulance, or even at the site of a disaster where extrication of the patient may be impractical.

Anaesthetics can be administered by inhalation, injection (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), oral, or rectal routes. Once they enter the circulatory system, the agents are transported to their biochemical sites of action in the central and autonomic nervous systems.

Most general anaesthetics are intravenous or inhaled. Commonly used intravenous induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, methohexital, and ketamine. Inhalational anaesthesia may be chosen when intravenous access is difficult to obtain (e.g., children), when difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or when the patient prefers it. Sevoflurane is the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, because it is less irritating to the tracheobronchial tree than other agents.

As an example sequence of induction drugs:
# Pre-oxygenation or denitrogenation to fill lungs with 100% oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels
# Fentanyl for systemic analgesia during intubation
# Propofol for sedation for intubation
# Switching from oxygen to a mixture of oxygen and inhalational anesthetic once intubation is complete

Laryngoscopy and intubation are both very stimulating. The process of induction blunts the response to these manoeuvres while simultaneously inducing a near-coma state to prevent awareness.

=== Physiologic monitoring ===
Several monitoring technologies allow for a controlled induction of, maintenance of, and emergence from general anaesthesia. Standard for basic anesthetic monitoring is a guideline published by the ASA, which describes that the patient&#x27;s oxygenation, ventilation, circulation and temperature should be continually evaluated during anesthetic.
# Continuous electrocardiography (ECG or EKG): Electrodes are placed on the patient&#x27;s skin to monitor heart rate and rhythm. This may also help the anaesthesiologist to identify early signs of heart ischaemia. Typically lead II and V5 are monitored for arrhythmias and ischemia, respectively.
# Continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2): A device is placed, usually on a finger, to allow for early detection of a fall in a patient&#x27;s hemoglobin saturation with oxygen (hypoxaemia).
# Blood pressure monitoring: There are two methods of measuring the patient&#x27;s blood pressure. The first, and most common, is non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. This involves placing a blood pressure cuff around the patient&#x27;s arm, forearm, or leg. A machine takes blood pressure readings at regular, preset intervals throughout the surgery. The second method is invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring, which allows beat to beat monitoring of blood pressure. This method is reserved for patients with significant heart or lung disease, the critically ill, and those undergoing major procedures such as cardiac or transplant surgery, or when large blood loss is expected. It involves placing a special type of plastic cannula in an artery, usually in the wrist (radial artery) or groin (femoral artery).
# Agent concentration measurement: anaesthetic machines typically have monitors to measure the percentage of inhalational anaesthetic agents used as well as exhalation concentrations. These monitors include measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anaesthetics (e.g., nitrous oxide, isoflurane).
# Oxygen measurement: Almost all circuits have an alarm in case oxygen delivery to the patient is compromised. The alarm goes off if the fraction of inspired oxygen drops below a set threshold.
# A circuit disconnect alarm or low pressure alarm indicates failure of the circuit to achieve a given pressure during mechanical ventilation.
# Capnography measures the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled by the patient in percent or mmHg, allowing the anaesthesiologist to assess the adequacy of ventilation. MmHg is usually used to allow the provider to see more subtle changes. 
# Temperature measurement to discern hypothermia or fever, and to allow early detection of malignant hyperthermia.
# Electroencephalography, entropy monitoring, or other systems may be used to verify the depth of anaesthesia. This reduces the likelihood of anaesthesia awareness and of overdose.

=== Airway management ===

Anaesthetized patients lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), airway patency, and sometimes a regular breathing pattern due to anaesthetics, opioids, or muscle relaxants. To maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of breathing tube is inserted after the patient is unconscious. To enable mechanical ventilation, an endotracheal tube is often used, although there are alternatives such as face masks or laryngeal mask airways. Generally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anaesthesia is to be induced, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient.

Induction of general anaesthesia usually results in apnea and requires ventilation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts. In other words, ventilation may be needed for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, or just during the induction. However, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange.

General anaesthesia can also be induced with the patient spontaneously breathing and therefore maintaining their own oxygenation which can be beneficial in certain scenarios (e.g. difficult airway or tubeless surgery). Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally maintained with inhalational agents (i.e. halothane or sevoflurane) which is called a gas or inhalational induction. Spontaneous ventilation can also be maintained using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). Intravenous anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous respiration has certain advantages over inhalational agents (i.e. suppressed laryngeal reflexes) but requires careful titration. Spontaneous Respiration using Intravenous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is a technique that has been used in difficult and obstructed airways.

=== Eye management ===

General anaesthesia reduces the tonic contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing lagophthalmos (incomplete eye closure) in 59% of people. In addition, tear production and tear-film stability are reduced, resulting in corneal epithelial drying and reduced lysosomal protection. The protection afforded by Bell&#x27;s phenomenon (in which the eyeball turns upward during sleep, protecting the cornea) is also lost. Careful management is required to reduce the likelihood of eye injuries during general anaesthesia. Some of the methods to prevent eye injury during general anesthesia includes taping the eyelids shut, use of eye ointments, and specially designed eye protective goggles.

=== Neuromuscular blockade ===

Paralysis, or temporary muscle relaxation with a neuromuscular blocker, is an integral part of modern anaesthesia. The first drug used for this purpose was curare, introduced in the 1940s, which has now been superseded by drugs with fewer side effects and, generally, shorter duration of action. Muscle relaxation allows surgery within major body cavities, such as the abdomen and thorax, without the need for very deep anaesthesia, and also facilitates endotracheal intubation.

Acetylcholine, a natural neurotransmitter found at the neuromuscular junction, causes muscles to contract when it is released from nerve endings. Muscle paralytic drugs work by preventing acetylcholine from attaching to its receptor. Paralysis of the muscles of respiration—the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the chest—requires that some form of artificial respiration be implemented. Because the muscles of the larynx are also paralysed, the airway usually needs to be protected by means of an endotracheal tube.

Paralysis is most easily monitored by means of a peripheral nerve stimulator. This device intermittently sends short electrical pulses through the skin over a peripheral nerve while the contraction of a muscle supplied by that nerve is observed. The effects of muscle relaxants are commonly reversed at the end of surgery by anticholinesterase drugs, which are administered in combination with muscarinic anticholinergic drugs to minimize side effects. Examples of skeletal muscle relaxants in use today are pancuronium, rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium, and succinylcholine. Novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agents such as sugammadex may also be used; it works by directly binding muscle relaxants and removing it from the neuromuscular junction. Sugammadex was approved for use in the United States in 2015, and rapidly gained popularity. A study from 2022 has shown that Sugammadex and neostigmine are likely similarly safe in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

== Maintenance ==
The duration of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to prolong unconsciousness for the duration of surgery, anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen and a volatile anaesthetic agent, or by administering intravenous medication (usually propofol). Inhaled anaesthetic agents are also frequently supplemented by intravenous analgesic agents, such as opioids (usually fentanyl or a fentanyl derivative) and sedatives (usually propofol or midazolam). Propofol can be used for total intravenous anaesthetia (TIVA), therefore supplementation by inhalation agents is not required. General anesthesia is usually considered safe; however, there are reported cases of patients with distortion of taste and/or smell due to local anesthetics, stroke, nerve damage, or as a side effect of general anesthesia.

At the end of surgery, administration of anaesthetic agents is discontinued. Recovery of consciousness occurs when the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level (this occurs usually within 1 to 30 minutes, mostly depending on the duration of surgery).
In the 1990s, a novel method of maintaining anaesthesia was developed in Glasgow, Scotland. Called target controlled infusion (TCI), it involves using a computer-controlled syringe driver (pump) to infuse propofol throughout the duration of surgery, removing the need for a volatile anaesthetic and allowing pharmacologic principles to more precisely guide the amount of the drug used by setting the desired drug concentration. Advantages include faster recovery from anaesthesia, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and absence of a trigger for malignant hyperthermia. At present , TCI is not permitted in the United States, but a syringe pump delivering a specific rate of medication is commonly used instead.

Other medications are occasionally used to treat side effects or prevent complications. They include antihypertensives to treat high blood pressure; ephedrine or phenylephrine to treat low blood pressure; salbutamol to treat asthma, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm; and epinephrine or diphenhydramine to treat allergic reactions. Glucocorticoids or antibiotics are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.

== Emergence ==
Emergence is the return to baseline physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as agitated emergence (acute mental confusion), aphasia (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. Shivering is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, cardiac output, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure. The proposed mechanism is based on the observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as clonic activity (shivering). This theory is supported by the fact that doxapram, a CNS stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering. Cardiovascular events such as increased or decreased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, or other cardiac dysrhythmias are also common during emergence from general anaesthesia, as are respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea. Responding and following verbal command, is a criterion commonly utilized to assess the patient&#x27;s readiness for tracheal extubation.

== Postoperative care ==

Postoperative pain is managed in the anaesthesia recovery unit (PACU) with regional analgesia or oral, transdermal, or medication. Patients may be given opioids, as well as other medications like non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Sometimes, opioid medication is administered by the patient themselves using a system called a patient controlled analgesic. The patient presses a button to activate a syringe device and receive a preset dose or &quot;bolus&quot; of the drug, usually a strong opioid such as morphine, fentanyl, or oxycodone (e.g., one milligram of morphine). The PCA device then &quot;locks out&quot; for a preset period to allow the drug to take effect, and also prevent the patient from overdosing. If the patient becomes too sleepy or sedated, they make no more requests. This confers a fail-safe aspect that is lacking in continuous-infusion techniques. If these medications cannot effectively manage the pain, local anesthetic may be directly injected to the nerve in a procedure called a nerve block.

In the recovery unit, many vital signs are monitored, including oxygen saturation, heart rhythm and respiration, blood pressure, and core body temperature.

Postanesthetic shivering is common. Apart from causing discomfort and exacerbating pain, shivering has been shown to increase oxygen consumption, catecholamine release, risk for hypothermia, and induce lactic acidosis. A number of techniques are used to reduce shivering, such as warm blankets, or wrapping the patient in a sheet that circulates warmed air, called a bair hugger. If the shivering cannot be managed with external warming devices, drugs such as dexmedetomidine, or other α2-agonists, anticholinergics, central nervous system stimulants, or corticosteroids may be used.

In many cases, opioids used in general anaesthesia can cause postoperative ileus, even after non-abdominal surgery. Administration of a μ-opioid antagonist such as alvimopan immediately after surgery can help accelerate the timing of hospital discharge, but does not reduce the development of paralytic ileus.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a society that provides up-to-date guidelines and consensus to ensure continuity of care and improve recovery and peri-operative care. Adherence to the pathway and guidelines has been shown to associate with improved post-operative outcomes and lower costs to the health care system.

== Perioperative mortality ==

Most perioperative mortality is attributable to complications from the operation, such as haemorrhage, sepsis, and failure of vital organs. Over the last several decades, the overall anesthesia related mortality rate improved significantly for anaesthetics administered. Advancements in monitoring equipment, anaesthetic agents, and increased focus on perioperative safety are some reasons for the decrease in perioperative mortality. In the United States, the current estimated anaesthesia-related mortality is about 1.1 per million population per year. The highest death rates were found in the geriatric population, especially those 85 and older. A review from 2018 examined perioperative anaesthesia interventions and their impact on anaesthesia-related mortality. Interventions found to reduce mortality include pharmacotherapy, ventilation, transfusion, nutrition, glucose control, dialysis and medical device. Interestingly, a randomized controlled trial from 2022 demonstrated that there is no significant difference in mortality between patient receiving handover from one clinician to another compared to the control group.

Mortality directly related to anaesthetic management is very uncommon but may be caused by pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, asphyxiation, or anaphylaxis. These in turn may result from malfunction of anaesthesia-related equipment or, more commonly, human error. In 1984, after a television programme highlighting anaesthesia mishaps aired in the United States, American anaesthesiologist Ellison C. Pierce appointed the Anesthesia Patient Safety and Risk Management Committee within the American Society of Anesthesiologists. This committee was tasked with determining and reducing the causes of anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. An outgrowth of this committee, the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, was created in 1985 as an independent, nonprofit corporation with the goal &quot;that no patient shall be harmed by anesthesia&quot;.

The rare but major complication of general anaesthesia is malignant hyperthermia. All major hospitals should have a protocol in place with an emergency drug cart near the OR for this potential complication.

<text>The Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL) is a Hong Kong pro-democracy social-liberal political party catering to grassroots interest with a strong basis in Sham Shui Po. Established on 26 October 1986, it was one of the three major pro-democracy groups along with the Meeting Point and the Hong Kong Affairs Society in the 1980s.

The ADPL survived through the great unification of the pro-democracy camp in the 1991 and became the only pro-democracy party to sit in the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislative Council in 1997. It was ousted for the first time in the 1998 Legislative Council election. Its veteran former chairman Frederick Fung was the only legislator for the ADPL until he was defeated in the 2016 Legislative Council election in which the party was ousted from the legislature for the second time. 

==Stances==
The stated aims of the ADPL are to:
* Strive for a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty and to implement the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle;
* Advocate democracy, fight for full implementation of direct elections for the Legislative Council, safeguard basic human rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people and preserve Hong Kong&#x27;s judicial independence;
* Maintain Hong Kong&#x27;s prosperity and stability and promote economic development in Hong Kong; and
* Distribute social resources fairly, improving the quality of life of the less well-off.

Within the pro-democracy camp, the ADPL is usually considered more moderate. Besides demanding universal suffrage, it emphasises livelihood issues and has supported an increase in profits and salaries taxes while opposing sales tax, a stance more favourable to lower income groups. The party has also called for an increase in education and coverage of medical expenses.

==History==
===Founding===
The ADPL was founded on 26 October 1986 as a political organisation by a group of incumbent Urban Councillors, District Board members, members from mainly four grassroots organisations and professionals, the Association for Democracy and Justice, the Society for Social Research, the New Hong Kong Society, the Hong Kong People&#x27;s Council on Public Housing Policy, the Septentrio Academy and the Sham Shui Po Residents Livelihood Concern Group. The founding chairman was Ding Lik-kiu and vice-chairmen were Frederick Fung and Lee Wing-tat.

===Late colonial period===
Initially, the ADPL engaged in the electoral reform debate, advocating direct election of the legislature in 1988. It supported the liberal proposals put forward by the Group of 190 coalition. The ADPL was one of the three major pro-democracy groups and performed fairly well in the local and municipal elections the 1980s with its strategic allies the Meeting Point and the Hong Kong Affairs Society. At its peak, it had 140 members, 28 District Board members, one Legislative Councillor, 5 municipal councillors.

In 1990, some leading figures of the ADPL such as vice-chairmen Lee Wing-tat and Albert Chan joined the United Democrats of Hong Kong, which later became the Democratic Party. The ADPL retained its separate identity, arguing that it represented grassroots interests whereas the United Democrats were more focused on the middle class. However, as many members joined the new party, the ADPL&#x27;s membership dropped significantly to only 70 members, 15 District Board members and two municipal councillors.

As the ADPL chairman Frederick Fung was elected to the Legislative Council in the 1991 direct election and other members were elected to municipal councils, the ADPL stabilised and matured from a political organisation to a political party in 1992. It won one seat in the first direct election of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) in 1991 when Fung was elected. In the 1995 election, the party won four seats. At the time, due to near-parity of representation between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps in Legco, the stance of the moderate ADPL was influential and often pivotal on controversial issues.

On the issue of the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council, the ADPL initially opposed but then agreed to join the interim body. This led to a group of 16 members leaving to form the Social Democratic Front. ADPL became the only pro-democracy party in the legislature immediately after the establishment of the HKSAR, keeping four members in the interim body. ADPL members also served on the Preparatory Committee for the establishment of the HKSAR.

===After 1997===
The ADPL lost all its seats in the 1998 Legco election. In the 2000 election, long-time chairman Frederick Fung recovered his directly elected seat in Legco for the ADPL.

At the district level, ADPL traditionally enjoyed a concentration of support in the Sham Shui Po District, with numerous seats across other District councils in the 1990s but it largely lost its influence outside of Sham Shui Po in the early 2000s. The party&#x27;s seats mainly concentrated in Sham Shui Po, followed by Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City Districts in Kowloon West, where Frederick Fung retook his Legco seat in, as well as Wong Tai Sin and Tuen Mun. Following a poor showing in the 2007 District Council elections, Fung resigned as chairman and was replaced by Bruce Liu.

The ADPL supported the controversial electoral reform package which created five seats in the District Council (Second) functional constituencies which are nominated by District Councillors and elected by all registered voters. In a pan-democrat primary, Fung stood in the 2012 Chief Executive election but was defeated by the Democratic Party&#x27;s Albert Ho. He was subsequently re-elected in the new constituency in the 2012 Legco election. Tam Kwok-kiu, however, failed to succeed Fung in Kowloon West, the ADPL&#x27;s stronghold, its first loss there since 1998.

In the 2015 District Council election, the ADPL won 18 seats while veteran Frederick Fung lost his seat in Lai Kok to Chan Wing-yan of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) and Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU). Former party member Eric Wong Chung-ki also contested the constituency. On 23 January 2016, Rosanda Mok, former vice-chairman of the party, was elected the party&#x27;s first female chairperson.

===Ousted from the LegCo and split===
Fung ran in the New Territories West after losing his eligibility to run in District Council (Second) in the 2016 Legislative Council election, while his party colleague Tam Kwok-kiu ran in Kowloon West for the second time. Kalvin Ho, a new Sham Shui Po District Councillor represented the ADPL to run in the District Council (Second). Both Fung and Tam lost in the election while Ho withdrew from the campaign to boost other pro-democrat candidates&#x27; chance to win. As a result, the ADPL was ousted from the legislature for the second time. Rosanda Mok resigned for the election defeat. In December, the party elected Sze Tak-loy as its new chairman.

Around the end of 2016, the ADPL&#x27;s six district councillors, which included all its members from Yau Tsim Mong District Council and Kowloon City District Council, quit the party in a disputes concerning the intra-party primary for the March 2018 Kowloon West by-election, in which Frederick Fung intended to run, leaving the ADPL with only 12 District Councillors. Kalvin Ho, who also intended to run in the primary, later withdrew. As the party resolved to nominate Fung, former chairperson Rosanda Mok also left the party in June 2017. After losing to Yiu Chung-yim in the primary, Fung announced he would not become the backup candidate if Yiu&#x27;s candidacy was disqualified amid alleged pressure from the progressive democrats forcing him to withdraw. On 12 July 2018, Fung announced his departure from the ADPL amid speculation that he was going to run for the November Kowloon West by-election as the party intended to back Lau Siu-lai.

=== Post National Security Law ===
Chairman Kalvin Ho and vice-chairman Sze Tak-loy was charged with subversion under the National Security Law in 2021, resigned respectively later after bail granted by court. Yeung Yuk became the acting chairman of ADPL. On 15 October 2021, amidst a crackdown on pro-Democracy political parties and organizations after the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law in 2020, the ADPL allowed members to sign up and contest in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election. While Bruce Liu signaled his interest in running again for the seat, none of the members signed up. The defeat of all moderates and democrats in the election marked by low turnout pressured Yeung, who supported Frederick Fung in the campaign and angered some pro-democracy activists, to resign as the acting chair of the party, citing his wish to focus on local issues. Bruce Liu was elected as the new chairman on 16 April 2022.

ADPL intended to join the elections by filling two candidates in the 2023 District Council elections after the election system was overhauled, but neither of the candidates was able to get nominations from the members of the &quot;three committees&quot;, many of which came from the pro-Beijing parties. Bruce Liu said that the ADPL has entered the &quot;desert stage&quot;, describing the current regional administration as being like Shenzhen&#x27;s system.

<text>Griffon is a type of dog, a collection of breeds that were originally hunting dogs. There are three lines of the griffon type recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI): the Griffon Vendéens, the wirehaired pointers, and the &quot;smousje&quot; (Belgian companion dogs or Dutch Smoushond). The griffon type is characterized by rough- or wire-hair.

The griffon is mentioned as early as Xenophon. The hounds, Canis Segusius, used by the Gauls were griffons. Among the oldest breeds are the Italian Wirehaired Pointing Dog or Spinone Italiano (FCI #165) and the breeds bred by Eduard Karel Korthals originating in the Low Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, northern France) which have a short, bearded muzzle. The &quot;smousje&quot;, a small dog mentioned since the Middle Ages in the Low Countries known for its firm, even temperament and rough coat, was the initial breeding stock for the Brussels Griffon.

<doc id="398578" wikidata="Q764115" url="?curid=398578" title="Projective line">
<text>In mathematics, a projective line is, roughly speaking, the extension of a usual line by a point called a &quot;point at infinity&quot;. The statement and the proof of many theorems of geometry are simplified by the resultant elimination of special cases; for example, two distinct projective lines in a projective plane meet in exactly one point (there is no &quot;parallel&quot; case).

There are many equivalent ways to formally define a projective line; one of the most common is to define a projective line over a field &quot;K&quot;, commonly denoted P1(&quot;K&quot;), as the set of one-dimensional subspaces of a two-dimensional &quot;K&quot;-vector space. This definition is a special instance of the general definition of a projective space.

The projective line over the reals is a manifold; see &quot;Real projective line&quot; for details.

== Homogeneous coordinates ==
An arbitrary point in the projective line P1(&quot;K&quot;) may be represented by an equivalence class of &quot;homogeneous coordinates&quot;, which take the form of a pair
: formula_1
of elements of &quot;K&quot; that are not both zero. Two such pairs are equivalent if they differ by an overall nonzero factor &quot;λ&quot;:
: formula_2

== Line extended by a point at infinity ==
The projective line may be identified with the line &quot;K&quot; extended by a point at infinity. More precisely,
the line &quot;K&quot; may be identified with the subset of P1(&quot;K&quot;) given by
: formula_3
This subset covers all points in P1(&quot;K&quot;) except one, which is called the &quot;point at infinity&quot;:
: formula_4
This allows to extend the arithmetic on &quot;K&quot; to P1(&quot;K&quot;) by the formulas
: formula_5
: formula_6
: formula_7

Translating this arithmetic in terms of homogeneous coordinates gives, when does not occur:
: formula_8
: formula_9
: formula_10

== Examples ==
=== Real projective line ===
The projective line over the real numbers is called the real projective line. It may also be thought of as the line &quot;K&quot; together with an idealised &quot;point at infinity&quot; ∞; the point connects to both ends of &quot;K&quot; creating a closed loop or topological circle.

An example is obtained by projecting points in R2 onto the unit circle and then identifying diametrically opposite points. In terms of group theory we can take the quotient by the subgroup .

Compare the extended real number line, which distinguishes ∞ and −∞.

=== Complex projective line: the Riemann sphere ===
Adding a point at infinity to the complex plane results in a space that is topologically a sphere. Hence the complex projective line is also known as the Riemann sphere (or sometimes the &quot;Gauss sphere&quot;). It is in constant use in complex analysis, algebraic geometry and complex manifold theory, as the simplest example of a compact Riemann surface.

=== For a finite field ===
The projective line over a finite field &quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot; of &quot;q&quot; elements has points. In all other respects it is no different from projective lines defined over other types of fields. In the terms of homogeneous coordinates , &quot;q&quot; of these points have the form:
: for each in ,

and the remaining point &quot;at infinity&quot; may be represented as .

== Symmetry group ==
Quite generally, the group of homographies with coefficients in &quot;K&quot; acts on the projective line P1(&quot;K&quot;). This group action is transitive, so that P1(&quot;K&quot;) is a homogeneous space for the group, often written PGL2(&quot;K&quot;) to emphasise the projective nature of these transformations. &quot;Transitivity&quot; says that there exists a homography that will transform any point &quot;Q&quot; to any other point &quot;R&quot;. The &quot;point at infinity&quot; on P1(&quot;K&quot;) is therefore an &quot;artifact&quot; of choice of coordinates: homogeneous coordinates
: formula_11
express a one-dimensional subspace by a single non-zero point lying in it, but the symmetries of the projective line can move the point to any other, and it is in no way distinguished.

Much more is true, in that some transformation can take any given distinct points &quot;Q&quot;&quot;i&quot; for to any other 3-tuple &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot; of distinct points (&quot;triple transitivity&quot;). This amount of specification &#x27;uses up&#x27; the three dimensions of PGL2(&quot;K&quot;); in other words, the group action is sharply 3-transitive. The computational aspect of this is the cross-ratio. Indeed, a generalized converse is true: a sharply 3-transitive group action is always (isomorphic to) a generalized form of a PGL2(&quot;K&quot;) action on a projective line, replacing &quot;field&quot; by &quot;KT-field&quot; (generalizing the inverse to a weaker kind of involution), and &quot;PGL&quot; by a corresponding generalization of projective linear maps.

== As algebraic curve ==
The projective line is a fundamental example of an algebraic curve. From the point of view of algebraic geometry, P1(&quot;K&quot;) is a non-singular curve of genus 0. If &quot;K&quot; is algebraically closed, it is the unique such curve over &quot;K&quot;, up to rational equivalence. In general a (non-singular) curve of genus 0 is rationally equivalent over &quot;K&quot; to a conic &quot;C&quot;, which is itself birationally equivalent to projective line if and only if &quot;C&quot; has a point defined over &quot;K&quot;; geometrically such a point &quot;P&quot; can be used as origin to make explicit the birational equivalence.

The function field of the projective line is the field &quot;K&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) of rational functions over &quot;K&quot;, in a single indeterminate &quot;T&quot;. The field automorphisms of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) over &quot;K&quot; are precisely the group PGL2(&quot;K&quot;) discussed above.

Any function field &quot;K&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) of an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; over &quot;K&quot;, other than a single point, has a subfield isomorphic with &quot;K&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). From the point of view of birational geometry, this means that there will be a rational map from &quot;V&quot; to P1(&quot;K&quot;), that is not constant. The image will omit only finitely many points of P1(&quot;K&quot;), and the inverse image of a typical point &quot;P&quot; will be of dimension . This is the beginning of methods in algebraic geometry that are inductive on dimension. The rational maps play a role analogous to the meromorphic functions of complex analysis, and indeed in the case of compact Riemann surfaces the two concepts coincide.

If &quot;V&quot; is now taken to be of dimension 1, we get a picture of a typical algebraic curve &quot;C&quot; presented &#x27;over&#x27; P1(&quot;K&quot;). Assuming &quot;C&quot; is non-singular (which is no loss of generality starting with &quot;K&quot;(&quot;C&quot;)), it can be shown that such a rational map from &quot;C&quot; to P1(&quot;K&quot;) will in fact be everywhere defined. (That is not the case if there are singularities, since for example a &quot;double point&quot; where a curve &quot;crosses itself&quot; may give an indeterminate result after a rational map.) This gives a picture in which the main geometric feature is ramification.

Many curves, for example hyperelliptic curves, may be presented abstractly, as ramified covers of the projective line. According to the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, the genus then depends only on the type of ramification.

A rational curve is a curve that is birationally equivalent to a projective line (see rational variety); its genus is 0. A rational normal curve in projective space P&quot;n&quot; is a rational curve that lies in no proper linear subspace; it is known that there is only one example (up to projective equivalence), given parametrically in homogeneous coordinates as
: [1 : &quot;t&quot; : &quot;t&quot;2 : ... : &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;].

See &quot;Twisted cubic&quot; for the first interesting case.

<text>Dyssomnias are a broad classification of sleeping disorders involving difficulty getting to sleep, remaining asleep, or of excessive sleepiness.

Dyssomnias are primary disorders of initiating or maintaining sleep or of excessive sleepiness and are characterized by a disturbance in the amount, quality, or timing of sleep.

Patients may complain of difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep, intermittent wakefulness during the night, early morning awakening, or combinations of any of these. Transient episodes are usually of little significance. Stress, caffeine, physical discomfort, daytime napping, and early bedtimes are common factors.

==Types==
There are over 31 recognized kinds of dyssomnias. The major three groups, along with the group types, include:

* Intrinsic sleep disorders
** idiopathic hypersomnia,
** narcolepsy,
** periodic limb movement disorder,
** restless legs syndrome,
** obstructive sleep apnea,
** central sleep apnea syndrome,
** sleep state misperception,
** psychophysiologic insomnia,
** recurrent hypersomnia,
** post-traumatic hypersomnia,
** central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome,
* Extrinsic sleep disorders – 13 disorders recognized, including
** alcohol-dependent sleep disorder,
** food allergy insomnia,
** inadequate sleep routine.
* Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, both intrinsic and extrinsic – 6 disorders recognized, including
** advanced sleep phase syndrome,
** delayed sleep phase syndrome,
** jetlag,
** shift work sleep disorder.

==Treatments==
Managing dyssomnias involves various strategies to regulate sleep patterns. 

Sleep hygiene focuses on eliminating behaviors that disrupt sleep, particularly for shift workers. 

Melatonin, a natural sleep-inducing hormone, can help adjust circadian rhythms in cases like jet lag and shift work. 

Light therapy (2500–10,000 lux for 30–120 minutes daily) aids circadian realignment—morning exposure promotes wakefulness, while evening exposure delays sleep onset. 

Zeitgebers (“time givers”) such as morning light, meal times, and social interactions help reset internal clocks. Phase shifting gradually adjusts sleep schedules in 15–60 minute increments to align with new time zones or routines. Environmental modifications allow adaptation to non-traditional light-dark cycles, benefiting shift workers. 

Lastly, sleep logs track sleep-wake patterns, assisting in diagnosis and treatment while offering insight into individual sleep behaviors. These interventions can effectively regulate circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality.

<doc id="398585" wikidata="Q234197" url="?curid=398585" title="Srivijaya">
<text>Srivijaya (), also spelled Sri Vijaya, was a Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empire based on the island of Sumatra (in modern-day Indonesia) that influenced much of Southeast Asia. Srivijaya was an important centre for the expansion of Buddhism from the 7th to 11th century AD. Srivijaya was the first polity to dominate much of western Maritime Southeast Asia. Due to its location, Srivijaya developed complex technology utilizing maritime resources. In addition, its economy became progressively reliant on the booming trade in the region, thus transforming it into a prestige goods-based economy.

The earliest reference to it dates from the 7th century. A Tang dynasty Chinese monk, Yijing, wrote that he visited Srivijaya in 671 for six months. The earliest known inscription in which the name Srivijaya appears also dates from the 7th century in the Kedukan Bukit inscription found near Palembang, Sumatra, dated 16 June 682. Between the late 7th and early 11th century, Srivijaya rose to become a hegemon in Southeast Asia. It was involved in close interactions, often rivalries, with the neighbouring Mataram, Khom or Khmer Empire and Champa. Srivijaya&#x27;s main foreign interest was nurturing lucrative trade agreements with China which lasted from the Tang to the Song dynasty. Srivijaya had religious, cultural and trade links with the Buddhist Pala of Bengal, as well as with the Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East.

Srivijaya is widely recognized as a powerful maritime kingdom in Southeast Asia. New research shows that while it had significant land-based elements, Srivijaya leveraged its maritime fleet not only for logistical support but also as a primary tool to project power across strategic waterways, such as the Strait of Malacca. In response to the ever-changing dynamics of Asia’s maritime economy, the kingdom developed sophisticated naval strategies to maintain its position as a regional trade hub. These strategies involved regulating trade routes and attracting merchant ships to their ports through strict control. As threats grew, Srivijaya’s fleet also transformed into an effective offensive force, used to protect trade interests while ensuring their dominance in the region.

The kingdom may have disintegrated after 1025 CE following several major raids launched by the Chola Empire upon their ports. After Srivijaya fell, it was largely forgotten. It was not until 1918 that French historian George Cœdès, of the French School of the Far East, formally postulated its existence.
== Etymology ==
&quot;Srivijaya&quot; is a Sanskrit-derived name: श्रीविजय, &quot;Śrīvijaya&quot;. &quot;Śrī&quot; means &quot;fortunate&quot;, &quot;prosperous&quot;, or &quot;happy&quot; and also has some association with the divine, at least in Hinduism. &quot;Vijaya&quot; means &quot;victorious&quot; or &quot;excellence&quot;. Thus, the combined word &quot;Srivijaya&quot; means &quot;shining victory&quot;, &quot;splendid triumph&quot;, &quot;prosperous victor&quot;, &quot;radiance of excellence&quot; or simply &quot;glorious&quot;. 

Early 20th-century historians who studied the inscriptions of Sumatra and the neighboring islands thought that the term &quot;Srivijaya&quot; referred to a king&#x27;s name. In 1913, H. Kern was the first epigraphist that identified the name &quot;Srivijaya&quot; written in a 7th-century Kota Kapur inscription (discovered in 1892). However, at that time he believed that it referred to a king named &quot;Vijaya&quot;, with &quot;Sri&quot; as an honorific title for a king or ruler.

The Sundanese manuscript of Carita Parahyangan, composed around the late 16th century in West Java, mentioned the name &quot;Sang Sri Wijaya&quot;. The manuscript describes princely hero that rose to be a king named Sanjaya that—after he secured his rule in Java—was involved in battle with the Malayu and Keling against their king Sang Sri Wijaya.

Subsequently, after studying local stone inscriptions, manuscripts and Chinese historical accounts, historians concluded that the term &quot;Srivijaya&quot; was in reference to a polity or kingdom. The main concern is to define Srivijaya&#x27;s amorphous statehood as a thalassocracy, which dominated a confederation of semi autonomous harbour cities in Maritime Southeast Asia.

==Historiography==
Little physical evidence of Srivijaya remains. There had been no continuous knowledge of the history of Srivijaya even in Indonesia and Maritime Southeast Asia; its forgotten past has been resurrected by foreign scholars. Contemporary Indonesians, even those from the area of Palembang (around where the kingdom was based), had not heard of Srivijaya until the 1920s when the French scholar, George Cœdès, published his discoveries and interpretations in Dutch and Indonesian language newspapers. Cœdès noted that the Chinese references to &quot;Sanfoqi&quot;, previously read as &quot;Sribhoja&quot; or &quot;Sribogha&quot;, and the inscriptions in Old Malay refer to the same empire.

The Srivijayan historiography is based on two main sources: the Chinese historical accounts and the Southeast Asian stone inscriptions that have been discovered and deciphered in the region. The Buddhist monk Yijing&#x27;s account is especially important in describing Srivijaya, when he visited the kingdom in 671 for six months. The 7th-century &quot;siddhayatra&quot; inscriptions discovered in Palembang and Bangka Island are also vital primary historical sources. Also, regional accounts that some might be preserved and retold as tales and legends, such as the Legend of the Maharaja of Zabaj and the Khmer King also provide a glimpse of the kingdom. Some Indian and Arabic accounts also vaguely describe the riches of the king of Zabag. It&#x27;s likely that the Zabag-Khmer story was based on Javanese overlordship over Cambodia.

The historical records of Srivijaya were reconstructed from a number of stone inscriptions, most of them written in Old Malay using Pallava script, such as the Kedukan Bukit, Talang Tuwo, Telaga Batu and Kota Kapur inscriptions. Srivijaya became a symbol of early Sumatran importance as a great empire to balance Java&#x27;s Majapahit in the east. In the 20th century, both empires were referred to by nationalistic intellectuals to argue for an Indonesian identity within a united Indonesian state that had existed prior to the colonial state of the Dutch East Indies.

Srivijaya, and by extension Sumatra, had been known by different names to different peoples. The Chinese called it &quot;Sanfotsi&quot;, &quot;Sanfoqi&quot; or &quot;Che-li-fo-che&quot; (&quot;Shilifoshi&quot;), and there was an even older kingdom of Kantoli, which could be considered the predecessor of Srivijaya. The Arabs called it &quot;Zabag&quot; or &quot;Sribuza&quot; and the Khmer called it &quot;Melayu&quot;. While the Javanese called them &quot;Suvarnabhumi&quot;, &quot;Suvarnadvipa&quot;, &quot;Melayu&quot;, or &quot;Malayu&quot;. This is another reason why the discovery of Srivijaya was so difficult. While some of these names are strongly reminiscent of the name of Java, there is a distinct possibility that they may have been referring to Sumatra instead.

==Capital==
===Palembang===
According to the Kedukan Bukit inscription, dated 605 Saka (683), Srivijaya was first established in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Palembang, on the banks of the Musi River. It mentions that Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa came from Minanga Tamwan. The exact location of Minanga Tamwan is still a subject of discussion. The Palembang theory as the place where Srivijaya was first established was presented by Cœdes and supported by Pierre-Yves Manguin. Soekmono, on the other hand, argues that Palembang was not the capital of Srivijaya and suggests that the Kampar River system in Riau where the Muara Takus temple is located as Minanga Tamwan. However, a recent study suggests that Minanga Tamwan is located by the upper Komering River in modern Minanga village, Cempaka district, East Ogan Komering Ulu Regency, South Sumatra. Komering River is a tributary of the Musi River, with its confluence located in Palembang.

Other than the Kedukan Bukit inscription and other Srivijayan inscriptions, immediately to the west of modern Palembang city, a quantity of artefacts have been revealed through archaeological surveys commenced since the 20th century. Artefacts unearthed include large amounts of Chinese ceramics and Indian rouletted ware remains, also the ruins of stupa at the foot of Bukit Seguntang. Furthermore, a significant number of Hindu-Buddhist statuary has been recovered from the Musi River basin. These discoveries reinforce the suggestion that Palembang was the centre of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, Palembang left little archaeological traces of ancient urban settlement. This is probably because of the nature of Palembang&#x27;s environment — a low-lying plain which is frequently flooded by the Musi River. Experts suggests that the ancient Palembang settlement was formed as a collection of floating houses made from thatched materials, such as wood, bamboo and straw. Zhao Rukuo&#x27;s 13th century Chinese account &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot; confirmed this; &quot;The residents of &quot;Sanfo-tsi&quot; (Srivijaya) live scattered outside the city on the water, within rafts lined with reeds.&quot; It was probably that only Kedatuan (king&#x27;s court) and religious structures were built on land, while the people live in floating houses along the Musi River.

Palembang and its relevance to the early Malay state were controversial in terms of its evidence build-up through the archaeological record. Strong historical evidence found in Chinese sources, speaking of city-like settlements as early as 700 AD, and later Arab travelers, who visited the region during the 10th and 11th centuries, held written proof, named the kingdom of Srivijaya. As far as early state-like polities in the Malay Archipelago, the geographical location of modern Palembang was a possible candidate for the 1st-millennium kingdom settlement like Srivijaya as it is the best described and most secure in historical context, its prestige was apparent in wealth and urban characteristics, and the most unique, which no other 1st-millennium kingdom held, was its location in junction to three major rivers, the Musi River, the Komering River, and the Ogan River. The historical evidence was contrasted in 1975 with publications by Bennet Bronson and Jan Wisseman. Findings at certain major excavation sites, such as Geding Suro, Penyaringan Air Bersih, Sarang Wati, and Bukit Seguntang, conducted in the region played major roles in the negative evidence of the 1st-millennium kingdom in the same region. It was noted that the region contained no locatable settlements earlier than the middle of the second millennium.

Lack of evidence of southern settlements in the archaeological record comes from the disinterest in the archeologist and the unclear physical visibility of the settlements themselves. Archeology of the 1920s and 1930s focused more on art and epigraphy found in the regions. Some northern urban settlements were sited due to some overlap in fitting the sinocentric model of city-state urban centres. An approach to differentiate between urban settlements in the southern regions from the northern ones of Southeast Asia was initiated by a proposition for an alternative model. Excavations showed failed signs of a complex urban centre under the lens of a sinocentric model, leading to parameters of a new proposed model. Parameters for such a model of a city-like settlement included isolation in relevance to its hinterland. No hinterland makes low archaeological visibility. The settlement must also have access to both easy transportation and major interregional trade routes, crucial in a region with few resources. Access to the former and later played a major role in the creation of an extreme economic surplus in the absence of an exploited hinterland. The urban centre must be able to organize politically without the need for ceremonial foci such as temples, monuments and inscriptions. Lastly, habitations must be impermanent, being highly probable in the region Palembang and of southern Southeast Asia. Such a model was proposed to challenge city concepts of ancient urban centres in Southeast Asia and basic postulates themselves such as regions found in the south, like Palembang, based their achievements in correlation with urbanization.

Due to the contradicting pattern found in southern regions, like Palembang, in 1977 Bennet Bronson developed a speculative model for a better understanding of coastal-oriented states in Insular Southeast Asia, such as insular and Peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines, and western Indonesia. Its main focus was the relationship of political, economic and geographical systems. The general political and economic pattern of the region seems irrelevant to other parts of the world of their time, but in correlation with their maritime trade network, it produced high levels of socio-economic complexity. He concluded, from his earlier publications in 1974 that state development in this region developed much differently than the rest of early Southeast Asia. Bronson&#x27;s model was based on the dendritic patterns of a drainage basin where its opening leads out to sea. Being that historical evidence places the capital in Palembang, and in junction of three rivers, the Musi River, the Komering River, and the Ogan River, such model can be applied. For the system to function appropriately, several constraints are required. The inability for terrestrial transportation results in movements of all goods through water routes, lining up economical patterns with the dendritic patterns formed by the streams. The second being the overseas centre is economically superior to the ports found at the mouth of the rivers, having a higher population and a more productive and technologically advanced economy. Lastly, constraints on the land work against and do not develop urban settlements.

An aerial photograph taken in 1984 near Palembang (in what is now Srivijaya Archaeological Park) revealed the remnants of ancient man-made canals, moats, ponds, and artificial islands, suggesting the location of Srivijaya&#x27;s urban centre. Several artefacts such as fragments of inscriptions, Buddhist statues, beads, pottery and Chinese ceramics were found, confirming that the area had once been densely populated. By 1993, Pierre-Yves Manguin had shown that the centre of Srivijaya was along the Musi River between Bukit Seguntang and Sabokingking (situated in what is now Palembang, South Sumatra, Indonesia). Palembang is called in , this is probably a testament of its history as a once a great port.

In 2021 numbers of treasures were surfaced from shallows and riverbed of the Musi River by local fishermen that turns to be treasure divers. The troves includes coins of certain periods, gold jewelries, Buddhist statues, gems, colourful beads, and Chinese ceramic fragments. However, these troves were immediately lost as local treasure hunters immediately has sold them to international antiquities dealers before archaeologists could properly study them. These discoveries led to the treasure rush in Musi River in 2021, where locals formed groups of treasure divers operating in some parts of the Musi River in and around Palembang. These troves seem to confirm that Palembang was indeed the commercial centre of Srivijaya.

===Jambi===

Some scholars argue that the centre of Srivijaya was located in Muaro Jambi, and not Palembang. In 2013, archaeological research led by the University of Indonesia discovered several religious and habitation sites at the Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds, suggesting that the initial centre of Srivijaya was located in the Muaro Jambi Regency, Jambi on the Batang Hari River, rather than on the originally-proposed Musi River. The archaeological site includes eight excavated temple sanctuaries and covers about 12 square kilometers, and stretches 7.5 kilometers along the Batang Hari River, while 80 mounds (&quot;menapos&quot;) of temple ruins, are not yet restored. The Muaro Jambi archaeological site was Mahayana-Vajrayana Buddhist in nature, which suggests that the site served as a Buddhist learning centre, connected to the 10th century Buddhist scholar Suvarṇadvipi Dharmakīrti. Chinese sources also mentioned that Srivijaya hosted thousands of Buddhist monks.

Compared to Palembang, Muaro Jambi has richer archaeological sites, i.e. multiple red brick temples and building structures along the Batang Hari river whilst Pelembang has no comparable temples or building structures. The proponents of the theory that Muaro Jambi was Srivijaya&#x27;s capital point out that the descriptions written by Yijing and Zhao Rukuo, the description of Srivijaya realms by the Cholas and archaeological findings, suggest that Srivijaya&#x27;s capital fits Muaro Jambi&#x27;s environment better than the marshy Palembang. The study also compares the environment, geographical location, and the economic wealth of both cities; arguing that Jambi, located on the mouth of the Batang Hari River basin with its connection to Minangkabau hinterland was the centre of gold trade in the area, that described as the fabulous wealth of Srivijaya.

===Central Java===
In the second half of the eighth century, the Srivijayan mandala seems to have been ruled by the Sailendra dynasty of Central Java. Several Arabic sources mentioned that Zabag (the Javanese Sailendra dynasty) ruled over Sribuza (Srivijaya), Kalah (a place in the Malay Peninsula, probably Kedah), and Ramni (a place in Sumatra, probably Lambri). However, it&#x27;s unknown whether Srivijaya&#x27;s capital moved to Java or Srivijaya simply became a subordinate of Java.

===Other places===
Another theory suggests that Dapunta Hyang came from the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, and that the Chaiya district in Surat Thani province, Thailand, was the centre of Srivijaya. The Srivijayan Period is referred to as the time when Srivijaya ruled over present-day southern Thailand. In the region of Chaiya, there is clear evidence of Srivijayan influence seen in artwork inspired by Mahayana Buddhism. Because of the large amount of remains, such as the Ligor stele, found in this region, some scholars have attempted to prove that Chaiya was the capital. This period was also a time for art. The Buddhist art of the Srivijayan Kingdom was believed to have borrowed from Indian styles like that of the Dvaravati school of art. Some scholars believe that &quot;Chaiya&quot; probably comes from &quot;Srivijaya&quot;. It was a regional capital in Srivijaya. Some Thai historians argue it was the capital of Srivijaya itself, but this is generally discounted.

==History==

===Formation and growth===

====Siddhayatra====
Around 500 CE, the roots of the Srivijayan empire began to develop around present-day Palembang, Sumatra. The Kedukan Bukit inscription (683)—considered to be the oldest inscription related to Srivijaya, discovered on the banks of the Tatang River near the Karanganyar site, states about the &quot;glorious Srivijaya&quot;, a &quot;kadatuan&quot; (kingdom or polity) which was founded by Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa and his retinue. He had embarked on a sacred &quot;siddhayatra&quot; journey and led 20,000 troops and 312 people in boats with 1,312 foot soldiers from Minanga Tamwan to Jambi and Palembang. Many of these armed forces gathered under Srivijayan rule would have been the sea people, referred to generally as the &quot;orang laut&quot;. In establishing its power, Srivijaya had first to consolidate its position in Southeast Sumatra, which at that time consisted of multiple quasi-independent polities ruled by local Datus (chieftain).

From the Old Malay inscriptions, it is known that Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa launched a maritime conquest in 684 with 20,000 men in the &quot;siddhayatra&quot; journey to acquire wealth, power, and &#x27;magical powers&#x27;. Under the leadership of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa, the Melayu Kingdom became the first kingdom to be integrated into Srivijaya. This possibly occurred in the 680s. Melayu, also known as Jambi, was rich in gold and was held in high esteem at the time. Srivijaya recognised that the submission of Melayu would increase its own prestige.

The empire was organised in three main zones: the estuarine capital region centred on Palembang, the Musi River basin which served as a hinterland, and estuarine areas capable of forming rival power centres. The areas upstream of the Musi River were rich in various commodities valuable to Chinese traders. The capital was administered directly by the ruler, while the hinterland remained under local datus or tribal chiefs, who were organised into a network of alliances with the Srivijaya maharaja or king. Force was the dominant element in the empire&#x27;s relations with rival river systems such as the Batang Hari River, centred in Jambi.

The Telaga Batu inscription, discovered in Sabokingking, eastern Palembang, is also a &quot;siddhayatra&quot; inscription, from the 7th century. This inscription was very likely used in a ceremonial &quot;sumpah&quot; (allegiance ritual). The top of the stone is adorned with seven nāga heads, and on the lower portion there is a water spout to channel liquid that was likely poured over the stone during a ritual. The ritual included a curse upon those who commit treason against Kadatuan Srivijaya.

The Talang Tuwo inscription is also a &quot;siddhayatra&quot; inscription. Discovered in Seguntang Hill, western Palembang, this inscription describes the establishment of the &quot;Śrīksetra&quot; garden endowed by King Jayanasa of Srivijaya for the well-being of all creatures. It is likely that the Seguntang Hill site was the location of the &quot;Śrīksetra&quot; garden.

====Regional conquests====
According to the Kota Kapur inscription discovered on Bangka Island, the empire conquered most of southern Sumatra and the neighbouring island of Bangka as far as Palas Pasemah in Lampung. Also, according to the inscriptions, Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa launched a military campaign against Java in the late 7th century, a period which coincided with the decline of Tarumanagara in West Java and the Kalingga in Central Java. The empire thus grew to control trade on the Strait of Malacca, the western side of Java Sea, and possibly the Gulf of Thailand.

Chinese records dating to the late 7th century mention two Sumatran kingdoms and three other kingdoms on Java as being part of Srivijaya. By the end of the 8th century, many western Javanese kingdoms, such as Tarumanagara and Kalingga, were within the Srivijayan sphere of influence.

===Golden age===
The 7th-century Sojomerto inscription mentions that an Old Malay-speaking Shivaist family led by Dapunta Selendra had established themselves in the Batang area of the northern coast of Central Java. He was possibly the progenitor of the Sailendra family. By the early 8th century, an influential Buddhist family related to Srivijaya, the Sailendra family of Javanese ancestry, dominated Central Java.

====Conquest of the Malay Peninsula====

During the 7th century, Langkasuka on the Malay Peninsula became part of Srivijaya. Soon after this, Pan Pan and Tambralinga, north of Langkasuka, came under Srivijayan influence. These kingdoms on the peninsula were major trading nations that transported goods across the Kra Isthmus.

The Ligor inscription in Vat Sema Muang says that Maharaja Dharmasetu of Srivijaya ordered the construction of three sanctuaries dedicated to the Bodhisattvas Padmapani, Vajrapani, and Buddha in the northern Malay Peninsula.

====Sailendra dynasty rule====
The Sailendras of Java established a relationship with the Sumatran Srivijayan lineage, and then further established their rule and authority in the Mataram Kingdom of Central Java. It is unknown what the exact nature of their relationship was, with Arab sources mentioning that Zabag (Java) ruled over Sribuza (Srivijaya), Kalah (a place in the Malay peninsula, probably Kedah), and Ramni (a place in Sumatra, probably Lambri).

In Java, Dharanindra&#x27;s successor was Samaragrawira (r. 800–819), mentioned in the Nalanda inscription (dated 860) as the father of Balaputradewa, and the son of &quot;Śailendravamsatilaka&quot; (the jewel of the Śailendra family) with the stylised name &quot;Śrīviravairimathana&quot; (the slayer of a heroic enemy), which refers to Dharanindra. Unlike his predecessor, the expansive and warlike Dharanindra, Samaragrawira seems to have been a pacifist, enjoying the peaceful prosperity of interior Java in the Kedu Plain and being more interested in completing the Borobudur project. It was in these years, at the beginning of the 9th century, that the Khmer prince Jayavarman II was appointed governor of Indrapura in the Mekong Delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was later proven to be a mistake, as Jayavarman II revolted, moved his capital further inland north from Tonle Sap to Mahendraparvata, severing the link to Srivijaya and proclaimed Khmer independent from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married Tārā, daughter of Dharmasetu. He was mentioned by his other name Rakai Warak in the Mantyasih inscription.

Earlier historians, such as N. J. Krom and Cœdes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and Samaratungga as the same person. However, later historians such as Slamet Muljana equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in the Mantyasih inscription as the 5th monarch of the Mataram kingdom. This would mean that Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.

Dewi Tara, the daughter of Dharmasetu, married Samaratunga, a member of the Sailendra family who assumed the throne of Srivijaya around 792. By the 8th century, the Srivijayan court was virtually located in Java, as the Sailendras monarch rose to become the Maharaja of Srivijaya.

After Dharmasetu, Samaratungga became the next Maharaja of Srivijaya. He reigned from 792 to 835. Unlike the expansionist Dharmasetu, Samaratungga did not indulge in military expansion but preferred to strengthen the Srivijayan hold on Java. He personally oversaw the construction of the grand monument of Borobudur; a massive stone mandala, which was completed in 825, during his reign. According to Cœdès, &quot;In the second half of the ninth century Java and Sumatra were united under the rule of a Sailendra reigning in Java... its center at Palembang.&quot; Samaratungga, like Samaragrawira, seems to have been influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strove to become a peaceful and benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess Pramodhawardhani who was betrothed to Shivaite Rakai Pikatan, son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seemed to be an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.

====Return to Palembang====

Prince Balaputra, however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani in Central Java. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani are interpreted differently by some historians. An older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which would make him the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.

It is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of a succession dispute with Pikatan, or already ruled in Sumatra. Either way, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and was enthroned in the Srivijayan capital of Palembang. Historians have argued that this was because Balaputra&#x27;s mother Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira, was the princess of Srivijaya, making Balaputra the heir of the Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of the Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in the Nalanda inscription dated 860.

After a trade disruption at Canton between 820 and 850, the ruler of Jambi (Melayu Kingdom) was able to assert enough independence to send missions to China in 853 and 871. The Melayu Kingdom&#x27;s independence coincided with the troubled times when the Sailendran Balaputradewa was expelled from Java and later seized the throne of Srivijaya. The new maharaja was able to dispatch a tributary mission to China by 902. Two years after that, the weakening Tang dynasty conferred a title on a Srivijayan envoy.

In the first half of the 10th century, between the fall of Tang dynasty and the rise of Song, there was brisk trading between the overseas world with the Fujian kingdom of Min and the rich Guangdong kingdom of Nan Han. Srivijaya undoubtedly benefited from this. Sometime around 903, the Muslim writer Ibn Rustah was so impressed with the wealth of the Srivijayan ruler that he declared that one would not hear of a king who was richer, stronger or had more revenue. The main urban centres of Srivijaya were then at Palembang (especially the Karanganyar site near Seguntang Hill area), Muara Jambi and Kedah.

====War against Java====

In the 10th century, the rivalry between Sumatran Srivijaya and the Javanese Mataram kingdom became more intense and hostile. The animosity was probably caused by Srivijaya&#x27;s effort to reclaim the Sailendra lands in Java or by Mataram&#x27;s aspiration to challenge Srivijaya domination in the region. In East Java, the Anjukladang inscription dated 937 mentions an infiltration attack from Malayu — which refers to a Srivijayan attack upon the Mataram Kingdom of East Java. The villagers of Anjuk Ladang were awarded for their service and merit in assisting the king&#x27;s army, under the leadership of Mpu Sindok, in repelling invading Malayu (Sumatra) forces; subsequently, a &quot;jayastambha&quot; (victory monument) was erected in their honor.

In 990, King Dharmawangsa of Java launched a naval invasion against Srivijaya and attempted to capture the capital Palembang. The news of the Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese Song period sources. In 988, a Srivijayan envoy was sent to the Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourning for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country had been attacked by Java which made him unable to return home. In 992 an envoy from Java arrived in the Chinese court and explained that their country was involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however, he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed to the Chinese Emperor for the protection of Srivijaya against Javanese invaders.

Dharmawangsa&#x27;s invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, to seek protection from China. Warmadewa was known as an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills. In the midst of the crisis brought by the Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of &quot;San-fo-qi&quot; was dispatched by the king &quot;Shi-li-zhu-luo-wu-ni-fo-ma-tiao-hua&quot; (Sri Cudamani Warmadewa). The Srivijayan envoy told the Chinese court that in their country a Buddhist temple had been erected to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, and asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple &quot;Ch&#x27;eng-t&#x27;en-wan-shou&quot; (&#x27;ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.

In 1006, Srivijaya&#x27;s alliance proved its resilience by successfully repelling the Javanese invasion. This attack opened the eyes of Srivijayan Maharaja to the threat of the Javanese Mataram Kingdom, so he laid a plan to destroy his Javanese rival. Srivijaya assisted Haji (king) Wurawari of Lwaram to revolt, which led to the attack and destruction of the Mataram palace. This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa&#x27;s daughter, which left the court unprepared and shocked. With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the Mataram capital, Srivijaya contributed to the collapse of Mataram kingdom, leaving Eastern Java in further unrest, violence and, ultimately, desolation for several years to come.

===Decline===
====Chola invasion====

The factors in the decline of Srivijaya were foreign piracy and raids that disrupted trade and security in the region. Rajendra Chola, the Chola king from Tamil Nadu in South India, launched naval raids on ports of Srivijaya in 1025. His navy sailed swiftly to Sumatra using monsoon winds, made a stealth attack and raided Srivijaya&#x27;s 14 ports. The strike took Srivijaya by surprise and unprepared; they first ransacked the capital city of Palembang and then swiftly moved on to other ports including Kadaram (modern Kedah).

The Cholas are known to have benefitted from both piracy and foreign trade. At times, the Chola&#x27;s seafaring led to outright plunder and conquest as far as Southeast Asia. An inscription of King Rajendra states that he had captured the King of Kadaram, Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman, son of Mara Vijayatunggavarman, and plundered many treasures including the &quot;Vidhyadara-torana,&quot; the jewelled &#x27;war gate&#x27; of Srivijaya adorned with great splendour.

According to the 15th-century &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, Rajendra Chola I after the successful naval raid in 1025 married Onang Kiu, the daughter of Vijayottunggavarman. This invasion forced Srivijaya to make peace with the Javanese kingdom of Kahuripan. The peace deal was brokered by the exiled daughter of Vijayottunggavarman, who managed to escape the destruction of Palembang, and came to the court of King Airlangga in East Java. She also became the queen consort of Airlangga named Dharmaprasadottungadevi and, in 1035, Airlangga constructed a Buddhist monastery named Srivijayasrama dedicated to his queen consort.

The Cholas continued a series of raids and conquests against parts of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula for the next 20 years. The expedition of Rajendra Chola I had such a lasting impression on the Malay people of the period that his name is even mentioned (as &quot;Raja Chulan&quot;) in the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;. Even today the Chola rule is remembered in Malaysia as many Malaysian princes have names ending with Cholan or Chulan, such as the Raja of Perak, Raja Chulan.

Rajendra Chola&#x27;s overseas expeditions against Srivijaya were unique in India&#x27;s history and its otherwise peaceful relations with the states of Southeast Asia. The reasons for the naval expeditions are uncertain as the sources do not state its exact causes. Nilakanta Sastri suggests that the attacks were probably caused by Srivijaya&#x27;s attempts to throw obstacles in the way of Chola&#x27;s trade with the East or, more probably, a simple desire on the part of Rajendra Chola to extend his military victories to well known countries to gain prestige. The new research however, suggests that the attack was a pre-emptive strike with a commercial motive. Rajendra Chola&#x27;s naval strike was a geostrategic manoeuvre.

The raids gravely weakened the Srivijayan hegemony and enabled the formation of regional kingdoms like Kediri, which were based on intensive agriculture rather than coastal and long-distance trade. With the passing of time, the regional trading centre shifted from the old Srivijayan capital of Palembang to another trade centre on the island of Sumatra, Jambi, which was the centre of Malayu.

====Under the Cholas====
&quot;Sanfoqi&quot; sent a mission to China in 1028, but this would refer to Malayu-Jambi, not Srivijaya-Palembang. No Srivijayan envoys arrived in China between 1028 and 1077. This indicates that the &quot;mandala&quot; of Srivijaya has faded. It is very possible that Srivijaya collapsed in 1025. In the following centuries, Chinese chronicles still mentioned &quot;Sanfoqi&quot;, but this term probably refers to the Malayu-Jambi kingdom, evidenced by the Chinese record of &quot;Sanfoqi Zhanbei guo&quot; (Jambi country of Sanfoqi). The last epigraphic evidence that mentions the word &quot;Sriwijaya&quot; or &quot;Srivijaya&quot; comes from the Tanjore inscription of the Chola kingdom in 1030 or 1031.

Chola control over Srivijaya lasted for several decades. Chinese chronicles mentioned &quot;Sanfoqi Zhu-nian guo&quot; which means &quot;Chola country of Sanfoqi&quot;, likely refer to Kedah. &quot;Sanfoqi Zhu-nian guo&quot; sent missions to China in 1077, 1079, 1082, 1088, and 1090. It is possible that the Cholas installed a crown prince in the Tamil-dominated area of the Malacca Strait.

There is also evidence to suggest that Kulottunga Chola, the maternal grandson of emperor Rajendra Chola I, in his youth (1063) was in Srivijaya, restoring order and maintaining Chola influence in that area. Virarajendra Chola states in his inscription, dated in the 7th year of his reign, that he conquered Kadaram (Kedah) and gave it back to its king who came and worshiped his feet. These expeditions were led by Kulottunga to help the Sailendra king who had sought the help of Virarajendra Chola. An inscription of Canton mentions Ti-hua-kialo as the ruler of Srivijaya. According to historians, this ruler is the same as the Chola ruler Ti-hua-kialo (identified with Kulottunga) mentioned in the Song annals and who sent an embassy to China. According to Tan Yeok Song, the editor of the Srivijayan inscription of Canton, Kulottunga stayed in Kadaram (Kedah) after the naval expedition of 1067 AD and reinstalled its king before returning to South India and ascending the throne.

Tamil colonization of the Malacca Strait seems to have lasted for a century. The Cholas left several inscriptions in northern Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Tamil influence can be found in works of art (sculpture and temple architecture), it indicated government activity rather than commerce. Chola&#x27;s grip on northern Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula receded in the 12th century — the Tamil poem &quot;Kalingatupparani&quot; of ca. 1120 CE mentioned Kulottungga&#x27;s destruction of Kadaram (Kedah). After that, Kedah disappeared from Indian sources.

====Successor state Malayu Dharmasraya====

After the fall of Shailendra dynasty in Sumatra in the 11th century, and a period of Chola involvements in the region, there are no clear records which can explain the period ensuing the fall of Srivijaya. Almost 150 years later, a new dynasty emerged in the region replacing the Sailendras. They were the Mauli dynasty that ruled the Melayu Kingdom in Jambi by the Batang Hari river valley. This late 12th century Malayu Dharmasraya kingdom can be considered as the successor of Srivijaya. The oldest inscription bearing the name of Maharaja Mauli is the Grahi inscription dated 1183.

==Government and economy==

===Political administration===
The 7th century Telaga Batu inscription, discovered in Sabokingking, Palembang, testifies to the complexity and stratified titles of the Srivijayan state officials. These titles are mentioned: &quot;rājaputra&quot; (princes, lit: sons of king), &quot;kumārāmātya&quot; (ministers), &quot;bhūpati&quot; (regional rulers), &quot;senāpati&quot; (generals), &quot;nāyaka&quot; (local community leaders), &quot;pratyaya&quot; (nobles), &quot;hāji pratyaya&quot; (lesser kings), &quot;dandanayaka&quot; (judges), &quot;tuhā an vatak&quot; (workers inspectors), &quot;vuruh&quot; (workers), &quot;addhyāksi nījavarna&quot; (lower supervisors), &quot;vāsīkarana&quot; (blacksmiths/weapon makers), &quot;cātabhata&quot; (soldiers), &quot;adhikarana&quot; (officials), &quot;kāyastha&quot; (store workers), &quot;sthāpaka&quot; (artisans), &quot;puhāvam&quot; (ship captains), &quot;vaniyāga&quot; (traders), &quot;marsī hāji&quot; (king&#x27;s servants), &quot;hulun hāji&quot; (king&#x27;s slaves).

During its formation, the empire was organised in three main zones — the estuarine capital region centred on Palembang, the Musi River basin which served as hinterland and source of valuable goods, and rival estuarine areas capable of forming rival power centres. These rival estuarine areas, through raids and conquests, were held under Srivijayan power, such as the Batanghari estuarine (Malayu in Jambi). Several strategic ports also included places like Bangka Island (Kota Kapur), ports and kingdoms in Java (highly possible Tarumanagara and Kalingga), Kedah and Chaiya in Malay peninsula, and Lamuri and Pannai in northern Sumatra. There are also reports mentioning the Java-Srivijayan raids on Southern Cambodia (Mekong estuarine) and ports of Champa.

After its expansion to the neighbouring states, the Srivijayan empire was formed as a collection of several Kadatuans (local principalities), which swore allegiance to the central ruling powerful Kadatuan ruled by the Srivijayan Maharaja. The political relations and system relating to its realms is described as a mandala model, typical of that of classical Southeast Asian Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms. It could be described as federation of kingdoms or vassalised polity under a centre of domination, namely the central Kadatuan Srivijaya. The polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing further administrative integration.

The relations between the central kadatuan and its member (subscribers) kadatuans were dynamic. As such, the status would shift over generations. Minor trading ports throughout the region were controlled by local vassal rulers in place on behalf of the king. They also presided over harvesting resources from their respective regions for export. A portion of their revenue was required to be paid to the king. They were not allowed to infringe upon international trade relations, but the temptation of keeping more money to themselves eventually led foreign traders and local rulers to conduct illicit trading relations of their own. Other sources claim that the Champa invasion had weakened the central government significantly, forcing vassals to keep the international trade revenue for themselves.

In addition to coercive methods through raids and conquests and being bound by &quot;pasumpahan&quot; (oath of allegiance), the royalties of each kadatuan often formed alliances through dynastic marriages. For example, a previously suzerained kadatuan over time might rise in prestige and power, so that eventually its ruler could lay claim to be the maharaja of the central kadatuan. The relationship between Srivijayan in Sumatra (descendants of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa) and Sailendras in Java exemplified this political dynamic.

===Economy===

==== Trade agreements and commerce ====
The main goal of Srivijayan foreign economic relations was to secure a lucrative trade agreement to serve the large Chinese market, that spanned from the Tang dynasty to the Song dynasty. In order to participate in this trade agreement, Srivijaya was involved in a tributary relation with China, in which they sent several envoys and embassies to secure the Chinese court&#x27;s favour. By 1178, a Srivijayan mission to China highlighted Srivijaya&#x27;s role as an intermediary to acquire Bornean products, such as plum flower-shaped Borneo camphor planks.

In the world of commerce, Srivijaya rose rapidly to be a far-flung empire controlling the two passages between India and China, namely the Sunda Strait from Palembang and the Malacca Strait from Kedah. Arab accounts state that the empire of the Srivijayan Maharaja was so vast that the swiftest vessel would not have been able to travel around all its islands in two years. The islands that the accounts referred to produced camphor, aloes, sandal-wood, spices like cloves, nutmegs, cardamom and cubebs, as well as ivory, gold and tin, all of which made the wealth of the Maharaja equal to any king in Medieval India.

==== Riverine system model ====
Besides interregional trade agreements, the Srivijayan economy is also theorized to have adopted a &quot;riverine system model&quot;, where dominance of a river-system and river-mouth centres guaranteed the kingdom&#x27;s control of the flow of goods from the hinterland region upstream of the river; as well as control on trade within the Straits of Malacca and international trade routes going through the strait. Srivijaya&#x27;s victory on its dominance of river-mouths centres on the Sumatra, Malaya and western Java coasts ensured Palembang&#x27;s control over the region. This was accomplished through its system of: &#x27;oath of allegiances&#x27; to local elites; its efforts on redistributions of wealth; and alliances made with local &quot;datus&quot; (chieftains) rather than on direct coercion.

==== Items of trade and barter system ====
The port of Srivijaya served as an important entrepôt in which valuable commodities from the region and beyond were collected, traded and shipped. Rice, cotton, indigo and silver from Java; aloes, resin, camphor, ivory, rhino horns, tin and gold from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula; rattan, rare timber, camphor, gems and precious stones from Borneo; exotic birds and rare animals, iron, sappan, sandalwood, and rare spices including clove and nutmeg from the Eastern Indonesian archipelago; various spices of Southeast Asia and India including pepper, cubeb and cinnamon; also Chinese ceramics, lacquerware, brocade, fabrics, silks, and Chinese artwork were among valuable commodities being traded in Srivijayan ports. What goods were actually native to Srivijaya is currently disputed due to the volume of cargo that regularly passed through the region from India, China, and Arabia. Foreign traders stopped to trade their cargo in Srivijaya with other merchants from Southeast Asia and beyond. It was an easy location for traders from different regions to meet as opposed to visiting each other directly. This system of trade has led researchers to conjecture that the actual native products of Srivijaya were far less than what was originally recorded by Chinese and Arabic traders of the time. It may be that cargo sourced from foreign regions accumulated in Srivijaya. The accumulation of particular foreign goods that were easily accessible and in large supply might have given the impression they were products of Srivijaya. This could also work in the opposite direction with some native Srivijayan goods being mistaken as foreign commodities.

Ceramics were a major trade commodity between Srivijaya and China with shard artefacts found along the coast of Sumatra and Java. It is assumed that China and Srivijaya may have had an exclusive ceramics trade relationship because particular ceramic shards can only be found at their point of origin, in Guangzhou, or in Indonesia, but nowhere else along the trade route. There have been some discrepancies with the dating of said artifacts. Ceramic sherds found around the Geding Suro temple complex have been revealed to be much more recent than previously assumed. A statuette found in the same area did align with Srivijayan chronology, but it has been suggested that this is merely a coincidence and the product was actually brought to the region recently.

The currency of the empire was gold and silver coins embossed with the image of the sandalwood flower (of which Srivijaya had a trade monopoly on) and the word &quot;vara,&quot; or &quot;glory,&quot; in Sanskrit. Other items could be used to barter with, such as porcelain, silk, sugar, iron, rice, dried galangal, rhubarb, and camphor. Some Arabic sources record that the profits acquired from trade ports and levies were converted into gold and hidden by the King in the royal pond.

==== Trade relations with Arabia ====
Other than fostering lucrative trade relations with India and China, Srivijaya also established commerce links with Arabia. In a highly plausible account, a messenger was sent by Maharaja Sri Indravarman to deliver a letter to Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz of the Umayyad Caliphate in 718. The messenger later returned to Srivijaya with a &quot;Zanji&quot; (a black female slave from Zanj), a gift from the Caliph to the Maharaja. Later, a Chinese chronicle made mention of Sri Indravarman and how the Maharaja of Srivijaya had sent the Chinese Emperor a &quot;ts&#x27;engchi&quot; (Chinese spelling of the Arabic &quot;Zanji&quot;) as a gift in 724.

Arab writers of the 9th and 10th century, in their writings, considered the king of Al-Hind (India and to some extent might include Southeast Asia) as one of the four great kings in the world. The reference to the kings of Al-Hind might have also included the kings of Southeast Asia; Sumatra, Java, Burma and Cambodia. They are, invariably, depicted by the Arab writers as extremely powerful and being equipped with vast armies of men, horses and having tens of thousands of elephants. They were also said to be in possession of vast treasures of gold and silver. Trading records from the 9th and 10th centuries mention Srivijaya, but do not expand upon regions further east, indicating that Arabic traders were not engaging with other regions in Southeast Asia, serving as further evidence of Srivijaya&#x27;s important role as a link between the two regions.

===Thalassocratic empire===

For some periods, Srivijaya controlled the transoceanic trade in its central passage in the Strait of Malacca, as part of the Maritime Silk Road. This has led some historian to argue that the amorphous statehood of Srivijaya, which dominated a confederation of semi autonomous port cities in the Maritime Southeast Asia, was actually a Thalassocracy. However, the true nature of Srivijaya naval development and maritime hegemony is still a subject of studies and disagreements among historians.

Srivijaya benefited from the lucrative maritime trade between China and India as well as trading in products such as Maluku spices within the Malay Archipelago. Serving as Southeast Asia&#x27;s main entrepôt and gaining trade patronage by the Chinese court, Srivijaya was constantly managing its trade networks and, was always wary of potential rival ports of its neighbouring kingdoms. A majority of the revenue from international trade was used to finance the military which was charged with the responsibility of protecting the ports. Some records even describe the use of iron chains to prevent pirate attacks.

Srivijayan settlers may have colonized some parts of Madagascar. The migration to Madagascar was estimated to have taken place around 830.

====7th to 11th centuries====
Previously it was assumed that Srivijaya was a maritime power that could not be separated from ethnicity and society in the Malacca Strait. The assumption that occurs is that the formation of a successful state and hegemony in the strait is directly related to the ability to participate in international maritime activities, which means that a shore-based state like this develops and maintains its power with its navy. However, a survey of the available information shows that such an assumption is incorrect. Data on maritime activity are scanty and mentions of their navy occurs only in incomplete sources. Even the material aspects of Southeast Asian navies were not known until the 15th century, scientific attention generally focused on shipbuilding techniques.

In the Kedukan Bukit inscription (683 AD), it is recorded that only 312 people used boats out of a total force of 20,000 people, which also included 1312 land soldiers. The large number of ground troops shows that Srivijaya&#x27;s navy only acted as a minor provider of logistical support. In the 8th century, Srivijaya&#x27;s naval capabilities grew to match the proportion of its army strength, although it only played a role as logistical support.

The absence of any terms denoting maritime vessel for general use and military showed that the navy was not a permanent aspect of Srivijaya. Even when neighboring powers in maritime Asia, especially Java during the 10th to 14th centuries, and the Chola Empire in the 11th century, began to develop their navies, Srivijaya&#x27;s naval power was relatively weak. For example, &quot;Songshi&quot; and &quot;Wenxian&quot; &quot;Tongkao&quot; note that between 990 and 991, a Srivijayan envoy was unable to return from South China to Palembang because of the ongoing military conflict between Java and Srivijaya. However the Javanese, Arabs from the Middle East, and South Asia were able to maintain diplomatic and economic exchanges with China during this time. The Javanese navy was strong enough to seriously disrupt Srivijaya&#x27;s communications with China. Despite the naval confrontation between Java and Srivijaya, communication between the coastal governments of the Indian Ocean and China continued during this time, suggesting that the conflict did not always occur on the high seas, but was more likely to be confined to the estuaries and rivers around the Srivijayan capital of Palembang, the mouth of the Musi River and the Bangka Straits.

Srivijaya&#x27;s response to Javanese aggression appeared to be defensive. In his account of &quot;Sanfoqi&quot;, Zhao Rugua records in &quot;Zhufanzhi&quot; (ca. 1225):
In the past, [this state] used an iron chain as a barrier to prepare against other robbing parties (arriving on vessels?). There were opportunities to release (i.e. draw) it by hand. If merchant ships arrive, it has to be released&quot;.

The inability of the Malacca Strait states to respond to maritime threats became very clear in the early 11th century. Between 1017 and 1025, the Chola Empire raided the main Malay ports in the strait and the Gulf of Siam, including Kedah, Malay (Jambi), Lambri, Srivijaya, and Langkasuka, looted the Kedah treasury and captured Srivijayan rulers, a further indication of the incompetence of the Malacca Strait states to defend themselves from naval attacks.

Until the 11th century, at least in terms of their military outlook, the kingdom was arguably land-based. Only with the changing international context from the 11th century onwards, marked initially by the Chola attacks, and then with the increasing presence of Chinese merchants directly operating in Southeast Asian waters, coupled with the emergence of new powers on the seafront, did the role and nature of these navies begin to change.

==== 12th to 13th centuries ====
After the Chola attack, historians believe that Srivijaya may be no longer the appropriate name for the overlord&#x27;s centre, and epigraphic references to &#x27;Sriwijaya&#x27; also ceased after the attack. However, the Chinese term for Srivijaya, namely &quot;Sanfoqi&quot;, was still used centuries later, but after 1025 the term &quot;Sanfoqi&quot; referred to the Malayu Dharmasraya kingdom where the mandala was re-centred. The new records appeared in the &quot;Lingwai daida&quot; (1178 CE), written by Zhou Qufei:
This country (Sanfoqi) has no products, but its people are well trained in warfare. When they put medicine on their body, they can&#x27;t be hurt. In offensive naval warfare, their attacks are unmatched. Therefore, neighboring countries are aligned with it. If foreign ships passing through the vicinity do not call in this state, [vessels] are sent to teach them a lesson and to kill. Therefore, the state is rich, with rhino horn, elephant [tusks] (ivory), pearls, aromatics and medicines.

Similar information about &quot;Sanfoqi&quot; is also recorded in &quot;Zhufanzhi&quot; (c. 1225), which records:All are excellent in maritime and land warfare. At any time that a mobilisation order is established, chieftains [are the ones who] command [the troops]. All of them prepare and equip [themselves] with soldiers, equipment, and food. Arriving at the enemy, they dare to die (i.e. are not afraid of dying). [Hence it is regarded as] the elder of the various states (i.e. first amongst equals)... This state is at the middle of the sea, controlling the choke-point through which the various foreign vessels come and go. In the past, [it] used an iron chain as a barrier... This year (i.e. presently), it is not taut (i.e. not extended) and not used, [lying in a] pile in the water... If merchant ships cross [the vicinity] and do not enter [i.e. call at the port], then ships are dispatched to do battle [with them]. They have to die (i.e. the persons onboard the merchant ships have to be killed). Hence, this state (Sanfoqi) is a great shipping centre.

This information may refer to sea and river warfare in particular given the extensive navigation capabilities of the Musi and Batang Hari rivers where the main centres of the kingdoms around the Malacca Strait (Palembang and Jambi) were located. These records show that both the nature of the navy and the role it played in the survival of the government itself, in the late 12th and 13th centuries, became very different.

At the same time, the 12th century saw the beginning of the decline of the empires around the Malacca Strait and in the eyes of its foreign partners. Kedah fell outside the influence of &quot;Sanfoqi&quot; during the 11th century. By the early 13th century, Pahang, Kuala Beranang and Kompei had established direct economic links with the Chinese port of Quanzhou. Jambi became independent from &quot;Sanfoqi&quot;&#x27;s influence in the early 13th century, while Ligor fell under the influence of Tambralingga in the 1230s.

After Singhasari&#x27;s attack on &quot;Malayu&quot; in 1275, a large number of Malay port-states emerged in the strait, each seeking to engage directly with foreign traders, with varying degrees of success. Therefore, the development of an increasingly proactive naval strategy was not only a reaction to the changing nature of interactions with major trading partners such as China and India, but also as a result of the polities&#x27; declining power.

==== Ship types ====
Textual record of Srivijayan vessels are very lacking, as Old Malay epigraphical records rarely mentioned watercraft. The Kedukan Bukit inscription (683 AD) mentioned &quot;samvau&quot; (modern Malay: &quot;Sampan&quot;). A ship type called &quot;lancang&quot; is identified as a Malay type of ship in later records, but during the Srivijaya era, the ship was mentioned in 2 inscriptions on the northern coast of Bali dated 896 and 923 AD. These inscriptions are written in the Old Balinese language, and not in Old Malay.

====Srivijayan exploration====
The core of the Srivijayan realm was concentrated in and around the Malacca and Sunda straits and in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and Western Java. However, between the 9th and the 12th centuries, the influence of Srivijaya seems to have extended far beyond this core. Srivijayan navigators may have reached as far as Madagascar. The migration to Madagascar was estimated to have taken place around 830 CE. According to an extensive mitochondrial DNA study, native Malagasy people today can likely trace their heritage back to 30 founding mothers who sailed from Indonesia 1,200 years ago. Malagasy contains loan words from Sanskrit, with all the local linguistic modifications via Javanese or Malay, hinting that Madagascar may have been colonised by settlers from Srivijaya.

==Culture and society==
Srivijaya-Palembang&#x27;s significance both as a centre for trade and for the practice of Vajrayana Buddhism has been established by Arab and Chinese historical records over several centuries. Srivijaya&#x27; own historical documents, inscriptions in Old Malay, are limited to the second half of the 7th century. The inscriptions uncover the hierarchical leadership system, in which the king is served by many other high-status officials. A complex, stratified, cosmopolitan and prosperous society with their tastes in art, literature and culture, with complex set of rituals, influenced by Mahayana Buddhism; blossomed in ancient Srivijayan society. Their complex social order can be seen through studies on inscriptions, foreign accounts, and in bas-reliefs of temples from this period. Their accomplished artistry was evidenced from a number of Srivijayan Mahayana Buddhist statues discovered in the region. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which was characterised by the heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom. Some forms of metallurgy were used as jewelry, coins and as decorative status symbols.

===Art and culture===
Some art was heavily influenced by Buddhism, further spreading religion and ideologies through the trade of art. The Buddhist art and architecture of Srivijaya was influenced by the Indian art of the Gupta Empire and Pala Empire. This is evident in the Indian Amaravati style Buddha statue located in Palembang. This statue, dating back to the 7th or 8th century, is evidence of the spread of art, culture, and ideology through trade. According to various historical sources, a complex and cosmopolitan society with a culture deeply influenced by Vajrayana Buddhism, flourished in the Srivijayan capital. The 7th century Talang Tuwo inscription described Buddhist rituals and blessings at the event of establishing a public park. This inscription allowed historians to understand the practices being held at the time, as well as their importance to the function of Srivijayan society. Talang Tuwo serves as one of the world&#x27;s oldest inscriptions that talks about the environment, highlighting the centrality of nature in Buddhist religion and Srivijayan society. The Kota Kapur inscription mentions Srivijayan military dominance against Java.

The Old Malay language, the predecessor the modern Malay language, had been used since the 7th century in the Malay Archipelago as evident by inscriptions in the coastal areas of the archipelago, such as those discovered in Java. The language was spread by traders and become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the archipelago.

Despite its economic, cultural and military advances, Srivijaya left few archaeological remains in their heartlands in Sumatra. Some Buddhist temples dated from Srivijayan era are found in Sumatra and are Muaro Jambi, Muara Takus and Biaro Bahal.

Some Buddhist sculptures, such as Buddha Vairocana, Boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara and Maitreya, were discovered at numerous sites in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. These archaeological findings such as the stone statue of Buddha discovered in Bukit Seguntang, Palembang, Avalokiteshvara from Bingin Jungut in Musi Rawas, the bronze Maitreya statue of Komering, all discovered in South Sumatra. In Jambi, a golden statue of Avalokiteshvara was discovered in Rataukapastuo, Muarabulian. In the Malay Peninsula the bronze statue of Avalokiteshvara of Bidor was discovered in Perak, and Avalokiteshvara of Chaiya in Southern Thailand. The difference in material, supports the spread of Buddhism through trade.

After the bronze and Iron Age, an influx of bronze tools and jewelry spread throughout the region. The different styles of bangles and beads represent the different regions of origin and their own specific materials and techniques used. Chinese artwork was one of the main items traded in the region, spreading art styles enveloped in ceramics, pottery, fabrics, silk, and artwork.

===Religion===
Remnants of Buddhist shrines (stupas) near Palembang and neighboring areas aid researchers in their understanding of the Buddhism within this society. Srivijaya and its kings were instrumental in the spread of Buddhism as they established it in places they conquered like Java and Malaya. People making pilgrimages were encouraged to spend time with the monks in the capital city of Palembang on their journey to India.

Other than Palembang, three Srivijayan archaeological sites in Sumatra are notable for their Buddhist temple density. They are Muaro Jambi by the bank of the Batang Hari River in Jambi province; Muara Takus stupas in the Kampar River valley of Riau province; and Biaro Bahal temple compound in the Barumun and Pannai river valleys, North Sumatra province. It is highly possible that these Buddhist sites served as &quot;sangha&quot; community; the monastic Buddhist learning centres of the region.

In the 5th century AD, the Chinese monk Faxian visited the region. 250 years later, the monk Yijing stayed in Srivijaya for six months and studied Sanskrit. According to Yijing, within Palembang there were more than 1,000 monks studying for themselves and training traveling scholars who were going from India to China and vice versa. Most of these travelers stayed in Palembang for long periods of time to wait for Monsoon winds to help further their journey.

A stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism, Srivijaya attracted pilgrims and scholars from other parts of Asia. These included the Chinese monk Yijing, who made several lengthy visits to Sumatra on his way to study at Nalanda University in India in 671 and 695, and the 11th century Bengali Buddhist scholar Atisha, who played a major role in the development of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet. Yijing and other monks of his time practiced a pure version of Buddhism although the religion allowed for cultural changes to be made. He is also given credit for translating Buddhist text which has the most instructions on the discipline of the religion. Yijing wrote his memoir of Buddhism whilst in Srivijaya. Travellers to these islands mentioned that gold coins were in use in the coastal areas but not inland. Srivijaya drew in priests from as far away as Korea.

A notable Srivijayan and revered Buddhist scholar was Dharmakirti who taught Buddhist philosophy in Srivijaya and Nalanda. The language diction of many inscriptions found near where Srivijaya once reigned incorporated Indian Tantric conceptions. This evidence makes it clear the relationship of the ruler and the concept of bodhisattva—one who was to become a Buddha. This is the first evidence seen in the archaeological record of a Southeast Asian ruler regarded as a religious leader/figure.

One thing researchers have found Srivijaya to be lacking is an emphasis in art and architecture. While neighboring regions have evidence of intricate architecture, Palembang lacks Buddhist stupas or sculptures.

Hinduism was also practiced in Srivijaya. This is based on the discovery of the Bumiayu temple ruin, a red brick Shivaist Hindu temple compound built and used between the 8th and 13th century. The Bumiayu temple site is located by the banks of the Lematang River, a tributary of the Musi River. This temple compound was probably built by a Kedatuan within Srivijaya&#x27;s mandala. The fact that a Hindu temple was discovered within the area of predominantly Buddhist Srivijaya suggests that Srivijaya&#x27;s two religious groups coexisted quite harmoniously.

According to the styles of Shiva and Agastya statues found in Bumiayu temple 1, those Hindu statues are dated from around the 9th to 10th-century. By the 12th to 13th-century it seems that the faith in Bumiayu was shifted from Hinduism to Tantric Buddhism.

==Relations with regional powers==
Although historical records and archaeological evidence are scarce, it appears that by the 7th century, Srivijaya had established suzerainty over large areas of Sumatra, western Java and much of the Malay Peninsula. Initially, Srivijaya dominated a confederation of semi-autonomous port cities in the region, through nurturing alliances and gaining fealty among these polities. Regarding its status as the central port of the region, it seems that Srivijaya had a unique &quot;ritual policy&quot; in its relations with the dominant powers of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China.

The oldest accounts of the empire come from Arabic and Chinese traders who noted in their travel logs of the importance of the empire in regional trade. Its location was instrumental in developing itself as a major port which connected China, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Control of the Malacca and Sunda Straits meant it controlled both the spice route traffic as well as local trade, charging a toll on passing ships. Serving as an entrepôt for Chinese, Malay, and Indian markets, the port of Palembang, accessible from the coast by way of a river, accumulated great wealth. Instead of traveling the entire distance from the Middle East to China, which would have taken about a year with the assistance of monsoon winds, it was easier to stop at Srivijaya. It took about half a year from either direction to reach Srivijaya which was a far more effective and efficient use of manpower and resources. A round trip from one end to Srivijaya and back would take the same amount of time to go the entire distance one way. This theory has been supported by evidence found in two local shipwrecks. One off the coast of Belitung, an island east of Sumatra, and another near Cirebon, a coastal city on the nearby island of Java. Both ships carried a variety of foreign cargo and, in the case of the Belitung wreck, had foreign origins.

The Melayu Kingdom was the first rival power centre absorbed into the empire, and thus began the domination of the region through trade and conquest in the 7th through the 9th centuries. The Melayu Kingdom&#x27;s gold mines in the Batang Hari River hinterland were a crucial economic resource and may be the origin of the word Suvarnadvipa, the Sanskrit name for Sumatra. Srivijaya helped spread Malay culture throughout Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and western Borneo. Its influence waned in the 11th century.

According to &quot;Song shi&quot;, a Song dynasty chronicle, &quot;Sanfoqi&quot; sent their envoys for the last time in 1178. Then in 1225 Chau Ju-kua mentioned that Palembang (Srivijaya) was a vassal kingdom that belonged to &quot;Sanfoqi&quot;. This means that between 1178 and 1225 the Srivijayan kingdom centred in Palembang was defeated by the Malayu kingdom centred in Jambi. Thus, the seat of the empire moved to Muaro Jambi in the last centuries of the kingdom existence.

Srivijaya was then in frequent conflict with, and ultimately subjugated by, the Javanese kingdoms of Singhasari and, later, Majapahit. This was not the first time the Srivijayans had a conflict with the Javanese. According to historian Paul Michel Munoz, the Javanese Sanjaya dynasty was a strong rival of Srivijaya in the 8th century when the Srivijayan capital was located in Java.

The Khmer Empire might also have been a tributary state in its early stages. It is mentioned that the Khmer king, Jayavarman II, spent years in the court of Sailendra in Java before returning to Cambodia to rule around 790. Influenced by the Javanese culture of the Sailendran-Srivijayan &quot;mandala&quot; (and likely eager to emulate the Javanese model in his court), he proclaimed Cambodian independence from Java and ruled as devaraja, establishing Khmer Empire and starting the Angkor era.

Some historians claim that Chaiya in Surat Thani province in southern Thailand was, at least temporarily, the capital of Srivijaya, but this claim is widely disputed. However, Chaiya was probably a regional centre of the kingdom.

Srivijaya also maintained close relations with the Pala Empire in Bengal. The Nalanda inscription, dated 860, records that Maharaja Balaputra dedicated a monastery at the Nalanda university in Pala. The relation between Srivijaya and the Chola dynasty of southern India was initially friendly during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I. In 1006, a Srivijayan Maharaja from the Sailendra dynasty, king Maravijayattungavarman, constructed the Chudamani Vihara in the port town of Nagapattinam. However, during the reign of Rajendra Chola I the relationship deteriorated as the Chola dynasty started to attack Srivijayan cities.

The reason for this sudden change in the relationship with the Chola kingdom is not fully known. However, as some historians suggest, that the Khmer king, Suryavarman I of the Khmer Empire, had requested aid from Emperor Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty against Tambralinga. After learning of Suryavarman&#x27;s alliance with Rajendra Chola, the Tambralinga kingdom requested aid from the Srivijaya king, Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. This eventually led to the Chola Empire coming into conflict with Srivijaya. The conflict ended with a victory for the Chola and heavy losses for Srivijaya and the capture of Sangramavijayottungavarman in the Chola raid in 1025. During the reign of Kulothunga Chola I, Srivijaya sent an embassy to the Chola dynasty.

==Legacy==
Although Srivijaya left few archaeological remains and was almost forgotten in the collective memory of Maritime Southeast Asia, the rediscovery of this ancient maritime empire by Cœdès in the 1920s raised the notion that it was possible for a widespread political entity to have thrived in Southeast Asia in the past. Modern Indonesian historians have used Srivijaya as a frame of reference of how ancient globalisation, foreign relations and maritime trade, have shaped Asian civilisation.

An important legacy of Srivijaya was its language. Unlike some inscriptions of Srivijayan contemporaries – Tarumanagara and other Javanese polities that use Sanskrit – Srivijayan inscriptions were written in Old Malay. This has promoted the status of local languages to the same status as Sanskrit; as the language of the elite. Sanskrit was only known in certain circles such as the brahmin and kavi, while Old Malay was a common language in the Srivijayan realm. This linguistic policy probably stemmed from the rather egalitarian nature of Mahayana Buddhism adhered to in Srivijaya, in contrast to the elitist nature of Hinduism. Unlike Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism did not have emphasize on a caste system that limited the use and knowledge of liturgical language to the Brahmin caste. For centuries, Srivijaya, through its expansion, economic power and military prowess, was responsible for the spread of Old Malay throughout the Malay Archipelago. It was the working language of traders, being used in various ports and marketplaces in the region.
Today, in Indonesian artistic tradition, songket weaving art is strongly associated with Palembang, and to a certain extent West Sumatra and Jambi. This has motivated Indonesian historians to trace the origin of songket and its possible link to Srivijaya. Based on an archaeological study on the Bumiayu temple complex in Penukal Abab Lematang Ilir Regency, South Sumatra, it can be seen that songket has been known by the people of South Sumatra since the 9th century. A textile motif known today in Palembang songket as &quot;lepus&quot; can be seen on the vest worn by Figure 1 statue at the Bumiayu temple complex, which suggests that the motif that has been around since the 9th century. This archaeological study has enforced the notion that songket gold thread weaving tradition originated in Srivijaya.

Modern Indonesian nationalists have used the name of Srivijaya, along with Majapahit, as a source of pride. Srivijaya has become the focus of national pride and regional identity, especially for the people of Palembang, South Sumatra. For the people of Palembang, Srivijaya has become a source of artistic inspiration for Gending Sriwijaya song and traditional dance.

Srivijaya is a street name in many cities in Indonesia and has become synonymous with Palembang and South Sumatra. Srivijaya University, established in 1960 in Palembang, was named after Srivijaya. Kodam Sriwijaya (a military commando area unit), PT Pupuk Sriwijaya (a fertiliser company), Sriwijaya Post (a Palembang-based newspaper), Sriwijaya Air (an airline), Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium, and Sriwijaya F.C. (Palembang football club) were also all named after Srivijaya. On 11 November 2011, during the opening ceremony of 2011 Southeast Asian Games in Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium, Palembang, a colossal dance performance titled &quot;Srivijaya the Golden Peninsula&quot; was performed featuring Palembang traditional dances and a life-sized replica of an ancient ship. In popular culture, Srivijaya has become the source of inspiration for numbers of fictional feature films, novels and comic books. For example, the 2013 film &quot;Gending Sriwijaya&quot;, took place three centuries after the fall of Srivijaya, telling a story about court intrigue amidst the efforts to revive the fallen empire.

A participant in debates at the Glasgow University Union, he was a member of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association and the Scottish Covenant Association. He was also the campaign manager for the successful bid to have John MacCormick elected Rector of the University.

===Stone of Destiny===
On Christmas Eve 1950, Hamilton, along with three other student Scottish nationalists including Kay Matheson, removed the Stone of Destiny from its place under the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey, London. Originally used for the coronation of Scottish monarchs, the Stone had been removed to England by Edward I in 1296 to bolster his claim to the throne of Scotland. After the Acts of Union 1707 between Scotland and England, it was used for the coronation of British monarchs. As such, Hamilton&#x27;s action in returning the Stone to Scotland was applauded as a symbolic triumph for Scottish nationalism. The Stone was turned over to the Church of Scotland, which passed it to the authorities in April 1951. Hamilton and his accomplices were charged, but never prosecuted. The Stone was eventually returned to Scotland in 1996, with provision for subsequent use in the coronation of British monarchs.

In 2008, Charles Martin Smith wrote and directed a feature film entitled &quot;Stone Of Destiny&quot;, based on these events, in which Hamilton was portrayed by Charlie Cox. Hamilton himself had a small part as an English businessman.

===MacCormick v. Lord Advocate===

When first admitted to the bar as a young advocate in 1953, Hamilton refused to swear allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II arguing that she could only be referred to as &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; (sans regnal number) in Scotland as the regnal numbers counted Queen Elizabeth I, who had not ruled over Scotland or any of the subsequent united kingdoms which it has entered into. &quot;MacCormick v Lord Advocate&quot;, which Hamilton brought with rector John MacCormick against the Crown, failed. The Inner House of the Scottish Court of Session held that the monarch&#x27;s title is the sole prerogative of the sovereign, and the Crown had accepted a system whereby regnal numbers were taken from the larger of both former kingdoms in the United Kingdom, that is England and not Scotland. (It was later suggested by Winston Churchill after the accession of Elizabeth II that, in the future, the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences could be used. This system has yet to be put to the test.)

==Career==
After graduating from university, Hamilton was admitted to the bar and became a practising lawyer.

His play &quot;The Tinkers of the World&quot; was staged at Edinburgh&#x27;s Gateway Theatre early in 1957.

Hamilton joined the Labour Party for a short while, but spent most of his life in active politics as a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP). He was SNP candidate for the Strathclyde East seat at the 1994 election to the European Parliament, as well as a candidate for the SNP in the Greenock and Inverclyde seat at the 1999 election to the Scottish Parliament.

Hamilton was Rector of the University of Aberdeen from 1994 to 1996 and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) in his final year. He was also chosen by the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association as their candidate for the Glasgow University Rectorial election in 1999 in which he came second to the actor, Ross Kemp.

Hamilton wrote two autobiographical works, that are also in part polemical, &quot;A Touch of Treason&quot; (1990) and &quot;A Touch More Treason&quot; (1994). At one time he wrote a blog, where he posted commentary on Scottish social and political life, and latterly occasionally posted thoughts to Twitter including support for Scottish independence. He died in North Connel on 3 October 2022, aged 97.

=== Royal Bank of Scotland lawsuit ===
In February 2009, BBC News and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Hamilton was suing the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) over claims they had mis-sold shares to him in April 2008. Hamilton purchased 640 shares at £2 per share as part of a £12 billion rights issue. The writ he lodged in court claimed that the bank invited shareholders, including him and his wife, to invest in a rights issue, an offer that he took up on her behalf. The writ further alleged that RBS induced him to invest his money by &quot;concealing the true state of their finances&quot;. He further alleged that the bank was &quot;negligent in representing themselves as solvent at all material times when in fact they were insolvent&quot;.

RBS stated they would defend themselves vigorously against the claims made by Hamilton in the small claims court, but he dropped the case on 26 February 2009 after the sheriff at Oban Sheriff Court ruled that it would have to be considered at a higher court, given the legal and factual complexity of the case.

== Portrayals in popular culture ==
In 2008, Hamilton&#x27;s book, &quot;The Taking of the Stone of Destiny&quot;, was made into a movie entitled &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot;. The film depicted Hamilton (played by Charlie Cox) as the protagonist leading a team of students to reclaim the Stone of Destiny. Additionally, Hamilton had a small cameo role.

<doc id="398602" wikidata="Q224159" url="?curid=398602" title="William H. Macy">
<text>William Hall Macy Jr. (born March 13, 1950) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer. He is two-time Emmy Award and four-time Screen Actors Guild Award winner, and has been nominated for an Academy Award, a Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award, and five Golden Globe Awards. 

Macy rose to prominence for his collaborations with playwright David Mamet, before building a film career on appearances in small, independent films, earning two Independent Spirit Award nominations. He achieved a mainstream breakthrough through his portrayal of Jerry Lundergaard in &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

His major subsequent film roles include &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), &quot;Mystery Men&quot; (1999), &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001), &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;Thank You For Smoking&quot; (2005), and &quot;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2024). From 2011 to 2021, he starred as Frank Gallagher on the television series &quot;Shameless&quot;. He previously played the recurring role of Dr. David Morgenstern on &quot;ER&quot; (1994–2009).

==Early life==
Macy was born in Miami, Florida, and grew up in Georgia and Cumberland,Maryland. His father, William Hall Macy Sr. (1922–2007), was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and an Air Medal for flying a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber in World War II; he later ran a construction company in Atlanta, Georgia, and worked for Dun &amp; Bradstreet before taking over a Cumberland, Maryland–based insurance agency when Macy was nine years old. Macy&#x27;s mother, Lois (née Overstreet; 1920–2001), was a war widow who met Macy&#x27;s father after her first husband died in 1943. Macy has described her as a &quot;Southern belle&quot;.

Macy graduated from Allegany High School in Cumberland, Maryland, in 1968. He attended Bethany College in West Virginia, where he studied veterinary medicine. A &quot;wretched student&quot; by his own admission, he transferred to Goddard College in rural Vermont, where he studied under playwright David Mamet, and graduated in 1972. He studied theater at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==
After graduating from Goddard, Macy originated roles in a number of plays by collaborator David Mamet, such as &quot;American Buffalo&quot; and &quot;The Water Engine&quot;. While in Chicago in his twenties, he did a TV commercial. He was required to join AFTRA in order to do the commercial, and received his SAG card within a year, which for an elated Macy represented an important moment in his career.

Macy spent time in Los Angeles before moving to New York City in 1980, where he had roles in over fifty Off Broadway and Broadway plays. One of his earliest on-screen roles was as a theater critic congratulating Christopher Reeve in 1980&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;, under the name W.H. Macy, so as not to be confused with the actor Bill Macy. Another memorable early performance was as a turtle named Socrates in the direct-to-video film &quot;The Boy Who Loved Trolls&quot; (1984). 
He had a minor role as a hospital orderly on the sitcom &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; in the fourth-season episode &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and played an assistant district attorney in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Favorite Bagman&quot;, the first produced episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. In both appearances, he was billed as W. H. Macy. He has appeared in numerous films that Mamet wrote or directed, such as &quot;House of Games&quot; (1987), &quot;Things Change&quot; (1988), &quot;Homicide&quot; (1991), &quot;Oleanna&quot; (1994) (reprising the role he originated in the play of the same name), &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; (1997), &quot;State and Main&quot; (2000) and &quot;Spartan&quot; (2004).

Macy&#x27;s leading role in &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996) helped boost his career and recognizability, though at the expense of nearly confining him to a narrow typecast of a worried man down on his luck. Other Macy roles of the 1990s and 2000s included &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; (1993), &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; (1995), &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; (1995), &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (1998), &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998), Gus Van Sant&#x27;s remake of &quot;Psycho&quot; (1998), &quot;Happy, Texas&quot; (1999), &quot;Mystery Men&quot; (1999), &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), &quot;Panic&quot; (2000), &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001), &quot;Focus&quot; (2001), &quot;Welcome to Collinwood&quot; (2002), &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003), &quot;The Cooler&quot; (2003), &quot;Cellular&quot; (2004), &quot;Sahara&quot; (2005), &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Hero&quot; (2006) and &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006).

He had a recurring role on &quot;ER&quot; (1994-2009) and &quot;Sports Night&quot; (1999-2000). Both roles earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

In a November 2003 interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Macy stated that he wanted to star in a big-budget action film &quot;for the money, for the security of a franchise like that. And I love big action-adventure movies. They&#x27;re way cool.&quot; He serves as director-in-residence at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York, where he teaches a technique called Practical Aesthetics. A book describing the technique, &quot;A Practical Handbook for the Actor&quot; (), is dedicated to Macy and Mamet.

In 2007, Macy starred in &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;, a film about middle-aged men reliving their youthful days by taking to the open road on their Harley-Davidson motorcycles from Cincinnati to the Pacific Coast. Despite being critically panned, with a 14% &quot;rotten&quot; rating from Rotten Tomatoes, it was a financial success, grossing over $168 million. The film also reunited him with his &quot;A Civil Action&quot; costar, John Travolta. In 2009, Macy completed filming on &quot;The Maiden Heist&quot;, a comedy that co-starred Morgan Freeman and Christopher Walken.
In June 2008, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced Macy and his wife, Felicity Huffman, would each receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the upcoming year. On January 13, 2009, Macy replaced Jeremy Piven in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot; on Broadway. Piven suddenly and unexpectedly dropped out of the play in December 2008 after he experienced health problems. Norbert Leo Butz covered the role from December 23, 2008, until Macy took over the part. &quot;Dirty Girl&quot;, which starred Macy along with Juno Temple, Milla Jovovich, Mary Steenburgen and Tim McGraw, premiered September 12, 2010, at the Toronto International Film Festival.

In summer 2010, Macy joined the Showtime pilot &quot;Shameless&quot; as the protagonist, Frank Gallagher. The project ultimately went to series, and its first season premiered on January 9, 2011. Macy has received high critical acclaim for his performance, eventually getting an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2014.

In the 2012 film &quot;The Sessions&quot;, Macy played a priest who helps a man with a severe disability find personal fulfillment through a sex surrogate. He made his directorial debut with the independent drama &quot;Rudderless&quot;, which stars Billy Crudup, Anton Yelchin, Felicity Huffman, Selena Gomez and Laurence Fishburne. In 2017, he directed &quot;The Layover&quot;, a road trip comedy starring Alexandra Daddario and Kate Upton.

In 2015, he had a small role as Grandpa in the drama film &quot;Room&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film reunited him with his &quot;Pleasantville&quot; costar, Joan Allen. In 2024, he played Trevathan in the film &quot;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. 

==Personal life==

Macy and actress Felicity Huffman dated on-and-off for 15 years and married on September 6, 1997. They have two daughters.

Macy and Huffman appeared at a rally for John Kerry in 2004. Macy plays the ukulele and is an avid woodturner. He has appeared on the cover of &quot;Fine Woodworking&quot;″s special edition, &quot;Wood Turning Basics&quot; and was featured in an article in the April 2015 issue of &quot;American Woodturner&quot; (American Association of Woodturners). He is a national ambassador for the United Cerebral Palsy Association.

Since shooting the film &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;, Macy has had a strong interest in riding motorcycles. Macy lives near and is the spokesperson for Woody Creek Distillers in Basalt, CO, which sells a signature whiskey bearing Macy&#x27;s name.

===Varsity Blues scandal===

In March 2019, it was reported that Macy and Huffman had agreed to pay someone $15,000 to take a college entrance exam for their daughter Sophia. Huffman was indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges as part of a wider federal investigation of college admissions bribery. For undisclosed reasons, no charges were filed against Macy. 

On September 13, 2019, a federal judge in Boston sentenced Huffman to 14 days in federal prison, of which she served 10 days. As of October 2020, Huffman completed the other parts of her sentence, which included 250 hours of community service and a year of supervised release.

The Semang are among the different ethnic groups of Southeast Asia who, based on their dark skin and other perceived physical similarities, are sometimes referred to by the superficial term &quot;Negrito&quot;.

They have been recorded since before the 3rd century. They are ethnologically described as nomadic hunter-gatherers.

The Semang are grouped together with other Orang Asli groups, a diverse grouping of several distinct hunter-gatherer populations. Historically they preferred to trade with the local population. For more than one thousand years, some of the Semang people remained in isolation while others were either subjected to slave raids or forced to pay tribute to Southeast Asian rulers.

==Name and status==

In Malaysia, the term Semang ( in Malay) is used to refer to the hunter-gatherers, that are referred to more generically as &quot;Negrito,&quot; Spanish for &#x27;little negro&#x27;. In the past, eastern groups of Semang have been called Pangan. Semang are referred to as Sakai in Thailand, although this term is considered to be derogatory in Malaysia.

In Malaysia, the Semang are one of three groups that are considered to be Orang Asli, the hunter-gatherer people of the Peninsula. The other two groups are the Senoi and the Proto-Malay (Aboriginal Malay). The Semang have six sub-groups: Kensiu, Kintaq, Lanoh, Jahai, Mendriq and Batek. The Malaysian federal government has designated the Department of Orang Asli Development (&quot;Jabatan Kemajuan Orang Asli&quot;, JAKOA) as the agency responsible for integrating the Orang Asli into the wider Malaysian society.

The three category division of the indigenous population was inherited by the Malaysian government from the British administration of the colonial era. It is based on racial concepts, according to which the Negrito were seen as the most primitive race leading the vagrant way of life of hunter-gatherers. The Senoi were considered more developed, and the Proto-Malay were placed at almost the same level with the Malaysian Malay Muslims.

In Thailand, the terms Semang and Orang Asli are replaced by the terms &quot;Sakai&quot; or &quot;Ngopa&quot; (&quot;Ngò &#x27;Pa&quot; or &quot;Ngoh Paa&quot;, which literally means &#x27;curly/frizzy (haired) people&#x27;). The first term is derogatory in Malaysia, with the connotation of savages, subjects or slaves. The Semang have had a degree of patronage from the royal family of Thailand.

==Physical features==
They have dark skin, often curly-hair, and are stockily built.

==Ethnic groups==

The Semang do not have a sense of common ethnic identity. The term Semang is applied on them from an outside view, however the Semang refer to themselves only with their tribes names.

In total there are at least ten tribes that are classified as &quot;Semang&quot; in Malaysia (not all of them are officially recognized by the Malaysian government):-
* Kensiu live in the northern part of Kedah, near the borders with Thailand. Most of them settled in the district village, Kampung Lubuk-Legong, which is in Baling District, Kedah.
* Kintaq also have only one village, which is located near the city Gerik in Hulu Perak District, Perak. Traditionally they wandered around Klian Intan in Hulu Perak District and near Baling District in Kedah.
* Lanoh located in three villages situated in the Hulu Perak District in the northwest of Perak near Gerik. Among these people there are also distinct tribal groups such as the Lanoh Yir (probably nomadic), Lanoh Jengjeng (semi-settled) and possibly others.
** Semnam are not included in the official list of JAKOA, however they are grouped with the Lanoh. They live at the Ayer Bal River near Kampung Kuala Kenering in the Hulu Perak District, west of Gerik.
** Sabub&#x27;n are also grouped together with the Lanoh. The remnants of this nearly extinct tribe, along with other Lanoh groups, live near Lenggong and Gerik in Hulu Perak District.
* Jahai live in the mountains separating the states of Perak and Kelantan, at south of the borders of Thailand. This is the only mountain that the Semang inhabit. Their settlements are mainly along rivers or near lakes. In Perak they live along rivers such as Sungai Banun, Sungai Tiang and near Temenggor Lake in the Hulu Perak District. In Kelantan, the Jahai are concentrated along rivers namely Sungai Rual and Sungai Jeli in Jeli District.
* Mendriq live in several villages along the middle reaches of the Kelantan River in the remotes of Gua Musang District in the southern state of Kelantan.
* Batek:-
** Bateg Deq live mostly at the Aring River in southern Kelantan, partly in the neighbouring districts of Terengganu and Pahang. JAKOA does not distinguish between different Batek groups.
** Bateg Nong, another Batek group, live in the Jerantut District of northern Pahang. In total, there are 7 villages in the Pahang state, of which 5 of them are in the Lipis District and the other 2 are in Jerantut District; while in Kelantan there are 4 hamlet villages in the Gua Musang District.
** Mintil or &quot;Mayah&quot; live along the riverbanks of Sungai Tanum near Chegar Perah in north-central of Lipis District, Pahang. Officially, they are recognized as part of the Batek.

A few smaller groups of Semang live in the southern provinces of Thailand. These nomadic groups are mentioned under the names such as Tonga, Mos, Chong and Ten&#x27;en. They call themselves Mani, but their linguistic affiliation remains uncertain.

Because of the small number of some of these Semang groups, they are on the verge of disappearance.

==Settlement areas==

The Semang live mainly in the more isolated lowlands and foothills within the primary and secondary wet tropical jungles of the northern Malay Peninsula. Only the Jahai live at higher altitudes.

In the past, the territory of the Semang settlement was wider, but neighbouring ethnic groups pushed them into hard-to-reach areas. Kensiu now live in the northeast of Kedah, the Kintaq of which are settled in the adjoining areas of Kedah and Perak, the Jahai are in the northeast of Perak and in west of Kelantan, the Lanoh in the northeast of Perak, in the north-central Perak, the Mendriq in the south-east of Kelantan, and the Batek in the northwestern of Terengganu, northeastern of Pahang and southern Kelantan.

A significant part of these tribes live in permanent settlements, but traditionally separate groups of different time periods go into the jungle for the harvesting of jungle produce. Most often of such cases take place during the end of the fall on the maturation of wild fruit season. Because of this tradition, they are often designated as nomads, although the Semang in Malaysia at present are no longer leading a nomadic way of life.

Today, among the Semang; as part of the Orang Asli group, they also live in urban areas of Malaysia, mixed with members of other ethnic groups.

Several isolated Semang groups reside in the jungles of the southern provinces of Thailand. So far in the north, there are two groups in Trang Province and one in Phatthalung Province live for several kilometers apart from each other. For many kilometers, in the southern direction, there is another very small group of Semang in the southern part of the Satun Province, near the Malaysian border.

The remaining groups of Thai Semang can be found living in the Yala Province. In the upper part of the valley, in the Than To District of this province; about 2 km from the Thai-Malaysian border, there is a village in which is the only settled Semang group that lives in Thailand. There is another group of nomad Semang who live along the border with Malaysia in the Yala Province. Both nomadic and settled groups maintain close contacts with Malaysia. The border here has only political significance, and nothing prevents the Semang from freely crossing it.

The closest neighbours of the Semang are the Malay people. This applies not only to Malaysian Semang but also to groups living in Thailand. The extreme south of this country is ethnically predominantly Malay, although the Malay people there are officially called Thai Muslims because of Thaification.

==Population==

Dynamics of the Semang population after the declaration of independence of Malaysia:-
Distribution of Orang Asli subgroups in Malaysia by states (1996):-
The population of Semang in Thailand was estimated at 240 people (2010).

==Language==

Semang languages belonged to the Aslian branch of the Austroasiatic languages. These languages are also spoken by the neighbouring Senoi. Austroasiatic languages, spoken by Khmer or Vietnamese, were adopted by various other hunter-gatherer groups during the Neolithic and pre-Neolithic period. Later, Kra-Dai and Austronesian languages partially replaced Austroasiatic and other languages.

Aslian languages are divided into four main divisions: the Northern Aslian languages, Central Aslian languages, Southern Aslian languages and the Jah Hut language, which occupies a separate position.

Among Semang in Malaysia, there are further extended languages and dialects such as Kensiu language, Kentaq Bong dialect, Kintaq Nakil dialect, Jahai language, Minriq language, Bateg Deq language, Mintil language, Bateg Nong language, Semnam language, Sabüm language, Lanoh Yir dialect, Lanoh Jengjeng dialect. Most of them form the Northern Aslian languages group of the Aslian languages, only the languages of the Lanoh language (with the dialects of its subfamilies and Semnam language close to it) belong to the Central Aslian languages group. Very few Semang languages have been studied in Thailand, most likely in Kensiu language or Jahai language.

A characteristic feature of the Semang languages is that they do not have clear boundaries. This is a typical phenomenon for languages whose carriers are mostly small nomadic groups, of whom the usual situation is when representatives of different ethnic groups live together in the same temporary camp settlement. Thus, all the Northern Aslian languages together form a large continuous network of languages, interconnected by constant contacts. A similar but smaller network form the languages of the Lanoh language.

Not all Semang languages have survived to this day, some of the dialects are already completely extinct. This danger also threatens some of the existing dialects, including Sabüm language, Semnam language and Mintil language. At the same time, the situation with most Semang languages remains stable; regardless of the small number of their speakers, their language are not threaten with disappearance.

Most Semang, in addition to their own language, also speak Malay. There are also many Malay loanwords in all Semang languages. In addition, some Aslian languages contain many loanwords from each other. Another source of loanwords is the Thai language, which is noticeably predominantly in the Kensiu language, in the north of the peninsula. In Thailand, most of the settled Semang also speak Thai. However, in some rare cases, some or a few Semang can also speak English since that Malaysia was ruled by the British from 1867–1957.

==History==
The Semang are suggested to be descended from the people of the pre-Neolithic Hoabinhian culture, which was distributed in Southeast Asia from contemporary Vietnam, to the north eastern part of Sumatra in the 9th-3rd millennium BC. These Hoabinhians were hunter-gatherers and may also have practiced some forms of plant cultivation. While the Upper Paleolithic origins of the Hoabinhians are unknown, the analysis of sampled genomes from Holocene Hoabinhian individuals has shown that they shared a common ancestor with East Asians and (probably more remotely) with Australopapuan populations as part of the Ancient East Eurasian ancestral lineage.
Approximately 4,000 years ago, the practice of Slash-and-burn farming came to the Malay Peninsula, but nomadic hunting and harvesting continued to exist. New migrants also brought to the peninsula Aslian languages, which now speak modern Senoic languages and Semang languages. It is believed that the ancestors of the Senoi became farmers, and the ancestors of the Semang continued to engage in harvesting, sometimes supplementing it with trade and agriculture. A stable social tradition, which made it impossible for marriages between these groups, contributed to the delineation of these two racial types.

After 500 BC, maritime trade was already developed and the Malay Peninsula became a crossroads that bound India with China. On the coast there are settlements, some of them subsequently turned into large ports with permanent populations, consisting of foreign traders who maintained constant ties with China, India, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. The Semang become suppliers of jungle produce, which was in high demand in other countries such as aromatic woods, camphor, rubber, rattan, rhino horns, elephant tusks, gold, tin and so on. They also played the role of jungle guardians.

The Malay Srivijaya empire came in contact with the Negrito. In the year 724 AD, two Negrito pygmies were among the tribute gifts to Malay rulers. Negrito pygmies from the southern forests were enslaved and exploited until modern times.

At the end of the 14th century, on the coast of the Strait of Malacca, the first trading settlements were founded by Malay settlers from Sumatra. The main center was Malacca. At the beginning of the 15th century, the ruler of Malacca embraced Islam. Malay settlers began to slowly move upstream deeper into the peninsula, while some were subjugated to the Malays, most of the Orang Asli retreated into the interior regions.

During the early years of contact, the Semang peacefully interacted and traded with the Malays, but with the strengthening of the Malay states, the relationship between them began to deteriorate. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Semang and other indigenous groups became slave trade victims of Batak and Rawa raiders. In response to attempts to capture slaves, the Semang developed a tactic of avoiding contact with outsiders. As a way of preserving their autonomy, they would immediately destroy their shelters if an outsider intruded and they would remained hidden or &quot;closed&quot; in the jungle.
The more the Semang were isolated from the surrounding peoples, the more surprising they were perceived by others. Many peoples of Southeast Asia considered the jungle as home to magical creatures, among those that assented are the Negritos. These people were endowed with magical qualities, and with various legends associated with fairy tales. Among the Malaysian sultans and rulers of the southern provinces of Thailand, it was once regarded as prestigious to keep Negritos in their yards as part of collections of amusing jungle beings.

In the first decade of the twentieth century, the king of Thailand, King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) visited the southern regions of his country and met with the Semang. In 1906, an orphan Semang boy named Khanung was sent to the royal court, where he was perceived as the adoptive son of the ruler. From this event, it has led to the patronage of the Semang by the royal court.

The British colonial government banned slavery at the end of the nineteenth century and introduced a protection policy for the Orang Asli. The British perceived the indigenous people as noble savages, who lead an idealized and romantic existence and need protection from the devastating actions of modern life.

Attention to the aborigines drew only during the Malayan Emergency in Malaysia in the 1950s. In order to bring them to the government&#x27;s side in the confrontation against the communist rebels, a special department was established, the Department of Orang Asli Affairs (&quot;Jabatan Hal Ehwal Orang Asli&quot;, JHEOA); which was to provide education, health and economic development of the Orang Asli. A comprehensive control of indigenous communities was then introduced. Similar actions on the neutralization of the Negritos, albeit on a smaller scale, were also carried out by the Thai government in response to the transfer of communist soldiers into Thailand&#x27;s territory.

The proclamation of Malaysia&#x27;s independence in 1957 and the cessation of the Malayan Emergency in 1961 did not bring about significant changes in the state&#x27;s policy towards the Orang Asli. In the 1970s, the Department of Orang Asli Affairs began to organize for the Semang settlements, which were meant to relocate several nomadic groups. Approximately by the end of 1980, the widespread development of jungle harvesting and the replacement of jungles for plantations, it has severely damaged the lives of most tribes of the Semang.

Much of the Kintaq, Jahai, Batek and Lanoh people now live in villages built by the state, surrounded by secondary jungles and plantations, as well as villages whose populations do not belong to the Orang Asli. They were forced to give up their livelihood and to some extent became accustomed to small farming.

In 1966 (according to some sources, 1973), in order to improve their lives, a Sakai Village was established in Thailand. The state laid a rubber plantation for them. In the early 1990s, it was decided to turn this village into a tourist centre, where the Semang in a theatrical form began to demonstrate to tourists features of their traditional way of life.

==Beliefs==

In terms of religion, the Semang are animists. They believe that not only people, but all natural objects have souls.

The land of the Semang are imagined in the form of a disk that lies on a huge snake or turtle floating underground. The earth is connected with the sky with one or several stone pillars. The world is filled with numerous immortal supernatural beings, spirits living on the sky, in stone pillars and underground. Skyline is a paradise filled with flowers and fruit trees. Supernatural beings have created rain forests to meet the needs of people on earth. Some of them in the past lived on the ground as ordinary people and now from time to time come back here, appearing in people in dreams.

Most supernatural beings have no names, they are often associated with certain natural phenomena or objects, such as wind or fruit trees. Others have their names and individual attributes. Most of the Semang are afraid of three natural phenomena; thunder, floods and storms. The main deity in them is the god of thunder Karey. He is not loved and evokes great fear, he is considered cruel and evil. Karey, according to local beliefs, carries out an important moral function, imposing punishment on violators of taboo. It can cause death, injury or illness through lightning strikes or wildlife attacks.

In each group there is a shaman called a &quot;hala&quot;. He acts as an intermediary between the visible world of people and the invisible world of spirits. Shamans perform rituals and magic rites, practice magic, anticipate the future, cure illnesses, and define a safe place for camp placement. Treatment of diseases is carried out using different herbs and magic spells. Semang believe that their shamans in a state of trance communicate with supernatural beings, can express them gratitude, as well as learn from them the way to treat a serious illness.

Shamans can be both men and women. There are big and small &quot;hala&quot;s. Small &quot;hala&quot;s are ordinary mortals who know some ways of treating. For the treatment of diseases, they use certain songs, massage, herbal medicine and spells. Sometimes during the healing ceremony, they are part of the trance. Great &quot;hala&quot;s, according to the Semang, are people with supernatural abilities. Not only do they communicate with spirits through dreams or trance, they themselves are supernatural beings, for example, they can turn into tigers and drive away from wildlife people. Big and small &quot;hala&quot;s get their knowledge from the spirits through dreams or from another hook. The best way is to wait on the grave of the deceased shaman until he appears in the likeness of the tiger, and then he will turn to the person and begin to teach the beginner.

Special rites accompany important events in life, such as birth, disease, death, there are also various rituals of economic orientation. When rituals are carried out, animist symbols are used.

The Malaysian government is pursuing a policy of conversion of the Orang Asli to Islam. A certain demographic of the Semang was considered Muslim by the end of the 20th century. The statistics are as follows:-
==Culture==

Scarification is practised. Young boys and girls are scarified in a simple ritual to mark the end of their adolescence. The finely serrated edge of a sugarcane leaf is drawn across the skin, then charcoal powder rubbed into the cut.

They have bamboo musical instruments, a kind of jaw harp, and a nose flute. On festive occasions, there is song and dance, both sexes decorating themselves with leaves.

The Semang bury their dead on the same day itself with the corpse wrapped in mat and the personal belonging of the deceased kept in a small bamboo rack placed over the grave. Only people of great importance, such as chiefs or great magicians are given a tree burial.

They have used Capnomancy (divination by smoke) to determine whether a camp is safe for the night.

===Traditional way of life===
Traditionally, the Semang have been living a vagrant lifestyle of jungle hunter-gatherers. Each group occupies a certain customary territory, which was a territorial subsistence for them. Within this territory they are constantly moving from place to place in search for new food resources. The Semang are not hunter-gatherers in the literal sense, as they constantly change their livelihood depending on what is currently beneficial for them. As soon as one source of edible resources is exhausted, they turn to another.

This way of life has been steadily maintained for a millennia due to the specific social structure of their society. Separate families in Semang community are completely autonomous; where they can gather together in temporary camps, then diverge, each in their direction, and then gather together with other families in new camps. Exogamy in such a society has an extreme level, which leads to large-scale family ties. Such model for the society ideally corresponds to the nomadic way of life and is unacceptable for the settled population. It served as a barrier that divided the populations that have been living together for a millennia.

Semang consider their customary territories free for use by all members of the local group. Western Semang recognize their human right to possess poisonous trees and perennial fruit trees that they have planted or found in the jungles. Other groups consider such trees to be free for everyone.

Claims of exclusive rights to a particular area in a dispute with other groups of Semang or with other peoples are usually not put forward and in any case are not valid. The Malaysian government does not at all recognize any rights of Semang to customary lands or resources.

Although they are commonly referred to as the inhabitants of the deep jungle areas, Semang actually occupy a transition zone between tropical jungles and agricultural districts. The resources here are very diverse and abundant. They can also collect valuable wood and maintain trade with neighbors. In the deep jungle they can only hunt small animals living among the trees, as valuable vegetation resources are practically absent from there.

In state villages, the Department of Orang Asli Development is trying to attract Semang to agriculture. On cleared jungle areas, the state organizes the planting of rubber trees, durian, rambutan, oil palms and bananas. The Semang are forced to adapt to new conditions, but agricultural activity requires long term waiting results, which contradicts their world view. At different times of the day, a group of Semang may send a whole group or individuals to harvest forest products, trade them, get hired in casual paid jobs from Malay farmers, go fishing or simply beg or live off of gifts left by visitors.

With this in mind, JAKOA provides the people with grocery kits so they do not leave their work. But, when there is a delay with the release of these rations, the Semang immediately stop agricultural activity, and some even return to live in the woods. The harvesting of jungle produce for sale still remains a priority for them, followed by work for money, settled agriculture and horticulture.

==Livelihood==

The main livelihood of the Semang has traditionally been gathering, hunting and fishing in a wandering lifestyle. Only in the 20th century some groups, the Lanoh and Batek in particular, began to practice Slash-and-burn farming.

For daily consumption, the roots and fruits of wild plants are collected in the jungle. The major food gathered is wild yams (Dioscorea), of which at least twelve species can be found in relative abundance throughout the year. Other wild foods include bamboo shoots, nuts, seasonal fruits, mushrooms, and honey. Apart from this list, there is also a range of medicinal herbs.

Different jungle plants are used by the Semang for various purposes. Bamboo is used for housing construction, the production of blowguns, darts, fish traps, kitchen utensils, water containers, combs, mats, rafts and ritual items. From the wood, they produce handles and sheaths for knives, and cutting boards for slicing meat. Pandan is used to make mats and baskets, tree barks for baskets and also clothing, and rattan for rope, baskets, ladders and belts.

The Semang spend a lot of time and effort on harvesting jungle products intended for sale or for exchange with neighboring Malay villages. These include wild fruits, as well as rattan, rubber, wax, honey, and herbs. The most popular products are petai (Parkia speciosa), kerdas (Archidendron bubalinum), keranji (Dialium indum), jering (Archidendron pauciflorum) and durian (Durio pinangianus). Petai and durian are collected from August to November, kerdas during February to May, and keranji from October to January. The produce obtained are shared with everyone in the camp. Money that the Semang receive from the sale of these goods is then used to buy rice, oil, tobacco, salt, sugar and other food products, as well as clothing, fabrics, knives and other provisions.

Hunting is done with spears, rifles, and slings, but the main weapon is the blowgun, which is used to hunt small game (squirrels, monkeys, bats and birds). Guns and spears are used to hunt large animals such as wild pigs, goats, deer and tapirs. Occasionally hunting traps are set. Slingshots of wood and rubber are used, mainly by young men, to capture birds, bats, and other tree dwelling animals. Some of the Semang in the past used bows and arrows in a collective hunting group, but this practice disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century. River fish are caught using special traps made of bamboo, spears, hooks and fishing rods.

Most of the Semang groups grow a certain number of cultivated plants (Upland rice, cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, other vegetables). Primitive manual farming is practiced on small scorched areas of the jungle. The result of the harvest is the property of the family that did the planting, but after harvesting, the foods are distributed to all as a rule. Women mainly engage in harvesting and farming, and men mainly focus on hunting.

Pottery and weaving among the Semang are absent. Steel knives and axes are obtained either through trade or by the processing of steel waste from spearheads, arrows, and blades from knives. Individual specialization is practically absent, except for the religious sphere.

==Lifestyle==

Until recently, most of the Semang led a nomadic way of life. They lived in temporary camps consisting of a group of primitive shelter structures. Typically, these are simple palm straw shields that are tilted, such that one edge stands on the ground, and the other is based on two or three supporting sticks. This design is a temporary accommodation that provides people with protection from wind and rain. Western groups of Semang sometimes put their lean-to in two rows facing to each other. Thus, a long common communal hut was formed in the form of a tunnel with exits at each of its ends.

Sometimes Semang erect circular dwellings with the center space being used as a meeting place for dancing and ceremonial rituals. For short stays they would take shelter in caves, rocky overhangs or groups of trees overnight.

Settled Semang live in small bamboo or straw huts on stilts. Residential groups built by the state under the RPS (&quot;Rancangan Pengumpulan Semula&quot;, meaning &quot;Regrouping Schemes&quot; in English) have typical Malay-style of wooden huts. RPS villages are provided with basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, water supply, medical institutions, and elementary schools.

Traditionally, the Semang tribes place their homes very close to each other. A remnant of their nomadic way of life is that they typically leave garbage around their huts. Previously, Semang simply left their waste behind and moved on, so they had no need to remove it from around their homes. Now, their more settled lifestyle leads to some groups living in close contact with their own waste, increasing the spread of disease and polluting nearby water supplies.

Traditionally, Semang had a minimum of household items and tools, because all their treasure would need to be carried with them. Their homes, utensils and tools were made mainly for single use.

The traditional clothing of the Semang is a loincloth for men and skirts for women. These garments are made of bark from the terap, a species of wild bread-fruit tree, hammered out with a wooden mallet. Often the resultant cloth is decorated with segments of bamboo in patterns intended to magically protect its wearer from disease. These two garments are typically the only clothing worn; some go naked, although this is not customary. Women also tattoo and paint their faces.

==Society==

Semang lived in small family groups of 15-50 people without a strict tribal organization, as the jungle cannot support a large mass of people. Semang do not have associations with fixed membership, there are no related groups and no affiliation by ideology. Many camps consist of one or more extended families, but these are only temporary formations.

The only stable association in the Semang community is the nuclear family, consisting of a husband, a wife and their children. The family usually occupies an individual home, and adult children can put up their own housing located next to the hut or shelter of their parents. The family engages in farming together, and at the same time adults teach children the basic skills of management and cultural values of the group.

The kinship account is carried out on both the paternal and the maternal line. For the Semang, there is no difference between relatives, cousins, and siblings, but they do differentiate based on age categories by dividing their siblings into elder and younger groups.

Young people usually choose their own spouses, and parents have little influence on these processes. Theoretically, a future husband must ask for permission of marriage from a woman&#x27;s parents, but this does not always happen. The marriage ceremony is as simple as possible and limited to the participation of the actual married couple, who often arranges a small holiday for themselves. Some groups do expect the groom to bring some gifts to his intended&#x27;s parents. Marriage is considered concluded when the spouses begin to live together.

The general groups are exogamous. For the Semang, marriages between blood relatives and close family (persons related through marriage) are not allowed. These rules require the search for marriages among distant groups, thus creating a large-scale network of social ties.

The rules for avoiding physical contact with the opposite sex, backed up by appropriate taboos, make it impossible for sexual relations outside the family. Polygyny and polyandry are allowed, but they are rare. Instead, divorce is commonplace in most Semang groups, especially if the couple have no children. The procedure is very simple, the couple just ceases to live together. Sometimes there are conflicts on this ground, but in the majority of cases everything is peaceful, and the former spouses remain friendly, staying in the same camp.

Little children of divorced couples usually stay with their mother; older children make their own choices and often move alternately from one parent to another. The step-parent usually refer to the children from the previous marriage as their own. Just as in the case of a divorce or death of a wife, a Semang man may marry again and again but remain monogamous.

The nuclear family is also the main economic unit of the Semang society. Women play an important role in the traditional economy, spending a lot of time harvesting fruits from the jungle and fish from the rivers to provide the family with food. Pregnant women or women with young babies are not expected to fully perform their work. Children in the Semang community do not have &quot;economic value&quot;. Most of the time during the day they simply play, simulating the activity of adults of the respective gender. 

Characteristically, with the transition to a sedentary lifestyle, the birth rate among the Semang is rapidly increasing. In addition, the food stamps that children receive at school and bring them home have become a significant factor in family life and have changed the perception of children in society.

Semang society is egalitarian. People are interconnected by ties of kinship and friendship. Social classes do not exist. No adult has any authority over any other adults. There are no means of coercion. Individual autonomy is highly respected, and antisocial behavior is discouraged. People believe that violations of the norms and violence will be punished by supernatural forces. Disputes are resolved through public discussion with the goal of achieving a consensus decision. Individuals who do not get along with one another cannot be in the camp at the same time. In the event of a conflict that involves third parties, the Semang, as a rule, would simply move on to avoid violence.

Individuals of charismatic personality, men and women, may have some influence on others, hence become informal leaders in certain situations, but they have no real power. Such a leader is called &quot;penghulu&quot;, a Malay term. Some &quot;penghulu&quot;, exclusively for men, are senior members appointed by the Department of Orang Asli Development, but they only act as mediators between the group and outsiders and they do not have any power within the group.

A &quot;penghulu&quot; receive wages from the department. Formally, they are elected by a group of men, specifically for this purpose as organized by the authorities. No direct consultations with women are held, although they do express their views freely. Usually the position of the &quot;penghulu&quot; is inherited by the eldest son, although there are exceptions. If the current &quot;penghulu&quot; does not suit the JAKOA, the department pressures the group to make a replacement.

<doc id="398611" wikidata="Q333632" url="?curid=398611" title="Chico Buarque">
<text>Francisco Buarque de Hollanda (born 19 June 1944), popularly known simply as Chico Buarque (), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, guitarist, composer, playwright, writer, and poet. He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic, and cultural reflections on Brazil.

The firstborn son of Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Rome. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and João Gilberto. He performed as a singer and guitarist in the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several Tropicalist and MPB musicians, was threatened by the Brazilian military government and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s.

In 2019, Buarque was awarded the Camões Prize, the most important prize for literature in the Portuguese language.
However, awarding of the prize was delayed by four years due to actions by Jair Bolsonaro, but Buarque received it in April 2023.

==Early life and career ==

Buarque was born in Rio de Janeiro on 19 June 1944. He came from an intellectually privileged family background—his father Sérgio Buarque de Holanda was a well-known historian, sociologist and journalist and his mother Maria Amélia Cesário Alvim was a painter and pianist. He is also brother of the singers Miúcha, Cristina Buarque and politician Ana de Hollanda. As a child, he was impressed by the musical style of bossa nova, specifically the work of Tom Jobim and João Gilberto. He was also interested in writing, composing his first short story at 18 years old and studying European literature, also at a young age. One of his most consuming interests, however, was playing football, beginning at age four, and he still played regularly in his 60s. During his childhood, he lived in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Rome.

Before becoming a musician, Buarque decided at one point to study architecture at the University of São Paulo, but this choice did not lead to a career in that field; Buarque often skipped classes.

He made his public debut as musician and composer in 1964, rapidly building his reputation at music festivals and television variety shows when bossa nova came to light and Nara Leão recorded three of his songs. His eponymous debut album exemplified his future work, with catchy sambas characterized by inventive wordplay and an undercurrent of nostalgic tragedy. Buarque had his first hit with &quot;A Banda&quot; in 1966, written about a marching band, and soon released several more singles. Although playing bossa nova, during his career, samba and Música popular brasileira would also be widely explored. Despite that, Buarque was criticized by two of the leading musicians at the time, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil as they believed his musical style was overly conservative. However, an existentially themed play that Buarque wrote and composed in 1968, &quot;Roda Viva&quot; (&quot;Live Circle&quot;), was frowned upon by the military government and Buarque served a short prison sentence because of it. He left Brazil for Italy for 18 months in 1970, returning to write his first novel in 1972, which was not targeted by censors.

At this time his thinly veiled protest single &quot;Apesar de Você&quot; (&quot;In spite of You&quot; – in reference to the military dictatorship) was also produced. &quot;Apesar de Você&quot; was overlooked by the military censors, becoming an important anthem in the democratic movement. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually censored and removed from the market. At one point in 1974, the censors banned any song authored by Chico Buarque. Then, he created a pseudonym, naming himself &quot;Julinho de Adelaide&quot;, complete with life history and interviews to newspapers. &quot;Julinho de Adelaide&quot; authored songs such as &quot;Jorge Maravilha&quot; (&quot;Wonder Jorge&quot;) and &quot;Acorda Amor&quot; (&quot;Wake Up Love&quot; as in a lover) before he was outed in a &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; news story. Buarque also wrote a play named &quot;Calabar&quot;, about the Dutch invasion of Brazil in the seventeenth century, drawing parallels with the military regime. Despite the censorship, songs such as &quot;Samba de Orly&quot; (1970), &quot;Acorda amor&quot; (1974, as &quot;Julinho da Adelaide&quot;) manifested Buarque&#x27;s continuing opposition to the military regime.

During the 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with filmmakers, playwrights, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship. Buarque approached the 1983 Concert for Peace in Nicaragua as a valid forum to vocalize his strong political views. Throughout the decade, he crafted many of his songs as vehicles to describe the re-democratization of Brazil. The Concert for Peace in Nicaragua was one in a concert series known as the &quot;Central American Peace Concerts.&quot; These concerts featured various Latin American artists. The political turmoil that plagued this era were expressed in many of Buarque&#x27;s songs. He later wrote &quot;Budapeste&quot;, a novel that achieved critical national acclaim and won the Prêmio Jabuti, a Brazilian literary award comparable to the Booker Prize.

His 2017 album &quot;Caravanas&quot; was named the 3rd best Brazilian album of that year by the Brazilian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==&quot;Cálice&quot;==
Following the Brazilian military coup of 1964, Buarque avoided censorship by using cryptic analogies and wordplay. For example, in the song &quot;Cálice&quot; (&quot;Chalice&quot;), a duet written in 1973 with Gilberto Gil and released with Milton Nascimento in 1978, he takes advantage of the homophony between the Portuguese imperative &quot;cale-se&quot; (&quot;shut up&quot;) and &quot;cálice&quot; (&quot;chalice&quot;) to protest government censorship, disguised as the Gospel narrative of Jesus&#x27; Gethsemane prayer to God to relieve him of the cup of suffering. The line &quot;Quero cheirar fumaça de óleo diesel&quot; (&quot;I want to sniff diesel fumes&quot;) is a reference to the death of political prisoner Stuart Angel, who reportedly had his mouth glued to a jeep&#x27;s exhaust pipe during a torture session. Buarque was close to Stuart&#x27;s mother, Zuzu Angel. This song is the subject of the final chapter of the book &quot;First Chico Buarque&quot; by Charles A. Perrone (London: Bloomsbury, 2022) in the Brazil 33 1/3 series.

<doc id="398628" wikidata="Q577102" url="?curid=398628" title="Alkahest">
<text>In Renaissance alchemy, alkahest was the theorized &quot;universal solvent&quot;. It was supposed to be capable of dissolving any composite substance, including gold (then not considered an element), without altering or destroying its fundamental components. By extracting from composite substances their fundamental virtues and properties, alchemists hoped to gain control of invaluable medical healing properties (see also azoth). For this reason the alkahest was earnestly sought. At the same time, its very existence was debated among alchemists and philosophers.

The first, or one of the first, to mention the alkahest was the Swiss physician and alchemist Paracelsus.

== Etymology ==
There is no consensus on the origin and etymology of the word alkahest, as Paracelsus left no trace or history of the word. One such view is that the term is of Arabic origin or pseudo-Arabic modeled on similar names of other chemical entities. George Starkey argued it came from the German word &quot;al-gehest&quot; (all spirit). Johann Rudolph Glauber posed that it could have come from the words &quot;alhali est,&quot; the German word &quot;al gar heis&quot;, or &quot;Al zu hees,&quot; meaning &quot;very hot&quot;. Anglo-Dutch alchemist and physician William Yworth (Cleidophorus Mystagogus) (died 1715) argued for its root originating from High Dutch. 

=== Other names ===
Jan Baptist van Helmont considered the alkahest to have never-ending reusability, calling it an &quot;immortal&quot;. He also used the term &quot;maccabean fire&quot; because of its similarities to the &quot;thick water&quot; in the deuterocanonical Book of Maccabees in the Old Testament. Another name for the Alkahest termed by Helmont was &quot;ignis gehennae.&quot; Other names include &quot;latex&quot; (or &quot;clear water reduced to its minutest atoms&quot;), and &quot;primum Ens Salum&quot; (or &quot;salt exalted to its highest degree&quot;).

== History ==

=== 16th century ===

==== Paracelsus ====
Among its many philosophical and spiritual preoccupations, Hermeticism also concerned itself with panaceas—remedies supposed to cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. Later, an emergent Latin alchemy, associated with European humanism, transmuted itself into a new, more modern medical and pharmaceutical philosophy, reformed by a better understanding of human physiology. Philippus Paracelsus (1493–1541), who gave his name to the early modern school of medical theory known as Paracelcism, first made mention of the alkahest as a chemical which could fortify the liver, and—in instances where the liver failed—could act as a substitute for its functions.

===== Recipe =====
The recipe for the theorized alkahest was often kept secret, as many alchemical recipes were. There were many alchemists attempting to obtain the universal solvent, and thus many recipes, some later rejected by their creators, have been found. Paracelsus&#x27;s own recipe for alkahest was made of caustic lime, alcohol, and carbonate of potash; however, his recipe was not intended to be a &quot;universal solvent&quot;.

=== 17th century ===
Alkahest became very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries through Jan Baptist van Helmont. Its prevalence in the 17th and 18th centuries, despite its otherwise absurd and extreme qualities, was likely due to the popularity of alchemy at the time and the lack of an adequate alternative theory of chemistry. During the 17th century, many alchemists were working on obtaining the alkahest, some of which were Johann Rudolf Glauber, George Starkey, Frederick Clod, Thomas Vaughan, Thomas Henshaw, Johann Brun, Robert Hamilton, Hugh Piatt, and Robert Child. Those who followed and trained under Paracelsus did not think of the alkahest as van Helmont did, but slowly built upon the ideas posed by their teacher.

==== Jan Baptist van Helmont ====

===== Alkahest as a universal solvent =====
Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont (1580–1644) expanded on the idea of the &#x27;alkahest&#x27;, believing it to be a universal solvent. Helmont claimed that knowledge of the recipe was granted by God and was therefore known by few, and he had many dreams during which he believed he had been gifted the recipe, only to find them inadequate. Given the difficulty of obtaining alkahest, Helmont suggested the use of other, inferior substances believed to be capable of similar tasks. Volatile salt of tartar, also known as pyrotartaric acid or glutaric acid, was considered both a substitute for alkahest and a component of alkahest. Helmont&#x27;s writings also referred to a fourteenth century alchemical manuscript which discussed &quot;sal alkali&quot; (possibly caustic potash or lye) that was capable of dissolving many substances, and perhaps an ingredient in Helmont&#x27;s alkahest.

==== George Starkey ====
Colonial American alchemist George Starkey (1628–1665) described alkahest as a circulated salt that is neither acid nor alkali. Moreover, Starkey believed that, because acid saline liquors are destroyed by alkalies and urinous spirits, they cannot be ingredients of the immortal alkahest. He believed instead that non-acidic substances could be ingredients of the alkahest, some of these suspected substances being urinous spirits, spirit of alkalies, and sulphureous vegetable spirits. In particular, Starkey believed that alkahest&#x27;s secret ingredient laid within urine.

===== Dissolving gold; removing sulphur from mercury; cure for urinary calculi =====
Starkey and his mentor Helmont (by their own report) used mercuric sulphide to dissolve gold, and informed Robert Boyle about it in a series of letters. The alkahest, according to Starkey, was able to remove sulphur from the natural mercury leaving a quicksilver resistant to corrosion. Because of the supposed power of alkahest to break down substances into their occult qualities, it was sought after for its potential to cure incurable diseases at the time. For example, the breaking down of &quot;Ludus&quot; could provide a cure for urinary calculi.

Ladislaus Reti, a 20th-century historian of science, investigated alchemical recipes involving alkahest and found that no chemical was sufficient in breaking down the wide variety of materials Helmont supposed. Reti points out that in such recipes, an alcohol solution of potassium hydroxide could have been used instead.

==== Johann Rudolf Glauber and nitric acid ====
German-Dutch alchemist and chemist Johann Rudolf Glauber (1604–1670) believed that the alkahest was a class of substances, rather than one, particular substance. Glauber believed he had discovered alkahest after discovering that volatile niter (nitric acid) and fixed niter (potassium carbonate) were able to dissolve several substances. 

==== Frederick Clod ====
German &quot;mystical chemist&quot; Frederick Clod (or Clodius) (1625–after 1661) believed that mercury could convert salts into &quot;ponderous liquor&quot;, which he believed was needed to make the alkahest.

==== Robert Boyle – corpuscular nature of alkahest ====
The theory of alkahest was conceived in terms of alchemy, Helmontian theories, and the physical theory of corpuscularianism. According to Helmont and Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle (1627–1691), the alkahest had a &quot;microstructure&quot;, meaning it was composed of extremely small, homogeneous corpuscles. This structure allowed the alkahest&#x27;s corpuscles to move between the corpuscles of all other materials and mechanically separate them without altering their base materials or itself, conforming with the idea that it was infinitely reuseable. It was these qualities which made the alkahest distinct from ordinary corrosives, which are altered by the substances they act upon and thus not infinitely reusable.

==== Tobias Ludwig Kohlhans and Henry Oldenburg – alkahest in the lymphatic vessels ====
Tobias Ludwig Kohlhans (1624–1705) suggested in his dissertation of the spleen, that alkahest could be found in the liquid that had been discovered in the lymphatic vessels of animals. In 1661, German-English scientist Henry Oldenburg (c. 1618–1677) made experimental connections between alkahest and this liquid. Helmont, Oldenburg, and Goddard raised questions, however, about the lymph&#x27;s &quot;sweetly acidic&quot; quality, the necessity of a hypothetical universal solvent to explain the acidity in empty animal lymphatic vessels, its ability to be generated within the body, and how it differed from other fluids or humours in the body. 

==== Johann Kunckel – the existence of alkahest is questioned ====
The German alchemist Johann Kunckel (1630–1703) and others at that time began to see the alkahest as merely fantasy and wishful thinking. A potential problem involving alkahest—first posed by Kunckel—is that, if it dissolves everything, then it cannot be placed into a container because it would dissolve the container. Starkey, however, specified that alkahest dissolved only composite materials into their constituent, elemental parts; hence, a hypothetical container made of a pure element (say, lead) would not be dissolved by alkahest.

===== Herman Boerhaave – alkahest and the philosopher&#x27;s stone =====
Paracelsus believed that alkahest was, in fact, the philosopher&#x27;s stone. Dutch chemist and physician Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738), in his textbook &quot;Elementa Chymiae&quot; (1732), did not think alkahest was the philosopher&#x27;s stone, but of greater importance and value than the stone.

After the 18th century alkahest was taken less seriously over time.

== Modern usages of the term ==
In modern times, water is sometimes called the universal solvent, because it can dissolve a large variety of substances; more than any other liquid. This is due to its chemical polarity and amphoterism.

The old remark &quot;spit is the universal solvent&quot; satirizes the idea.

Alkahest, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical subsidiary of Grifols which is developing products derived from blood plasma to reverse and inhibit aging.

&quot;Alkahestry&quot; is the term used for a type of alchemy in the manga series &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;.

<text>In addition to the Isle of Man itself, the Isle of Man Government administers three small neighbouring islands: the Calf of Man, St Patrick&#x27;s Isle and St Michael&#x27;s Isle. There is one place with official status as a city, three places with official status as towns, four villages, and many other smaller settlements. Traditionally the Island is divided into six sheadings, then further into seventeen parishes.

Manx language names are given in &quot;italics&quot;.

== Cities ==
There is only one city on the island, a status which was awarded in 2022 and came into effect in 2024:
*Douglas – capital and largest settlement ()

==Towns==
The official towns of the Isle of Man are:
* Castletown ()
* Peel ()
* Ramsey ()

==Villages==
The official villages of the Isle of Man, with village commissioners, are:

* Laxey () – no longer has village commissioners; is now merely an electoral ward of the parish district of Garff
* Onchan – second largest settlement ()
* Port St Mary ()
* Port Erin ()

==Other settlements==
Other notable settlements, with no official status, are:

* Andreas ()
* Baldrine ()

* Union Mills ()

Those marked ‡ (at least) are mostly not large enough to be notable as settlements, but some may be notable as tourist destinations.

==Settlements by population==
The following list ranks the populations of eight main settlements on the Isle of Man which populations were reported in the 2021 Isle of Man Census.

==Sheadings==
The sheadings () of the Isle of Man are:

* Ayre ()
* Garff ()
* Glenfaba ()
* Michael ()
* Middle ()
* Rushen ()

==Historic parishes==
The historic parishes () currently included in each sheading of the Isle of Man are:

* Ayre

<doc id="398631" wikidata="Q633011" url="?curid=398631" title="Final Fantasy X-2">
<text>is a 2003 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation 2. Unlike most &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, which use self-contained stories and characters, &quot;X-2&quot; continues the story of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; (2001). The story follows Yuna as she searches for Tidus, the main character of the previous game, while trying to prevent political conflicts in Spira from escalating to war.

&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; was the first game in the series to feature just three player characters and an all-female main cast. The battle system incorporates &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character classes—one of the series&#x27; signature gameplay concepts—and is one of the few entries to have multiple possible endings. The soundtrack was created by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi in lieu of long-time &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; composer Nobuo Uematsu.

The game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful, selling over 5.4 million copies on PlayStation 2 and winning a number of awards. It was the last &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to be released by Square before it merged with Enix in April 2003. The game was re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, alongside &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, as &quot;Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster&quot;; this version was later released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, Windows in 2016, and the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019. As of September 2021, the &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; series had sold over 20.8 million units worldwide, and at the end of March 2022 had surpassed 21.1 million units sold around the world.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; is a role-playing video game in which players take on the role of Yuna as she explores the fictional world of Spira. In contrast to its predecessor, &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, players may visit almost every location in Spira from an early point in the game via airship. The field-map navigation system is largely unchanged from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;; players navigate large, continuous three dimensional areas by controlling the on-screen character. A few upgrades have been implemented, providing the player with extended interaction with the environment through jumping, climbing, and rotating camera angles. The game&#x27;s sidequests include minor tasks and quests, optional bosses and dungeons, and the most minigames of any &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; at the time of its release. These minigames include Gunner&#x27;s Gauntlet (a shooter game) and Sphere Break (a math-based coin game), and a management sim based on blitzball, the fictional underwater sport from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;.

Unlike its predecessor, in which the player&#x27;s course through the world was largely linear, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; allows players to visit almost any location at any time. The game consists of five chapters, with each location featuring one scenario per chapter. Together, the five scenarios in one locale form a subplot of the game called an &quot;Episode&quot;. Players are free to engage with as many or as few optional scenarios as they choose; only a few scenarios per chapter are required to advance the game&#x27;s central plot and are marked on the world navigation system as &quot;Hotspots&quot;. Both Hotspots and optional scenarios contribute to a story completion tracker and the latter may indirectly influence the main narrative. Achieving 100% completion unlocks a secret ending. When the game is finished, a New Game Plus option gives players the opportunity to replay the game with different choices, with all of the items and storyline completion percentage previously achieved intact, but all character levels are reset.
The combat in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; uses an enhanced version of the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which characters and enemies take actions according to their speed. This implementation of ATB allows characters to interrupt enemies while they are preparing to take an action. With precise timing, it is possible to chain attacks together for greater damage. Characters may change their character class mid-battle using dresspheres and the Garment Grid. These dresspheres, based on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character classes, allow access to different abilities to alter the course of battle. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. Characters have access to dresspheres placed in the nodes. Depending on the properties of the Garment Grid, changing dresspheres in battle will grant bonuses such as increased strength or added elemental effects. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere with the use of Ability Points (AP). AP is earned by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere.

== Plot ==
=== Setting and characters ===

&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; takes place two years after &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and is set in the fictional world of Spira, which consists of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi&#x27;ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Spira is distinct from the mainly European-influenced worlds found in previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but previously disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. The lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello comprise the remaining sentient races. The &quot;unsent&quot; are the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into &quot;fiends&quot;, the monsters that are encountered throughout the game. Unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form.

Aesthetically, the world of Spira is largely unchanged in the two years since &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and many locations return. There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira&#x27;s people. Spira had been terrorized by a gargantuan monster called Sin for 1000 years, inhibiting technological advancement and trapping its people in a cycle of religious asceticism in hopes of praying Sin away. After Sin&#x27;s destruction during the events of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, an era of enlightenment known as &quot;the Eternal Calm&quot; began. Yuna, a main character of the previous game, is heralded as High Summoner for her pivotal role in this battle. The priests of the Yevon religion chose to expose the truth about the order&#x27;s role in perpetuating the cycle, leaving the populace to decide for themselves how to live in a world without Sin. Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are embraced by the people, who have begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of blitzball. Others have become hunters of ancient treasures, ranging from coins and machinery to arcane spheres in forgotten caves and ruins. These &quot;sphere hunters&quot; pursue the knowledge of ancient civilizations contained within.

In the absence of Yevon, various factions have formed. Young people were especially quick to abandon Yevon and embrace technology, while many of the older generation felt that cultural changes were happening too quickly. The most influential of the groups are the progressive Youth League led by Mevyn Nooj, the reformist New Yevon Party led by Praetor Baralai, and the Machine Faction led by Gippal which supplies weapons to both sides. By the start of the game, there are rising tensions between the Youth League and the New Yevon Party. Both groups have sought High Summoner Yuna&#x27;s endorsement.

The three main playable characters of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; are Yuna, Rikku, and Paine, members of the sphere hunter group called the Gullwings. Yuna was inspired to join after viewing a sphere recording that appeared to depict Tidus, her lost love who vanished during the ending of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles and, though their personalities are much the same as before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Spira as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. Paine is a new character designed for &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, to accommodate the game&#x27;s intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Several characters from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; appear in the game in supporting roles, including Brother, Wakka, and Lulu. Additionally, other characters are introduced in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, such as the faction leaders and the Leblanc Syndicate, a group of sphere hunters who serve as the Gullwings&#x27; rivals for much of the game. The game&#x27;s main antagonist is Shuyin, the unsent spirit of a fallen soldier during the Machina War 1000 years ago.

=== Story ===
Two years after Sin&#x27;s defeat, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine recover Yuna&#x27;s stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur. Meanwhile, the Gullwings discover a sphere containing images of an ancient machina weapon called &quot;Vegnagun&quot; that was secretly buried beneath Bevelle. The weapon has enough power to threaten all of Spira. The Gullwings join forces with the Leblanc Syndicate to investigate the underground areas of the city in an attempt to destroy the machine before it can be used by either side in the upcoming conflict. Discovering a large tunnel recently dug into the floor of the weapon&#x27;s chamber, they realize that Vegnagun has apparently moved to the Farplane, located deep below ground.

Disagreements between Spira&#x27;s factions are exacerbated by the disappearance of their leaders, Baralai, Nooj, and Gippal. In the underground areas of Bevelle, the Gullwings discover the missing faction leaders discussing Vegnagun and learn that the machine&#x27;s artificial intelligence allows it to detect hostility and respond by fleeing. Paine had once been comrades with all three men during an operation in the &quot;Den of Woe&quot;. Two years earlier, their squad explored the cave but a vengeful spirit drove them to kill one another. The four were the only survivors. The spirit—Shuyin, a soldier from the Machina War that led to the creation of Vegnagun—possessed Nooj and later forced him to shoot his comrades. Under Bevelle, Shuyin possesses Baralai and follows Vegnagun to the Farplane. Nooj and Gippal pursue, asking Yuna to keep things under control on the surface.

Yuna falls into the Farplane and meets Shuyin, who mistakes her for a woman named Lenne, whose memories are recorded in the Songstress dressphere. One thousand years ago, Shuyin was a famous blitzball player in the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand and Lenne&#x27;s lover. Desiring to save Lenne who had been conscripted into the Machina War between Zanarkand and Bevelle, he infiltrated Bevelle to hijack their secret weapon, Vegnagun. Lenne begged him to stop and Shuyin yielded, but a group of Bevelle soldiers arrived a moment later and executed the couple. In the present, Shuyin&#x27;s spirit expresses anger that the people have still not understood the pain of war and plans to use Vegnagun to destroy all of Spira in retribution. The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. The Songstress dressphere displays the scene of Shuyin and Lenne&#x27;s last moments to all the concertgoers, opening their eyes to the unproductive nature of their disagreements.

Although the factional fighting had ceased, Shuyin&#x27;s plan proceeds. Joining forces with the Leblanc Syndicate again, the Gullwings make their way to the Farplane and find Gippal and Nooj already battling Vegnagun. Once the group destroys Vegnagun, Yuna masquerades as Lenne to convince Shuyin to let go, but Shuyin eventually sees through her and attacks. The Gullwings defeat him and Lenne&#x27;s spirit appears to soothe him as they depart together. By fulfilling certain conditions, the ancient spirits known as fayth agree to restore Tidus to life and reunite him with Yuna. Players who achieve 100% completion see an additional reunion scene in Zanarkand where the pair discuss whether he is truly real or still a dream.

== Development ==
Development of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; began in late 2001 in response to the success of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, particularly fan reaction to the &quot;Eternal Calm&quot; video included in the Japanese version of &quot;Final Fantasy X International&quot;, which depicts Yuna&#x27;s everyday life after the game. &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The production team initially disliked the name &quot;X-2&quot;, but was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of the previous story and thus could not be the next numbered game in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game&#x27;s writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. He was particularly averse to the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story. The production team was one third the size of its predecessor. This was because the team was already familiar with the material, which allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. A significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs were reused from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura explained that this enabled the team to create the game in one year and at half the scope &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.

Producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Motomu Toriyama explained that the objective in mind when designing &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; was to embrace the concept of change as the game&#x27;s theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. Retaining the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could spend most of their time on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous game. &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; incorporated a number of elements from modern Japanese pop culture.

The ending of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; meant that the Aeon summoning system could not be used in the sequel, necessitating a new gameplay system. Because of the more optimistic setting, the designers drew inspiration from the magical girl subgenre of anime and manga to create the elaborate transformation sequences of the dressphere system. The influence of J-pop is prominent in the game&#x27;s opening sequence. They also drew inspiration from &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Toriyama explained that one of the goals during development was to provide a large variety of minigames, such that &quot;if you bought &quot;FFX-2&quot; you wouldn&#x27;t need any other game&quot;. The dressphere system and a lead cast of three non-&quot;macho&quot; girls were intended to keep the tone of the game light and lively. Lulu was excluded from the playable cast because, in addition to being married, her presence would have given her an &quot;older sister&quot; role to Yuna, rather than allow Yuna to discover herself on her own. Though work on the opening song and motion capture began early in development, the opening sequence was actually the last portion of the game to be completed.

=== Music ===

Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi composed the soundtrack to &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; instead of regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu. The soundtrack included two J-pop songs: &quot;Real Emotion&quot; and &quot;1000 Words&quot;. Koda Kumi performed the Japanese versions of the songs and did the motion capture for the &quot;Real Emotion&quot; full motion video shown in the game&#x27;s opening. She also voiced Lenne in the Japanese version of the game. Jade Villalon of Sweetbox recorded the songs&#x27; English versions and released extended versions as bonus tracks for the Japanese release of the album &quot;Adagio&quot;. Koda released her own English versions of &quot;Real Emotion&quot; and &quot;1000 Words&quot; on the CD single for &quot;Come with Me&quot;, with slightly different translations.

== Release ==
As with &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, Square Enix released an expanded version of the game, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission&quot;, in 2004 for the PlayStation 2. It introduces two new dresspheres, an additional &quot;Last Mission&quot; at a location called &quot;Yadonoki Tower&quot;, and the option to capture and battle with numerous monsters and characters including Tidus, Auron and Seymour Guado from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. This version was not released outside Japan, although the English voice track was used for the main story in this version. Due to this change, parts of the Japanese subtitles were changed or altered to fit the voice-overs. This was detailed in the strategy book for the international version. In 2005, a compilation featuring &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot; was released in Japan as &quot;Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box&quot;.

Several action figures, books, and soundtracks were released by Square Enix, including three &quot;Ultimania&quot; guidebooks, a series of artbooks and strategy guides published in Japan. They feature original artwork from &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game&#x27;s storyline, and feature several interviews with the game&#x27;s developers. There are three books in the series: &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania Ω&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission Ultimania&quot;. A similar three-book series was produced for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;.

Gaming peripheral company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers modeled after the Tiny Bee guns Yuna uses in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. These controllers were released only in Japan. They were re-released in a new silver box to coincide with the release of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission&quot;. Hori also released a vertical stand for the PlayStation 2 console, with a &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; logo that lights up in blue color when plugged in.

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot; were re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in celebration of the game&#x27;s 10-year anniversary. Production had started by January 2012, with Kitase involved. Both games are based on the expanded editions previously only released in Japan. The collection on PlayStation 3 was titled &quot;Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster&quot;. The two games were sold separately on PlayStation Vita in Japan. Outside of Japan, the Vita games were sold together as a collection. The remasters support the &quot;cross save&quot; feature, in which saved games from one platform may be transferred to another platform over the internet. The remaster collection was also released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015, PCs in 2016, followed by Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
According to review aggregator Metacritic, reviews for &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; were &quot;generally favorable&quot;. In 2006, readers of Japanese video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; ranked &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; as number 32 in a poll on the best video games of all time. The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded the character Rikku, performed vocally by Tara Strong, with &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance - Female&quot; in 2004 (tying with the character Niobe for &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, performed vocally by Jada Pinkett Smith); it also received nominations for &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction&quot;. Despite largely positive reviews from the video games press, &quot;Destructoid&quot; observed a significant backlash among fans against the game.

&quot;IGN&quot; summarized &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; as &quot;a brilliant and addictive romp&quot; through the world of Spira. &quot;GameSpot&quot; remarked that it was as endearing and poignant as its forebears, with strengths that outweighed any of its flaws. &quot;RPGamer&quot; regarded the battle system as innovative and &quot;very simple to navigate&quot;. While &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the battle system as a &quot;welcome addition&quot;, the reviewer disliked the increased inclusion of minigames. &quot;GameSpy&quot;, while initially unsure about the new system, praised it as a solid alternative with unexpected depth.

Critics had mixed reactions to &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;″s tonal shift from its predecessor. &quot;IGN&quot; felt the changes were part of its intrigue, praising the narrative&#x27;s political elements and comedic tone compared to the first game. The reviewer also praised the character writing and gameplay changes. Further praise came from &quot;RPGamer&quot;, with one staff reviewer summarizing it as &quot;a light-hearted fun game&quot; that &quot;may ... be the most enjoyable thing to come from the series in several years&quot;. By contrast, &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that some of the missions came off as too frivolous, and that its non-linear nature made the narrative unfocused compared to its predecessor.

The soundtrack was met with mixed reception, due to a lack of input from Uematsu and its shift to a J-pop style. Whereas &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;1Up.com&quot; commended the music as a fitting backdrop to the action and new tone, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; regarded it as &quot;too bubbly&quot;. &quot;RPGamer&quot; suggested that &quot;the absence of Uematsu proves deafening&quot;, but noted that its lighter atmosphere matched the tone and events of the game. The game&#x27;s reuse of graphical designs from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was the subject of criticism. &quot;RPGamer&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that, despite the lack of overt improvement on the first game, it was still one of the best-looking PlayStation 2 games at the time. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; regarded this reuse of code as &quot;[tripping up] in the one area where &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles usually shine&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; shared this view. &quot;RPGamer&quot; also criticized the multiple outfits as too revealing and aimed more at attracting male gamers than being true to the characters.

=== Sales ===
In 2003, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; sold over 1.94 million copies in Japan, making it the highest-selling game of the year. Within nine months of its Japanese release, it sold more than a million copies in North America (within two months of its release there), and nearly four million copies worldwide. It went on to sell 2.11 million units in Japan, 1.85 million units in the United States, and more than 100,000 units in the United Kingdom. &quot;International + Last Mission&quot; sold over 288,000 copies in Japan over the course of 2004. As of March 2013, the game has sold over 5.4 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2. By October 2013, &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and its sequel &quot;X-2&quot; had together sold over 14 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.

===Legacy===
After &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, Square Enix released direct sequels to other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, including &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy IV: The After Years&quot;, and two sequels to &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;. Joseph Leray of &quot;Destructoid&quot; attributed the fan backlash against the game to its status as the first direct sequel in the series and its light-hearted and &quot;girly&quot; tone. Reflecting on the game&#x27;s legacy, Dale Bashir of &quot;IGN&quot; declared it the best among &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; sequels, citing its innovations in non-linear and episodic storytelling. Fritz Fraundorf of the &quot;GIA&quot; likewise praised its open-ended nature, observing that it was the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game released in the wake of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;″s popularity. He felt that it was a worthy companion to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, with complementary themes, structure, and characterization. Katharine Castle of &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; appreciated the game for serving as the &quot;happy ending&quot; to Yuna&#x27;s story, a sentiment echoed by Mike Fahey of &quot;Kotaku&quot;, who also commended its ability not to take itself seriously.

<doc id="398633" wikidata="Q5122722" url="?curid=398633" title="Citizens Party (Hong Kong)">
<text>Citizens Party () was a small pro-democracy political party existed in Hong Kong from 1997 to 2008. It was founded by Legislative Council member Christine Loh in May 1997.

==Beliefs==
Being part of the pro-democracy camp, the Citizens Party demanded democratisation with the ultimate aims of universal suffrage which was stated in the Hong Kong Basic Law. However, it claimed to be more creative and less confrontational than the Democratic Party in seeking democratic reform and emphasised the importance of dialogue with the Beijing officials. In general, the party believed in an accountable government with representative democracy under rule of law, that would protect citizens&#x27; personal freedoms and equal opportunity, as well as promote tolerance and personal responsibility. In economic policies, the Citizens Party believed that free-market principles could best respond to change and provide choice. However, it also demanded proper regulation where there is an overriding public interest, such as to ensure fair competition.

The Citizens Party differentiated itself from other parties by stressing on anti-discrimination and minority issues and was particularly concerned with environmental protection. The Chairwoman Christine Loh was famous for her campaign on legislation and implementation of the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance, to ban any reclamation in the Victoria Harbour. It also opposed government&#x27;s proposal of building a prison on Hei Ling Chau Island. It also stressed the women&#x27;s rights, anti-discrimination and minority issues, such as demand for legislation against racial and sexual orientation discriminations.

==History==

It was officially founded on 4 May 1997 by 14 pro-democracy individuals on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong. Its first chair, Christine Loh Kung-wai, was a legislative council member elected in 1995. Loh proposed the legislation of the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance to prevent excessive harbour reclamation, which was passed in June 1997. The Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) controlled by the pro-Beijing politicians was asked by the SAR government to freeze the Ordinance. Loh and the Society for Protection of the Harbour eventually successfully lobbied the provisional legislature not to freeze the law.

Loh returned to the legislative council in the 1998 legislative council election in the Hong Kong Island, despite another party&#x27;s candidate Mozart Lui Yat-ming lost in the New Territories East. After Loh decided not to run for the 2000 LegCo election and resigned as chair before the election, the Citizens Party became less active in the political arena without representation in the legislative council. However, the party continued to express views in various issues.

In the 1999 District Council elections, the party won a seat in the Heng Fa Chuen constituency. In the 2003 District Council elections, its then chairman, Alex Chan Kai-chung, unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Lamma and Po Toi constituency.

The party officially wound itself up in December 2008, under Section 21 of the Companies Ordinance.

<doc id="398637" wikidata="Q1026205" url="?curid=398637" title="Laxey">
<text>Laxey () is a village on the east coast of the Isle of Man. Its name derives from the Old Norse &quot;Laxa&quot; meaning &#x27;Salmon River&#x27;. Its key distinguishing features are its three working vintage railways and the largest working waterwheel in the world. It is also the location of King Orry&#x27;s Grave.

The village lies on the A2, the main Douglas to Ramsey road, and on the vintage Manx Electric Railway, and Snaefell Mountain Railway. Laxey Glen is one of the Manx National Glens; another glen, Dhoon Glen, is about 1 miles away. The Raad ny Foillan long distance coastal footpath, opened in 1986, runs along the coast of Laxey Bay through the village.

==History==
In the 19th century lead and zinc mining began; it became the largest industry in the village, but ended in 1929. The village also had a fishing industry.

In the late 1800s the Manx Electric Railway line was built through the village, opening it up to tourists. Other attractions were built at that time, including Snaefell Mountain Railway and the Laxey Glen Pleasure Gardens.

Laxey village is now a mainly residential and tourist area. There are several public gardens, primarily Laxey Glen Gardens. There is also a handweaving mill which sells its own products and many others. The village has five pubs and a microbrewery, The Old Laxey Brewing Company.

The village is built around a wooded glen with a number of steep winding streets and paths leading to the floor of the glen, from where one can walk by the side of Laxey River to its outflow to the sea at the small harbour, and onto the beach and promenade. One can also walk around the cliffs to the north of the beach from opposite the &quot;La Mona Lisa Restaurant&quot;. This walk goes over the cairn (kern), from where there are views of Laxey Bay and Clay Head to the south. A Laxey-born and bred person would say, &quot;I&#x27;m going over the kern for a walk&quot;. 

Many of Laxey&#x27;s buildings were built as mining cottages in the traditional Manx style. To the southeast of the village centre, above the left bank of the Laxey River, is the &quot;Minorca&quot; area. &quot;Old Laxey&quot; has winding streets around the harbour. The village centre is a newer, late Victorian section further inland is the area of shops and services around the railway station.

===Mining===

The Great Laxey Mine was a silver, lead ore and zinc mine. The mine reached a depth in excess of 2,200 ft (670 m) and consisted primarily of three shafts: the Welsh Shaft, the Dumbell&#x27;s Shaft and the Engine Shaft, each of these shafts being connected by a series of levels. 

There is no exact date for the start of mining at Laxey, but by 1782 workings were being opened. The mine yielded zinc, silver ore, copper pyrites and hematite iron in significant quantities; and by the 1830s over 200 men were employed in the mines, the figure rising steadily until over 600 were employed by 1900.

Following various short-term closures, by May 1929 rumours had begun to circulate about the future of the mine. By then, most of the miners had left, with many emigrating to South Africa, Australia or the United States of America. Continued flooding in the lower reaches of the mine combined with antiquated pumping machinery finally led to the end of mining operations at Laxey, and on the Isle of Man. However some of the spoil residue was brought to the washing floors to extract any remaining worth from it. It is thought that this continued until 1934, when all working finally ceased.

==Demographics==
The Isle of Man census 2011 lists the village district population as 1,705. It is the fourth largest village on the island.

==Governance==
Historically, Laxey was in the parish of Lonan within the sheading of Garff.

Until 2016, Laxey was a village district with its own commissioners. From 1 May 2016, it merged with the parishes of Lonan and Maughold to form the new parish district of Garff, within which it is a ward.

Laxey is also part of the Keys constituency of Garff, whose representation increased in 2016 from one to two members.

==Tourism==

=== Laxey Wheel ===

Laxey Wheel, also known as Lady Isabella after the wife of The Hon. Charles Hope, then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, was built in 1854 to pump water from the Laxey mine shafts. Now a tourist attraction, it is claimed to be the largest working waterwheel in the world. Designed by Robert Casement, it is in diameter and wide. It revolves at about 3 rpm. The wheel was owned by Edwin Kneale from 1939 to 1965; he saved it from being dismantled and ran it as a tourist attraction, before passing it on to the Manx nation, with the agreement that it should be kept in perpetual running order for the people of the Isle of Man. In 1965 the Isle of Man Government bought the wheel and the site. Restoration work began, and in 1989 it was put under the control of Manx National Heritage.

The Great Laxey Mine Railway re-opened with two small steam engines in September 2004 to carry passengers along the restored route.

===Laxey Woollen Mills===
The Laxey Woollen Mills were founded in 1881 by Egbert Rydings, supported by John Ruskin, and were originally water powered. The mills are known for producing Manx tartan which is used to make a variety of items from hats, scarfs and kilt skirts to capes and rugs. The cloth is made of fine Manx Loaghtan wool and woven on traditional-style looms. One loom operates by bicycle-power. The mills are now mainly a working shop, but still weave the Manx tartan and other cloth. The Laxey Woollen Mills also contain a busy craft shop, a tea-room, and the Hodgson Loom Gallery, which holds monthly arts and crafts exhibitions.

===Laxey Harbour and Bay===
The village has a small harbour at the river mouth which was built in the 1850s to service the mining industry. It is now used by leisure craft and inshore fishing vessels that utilise Laxey Bay and further offshore. Laxey Bay is a protected Marine Nature Reserve.

===Ancient monument===
Laxey is the site of King Orry&#x27;s Grave.

===Conventions===
The Isle of Man is a popular venue for conventions. As an example, Laxey was the venue for the Linux Bier Wanderung in 2016.

==Transport==

Laxey lies on the Manx Electric Railway, a vintage line which runs for 17 miles along the coast, between Douglas and Ramsey. Laxey station is in the north of the village and is also the southern terminus of the Snaefell Mountain Railway which runs for five miles between Laxey and the top of Snaefell mountain. 

Laxey is also on the route of most buses between Douglas and Ramsey.

==Religion==
Laxey had a number of Methodist chapels. Shore Road Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1825, and closed in 1870. Glen Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was opened in 1850. It closed in 1966. Minorca Primitive Methodist Chapel was opened in 1870 and Sunday School was built in 1898 in land across the road; the chapel closed in 1966 when Glen Road and Minorca combined. In 1970 Minorca&#x27;s Sunday School building became the new Methodist chapel for Laxey.

Christ Church, the Church of England parish church, was built to a design of Ewan Christian and constructed by the mining company at a cost of £950. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Sodor and Man, Lord Auckland, on 27 May 1856.

==Education==
Laxey School is a primary school located on Quarry Road.

==Twinnage==
Laxey is twinned with Bagillt, North Wales. 

==Sport==
Laxey F.C., based at Glen Road, play in the Isle of Man Football League.

<doc id="398638" wikidata="Q846303" url="?curid=398638" title="Biogeochemical cycle">
<text>A biogeochemical cycle, or more generally a cycle of matter, is the movement and transformation of chemical elements and compounds between living organisms, the atmosphere, and the Earth&#x27;s crust. Major biogeochemical cycles include the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle. In each cycle, the chemical element or molecule is transformed and cycled by living organisms and through various geological forms and reservoirs, including the atmosphere, the soil and the oceans. It can be thought of as the pathway by which a chemical substance (is turned over or moves through) the biotic compartment and the abiotic compartments of Earth. The biotic compartment is the biosphere and the abiotic compartments are the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere.

For example, in the carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, which converts it into organic compounds that are used by organisms for energy and growth. Carbon is then released back into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition. Additionally, carbon is stored in fossil fuels and is released into the atmosphere through human activities such as burning fossil fuels. In the nitrogen cycle, atmospheric nitrogen gas is converted by plants into usable forms such as ammonia and nitrates through the process of nitrogen fixation. These compounds can be used by other organisms, and nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere through denitrification and other processes. In the water cycle, the universal solvent water evaporates from land and oceans to form clouds in the atmosphere, and then precipitates back to different parts of the planet. Precipitation can seep into the ground and become part of groundwater systems used by plants and other organisms, or can runoff the surface to form lakes and rivers. Subterranean water can then seep into the ocean along with river discharges, rich with dissolved and particulate organic matter and other nutrients.

There are biogeochemical cycles for many other elements, such as for oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus, calcium, iron, sulfur, mercury and selenium. There are also cycles for molecules, such as water and silica. In addition there are macroscopic cycles such as the rock cycle, and human-induced cycles for synthetic compounds such as for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In some cycles there are geological reservoirs where substances can remain or be sequestered for long periods of time.

Biogeochemical cycles involve the interaction of biological, geological, and chemical processes. Biological processes include the influence of microorganisms, which are critical drivers of biogeochemical cycling. Microorganisms have the ability to carry out wide ranges of metabolic processes essential for the cycling of nutrients (macronutrients and micronutrients) and chemicals throughout global ecosystems. Without microorganisms many of these processes would not occur, with significant impact on the functioning of land and ocean ecosystems and the planet&#x27;s biogeochemical cycles as a whole. Changes to cycles can impact human health. The cycles are interconnected and play important roles regulating climate, supporting the growth of plants, phytoplankton and other organisms, and maintaining the health of ecosystems generally. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels and using large amounts of fertilizer can disrupt cycles, contributing to climate change, pollution, and other environmental problems.

==Overview==

Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels. However, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules — carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur — take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates, all play a role in this recycling of materials. Because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle.

The six aforementioned elements are used by organisms in a variety of ways. Hydrogen and oxygen are found in water and organic molecules, both of which are essential to life. Carbon is found in all organic molecules, whereas nitrogen is an important component of nucleic acids and proteins. Phosphorus is used to make nucleic acids and the phospholipids that comprise biological membranes. Sulfur is critical to the three-dimensional shape of proteins. The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is critical for leaching sulfur and phosphorus into rivers which can then flow into oceans. Minerals cycle through the biosphere between the biotic and abiotic components and from one organism to another.

Ecological systems (ecosystems) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a part of the system, for example, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, etc. All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere), and/or the air (atmosphere).

The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the nutrients — such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur — used in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a &quot;closed system&quot;; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system.

The major parts of the biosphere are connected by the flow of chemical elements and compounds in biogeochemical cycles. In many of these cycles, the biota plays an important role. Matter from the Earth&#x27;s interior is released by volcanoes. The atmosphere exchanges some compounds and elements rapidly with the biota and oceans. Exchanges of materials between rocks, soils, and the oceans are generally slower by comparison.

The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an &quot;open system&quot;; the Sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the trophic levels of a food web. Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of food energy. These compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by plants to make organic compounds. The chemical reaction is powered by the light energy of sunshine.

Sunlight is required to combine carbon with hydrogen and oxygen into an energy source, but ecosystems in the deep sea, where no sunlight can penetrate, obtain energy from sulfur. Hydrogen sulfide near hydrothermal vents can be utilized by organisms such as the giant tube worm. In the sulfur cycle, sulfur can be forever recycled as a source of energy. Energy can be released through the oxidation and reduction of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur to sulfite and then to sulfate).

Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the Sun, its chemical composition is essentially fixed, as the additional matter is only occasionally added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.

Biogeochemical cycles can be contrasted with geochemical cycles. The latter deals only with crustal and subcrustal reservoirs even though some process from both overlap.

==Compartments==

===Atmosphere===
===Hydrosphere===

The global ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth&#x27;s surface and is remarkably heterogeneous. Marine productive areas, and coastal ecosystems comprise a minor fraction of the ocean in terms of surface area, yet have an enormous impact on global biogeochemical cycles carried out by microbial communities, which represent 90% of the ocean&#x27;s biomass. Work in recent years has largely focused on cycling of carbon and macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate: other important elements such as sulfur or trace elements have been less studied, reflecting associated technical and logistical issues. Increasingly, these marine areas, and the taxa that form their ecosystems, are subject to significant anthropogenic pressure, impacting marine life and recycling of energy and nutrients. A key example is that of cultural eutrophication, where agricultural runoff leads to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment of coastal ecosystems, greatly increasing productivity resulting in algal blooms, deoxygenation of the water column and seabed, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, with direct local and global impacts on nitrogen and carbon cycles. However, the runoff of organic matter from the mainland to coastal ecosystems is just one of a series of pressing threats stressing microbial communities due to global change. Climate change has also resulted in changes in the cryosphere, as glaciers and permafrost melt, resulting in intensified marine stratification, while shifts of the redox-state in different biomes are rapidly reshaping microbial assemblages at an unprecedented rate.

Global change is, therefore, affecting key processes including primary productivity, CO2 and N2 fixation, organic matter respiration/remineralization, and the sinking and burial deposition of fixed CO2. In addition to this, oceans are experiencing an acidification process, with a change of ~0.1 pH units between the pre-industrial period and today, affecting carbonate/bicarbonate buffer chemistry. In turn, acidification has been reported to impact planktonic communities, principally through effects on calcifying taxa. There is also evidence for shifts in the production of key intermediary volatile products, some of which have marked greenhouse effects (e.g., N2O and CH4, reviewed by Breitburg in 2018, due to the increase in global temperature, ocean stratification and deoxygenation, driving as much as 25 to 50% of nitrogen loss from the ocean to the atmosphere in the so-called oxygen minimum zones or anoxic marine zones, driven by microbial processes. Other products, that are typically toxic for the marine nekton, including reduced sulfur species such as H2S, have a negative impact for marine resources like fisheries and coastal aquaculture. While global change has accelerated, there has been a parallel increase in awareness of the complexity of marine ecosystems, and especially the fundamental role of microbes as drivers of ecosystem functioning.

===Lithosphere===
===Biosphere===
Microorganisms drive much of the biogeochemical cycling in the earth system.

== Reservoirs ==
The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a &quot;reservoir&quot;, which, for example, includes such things as coal deposits that are storing carbon for a long period of time. When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in &quot;exchange pools&quot;. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals.

Plants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy. Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it back into the air or surrounding medium. Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its residence time or turnover time (also called the renewal time or exit age).

==Box models==

Box models are widely used to model biogeochemical systems. Box models are simplified versions of complex systems, reducing them to boxes (or storage reservoirs) for chemical materials, linked by material fluxes (flows). Simple box models have a small number of boxes with properties, such as volume, that do not change with time. The boxes are assumed to behave as if they were mixed homogeneously. These models are often used to derive analytical formulas describing the dynamics and steady-state abundance of the chemical species involved.

The diagram at the right shows a basic one-box model. The reservoir contains the amount of material &quot;M&quot; under consideration, as defined by chemical, physical or biological properties. The source &quot;Q&quot; is the flux of material into the reservoir, and the sink &quot;S&quot; is the flux of material out of the reservoir. The budget is the check and balance of the sources and sinks affecting material turnover in a reservoir. The reservoir is in a steady state if &quot;Q&quot; = &quot;S&quot;, that is, if the sources balance the sinks and there is no change over time.

The residence or turnover time is the average time material spends resident in the reservoir. If the reservoir is in a steady state, this is the same as the time it takes to fill or drain the reservoir. Thus, if τ is the turnover time, then τ = &quot;M&quot;/&quot;S&quot;. The equation describing the rate of change of content in a reservoir is

: formula_1

When two or more reservoirs are connected, the material can be regarded as cycling between the reservoirs, and there can be predictable patterns to the cyclic flow. More complex multibox models are usually solved using numerical techniques.

The diagram on the left shows a simplified budget of ocean carbon flows. It is composed of three simple interconnected box models, one for the euphotic zone, one for the ocean interior or dark ocean, and one for ocean sediments. In the euphotic zone, net phytoplankton production is about 50 Pg C each year. About 10 Pg is exported to the ocean interior while the other 40 Pg is respired. Organic carbon degradation occurs as particles (marine snow) settle through the ocean interior. Only 2 Pg eventually arrives at the seafloor, while the other 8 Pg is respired in the dark ocean. In sediments, the time scale available for degradation increases by orders of magnitude with the result that 90% of the organic carbon delivered is degraded and only 0.2 Pg C yr−1 is eventually buried and transferred from the biosphere to the geosphere.

The diagram on the right shows a more complex model with many interacting boxes. Reservoir masses here represents &quot;carbon stocks&quot;, measured in Pg C. Carbon exchange fluxes, measured in Pg C yr−1, occur between the atmosphere and its two major sinks, the land and the ocean. The black numbers and arrows indicate the reservoir mass and exchange fluxes estimated for the year 1750, just before the Industrial Revolution. The red arrows (and associated numbers) indicate the annual flux changes due to anthropogenic activities, averaged over the 2000–2009 time period. They represent how the carbon cycle has changed since 1750. Red numbers in the reservoirs represent the cumulative changes in anthropogenic carbon since the start of the Industrial Period, 1750–2011.

==Fast and slow cycles==

There are fast and slow biogeochemical cycles. Fast cycle operate in the biosphere and slow cycles operate in rocks. Fast or biological cycles can complete within years, moving substances from atmosphere to biosphere, then back to the atmosphere. Slow or geological cycles can take millions of years to complete, moving substances through the Earth&#x27;s crust between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere.

As an example, the fast carbon cycle is illustrated in the diagram below on the left. This cycle involves relatively short-term biogeochemical processes between the environment and living organisms in the biosphere. It includes movements of carbon between the atmosphere and terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as soils and seafloor sediments. The fast cycle includes annual cycles involving photosynthesis and decadal cycles involving vegetative growth and decomposition. The reactions of the fast carbon cycle to human activities will determine many of the more immediate impacts of climate change.

The slow cycle is illustrated in the diagram above on the right. It involves medium to long-term geochemical processes belonging to the rock cycle. The exchange between the ocean and atmosphere can take centuries, and the weathering of rocks can take millions of years. Carbon in the ocean precipitates to the ocean floor where it can form sedimentary rock and be subducted into the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Mountain building processes result in the return of this geologic carbon to the Earth&#x27;s surface. There the rocks are weathered and carbon is returned to the atmosphere by degassing and to the ocean by rivers. Other geologic carbon returns to the ocean through the hydrothermal emission of calcium ions. In a given year between 10 and 100 million tonnes of carbon moves around this slow cycle. This includes volcanoes returning geologic carbon directly to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. However, this is less than one percent of the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.

==Deep cycles==
The terrestrial subsurface is the largest reservoir of carbon on earth, containing 14–135 Pg of carbon and 2–19% of all biomass. Microorganisms drive organic and inorganic compound transformations in this environment and thereby control biogeochemical cycles. Current knowledge of the microbial ecology of the subsurface is primarily based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Recent estimates show that &lt;8% of 16S rRNA sequences in public databases derive from subsurface organisms and only a small fraction of those are represented by genomes or isolates. Thus, there is remarkably little reliable information about microbial metabolism in the subsurface. Further, little is known about how organisms in subsurface ecosystems are metabolically interconnected. Some cultivation-based studies of syntrophic consortia and small-scale metagenomic analyses of natural communities suggest that organisms are linked via metabolic handoffs: the transfer of redox reaction products of one organism to another. However, no complex environments have been dissected completely enough to resolve the metabolic interaction networks that underpin them. This restricts the ability of biogeochemical models to capture key aspects of the carbon and other nutrient cycles. New approaches such as genome-resolved metagenomics, an approach that can yield a comprehensive set of draft and even complete genomes for organisms without the requirement for laboratory isolation have the potential to provide this critical level of understanding of biogeochemical processes.

==Some examples==
Some of the more well-known biogeochemical cycles are shown below:

Many biogeochemical cycles are currently being studied for the first time. Climate change and human impacts are drastically changing the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles, which include:
* the mercury cycle, and 
* the human-caused cycle of PCBs.


Biogeochemical cycles always involve active equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale.

As biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary. The carbon cycle may be related to research in ecology and atmospheric sciences. Biochemical dynamics would also be related to the fields of geology and pedology.

<text>Onchan (; ) is a large village in the parish of Onchan on the Isle of Man. It is at the north end of Douglas Bay. Administratively a district, it has the second largest population of settlements on the island, after Douglas, with which it forms a conurbation.

In Manx the name for the village is &quot;Kione Droghad&quot; meaning &quot;bridge end&quot;.

==Early history==
In the 1890s, a 5,000-year-old stone age axe was found in the Cassa Field by Onchan wetlands. In the Viking reign Onchan became part of Middle sheading. The name of the village is identified with St Connachan who was Bishop of Sodor and Man in 540 and the church named after him, Kirk Coonachan. An early name for the village is which literally translated means &quot;bridgehead&quot;. The earliest written record of Kiondroghad was in the 1643 Manorial Roll, when it was very small. The name Kiondroghad appeared on the 1841 census but not the one in 1851.

==The &quot;Butt&quot;==

Gradually the village spread beyond Church Road, known locally as &quot;The Butt&quot;. At the junction with the track that led towards the mountains (Avondale Road) a few more cottages appeared in the early 19th century. In the late 19th century land was sold off for terraces of houses to be built. The area surrounding Church Road is today the village&#x27;s heritage area and the location of Molly Carooin&#x27;s Cottage, which is maintained by the Friends Of Onchan&#x27;s Heritage, a local volunteer group. The area features period lamp standards, and since 2001 has been home to the newly developed Village Green which links Church Road with the Onchan Wetlands to the north west. There is also a vehicle garage, a highways department depot, a barber shop and several residential dwellings in the area which leads to St Peter&#x27;s Church via the one-way road. The &quot;Jubilee Lamp&quot; was erected in this road in 1987 after relocation from White City, and this was the first electrically lit lamp standard on the island.

==20th century development==

In the early 20th century the Port Jack area was being developed in connection with the Douglas Bay Estate Company&#x27;s promotion of land sales on the Howstrake Farm. They also built an electric urban railway which later became a coastal railway to Ramsey. There was then a mixture of private houses, terraced houses and guest houses to take the overflow of visitors to Douglas. There was further development in the 1930s. During the Victorian and Edwardian tourism boom Onchan made a bid to become the island&#x27;s second resort, encouraging the building of hotels and guest houses. The Manx Electric Railway was constructed in 1893, but never achieved its goal of connecting with the heart of Douglas for commuter journeys. In the early 20th century Lower Onchan, around the Port Jack area, was the first area on the island to have electric-powered street lighting, powered by the Manx Electric Railway generators. After World War II development gradually continued, and in the 1960s the village commissioners built local authority housing.

==Government House==

The official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, the representative on the Isle of Man of the Lord of Mann, currently King Charles III, is Government House on Governor&#x27;s Road. Originally named Bemahague House, the house was leased to Governor Henry Brougham Loch in 1865, and purchased by the Isle of Man Government in 1903 as the official residence for the Sovereign&#x27;s representative.

==Transport==

There are ten Manx Electric Railway stops in Onchan. Onchan Head railway station was the first official stop on the line and served the former White City pleasure grounds. There are also stops at Port Jack Halt, Gandhi Indian Restaurant, the former Majestic Hotel, Braeside, Far End, Howstrake, Groudle Old Road, Groudle Glen and Eskadale. The village has a frequent bus service of Bus Vannin: there are several local services in Onchan and Douglas; these serve the various housing estates including Ballachrink, Lakeside Gardens, Birch Hill and Governor&#x27;s Hill. The last of these is in Douglas, but through services often link all estates. There is now a regular through service to Nobles Hospital, north-west of Douglas. Onchan is also served by buses to Laxey and Ramsey as well as by local taxi firms.

==Religion==
The Church of England parish church in Onchan is St Peter&#x27;s on Church Road. The original church, dedicated to St Conchan, dated back to the 12th century. By 1760 the walls and roof had become dangerous and it was condemned in 1771. But nothing was done until the Bishop of Sodor and Man, Bishop Ward commissioned a new church. Its foundation stone was laid in 1830, but due to pressures from the parishioners, it was moved to its current position. The church was built by John Samuel Skillicorn, and was consecrated in 1833. It was dedicated to Saint Peter. The church was refurbished in 1863. In 1897 it was the first church on the island to be lit by electricity, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria; the electricity was supplied by the Isle of Man Tramways and Power Company.
 St Anthony&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is located on Ridgeway Road. Onchan Methodist Church, part of the Douglas and Peel circuit, is on Main Road. Onchan Baptist Church is on Whitebridge Road.

==Facilities and accommodation==

The main shopping areas are The Village Walk, a small shopping arcade and Avondale Court, both off Avondale Road, Main Road and Port Jack. A house on the Whitebridge Road at one time had its own (private) miniature railway in its grounds. This was never a public railway. Onchan Community Centre is located off School Road with a community hall, sports hall, games room and committee room. There are a number of hotels and guest houses in the village and the Glen Dhoo and Lower Ballacottier campsites. DHSOB FC operate a campsite each year during the annual Isle of Man TT motorcycle racing. The area has a number of residential housing estates including a large collection of local authority housing at Nursery Avenue, an estate at Ballachrink which also houses more local authority dwellings, Lakeside Gardens to the north east side of the village, Birch Hill, which can be found above the core village area and a number of older residences in the centre, notably Royal Avenue, Port Jack and Alberta Drive all of which were developed in the earliest years of the twentieth century.

==Demographics==
The Isle of Man census 2021 lists the population as 9,039, down from the 2016 figure of 9,128, which was a decrease from the population of 9,273 in 2011. It is the largest village on the island. It also has a higher population than all three of the island&#x27;s towns - Castletown, Peel and Ramsey, making it the second largest settlement on the island (Douglas, a city since 2024, is the largest). Onchan is now principally a dormitory village, providing homes for workers in nearby Douglas.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in Onchan, Onchan Primary School on School Road with nearly 400 pupils and Ashley Hill Primary School () on Ashley Road which was opened in 1972 and has about 350 pupils.
For secondary education children in Onchan usually go to either Ballakermeen High School in Douglas or St Ninian&#x27;s High School which has a lower school (years 7–9) in Onchan and an upper school (years 10–11 and sixth form) in Upper Douglas.

(DHSOB FC) are based at the DHSOB Football Ground, Blackberry Lane and are in the Premier League. Onchan F.C. are based at Nivison stadium, Onchan Pleasure Park and are in Division 2. The stadium was opened in 1952.

===Stock cars===
There is stock car racing held each week in the summer months in the Pleasure Park organised by the British Stock Car Association. There is also bowling, tennis and kart racing at the park as well as the Onchan Squash and Social Club.

===Equestrian===
The Abbeyland Equestrian Centre is on Scollag Road, but this has been knocked down and built over by houses.

===Golf===
King Edward Bay Golf Club is an 18-hole golf course located in an elevated position on the east side of the village off the A11 King Edward Road.

===Pleasure Park===
Onchan Pleasure Park is a leisure park which has a boating lake, miniature golf course, football pitch, tennis courts and a British Stock Car Association stock car racing track. Onchan Village Commissioners purchased farmland after World War II to build new homes and a recreation area with a large park containing a stadium with the first ever banked cycle track which was opened by Reg Harris, World Champion Sprint Cyclist and Britain&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year, on 19 June 1951. The park cost £50,000 to build. The stadium is no longer used for cycling.

==Glens==
===Groudle Glen===
Groudle Glen and Molly Quirk&#x27;s Glen meet at the Whitebridge, at the northern edge of the village on the main A2 coast road to Laxey. Groudle Glen extends right down to the coast and has been described as one of the most spectacular of all the island&#x27;s glens. It was developed in the 1890s as a pleasure glen, with trees planted and long winding paths added. A bandstand, swings and various other minor attractions were also added. On the rocky headland, a small inlet had been dammed off to form a deep pool, which became the centre of the small headland zoo which exhibited sea lions and polar bears. To get visitors out to the highland zoo, the glen owners built a miniature railway. Today, the attractions have all but disappeared apart from the Groudle Glen Railway, which still runs during the summer months operated by a group of local railway enthusiasts, who in the 1980s completely re-built the line after it was closed and ripped up in the early 1960s.

===Molly Quirk&#x27;s Glen===
Molly Quirk&#x27;s Glen was reputedly named after a woman who was murdered in her cottage. The glen covers about . At the far end of the glen the Clypse and Kerrowdhoo reservoirs now have a series of footpaths and ancient tracks for walkers.

===Bibaloe Glen===
Bibaloe Glen was named after a ford at the bottom of Whitebridge Hill.

===&quot;Raad Ny Foillan&quot;===
The Raad ny Foillan (Way of the Gull) long distance coastal footpath opened in 1986, and runs along the coast in the village. It starts at Port Jack where it connects with Douglas, and runs as far as Howstrake Head before continuing into the neighbouring parish of Lonan.

==Onchan wetlands==

The Onchan wetlands () is a nature reserve in Onchan village that contains a variety of habitats. The site was donated to the Manx Wildlife Trust in 1988 and is open to the public for viewing and has a footpath which is suitable for wheelchair users. The site contains &quot;curragh&quot; (wetlands - willow scrub), broadleaved trees, &quot;dub&quot; (pond), neutral grassland and embankments of tall grassland. This variety of habitats leads to a diversity of wildlife and plant life. Some of the plants and trees that grow in the wetlands are silver birch, ash, holly, rowan, marsh marigold, yellow flag, reed canary grass, hemlock water-dropwort, woody nightshade and cuckoo flower. Birds recorded on the site are the grey wagtail, heron, mallard, goldcrest, woodcock, chiffchaff and hen harrier (rare) along with invertebrates and bats. There are also many frogs and spawn in early summer.

<text>Peel ( &#x27;port of the Island&#x27;) is a seaside town and small fishing port in the Isle of Man, in the historic parish of German but administered separately. Peel is the third largest town in the Island after Douglas and Ramsey but the fourth largest settlement, as Onchan has the second largest population but is classified as a village.

Until 2016 (when it was merged with Glenfaba) Peel was also a House of Keys constituency, electing one Member of the House of Keys (MHK), who, from September 2015, was Ray Harmer. 

Peel has a ruined castle on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, and a cathedral, seat of the Diocese of Sodor and Man (the diocese was founded when Mann was ruled by the Norse).

== Name ==
The English name for the town, &quot;Peel&quot;, means &#x27;palisade, fortification&#x27; comes from Middle English &quot;peel&quot; ~ &quot;pele&quot;, ultimately from Latin &quot;pālus&quot; &#x27;stake&#x27;. It is a shortened version of the earlier &quot;Peeltown&quot; &#x27;town of the fortification&#x27; in reference to Peel Castle. An earlier name for the settlement was Holmtown meaning &#x27;UIsland town&#x27;, &lt;holm&gt; coming from Old Norse &quot;holmr&quot; &#x27;island&#x27;, in reference to St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, where Peel Castle is located. This is the same referent of the Manx name &quot;Purt ny h-Inshey&quot; &#x27;harbour of the Island&#x27;, sometimes &quot;Balley ny h-Inshey&quot; &#x27;town of the Island&#x27;; &quot;inshey&quot; comes from the genitive of a hypothetical Manx *&quot;insh&quot; &#x27;island&#x27; (related to Irish &quot;inis&quot;) and only appears in toponyms.

==Geography==
Peel is on the west coast of the Isle of Man, on the east side of the mouth of the River Neb. To the north west is St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, connected to the mainland by a causeway, and to the west across the river is Peel Hill. The A1 road connects Peel with Douglas. The A4 and A3 roads connect it with Kirk Michael and Ramsey. To the south of Peel is Castletown, the former capital of the Island, and to the SE is Douglas. Ireland to the west and Scotland to the north may be seen on a clear day.

The older part of Peel is built of reddish Peel Sandstone, mostly the original homes and businesses of fishermen and merchants with narrow winding lanes by the quayside. Before 1765, the town had a busy import-export trade importing goods from ports such as Amsterdam; in the mid to late 19th century the town was a busy fishing port.

==Demographics==
The Isle of Man census 2016 lists the population as 5,374, an increase from 5,093 in 2011.

==Governance==
The local authority is Peel Town Commissioners who are based at the Town Hall on Derby Road. There are nine commissioners. The day-to-day activities of the authority are run by the clerk.

==Town history==
Peel was the capital of the Island before the King of Mann moved his home and military base from Peel Castle to Castle Rushen. The last King of Man, Magnús Óláfsson, is recorded in the Chronicle of Mann to have died at Rushen Castle in 1265.

Peel is the Island&#x27;s main fishing port and Peel Cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Sodor and Man.

Peel is sometimes referred to as the &quot;rose red city&quot;, due to the red sandstone used to build the castle and other important buildings. As it is in the west, it is also called the &quot;sunset city&quot;. Peel is a popular seaside destination for Manx residents and visitors in summer. It has narrow streets of fishermen&#x27;s cottages and a Victorian promenade which was built on reclaimed land and a small construction line built for this purpose, as well as sandy beaches. For many years the main industries in the town were fishing, trading and shipbuilding.

There is evidence of local settlers in the Mesolithic Age on both St Patrick&#x27;s Isle and the nearby Peel Hill, and Neolithic farmers are believed to have settled in the area.

About 550, a Celtic monastery was founded on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle.
 Excavations in the 1980s found a large early Christian burial ground, many of the burials dating from around 550. Some later graves had Norse burial goods: e.g. the &#x27;Pagan Lady&#x27;. The ruins of the original Peel Cathedral (c.1250) can be seen within the walls of Peel Castle on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle. This replaced an earlier church.

Norsemen first came to Mann around the year 800, and ruled the Island for four-and-a-half centuries before finally ceding it to the King of Scotland in 1266.
Norsemen settled in Peel and used the harbour on the River Neb as a shelter for their longships. In 1228 Olaf the Black, King of Mann and the Isles, beached his fleet in the inlet. It was attacked and burned by his half-brother Ragnald. In 1266, as agreed in the Treaty of Perth, Norway&#x27;s King Magnus VI ceded the Isle of Man to Scotland. The Island came under English control in the 14th century.

The town of Peel developed on the east bank of the river and the settlement was known as Holmtown until the 17th century. Later development, apart from the late 19th century guest house building on the sea front, has been inland, away from the coast. The name Peel was given to the castle by the English rulers, and the settlement then became Peeltown until about 1860. By the time the local councils were established in 1883, the name Peel referred to the town rather than the castle. In the 19th century, schooners built in Peel traded around northwest Europe and Peel fishing boats fished around the Island and further afield to the southern coast of Ireland and near to Shetland. The harbour and breakwater were gradually improved, with much of the local income derived from the export of salted herring. By the 1880s, fishing was the main employer with about 3,000 men and boys employed, with ancillary businesses such as shipbuilding providing employment to hundreds more. However, with what is now seen as over-fishing, the number of boats leaving for Ireland dwindled from 300 in 1880 to a handful by 1915.

After the railway arrived in Peel in 1873, Peel started to develop as a tourist resort, with guest houses and hotels built along the shoreline and headlands, and then the promenade was added. Tourism gradually grew in the town. During World War I Knockaloe Farm, at Patrick to the south of the town, was made into the Knockaloe internment camp and housed up to 30,000 German, Austrian and Turkish civilians. In 1940, guest houses at one end of the promenade were requisitioned to become Peveril Internment Camp, housing those suspected of having sympathy for the Nazi regime under the UK&#x27;s Defence Regulation 18B. By the late 1960s the Peel to Douglas railway line had closed and tourism declined. Fishing from Peel has seen periods of upturn and decline. For a number of years the annual Viking Festival has attracted visitors to the resort. In 1979 &quot;Odin&#x27;s Raven&quot;, a replica of a Viking longship, sailed from Norway to Peel to commemorate the millennium of the legendary first sitting of the Isle of Man&#x27;s Parliament, Tynwald. In 2005, a new floodgate was installed at Peel to retain the waters of the River Neb and thus enable the moored boats to float at low tide.

Peel is the birthplace of Peel microcars, made by the Peel Engineering Company in the 1960s, the only Manx cars ever built.

==Amenities==
Peel has a campsite, swimming pool, tennis courts, BMX track, football ground, golf club, bowling green and various other amenities.

===House of Manannan Museum===
The House of Manannan Museum was built in 1997, costing £5.5 million, partly new and partly in the old Peel railway station. The museum covers the past and present of the Island and houses &quot;Odin&#x27;s Raven&quot;, a two-thirds scale replica of a Viking longship which had been built in and sailed from Norway, arriving on 4 July 1979 to celebrate the millennium of the High Court of Tynwald, the legislature of the Isle of Man.

===Manx Transportation Museum===
The Manx Transportation Museum, which opened in 2002, is housed in the former Brickworks building near the harbour.

===Leece Museum===
The Leece Museum was established in 1984 and relocated to the Old Courthouse building in East Quay in 2000. The museum is devoted to objects, photographs and documents specifically relating to the town. The museum now has a large display of TT and Manx Grand Prix racing bikes, on and off-road and vintage bikes along with memorabilia from the TT races.

===Peel Castle===
Peel Castle is on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, a small island connected to Peel Hill by a causeway. It is thought that the castle was started by Magnus Barelegs (King Magnus III of Norway, also known as Magnus Barefoot) and then extended in 1392 by William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. The castle is now a tourist attraction open in summer. There is a public footpath around the castle. Archaeological investigations have uncovered evidence of a cemetery dating to around AD 550, and Norse fortifications. The &quot;Pagan Lady&quot; burial discovered within the castle grounds was a Christian-style grave but with various grave goods in the Norse style, including a necklace of beads traded from various countries in Europe and the Mediterranean. No pagan Viking-age burial in the British Isles has produced grave goods of such high quality.

==Events==
Regular events from spring to autumn based in Peel include: the Isle of Man Art Festival (WOSAT) in May; Peel Day during TT fortnight (May/June); Peel Secret Gardens (usually July); Yn Chruinnaght Inter-Celtic Festival (July); Peel Viking Longboat Races (July), and Peel Carnival.

==Kipper production==
Kippers have been produced in Peel since at least the 19th century. Two kipper houses remain: Moore&#x27;s Kipper Yard (established 1884) which provides tours of the factory demonstrating the preparation and smoking processes, and Devereau&#x27;s (also established 1884).

==Peel Centenary Centre==
Peel Centenary Centre () is an arts and community centre based at the Centenary Hall. It runs a programme of films, live concerts (local, British, and international acts), and other community events.

==Douglas to Peel railway line==
Peel railway station opened on 1 July 1873, beside the harbour, as the western terminus of the Isle of Man Railway&#x27;s Douglas to Peel line. The station closed to passengers on 7 September 1968. The station site is now a car park and boatyard, and the station building is used as part of the House of Manannan Museum. The former railway line is now a footpath and cycleway: the path is close to the main road and leads to St John&#x27;s, from where it continues to Douglas, the Island&#x27;s capital.

==Peel Harbour and Marina==
Peel Harbour is the most active fishing port in the Isle of Man and is also used to import fuel oils. There is a fish and shellfish processing industry as well as the traditional art of kipper curing. The breakwater has deep-water berths with a lighthouse situated at the end. Fishing boats are usually berthed on the breakwater. 

The castle overlooks the entrance to the inner harbour, which is tidal. However a water retention scheme was built in July 2005 with a jetty from East Quay toward West Quay with an automatically operated gate-flap and a pedestrian swing bridge above it. The gate-flap enables a half tide dock, similar to one at Douglas, and Padstow. As a result, in Peel, inner harbour boats remain afloat even at low water, whereas before boats would settle upon the hard or exposed seabed.

Yachts may be moored in Peel Marina, which was constructed in the inner harbour at a cost of £3.1 million. 124 new berths have been installed by reclaiming part of the top end of the harbour for a boat park, with construction of a new harbour office.

==Sport and recreation==

Peel A.F.C., who compete in the Isle of Man Football League, are based in Peel. They play their home games at the Peel FC Football Ground, Douglas Road. Formed in 1888, they are the most successful club on the Island with 29 league titles and 32 victories in the Manx FA Cup. They were the first winners of the Isle of Man Football League in 1897. Peel Cricket Club are also based in the town, they are members of the Isle of Man Cricket Association.

Valkyrs Hockey Club play their home matches at the Queen Elizabeth II High School astro turf pitch. Peel Golf Club is an 18-hole golf course, totalling over 5870 yds off competitions tees, located on Rheast Lane which was established in 1895. The clubhouse was opened in 1977 by Peter Alliss. Western Athletics club is based at Queen Elizabeth II School. Western Swimming Pool is located on Derby Road.

The Headlands Field has a BMX track, football pitch, park and coastal pathway. There is also a telescope on the headlands which overlooks Peel promenade. The coastal path starts on the Headlands and leads all the way to Kirk Michael beach. Also on the Headlands is the park which has swings, climbing frames and exercise machines installed into it.

The Raad ny Foillan long distance coastal footpath opened in 1986 runs along the coast through Peel.

==Astronomy==
Peel Castle/St Patrick&#x27;s Isle is a Dark Skies astronomy site, meaning that there are low levels of light pollution, so that fainter night sky features such as the Milky Way may be seen on a clear night. Peel Head has been used as a vantage point for viewing the Northern Lights when conditions are favourable, as it has a clear and elevated view to the Northern horizon. Peel is well known for sunsets over the sea (hence its moniker &quot;Sunset City&quot;): sometimes these outline the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland, directly to the west of Peel.

==Wildlife==
The seas by Peel are home to basking sharks in early summer. These sharks are seen occasionally from the land and more often from boats. Seals are often to be found around the breakwater by the castle. A variety of seabirds live and feed around the harbour, castle and headland.

==Religion==
Peel Cathedral (the Cathedral Church of St German), built in 1884, became a cathedral in 1980. It is the cathedral church for the Anglican diocese of Sodor and Man and is located in the centre of the town. Just outside the cathedral are stone reproductions of a few of the many medieval Manx Celtic and Norse crosses. One of these is Thorwald&#x27;s Cross which shows symbolism of both Christianity and the Norse myths. Another has runes down the side.

The ruins of the original Peel Cathedral (c. 1250) can be seen within the walls of Peel Castle on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle. This replaced an earlier church.

Before Peel Castle was built on St Patrick&#x27;s Isle, there was an early Celtic Christian religious community. Excavations in the 1980s found a large early Christian burial ground, many of the burials dating from around 550. Some later graves had Norse burial goods: e.g. the Pagan Lady.

Peel Elim Community Church holds meetings at the Philip Christian Centre.

Grace Baptist Church, founded in 1974 as an outreach of the Grace Baptist Church in Onchan, is located in the former Peel Mathematical School building. It was purchased in 1984 and renovated in 1997, and is listed as a &quot;heritage building&quot;.

Peel Methodist Church is located in Athol Street. There have been a number of Methodist chapels in Peel. The first one was Shore Road Wesley Methodist Chapel, built in 1777. It was used as a fishing-net factory between the 1850s and 1870s, and is now the Peel Youth Centre. A Primitive Methodist Chapel was built on Kirk Michael Street in 1835. It became a public hall when the Christian Street Chapel opened and is now used, after much redevelopment, as a showroom. Peel Centenary Wesley Methodist Chapel was built in 1839 on Athol Street. Peel Primitive Methodist Chapel, built in 1878, has now been converted into flats. The organ is now in Jurby parish church. The Isle of Man Christian Fellowship are based at the Philip Christian Centre on Christian Street. St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is on Patrick Street.

There is also another Evangelical church in Peel named Living Hope which is now held in QE2 High School. It was formerly (until mid 2011) held in the Philip Christian Centre.
==Education==
The local secondary school is Queen Elizabeth II High School, which is on Douglas Road at the eastern edge of the town. It was opened on 5 July 1979 by Queen Elizabeth II, during her visit to the Island to celebrate the millennium of Tynwald, and since then has grown to about 850 pupils with about 50 staff. The school is one of five main schools in the Island, the others being Ramsey Grammar School, St Ninians High School, Castle Rushen High School and Ballakermeen High School.

Peel Clothworkers&#x27; School is a primary school on Derby Road, which was founded in the 17th century after Philip Christian, a successful expatriate Peel businessman, bequeathed a sum of money in his will to provide for the education of the children in Peel. After changing sites in the town a number of times, as it grew and developed, it finally moved to Derby Road after World War II and officially opened there in 1953. It is the third largest primary school in the Isle of Man. On 23 April 2008 new £3.3m facilities at the school were officially opened. New dining/assembly hall, kitchen, reception/office complex, meeting room, library, special needs unit, ICT suite had all opened in June 2007, while a refurbished sports hall, staff facilities, two more classrooms and a permanent nursery were added in 2008.

Christian&#x27;s Endowed National School was built in 1860. It was closed for some time in the mid-20th century before it was refurbished and became the Philip Christian Centre, and a registered building.

<text>Port St Mary ( or &quot;Purt-noo-Moirrey&quot; ) is a village district in the south-west of the Isle of Man. The village takes its name from the former Chapel of St Mary () which is thought to have overlooked Chapel Bay in the village. Its population is 1,953 according to the 2011 census. In the 19th century it was sometimes called Port-le-Murray.

== Etymology ==
The English version &quot;Port St Mary&quot; comes directly from the Manx version, originally &quot;purt kill Moirrey&quot; &#x27;harbour of/by St Mary&#x27;s church&#x27; most likely in reference to the former Chapel of St Mary. The vowel and lateral /l/ of &quot;kill&quot; was metathesized into &quot;le&quot; (documented as &lt;port &#x27;le Muire&gt;) or alternatively it could have been borrowed from French &quot;le&quot; &#x27;the&#x27;.

==Geography and communications==

Port St Mary is located in the south-western part of the island, near Port Erin.
A railway station is just north of the village, one of the stops on the surviving section of the Isle of Man Railway between Douglas and Port Erin. Steam trains operate on the line several times a day during the summer season, and stop at Port St Mary. The village is served by Bus Vannin services to Port Erin, Castletown, Douglas and Onchan.

==Recreation==

Once a fishing and trading port, the village is still popular with tourists and fishermen, especially during the summer. The inner harbour, with its pier created in 1812, is tidal and dries out from half-tide. The outer harbour was created when the Alfred Pier got built in 1882, is accessible at all tide states - unique amongst the Manx ports. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has a lifeboat and station in Port St Mary since 1896. The current lifeboat, the Gough Ritchie II, lies to a permanent floating mooring inside the outer breakwater.

The village is home to the Port St Mary Golf Links, the Island&#x27;s sole 9-hole golf course, and also , a primary school opened in 1993–1994. The Isle of Man Yacht Club is also based at Port St Mary harbour.

Chapel Bay, a sandy beach in the upper part of the village, is used for recreation and bathing in the summer months.

==Churches and other notable buildings==

Port St Mary Town Hall is an imposing stone building situated on the village&#x27;s Victorian promenade at the upper end of the village and houses local government offices and a tourist information point, as well as the hall itself, which is used for performances and community gatherings and is available for private hire. The building is thought to stand on the site of the original .

The Anglican St Mary&#x27;s Church lies in the centre of the village and is a chapel of ease dedicated to Mary of Nazareth lying in the parish of Rushen and diocese of Sodor and Man.

Just north of St Mary&#x27;s is the Port St Mary site of the Living Hope Community Church (formerly known as Port St Mary Baptist Church). The current church building was built in the early 2000s on the site of the former Port St Mary Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, which was completed in 1895, closed in 1970 and was demolished in 2000.

In the lower part of the village, near the port, lies the current Port St Mary Methodist Chapel, built in 1903 as a Primitive Methodist chapel and known as Mount Tabor. Another smaller former Wesleyan chapel, on the High Street, opened in 1835 and was demolished in the 1970s, with the village&#x27;s garden of remembrance and war memorial occupying the site.

Port St Mary is served by St Columba&#x27;s Catholic Church, which lies just outside the village and is shared with Port Erin. It is a chapel of ease in the parish of St Mary&#x27;s with St Columba&#x27;s in the Archdiocese of Liverpool.

There are two pubs in Port St Mary - the Albert and The Railway Station, the Bay View Hotel having closed a number of years ago. The Railway Station Pub being adjacent to Port St Mary railway station on the main road to Port Erin.

A small 1860s &quot;pepperpot&quot; lighthouse of the end of Alfred Pier was destroyed in a storm on the night of 11/12 January 2009. It was replaced by a temporary beacon until a permanent replacement was constructed in 2018 although there is some controversy over whether it can withstand a storm.

==National Dunkirk Memorial==

To commemorate the 70th anniversary of her sinking, the starboard anchor of &quot;Mona&#x27;s Queen&quot;, an Isle of Man Steam Packet Company vessel lost off Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo on which many seamen from the Port St Mary area served, was raised on 29 May 2010 and returned to the Isle of Man to form the centerpiece of a permanent memorial. On 29 May 2012, a memorial featuring the restored anchor and commemorating the losses in 1940 of &quot;Mona&#x27;s Queen&quot;, &quot;King Orry&quot; and &quot;Fenella&quot; was opened in a ceremony at Kallow Point in Port St Mary, attended by representatives of local and national government, the Lieutenant Governor, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and the French Navy.

==Local government==

Port St Mary became a village district for local government purposes in 1890, for which Port St Mary Commissioners are responsible. The local government district is adjacent to the village district of Port Erin and the parish of Rushen.

It was claimed in Tynwald on 18 July 2018 that &quot;it appears that Port St Mary Commissioners lurch inelegantly from one crisis to another&quot;.

<text>Port Erin ( &#x27;lord&#x27;s port&#x27; or originally &#x27;Irish port&#x27;) is a seaside village in the south-west of the Isle of Man, in the historic parish of Rushen. It was previously a seaside resort before the decline of the tourist trade. Administratively it is designated as a village district, with its own board of commissioners. The district covers around 1 square mile, and is adjacent to: Port St Mary to the south-east; the main part of Arbory and Rushen parish district to the north and east; the sea to the west; and an exclave of Arbory and Rushen parish district (including the village of Cregneash) to the south. Following recent residential expansion, the settlement is now contiguous with that of Port St Mary, and on 18 July 2018 Tynwald authorised a public enquiry into the proposed expansion of the district boundary to include some of this expansion.

The village was twinned with Latour-de-France.

==Etymology==

The English toponym &quot;Port Erin&quot; means &#x27;Irish port&#x27;, coming from &quot;Gaelic&quot; (named as such in the source) &quot;port Éireann&quot;, which then was anglicized. The Manx version &quot;Purt Çhiarn&quot; is explained through the palatalization of plosive /t/ into affricate /tʃ/, resulting a pronunciation like [poːrˈtʃɑːrn]. The -&quot;eann&quot; ending was reduced due to its unstressed nature. The &quot;Éi&quot;- /eː/ lowered into /ɛː/ in the presence of /r/ and was thereafter confused with the existing Manx word &quot;çhiarn&quot; &#x27;lord&#x27;.

The toponym has variably been spelt &lt;Port Iron&gt;, possibly from an earlier form &quot;Port Yiarn&quot; (showing no palatalization of /t/). Cregeen&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; (1835) writes &quot;Erin&quot; as &lt;Sheearan&gt; ~ &lt;Sheearayn&gt;, which Kneen speculates must have been confused as a derivation from Manx &quot;sheear&quot; &#x27;westerly&#x27;.

== History ==
The outer breakwater, visible at low tide only, was an abandoned project constructed in 1863 using the Port Erin Breakwater Railway and saw the first steam locomotive used on the island; a severe storm of 1884 later destroyed the breakwater and it was never rebuilt. Today, a marker buoy shows the extent of the breakwater, and the landward end is still clearly discernible. To the north-east, by the A7 road, are the earthwork remains of a motte-and-bailey castle known as &quot;Cronk Howe Mooar&quot;, possibly the site of a timber fortification built by Magnus Barelegs [Barefoot] c. 1100.

The oldest building in the village is known as &quot;white cottage&quot; or &quot;Christian&#x27;s cottage&quot;; it was built by William Christian and his family in 1781. The Christian family still own the cottage today.

During World War II the village was the location of Port Erin Women&#x27;s Detention Camp.

==Demographics==

* Population (2011 census) 3,530
* Adjacent village: Port St Mary
* Largest settlement by population in the south of the island. Thus it has a higher population than Castletown, which has the status of a town.
* House of Keys constituency: Rushen (two seats)
* Sheading: Rushen

==Transport==
===Road===
Port Erin is linked to the rest of the island by three roads:

* A5 Shore Road (the coast road, as the name implies) east towards Castletown
* A7, the inland road leading east towards Ballabeg and Ballasalla
* A36, leading north through a sparsely-populated area towards Foxdale and Glenmaye.

===Railway===
The steam railway station forms the western terminus of the Isle of Man Railway and sits in the centre of the village. The station is built of distinctive red Ruabon brick in an unusual design specifically to fit into its diagonal site between the platforms and the nearby road. The station is now a fraction of its original size, with the former bay platform and sidings now occupied by the storage yard for Bus Vannin, whilst an additional area once used for maintenance has been replaced by The Haven public house. More recent developments have seen the platform shortened and a carriage shed constructed in the yard, capable of storing eight carriages. Prior to this the rolling stock was stored in the open.

===Buses===
Bus services operate directly via a stop outside the village&#x27;s railway station to the island&#x27;s capital Douglas via Port St Mary, Colby, Castletown, Ronaldsway Airport and Ballasalla, using route numbers 1, 2, 11 and 12; these run about every twenty minutes on weekdays and Saturdays, with a less frequent service on Sundays and after 6.00pm. Some of these services (1c and 11b) use an alternative coastal route. The route is the island&#x27;s busiest, partly because it calls at the island&#x27;s airport. A late evening service also operates on Friday and Saturday evenings, called the Night Owl (&quot;Hullaid Oie&quot;), which charges higher fares. There are also occasional buses to Peel (Service No. 8) via Foxdale; all these buses are within the island&#x27;s transport network Bus Vannin, a government-run service which replaced the railway-operated Isle Of Man Road Services in 1976, itself a subsidiary of the railway.

===Other===
There is a coach park to the rear of the railway station, formerly occupied by Tours (Isle Of Man) Limited, though more often used by visiting coaches in recent times. A number of private taxi services operate from the village into the later hours, though other Douglas-based hackneys will serve the south on demand.

==Geography==
The beach is sandy and is on a bay bounded by two headlands which (on windy days) funnel the prevailing westerly wind towards the village. On sunny days, the bay acts as a suntrap. To the north of the promenade is Bradda Glen, one of the Manx National Glens. The northern headland, Bradda Head, has an iconic memorial tower called Milner&#x27;s Tower. The promenade, on the east side of the bay, is somewhat higher than the seafront, and primarily consists of hotels, mostly built in the Victorian era, although due to changes in taste among tourists, many of these are being converted into flats and apartments. The town is famed for its views, including spectacular sunsets over Port Erin Bay and Bradda Head, as well as glimpses of the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland in the distance.

==Religion==

=== Church of England ===
The largest church in the village is dedicated to St Catherine and located on Church Road at its junction with the upper promenade and lies within its own grounds. The church was built in 1880 with funds donated by local locksmith William Milner. In addition to regular community services the church is also well known for its summer concert series that runs on a Wednesday evening throughout the summer months from May to September, featuring local talent.

=== Methodist ===
This church is at the junction of Droghadfayle Road with the main road entering the village, and has a mid-sized, modern built community hall annexed to it which hosts the Over Sixties club regularly in addition to services. To the rear of the church lies the village&#x27;s branch of the Royal British Legion in the same cluster of buildings.

=== Grace Baptist ===
Constructed in 1980 at the same time and in a similar architectural style to a surrounding housing estate, this church began life in neighbouring Castletown before relocating and expanding its current headquarters in 1985; since this time the building has also been modified and expanded subject to demand.

=== Catholic ===
Found on the outskirts of the village on the main road to Port St Mary, another modern build small church with its own parking area; it can be found at the same site as the community gospel church. It is dedicated to St Columba and was built in 1923 to replace a temporary chapel on the shore line beneath the Bellevue Hotel previously used as a marine biology station and converted to a chapel in 1903. In 1989 the building was extended and re-orientated to provide a larger church with a church hall.

=== Free Presbyterian===
Located at the same site as the Catholic Church, this is a further modern-build small church. It was founded in 1991 and later came under the auspices of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. This is one of the only churches on the island which continues to use exclusively the King James Version of the Bible. It is titled as Port Erin Gospel Church and has an emphasis on evangelism with people travelling over from Ulster regularly to oversee the work.

<doc id="398643" wikidata="Q150106" url="?curid=398643" title="Ramsey, Isle of Man">
<text>Ramsey () is a coastal town in the north of the Isle of Man. In 2024 it became the largest town on the Island after Douglas was granted city status. Ramsey&#x27;s population is 8,288 according to the 2021 Census. It has one of the biggest harbours on the Island, and has a prominent semi-derelict pier, called the Queen&#x27;s Pier (currently under restoration). It was formerly one of the main points of communication with Scotland. Ramsey has also been a route for several invasions by the Vikings and Scots.

Ramsey is also known as &quot;Royal Ramsey&quot; due to royal visits by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1847 and by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1902.

==History==

The name of the town derives from the Old Norse &quot;hrams-á&quot;, meaning &quot;wild garlic river&quot;, More specifically, it refers to the plant known as ramsons, buckrams or wild garlic, in Latin &quot;Allium ursinum&quot;.

The Isle of Man has been an important strategic location in conflicts between the Norse rulers of Man and the Isles, and the Scots and English. Smugglers and pirates were also common at many times in Manx history.

Ramsey was the landing place of the Viking warrior Godred Crovan around 1079: he was determined to subjugate the Island and make it his kingdom. On Sky Hill, inland, an important battle was fought; this resulted in a period of Viking rule, influencing the development of the Manx nation and many of the traditions that continue today.

Godred&#x27;s son, King Olaf, was murdered by his nephew Reginald near Ramsey harbour in 1154, and two years later the &quot;Chronicle of Man&quot; states that the ships of Somerled came to Ramsey during a conflict which would lead to the division of the kingdom of Man and to Somerled taking the Kingship of the Isles (the Hebrides).

On 17 May 1313 Robert the Bruce landed at Ramsey &quot;with a multitude of ships&quot; from the fleet of his friend, Angus Og Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, on his way to capturing Castle Rushen.

Captain François Thurot, a then-famous French privateer, and notorious scourge of the British fleet, was defeated off the north-west of the Island in February 1760. His badly damaged, captured ship was brought into Ramsey Bay after the battle. Thurot&#x27;s actions had been part of a planned French invasion of Britain. In previous years Thurot had traded between Ireland and the Isle of Man and had been well liked by many Manx people, and regarded as an intelligent gentleman. Several cottages and bridges were built using timbers from the wrecked ship: hence Thurot Cottage and Thurot Bridge.

Pirate radio station Radio Caroline North was based in Ramsey Bay from 1964–68 and supplied with provisions from Ramsey.

During World War II, thirty boarding houses on the North Shore were requisitioned for the Mooragh Internment Camp.

==Climate and geography==

Ramsey is in the sunniest area of the Isle of Man, with relatively low rainfall. This is because Ramsey is in a &#x27;rain shadow&#x27; just to the north-east of the hills at North Barrule, on the edge of the northern plain of the Island. Rain clouds coming from the prevailing wind direction, the south-west, tend to lose most of their moisture over the hills before they reach Ramsey.

Ramsey is built mostly on sandy ground and has miles of sandy beaches. To the north of Ramsey the beaches run continuously to the north tip of the Island. On the southern edge of Ramsey, at the edge of the hills, are a network of woods and glens: Ballure Walk, Lhergy Frissel and Elfin Glen. The Millennium Way and other paths and roads lead up to and across the upland heath (&#x27;the tops&#x27; and &#x27;the hills&#x27;). The new &#x27;Ramsey Forest&#x27; project aims to increase the tree cover in this area and connect areas of woodland.

==Transport and infrastructure==

===Shipping===
Ramsey is home to the second busiest port on the Island, handling a wide range of general cargo. The port was formerly used as an operating base by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company for both cargo and passenger services. The company operated scheduled services to Liverpool and Whitehaven in addition to which during the summer months steamers would call at the Queen&#x27;s Pier whilst en-route to Douglas from Belfast and Ardrossan.

The port is the headquarters of the local shipping line Mezeron, as it was formerly for the Ramsey Steamship Company, until it ceased trading in 2014.

Star of India is an iron-hulled sailing ship, built in 1863 in Ramsey, Isle of Man, as the full-rigged ship Euterpe.

===Buses===
Ramsey serves as the main terminus for the northern network of Bus Vannin, providing local services to Andreas,Ballaugh,Jurby, Sulby and Bride. In addition it provides an on-demand service to Ronaldsway Airport and main services to Peel and to Douglas via Laxey.

===Rail===
At one time the town was served by both the Manx Electric Railway and the Isle of Man Railway. The first rail link was established by the Isle of Man Railway in 1879, transferring to the Manx Northern Railway in 1880. The line ran via Sulby, Ballaugh and Kirk Michael to St John&#x27;s, where it connected to the main Douglas – Peel line and with the Foxdale Railway. The railway was largely financed by the prosperity of the Foxdale Mines for which it was used to haul ore trains from Foxdale to the Ramsey quayside for shipment. Return trains would haul coal back to Foxdale to power the pumping houses of the mines.

Ramsey is also the northern terminus of the Manx Electric Railway. Initially linking Douglas to Laxey, the line from Laxey to Ramsey was opened on 2 August 1898 by the Lieutenant Governor, John Henniker-Major, 5th Baron Henniker. At that date the line ran as far as Ballure, on the outskirts of Ramsey. The final extension to the centre of Ramsey was opened on 24 July 1899.

===Air===

For a period between 1935 and 1937 Hall Caine Airport just outside the town operated scheduled air services to English, Scottish and Irish airports. Both Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine&#x27;s sons, Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine, were particularly keen on the development of an aerodrome on the site, as they saw it as another memorial to their late father. They also wished to involve the Ramsey town commissioners in the project, as they felt the aerodrome would bring immense benefit to the town. Hall Caine Airport officially came into being on 30 April 1935.

Scheduled services proved successful in 1935 and 1936, with Hillman&#x27;s Airways and later British Airways Ltd and Northern and Scottish Airways providing scheduled services to Belfast, Glasgow, Blackpool and Liverpool where the passenger could connect with services to London. There was also an air link between Hall Caine and Ronaldsway Airport for air mail. The primary reason for the cessation of services from Hall Caine was a rationalization of services operated by Northern and Scottish. Northern and Scottish and Manx Airways Ltd entered into an undertaking at Ronaldsway. This resulted in Manx Airways covering the schedules to Liverpool, Blackpool, Carlisle and Belfast which were formerly operated by Northern and Scottish, leaving only the Glasgow service being operated from Hall Caine. This was a severe blow to Ramsey, coming as it did at the beginning of the tourist season. Services from Hall Caine to Glasgow resumed in early June, aimed primarily at the increased traffic as a result of the TT Races which continued throughout the month.

The Ramsey Ratepayers Association petitioned the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Montague Butler, with a view to his intervening to preserve commercial air operations from Hall Caine. The cancellation by Northern and Scottish Airways also led to a special meeting of the Ramsey Commissioners. It was hoped that Railway Air Services would have commenced operations from Hall Caine, but any hope proved unfounded.

Piloted by Capt. McGeow, the final commercial flight from Hall Caine Airport departed at 4:15 pm on Saturday, 2 October 1937.

==Sights==
Ramsey (Plaza) tram station is the northern terminus of the Manx Electric Railway, and Ramsey is the start of the mountain section of the Snaefell Mountain Course used for the annual Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix motorcycle races. A popular vantage point is Ramsey Hairpin, where enthusiasts gather to watch the racers. Another popular spot is Parliament Square in the middle of town. There are also opportunities for walking, cycling, kayaking, and other outdoor activities.

The Millennium Way footpath ends from the centre of the town on the A3 road at the foot of Sky Hill.

Mooragh Park, on the north side of the Sulby river, is a 19th-century park with a large boating lake where boats (canoes, pedaloes etc) are available for hire. It was originally part of a salt marsh but was purchased and developed by the town to encourage visitors. Mooragh Park has a small water park, two cafés, a BMX club, skate park, tennis courts, basketball area, outdoor exercise equipment, and a children&#x27;s playground. The park is mostly on the level and has disabled toilets.

Ramsey&#x27;s original swimming pool in the town centre was converted into a ten-pin bowling alley in 2010.
The new Northern Swimming Pool opened in January 2009 on the Mooragh Promenade.

The Albert Tower was built to commemorate the royal visit of Prince Albert on 20 September 1847. Queen Victoria&#x27;s Royal Yacht anchored in the bay, when heavy seas made it impossible to enter Douglas Harbour. Recovering from seasickness, Victoria remained on the yacht, leaving Prince Albert to venture ashore. He climbed to the top of the hill, from where he viewed the town of Ramsey and the northern plain. The hill was renamed Albert Mount and a year later the tower&#x27;s foundation was laid. The tower is made of granite and rises high. It is a landmark not only for the town of Ramsey, but also for the north of the Isle of Man. There is a public path leading up the hill for people to visit the tower.

Another distinctive landmark of the town is the Queen&#x27;s Pier, an iron pier which was built in 1886. It is about 650 metres or 700 yards long. As well as recreational purposes, the pier had a landing stage for visiting ships. It has been closed for many years due to health and safety concerns, although subject to many re-opening appeals. It had its own tramway. The Queen&#x27;s Pier has had significant renovation work, and is open for visitors on Sunday afternoons in the summer. The lease has been taken on by the Queens Pier Restoration Trust, who aim to restore it gradually.

The Grove Museum of Victorian Life (Manx National Heritage) is located in the northern suburbs on the A9 (Andreas Road).

==Leisure amenities and sport==

Among the various leisure venues in Ramsey are a swimming pool, bowling alley, a rural museum (the Grove Museum of Rural Life), and Milntown House at the western edge of the town.

There are several sports clubs, including a rugby club, a football club and Ramsey Youth Centre and Old Boys F.C., a hockey team, a Gaelic football team, Ramsey Ravens swimming team and a golf club. There is an active sailing club, the Manx Sailing and Cruising Club, which promotes an annual Round the Island sailing race as well as regularly scheduled dinghy and cruiser races. Ramsey Angling Club holds regular sea angling competitions.

==Health and education==

Ramsey has a modern junior school, a secondary comprehensive school, and the Ramsey Cottage Hospital.

==Places of religious worship==

The town has a number of churches, including: Our Lady, Star of the Sea &amp; St Maughold Church and St Paul&#x27;s.

==Industry and commerce==

Ramsey has an active shipyard and industrial workshops. The main street has a range of independent shops, including a butcher, ironmonger, and shops selling clothes, gifts and homewares. There are pubs, cafes, restaurants and a Farmers&#x27; Market every Saturday.

The harbour is used by fishing and small leisure boats, and small freight boats from the Mezeron shipping company. There is a swing bridge for pedestrians and vehicles, built in 1892, that crosses the harbour.

==Wildlife and nature==

Wildlife around Ramsey reflects the mix of landscape: with sandy coast and estuary at Ramsey, wooded glens and rocky coasts just to the south-east, and hills and moors to the south-west, plus Ballaugh Curragh (wooded swamp) and productive farmland inland, and isolated sandy shores and dunes to the north.

Ramsey Bay was the Island&#x27;s first Marine Nature Reserve, set up to protect fisheries and marine wildlife. The protected area acts as a &#x27;nursery area&#x27; for fish and other creatures and plants, which can then move out to restock surrounding areas.

Ramsey shore and estuary provide a feeding area for birds, including oystercatcher, redshank and ringed plover on the shore, and geese, swans and ducks in the harbour. The inner harbour footpath (toward Mooragh Park) is a scrap of rich original saltmarsh habitat plus many land plants (also a sun trap). There is a big patch of salt marsh in Poyll Dooey park up the harbour.

Just south-east of Ramsey, in Maughold, are rugged wooded glens open to the public, and rocky coasts, headlands and beaches, with much of the area accessible by road, footpath, and electric tram.

Inland wildlife areas include Sulby Glen (a rugged grassy glen full of bluebells in spring) and Ballaugh Curragh: a wildlife-rich patchwork of semi-wilderness, swamp, woodland and agriculture, continuous since the last Ice Age.

===Wildlife hotspots around Ramsey===

==Music, culture and events==

Ramsey has been a centre for the revival of Manx traditional music and culture. &#x27;Shennaghys Jiu&#x27; (&quot;Tradition Today&quot;) Celtic music festival runs in springtime, usually late March. There are two separate live folk music nights at the Mitre Hotel, on Thursdays (singaround) and Fridays (Irish session).

The busiest times of year are Shennagys Jiu in March, Cyclefest in May, TT fortnight in late May / early June, (especially Ramsey Sprint Day, when thousands of biking fans visit to watch motorbike drag sprints on Mooragh Promenade), Manx Grand Prix/ Manx Classic motorbike race fortnight in late August, Ramsey National Week in early July, with many music and culture events, and &#x27;Ramsey Rocks&#x27; held on the Quayside one Friday in summer.

==Politics, civic authority and local government==

The local authority is the Ramsey Town Commissioners. Ramsey is also a House of Keys constituency electing two MHKs. As of 2021, these are Alex Allinson (independent) and Lawrie Hooper (Liberal Vannin).

===MHKs and Elections===

<doc id="398644" wikidata="Q2706773" url="?curid=398644" title="Yasumi Matsuno">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer and writer. Matsuno was first introduced to video games in arcades while waiting for the train, and first played &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Xevious&quot; there. He attended Hosei University for foreign policy but dropped out, and after working for a time as an economic reporter, he joined Quest Corporation.

As an employee at video game companies Quest in 1989 and later Square in 1995, Matsuno became well known for his work in the tactical role-playing game genre, specifically the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; (1993) and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; (1997) series, in addition to &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; (2000) and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; (2006). After disruptions from staff leaving his development team, he resigned from Square Enix due to prolonged illness. During a freelance period, he worked on games for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii such as &quot;MadWorld&quot; (2009). He joined Level-5 in 2011 where he helped create Crimson Shroud for the Nintendo 3DS.

In 2016, he created his own company called Algebra Factory, and during this period was asked by Square Enix to create a scenario for &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; expansion &quot;Stormblood&quot; (2017). He created a raid called &quot;Return to Ivalice&quot;, the land of Ivalice being a setting from previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games he had worked on. Matsuno was subsequently asked to create another scenario, which was titled &quot;Save the Queen: Blades of Gunnhildr&quot; and included in &quot;Shadowbringers&quot;, another expansion for the game.

==Early life==
Matsuno grew up in a rural area, where he felt his only entertainment were movies, television, and books. His hobbies included making dioramas. He was particularly fond of World War II dioramas, that he used to make by researching at the local library. He would incorporate story elements into each of his creation.

His introduction to video games was playing &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Xevious&quot; at the arcades while waiting for the train. He was fond of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and played heavily on the Amiga and PC, including &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. He attended Hosei University for foreign policy but dropped out after three years. Shortly thereafter he found work as an economic reporter but found the work unfulfilling. In 1989, Matsuno left his job as a reporter to work at Quest Corporation.

==Career==
===Quest===
Matsuno began his career at the Japanese video game developer Quest Corporation. In 1993, he served as the director of &quot;Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen&quot; for the Super NES. It is the first installment of an episodic series of tactical role-playing games. Matsuno was inspired by the British rock band Queen&#x27;s second album, which contained the songs &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; and &quot;The March Of The Black Queen&quot;. A sea in the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; universe was also named after &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;. The next game he worked on was &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, released in 1995 for the Super NES. The political narrative of the game revolving around the reality of war were inspired by the Bosnian Genocide and Yugoslav Wars at the time.

===Square and Square Enix===

In 1995, Matsuno joined Square after quitting Quest. At Square, Matsuno directed and wrote &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; for the PlayStation. Similar in design and gameplay to &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, it was lauded for its highly intricate story. After the game&#x27;s release, Matsuno and his team began development on &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;. Smaller in scope than &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, it was highly regarded by critics and has gained somewhat of a cult following since its release. Matsuno supervised PlayOnline, Square&#x27;s online multiplayer gaming software prior to its first beta release in 2001. He then served as producer for &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; for the Game Boy Advance system, which shares the &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; system but has an entirely different storyline.

In 2001, Matsuno was assigned to work on &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; as director together with Hiroyuki Ito. He came up with the game&#x27;s original concept and plot. Matsuno reportedly was temperamental and refused to come to work for a month after part of the &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; team had left Square Enix to join Hironobu Sakaguchi&#x27;s new company Mistwalker. In August 2005, it was officially announced that he had stepped down from his position on the project due to a prolonged illness.

===Freelance period and Level-5===
In 2006, Matsuno expressed his interest for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console in a promotional video, stating that he was impressed with the intuitive functionality provided by the remote controller. He was approached by his friend, the PlatinumGames producer Atsushi Inaba, to work on the scenario for the Wii game &quot;MadWorld&quot;. While developing the setting, story and script, Matsuno often consulted with the development team and received conflicting orders from the staff members: the game designers wanted to emphasize extreme violence but the producers wished to tone it down instead. Matsuno&#x27;s ideas and writing for the game were influenced by the necessity to balance these two different points of view. When the original developers of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; were assembled to work on a reimagined port for the PlayStation Portable. Matsuno was called upon to handle the game design and new story elements.

Soon after the port was finished, Level-5 president Akihiro Hino entered talks with him to convince him of joining the company. In June 2011, it was announced that Matsuno had entered Level-5 based on his impression of the &quot;Professor Layton&quot; and &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; series and in order to create the games he wanted to. During his stay there, he developed the fantasy RPG &quot;Crimson Shroud&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, which is part of the collaborative project &quot;Guild 01&quot; of Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s Goichi Suda, Sega&#x27;s Yoot Saito and comedian Yoshiyuki Hirai. Matsuno left Level-5 in October 2012 and explained &quot;With my work done on the domestic and overseas version of my latest 3DSWare game, it was good timing for me to step down and take a short break in order to recharge for my next project.&quot; In September 2013, he announced a partnership with the American company Playdek to develop &quot;Unsung Story&quot;, a strategy game similar to Matsuno&#x27;s previous titles and set in a medieval fantasy world. In 2020, Matsuno revealed that he had left the project before it was handed off to Little Orbit, the company currently developing the game; calling Playdek&#x27;s version a &quot;Final Fantasy clone&quot;. He met with Little Orbit, and they confirmed that the current game was based on Matsuo&#x27;s original concept, however he had no influence on the current game; stating that &quot;I look forward to enjoying it with the same fresh eye as any other gamer&quot;.

===Algebra Factory===
Matsuno founded a &quot;planning, screenplay, and production&quot; oriented company named Algebra Factory in 2016. During the Algebra Factory era, he was hired by Square Enix to produce the &quot;Return to Ivalice&quot; raid for the MMORPG &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;&#x27;s expansion &quot;Stormblood&quot; and once more for the &quot;Save the Queen: Blades of Gunnhildr&quot; storyline for the &quot;Shadowbringers&quot; expansion, and by Cygames Corporation for game drafts and management for the mobile game &quot;Lost Order&quot;.

==Game design==
His games usually feature story driven adventures with tactical or strategical combat. He has described the development culture at Quest as having been a &quot;kind dictatorship&quot; while Square&#x27;s was more &quot;democratic&quot;, and is not personally fond of other team members having input on his narrative work.

<text>The 12th (Eastern) Division was an infantry division raised by the British Army during the First World War from men volunteering for Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies. The division saw service in the trenches of the Western Front from June 1915 to the end of the war.

== Formation and First World War ==
The 12th (Eastern) Division, was one of the first Kitchener&#x27;s Army divisions raised from volunteers by Lord Kitchener. It was formed within Eastern Command as a result of Army Order No. 324 of 21 August 1914, as part of the K1 wave of divisions.

It fought on the Western Front for the duration of the First World War. One of its most notable actions was the Battle of Épehy where there is a memorial cross to the 12th Division.

In the First World War, the division&#x27;s insignia was the Ace of Spades, which has since been adopted by the present 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade.

<text>Stellite alloys are a range of cobalt-chromium alloys designed for wear resistance. &quot;Stellite&quot; is also a registered trademark of Kennametal Inc. and is used in association with cobalt-chromium alloys.

==History==
Stellite was invented by Elwood Haynes in the early 1900s, initially as a material for making cutlery that would not stain or require constant cleaning. He was granted a patent for two specific alloys in 1907, and for two related ones in 1912; once he had these four patents he went into the business of producing his metal alloys. In the early 1920s, after considerable success during World War I in sales of cutting tools and high-speed machine tools made from Stellite, Haynes&#x27;s company was bought by Union Carbide, becoming its &quot;Stellite division&quot;, and continued to develop other alloys as well. The company was sold again in 1970 to Cabot Corporation, and in 1985 Cabot sold off the Stellite portion of the business. The Stellite trademark was acquired by Kennametal in 2012.

==Composition==
Stellite alloys include a range of cobalt-based alloys, with significant proportions of chromium (up to 33%) and tungsten (up to 18%). Some of the alloys also contain nickel or molybdenum. Most of them have fairly high carbon content when compared to carbon steels.

==Properties==
Stellite alloys are a family of completely non-magnetic and corrosion-resistant cobalt alloys of various compositions that have been optimised for different uses. Stellite alloys are suited for cutting tools, an example is Stellite 100, because this alloy is quite hard, maintains a good cutting edge at high temperature, and resists hardening and annealing. Other Stellite alloys are formulated to maximize combinations of wear resistance, corrosion resistance, or ability to withstand extreme temperatures.

Stellite alloys display outstanding hardness and toughness, and are also usually very resistant to corrosion. Typically, a part produced with a Stellite alloy is precisely cast so that only minimal machining is necessary. Due to the very high hardness many Stellite alloys are primarily machined by grinding, as cutting operations in some alloys cause significant tool wear even with carbide inserts. Stellite alloys also tend to have extremely high melting points due to the cobalt and chromium content.

==Applications==
Typical applications for Stellite alloys include saw teeth, hardfacing, and acid-resistant machine parts. Stellite alloys were a major improvement in the production of poppet valves and valve seats for the valves, particularly exhaust valves, of internal combustion engines. By reducing their erosion from hot gases, the interval between maintenance and re-grinding of their seats was dramatically lengthened. Stellite alloys have also been used in some engines for the cam followers, particularly by the Norton Motorcycle Company.

The first third of the M2HB machine gun and M60 machine gun barrels (starting from the chamber) are lined with a Stellite alloy. The locking lugs and shoulders of Voere Titan II rifles also include a Stellite alloy. In the early 1980s, experiments were done in the United Kingdom to make artificial hip joints and other bone replacements out of precision-cast Stellite alloys. Stellite alloys are also used for making the cast structure of dental prostheses.

Stellite alloys have also been used in the manufacture of turning tools for lathes. With the introduction and improvements in tipped tools it is not used as often, but it was found to have superior cutting properties compared to the early carbon steel tools and even some high-speed steel tools, especially against difficult materials such as stainless steel. Care was needed in grinding the blanks and these were marked at one end to show the correct orientation, without which the cutting edge could chip prematurely.

While Stellite alloys remain the material of choice for certain internal parts in industrial process valves (valve seat hardfacing), cobalt alloys have been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts could be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor. There the cobalt would be activated by the neutron flux in the reactor and become cobalt-60, a radioisotope with a five-year half life that releases very energetic gamma rays. This phenomenon is more problematic in boiling water reactor (BWR) plants, since the steam is in direct contact with both the reactor and the steam turbine. Pressurized water reactor (PWR) designs are less susceptible. While not a hazard to the general public, about a third to a half of nuclear worker exposures to radiation could be traced to reactor components made of cobalt alloys (or stainless steel with trace amounts of cobalt in it). 

Stellite alloys have also used as the cage material for the first commercially available artificial heart valve, the Starr-Edwards caged-ball valve, first implanted in 1960.

Stellite is used in pumps for components like impellers, wear rings, and shafts. Additionally, due to its strength retention at high temperatures, it is employed in power generation, chemical processing, and the food and pharmaceutical industries.

==Varieties==
* Talonite is an alloy similar to Stellite alloys which has been hot-rolled and hardened in a particular manner, to provide a combination of hardness, wear resistance and machinability. Not all Stellite alloys respond to this rolling process.
* Vitallium, used for dentistry and medical implants.

<doc id="398679" wikidata="Q296950" url="?curid=398679" title="Antanas Smetona">
<text>Antanas Smetona (; 10 August 1874 – 9 January 1944) was a Lithuanian intellectual, journalist and politician. He served as the first president of Lithuania from 1919 to 1920 and later as the authoritarian head of state from 1926 until the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940. Referred to as the &quot;Leader of the Nation&quot; during his presidency, Smetona is recognised as one of the most important Lithuanian political figures between World War I and World War II, and a prominent ideologist of Lithuanian nationalism and the movement for national revival.

Born into a farming family in the village of Užulėnis, Kovno Governorate, Smetona exhibited a strong interest in education and Lithuanian cultural identity from an early age. He attended Palanga Progymnasium and later graduated from Jelgava Gymnasium. He pursued higher education at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, where he studied law and became involved in nationalist and cultural movements. During this time, he contributed to the Lithuanian press, advocating for national self-determination and the preservation of Lithuanian culture under Russian imperial rule. After completing his studies, he worked as a teacher and journalist, eventually becoming one of the key intellectual leaders of the Lithuanian National Revival.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent collapse of the Russian Empire provided a pivotal opportunity for Smetona and other Lithuanian leaders to pursue national independence. As a member of the Council of Lithuania, he was instrumental in the drafting and signing of the Act of Independence on 16 February 1918, which proclaimed the restoration of an independent Lithuania. During the interwar period, Smetona emerged as a prominent political figure, serving as the first President and later taking power in a coup d&#x27;état in 1926. Under his leadership, Lithuania pursued a policy of neutrality and underwent significant economic and cultural development, despite the challenges posed by regional instability and the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe.

After the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in 1940, Smetona fled to Germany and later to the United States, where he lived in exile until his death in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1944. His legacy remains a topic of debate among historians. While some view him as a pivotal figure in the establishment of Lithuanian independence and the promotion of national identity, others criticize his authoritarian rule and suppression of political opposition.

==Early life and education==
Smetona was born on in the village of Užulėnis, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire, to a family of farmers, Jonas Smetona and Julijona Kartanaitė – former serfs of the Taujėnai Manor, which belonged to the Radziwiłł family. Researcher Kazimieras Gasparavičius has traced Smetona&#x27;s patrilineal ancestry to Laurentijus who was born around 1695 and lived near Raguva. Smetona was the eighth of nine children. His parents were hardworking people who managed to double their inherited . His father was literate and Smetona learned to read at home.
Smetona&#x27;s father died in 1885 when Smetona was only 11 years old and, despite financial difficulties, a year later Smetona – the only of his siblings – was sent to the primary school in Taujėnai where instruction was in Russian due to the Lithuanian press ban. This was his dying father&#x27;s request. His mother hoped that Smetona would become a priest. After graduation in 1889, Smetona wanted to continue his education, but gymnasiums admitted pupils only up to the age of 12 and he was already 15 years old. Therefore, he was forced to study privately in Ukmergė in order to catch up and be able to pass examinations to enter the fourth class of gymnasium. In summer 1891, he attempted to gain admission to the Liepāja Gymnasium as his brother Motiejus worked in a factory in Liepāja. He was refused and instead applied to the Palanga Progymnasium, which had no age restrictions. Smetona was an exemplary student (one of the top two students) and received a tuition waiver. As a superintendent of a student dormitory, he also received free housing and was able to support himself by providing private lessons. Three other future signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania attended the progymnasium at the same time: Steponas Kairys, Jurgis Šaulys, and Kazimieras Steponas Šaulys. As Palanga was close to East Prussia, it was easier to obtain Lithuanian literature, which was banned by the Tsarist authorities. Smetona began reading Lithuanian periodicals and books, including a history of Lithuania by Maironis.

After graduating in 1893, according to his family&#x27;s wishes, he passed his entrance examinations for the Samogitian Diocesan Seminary in Kaunas. However, he felt no great calling for priesthood and enrolled at the Jelgava Gymnasium in Latvia. This was a cultural hub of the Lithuanian National Revival and attracted many future leaders in Lithuanian culture and politics, including Juozas Tūbelis and Vladas Mironas who later became Smetona&#x27;s political companions. In particular, Lithuanian language and culture was openly promoted by the linguist, Jonas Jablonskis, teacher of Greek, with whom Smetona developed a close professional relationship. Jablonskis visited Smetona&#x27;s native village collecting data on Lithuanian dialects. Smetona met his future wife, Sofija Chodakauskaitė, through Jablonskis who recommended him as tutor for her brother.
In autumn 1896, the administration of the Jelgava Gymnasium forced Lithuanian students to recite their prayers in Russian while Latvian and German students were allowed to use their native languages. Smetona and other students refused and were expelled. Most later agreed to pray in Russian and were re-admitted, but a handful who refused were prohibited from attending any other school. The students sent petitions to Pope Leo XIII and Ivan Delyanov, Minister of National Education. Smetona and two others, and Petras Vaiciuška, managed to secure an audience with Delyanov, who allowed the Lithuanians to pray in Latin and the expelled students to continue their education. Smetona did not return to Jelgava and finished up at Gymnasium No. 9 in Saint Petersburg.

Upon graduation in 1897, Smetona entered the faculty of law of the University of Saint Petersburg. He was more interested in history and languages, but knew that as a Catholic his choices were limited to priest, lawyer, or doctor if he wanted to work in Lithuania. Saint Petersburg, with a direct railway connection to Lithuania, was becoming a Lithuanian cultural center. Smetona joined and chaired a secret Lithuanian student organization. He was later succeeded by Steponas Kairys. He also joined a Lithuanian choir led by Česlovas Sasnauskas, organist at the Church of St. Catherine. Smetona was exposed to socialist ideas and even read Marx&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, but resolutely rejected them. He was expelled from the university, imprisoned for two weeks, and deported to Vilnius for participating in the February 1899 student protests. It was the first time Smetona visited the city, the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and it left a deep impression on him. A month later, he was allowed to return to the university.

In 1898, Smetona and his roommate, , using a mimeograph, printed about 100 copies of a brief Lithuanian grammar written by Petras Avižonis based on the German-language writings of Friedrich Kurschat. This grammar was insufficient for Lithuanian needs and in summer 1900 Jonas Jablonskis set to work on his Lithuanian grammar. He was assisted by Avižonis, Žemaitė, and Smetona, though Smetona mostly edited works of Bishop Motiejus Valančius. The grammar was published in 1901 and became a fundamental work in establishing the standard Lithuanian language. In early 1902, the police began investigating a network of Lithuanian book smugglers and raided Smetona&#x27;s room where they found several prohibited Lithuanian publications. He was imprisoned in Vyborg Castle, but managed to secure acquittal and graduate that spring.

==Early activities==
After his graduation from university in 1902, he moved to Vilnius and worked at the Vilnius Land Bank until 1915. He became an active participant in Lithuanian cultural life and, up until becoming president in December 1926, devoted substantial amounts of time and effort to the Lithuanian press. Two years later, he married Sofija Chodakauskaitė in the Church of St. Raphael the Archangel in Vilnius.

From his very first days in Vilnius, Smetona became involved in the activities of various Lithuanian nationalist groups, and joined the Lithuanian Democratic Party, which he represented in the Great Seimas of Vilnius. He was later elected to its Presidium. In 1904 and 1907, he was on the staff of the Lithuanian newspaper, &quot;Vilniaus žinios&quot; (The Vilnius News). In 1905–1906, he edited the weekly &quot;Lietuvos ūkininkas&quot; (The Lithuanian Farmer). In 1907, Smetona and the Rev. Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas established a venture to print the newspaper &quot;Viltis&quot; (The Hope), and started publishing and circulating it. In &quot;Viltis&quot;, Smetona advocated national unity. He was also one of the incorporators of the Aušra (Dawn) company for the publishing of Lithuanian books, a member of the Lithuanian Mutual Aid Society of Vilnius, the Lithuanian Learned Society, the Vilniaus aušra (The Dawn of Vilnius), and Rytas (The Morning) education societies, the Rūta Art Society and many other societies, and taught the Lithuanian language at Vilnius schools. In 1914, he started publishing &quot;Vairas&quot; (The Rudder), a new bi-weekly magazine.

==Politics==

During the First World War, he was the first vice-chairman, and later chairman, of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In the summer of 1916, Antanas Smetona, together with other Lithuanians from Vilnius, presented a memorandum to the German Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Front, in which they demanded the right of the Lithuanian nation to have an independent State. On 6 September 1917, he started printing the newspaper, &quot;Lietuvos Aidas&quot; (Lithuania&#x27;s Echo), working as its publisher and its editor-in-chief. In the first issue of the newspaper, Smetona wrote that the most important goal of the Lithuanian nation was the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian state.

Between 18 and 22 September 1917, he participated in the Lithuanian Conference in Vilnius, and was elected chairman (1917–1919) of the Council of Lithuania (later Council of the State). On 16 February 1918, Antanas Smetona signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania.

Between December 1918 and March 1919, he lived primarily in Germany and the Scandinavian countries, soliciting loans for the cause of Lithuanian independence. On 4 April 1919, the State Council of Lithuania elected Smetona the first president of the Republic of Lithuania. On 19 April 1920, the Constituent Assembly elected Aleksandras Stulginskis President. Not re-elected to Seimas, from 1921 to 1924, he edited several periodicals, including &quot;Lietuvos balsas&quot;, &quot;Lietuviškas balsas&quot; and &quot;Vairas&quot;.
After the Klaipėda Revolt of January 1923, in the Memelland, which had been separated from Germany, he was made commissioner there on 20 February, but, due to disagreements with Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas, he resigned from his post.

In November 1923, authorities imprisoned Smetona for several days for publishing an article by Augustinas Voldemaras in &quot;Vairas&quot;. Between 1923 and 1927, he was an assistant professor at the University of Lithuania – at first in the chair of art theory and history and later at the department of philosophy. He lectured on ethics, ancient philosophy and Lithuanian linguistics. In 1932, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. at the Vytautas Magnus University.

Smetona participated in the activity of the Lithuanian Riflemen&#x27;s Union that had staged the Klaipėda Revolt, which gave him greater name-recognition. More than once, he was elected to its central board. Between 1924 and 1940, he was the vice-chairman of the board of the International Bank.
Smetona was known for his tolerant stance towards Jews and his radical opponents nicknamed him as &quot;Jewish King&quot;. Under Smetona&#x27;s rule in Lithuania, not a single anti-Jewish law was passed and high-ranking Lithuanian officials, including ministers, did not publicly say anti-Jewish statements. Smetona considered Jews not as foreigners, but as Lithuanian citizens of foreign nationality and himself acted against antisemitic acts with his statements which were later followed by actions of governmental institutions (e.g. censorship). The Lithuanian courts, war commandants, Lithuanian Police Force severely punished the participants of anti-Jewish physical attacks or smashing of Jews windows (the culprits were punished with fines, imprisoned or even sent to hard labor prisons). Moreover, the Government of Lithuania also did not tolerate anti-Jewish attacks and severely punished their participants, especially activists. Consequently, Jews were widely sympathetic towards Smetona and his rule. However, his regime did not tolerate insults of the German government and actively repressed suspected communists. For example, in 1934, the Ministry of National Defence of Lithuania approved an order to the counties commandants to &quot;severely punish all those who insult the German Government in any way, as well as those who deliberately agitate against Lithuanian Jews; to suppress the activity of all those Jewish organizations which appear to be under Communist cover or succumb to Communist influence&quot;.

===Authoritarian president===

Smetona was a leader of the 1926 coup d&#x27;état that deposed President Kazys Grinius. He once again became president on 19 December that year (two others briefly held the office during the coup, which began on 17 December, before Smetona was formally restored to the presidency). He designated Augustinas Voldemaras as prime minister. One year later, he dissolved parliament and on 15 May 1928, with the approval of the government, he promulgated a new constitution with more extensive presidential powers. In 1929, he removed Voldemaras and assumed dictatorial powers. He was re-elected president in 1931 and 1938, both times as the sole candidate. He remained in office until 15 June 1940.

Smetona&#x27;s constitution vested the president with both executive and legislative powers when the Seimas was not in session. The Seimas was not reconvened until the 1936 Lithuanian parliamentary election; for the next decade, Smetona ruled by decree, without a parliament, making his regime on paper one of the most arbitrary in the world. Even when the Seimas was reconvened, it was composed entirely of Smetona&#x27;s adherents; Smetona thus effectively retained all governing power in the nation. In 1938, a third constitution was enacted that retained the general authoritarian character of the 1928 document, and declared that political power in the state was &quot;indivisible.&quot;

The regime repeatedly arrested and imprisoned members of the already-banned Communist Party – as with almost all interwar European dictatorships, the claimed threat of Communism was the source of its legitimacy and the regime executed the original leadership five days after coming to power. However, despite propaganda that Communists were a &quot;non-Lithuanian force invading the country&quot;, they continued to operate underground with growing membership and it is known today that their leaders were ethnically Lithuanian.

In 1935, Smetona suffered a blow when farmers in south-east Lithuania organised a strike and refused to sell their products. Reprisals led to five deaths and 456 farmers being arrested. This exacerbated long-standing tensions within his regime between hardliners arguing for more rigid authoritarian control over Lithuanian life, and moderates who wanted liberalisation. These difficulties, however, were already becoming overshadowed by the threat of Nazi Germany. Smetona&#x27;s regime was the first in Europe to put Nazis on trial: as early as 8 February 1934, action was taken against Nazis in the Memel region, which was autonomous within Lithuania. The Smetona regime trial of Ernst Neumann and Freiherr von Sass (July 1934 to March 1935) was the first attempt anywhere to bring Nazis to justice, and saw 76 Hitlerites imprisoned and four sentenced to death – though this was commuted to life imprisonment. By 1938, however, Memel was becoming a difficult issue for a regime spending a quarter of its budget on defence and expensive army modernisation, and the Nazis were able to win 26 of 29 seats in elections. The following year, Smetona surrendered Memel to Hitler and declared a state of emergency – he never lost his distaste for Hitler and Nazism, having been so discredited by the loss of Memel that members of the Lithuanian political opposition were appointed to his cabinet to try recovering credibility and domestic stability.
Smetona&#x27;s government was cautious about industrialisation, as its support base lay in the dominant rural population. As dictator, Smetona did nothing to encourage direct foreign investment, which remained extremely limited throughout his time in office. Nonetheless, during Smetona&#x27;s dictatorship, Lithuania did advance economically: industrial output – mainly directed to domestic demand – when he was overthrown by the Soviet invasion was twice what it had been before the coup that brought him to power, and the country&#x27;s transport network had been greatly improved by the construction of railways from Šiauliai to Klaipėda and from Kaunas to the south and north-east. In contrast, Smetona was more generous in support for the agricultural sector, which at the time provided almost all of Lithuania&#x27;s exports despite occasionally protesting against the regime.

===Soviet occupation===

Lithuania was occupied by the Soviets in 1940 as a consequence of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. After the USSR presented an ultimatum to Lithuania in June of that year, Smetona proposed armed resistance against the Soviets. but most of the government and army commanders believed that the country was not capable of effective resistance with Soviet troops stationed inside Lithuania. On 15 June, Smetona turned his presidential duties over to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys on an interim basis, according to the constitution. Before leaving the presidential palace, Smetona said: &quot;I do not want to make Lithuania a bolshevik country with my own hands.&quot; He believed that by leaving the country, he would be in a position to do more for the country by leading a government in exile rather than become a Soviet puppet. He firstly fled to Germany with his family. Shortly afterwards, the Smetonas fled to Switzerland.

A day after Smetona left the country, Merkys announced that he had deposed him and was now president himself. Two days later, Merkys was pressured into appointing the more pliant Justas Paleckis as prime minister and resigning. Paleckis then became acting president, and was used as a puppet to oversee the final stages of Lithuania&#x27;s incorporation into the Soviet Union a month later.

Since Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, it has taken the position that Merkys&#x27; takeover of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional, since Smetona never formally resigned. Lithuania thus does not recognize Merkys or Paleckis as legitimate presidents, and contends that all subsequent actions leading up to the Soviet annexation were &quot;ipso facto&quot; void.

==Flight abroad==
On the morning of 15 June, just after the government decided to accept the Soviet ultimatum, Smetona made hasty preparations to flee the country. He was accompanied by his wife, his son and daughter and their spouses and children, Kazys Musteikis, former minister of defense, and two presidential adjutants. Smetona departed Kaunas at about 3 pm that day. They stopped in Kybartai on the border with Nazi Germany. Smetona and Musteikis attempted to summon the 9th Infantry Regiment from Marijampolė to protect them and to offer at least symbolic resistance to the Red Army, but the regiment was stopped by a delegation sent from Kaunas to retrieve the president. Smetona decided to cross the border without delay, but Lithuanian border guards would not allow him to pass. Around midnight, a local man led Smetona, his bodyguard and adjutant across the shallow Liepona stream. With Smetona already on the other side, his family managed to convince border guards to let them through at about 6 am.

On the German side, Smetona was met by , a Gestapo officer. Via Königsberg, the refugees were moved to a hunting lodge near the (Schwenzait) lake in the Masurian Lake District. On 17 August, Smetona received permission to relocate to Berlin, where he settled on the . There, he was carefully supervised and allowed to communicate only with Lithuanian representative, Kazys Škirpa. The Germans did not allow him to make any political moves so as not to upset the Soviet Union. It was clear that Smetona&#x27;s presence was not desirable. On 4 September, Smetona officially petitioned the Embassy of the United States in Berlin for U.S. visas. The request was granted, but only on condition that while Smetona was in the U.S., he would not be considered the leader or representative of any state or government. It was a humiliating condition, but Smetona accepted it and left for Bern, Switzerland on 18 September. Musteikis stayed in Berlin.

In Bern, Smetona met with members of the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service, ambassadors and diplomats who continued to represent pre-occupation Lithuania. They hoped to establish a government-in-exile via the National Committee chaired by former prime minister Ernestas Galvanauskas. Smetona saw no need for such a committee and criticized the choice of Galvanauskas. The diplomats were not receptive to Smetona – he had no funds, authority or political influence. Nevertheless, Smetona signed the so-called Kybartai Act – a backdated document supposedly written in Kybartai before his exile. The Act dismissed Antanas Merkys and appointed Stasys Lozoraitis as both prime minister and acting president. This controversial document was never used in practice.

Smetona departed Bern for Lisbon in January 1941. He stayed in Monte Estoril at the Pensão Zenith. He left for Brazil aboard the &quot;Serpa Pinto&quot;, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 14 February. He was met by local officials and Lithuanian emigrants, and had a meeting with Getúlio Vargas, the president of Brazil. Smetona departed Brazil on 26 February. On 9 or 10 March 1941, Smetona and his wife arrived in New York on the SS &quot;Argentina&quot;. He was greeted by about 30 American journalists and photographers as well as Lithuanian-American representatives. He was escorted to The Pierre hotel, where an evening function with about 400 guests was held on 13 March. Since Smetona was a private individual in the United States, the gathering did not include any members of U.S. organizations.

They lived temporarily at the Embassy of Lithuania in Washington, D.C., but their relationship with representative Povilas Žadeikis was tense. Smetona then lived in Pittsburgh and Chicago before settling in Cleveland in May 1942 with his son&#x27;s family. While in exile, he began work on a history of Lithuania and on his memoirs.

==Death and burial==

As Smetona was busy on his writing, he paid little attention to the fact that the heating system in his son&#x27;s house needed repair and was becoming dangerous. On 28 October 1943, Smetona wrote:
On 9 January 1944, a fire broke out in the house. Smetona&#x27;s son Julius noticed the fire while on the first floor. Above him, in the attic suite, Smetona and his wife Sofija spotted the smoke seeping in under the door. Sofija opened the door and she and Smetona began descending the stairs. Smetona, apparently decided that he could not go outside without a coat – he was recovering from the flu and was to give a talk in the coming weeks – and without saying anything to his wife, returned to get his fur coat. It took just a few minutes for him to be overcome by the smoke. Julius tried to return into the burning building to save his father but was forced out by the smoke and fire. Smetona was found lying on the kitchen floor on the second floor of Julius&#x27; flat. He was not burned.

Firefighters took Smetona outside and he was rushed to hospital by ambulance. He died before arriving.

The official record said that the fire was caused by an overheated furnace. Some believe, however, that due to Smetona&#x27;s continued political activities, the fire was started by the Russian Intelligence Service (called the NKGB at the time). With no evidence turning up in the subsequent years to substantiate that claim, it is, however, doubtful.

On 13 January, the funeral of President Smetona took place at Cleveland&#x27;s Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. Bishop Edward F. Hoban officiated. Smetona was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland.

His wife Sofija died in Cleveland on 28 December 1968.

The couple were survived by their daughter, Marija Danutė Smetonaitė (1905–1992), son Julius Rimgaudas Smetona (1913–1974) and Julius&#x27; sons, Anthony Algirdas Smetona (1939–2012), Juozas Smetona (1940–1996) and Vytautas Julius Smetona (born 1955).

In 1975, Smetona&#x27;s remains were moved from Cleveland&#x27;s Knollwood Cemetery mausoleum to a crypt (No. 103) next to his wife Sofija in All Souls Cemetery in Chardon, Ohio.

<text>In chemistry, hydroxylation refers to the installation of a hydroxyl group () into an organic compound. Hydroxylations generate alcohols and phenols, which are very common functional groups. Hydroxylation confers some degree of water-solubility. Hydroxylation of a hydrocarbon is an oxidation, thus a step in degradation.
==Biological hydroxylation==
In biochemistry, hydroxylation reactions are often facilitated by enzymes called hydroxylases. These enzymes insert an O atom into a bond. Typical stoichiometries for the hydroxylation of a generic hydrocarbon are these:
:
Since itself is a slow and unselective hydroxylating agent, catalysts are required to accelerate the pace of the process and to introduce selectivity.

Hydroxylation is often the first step in the degradation of organic compounds in air. Hydroxylation is important in detoxification since it converts lipophilic compounds into water-soluble (hydrophilic) products that are more readily removed by the kidneys or liver and excreted. Some drugs (for example, steroids) are activated or deactivated by hydroxylation.

The principal hydroxylation catalyst in nature is cytochrome P-450, hundreds of variations of which are known. Other hydroxylating agents include flavins, alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases (2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases), and some diiron hydroxylases.
=== Of proteins ===
The hydroxylation of proteins occurs as a post-translational modification and is catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Hydroxylation improves water‐solubility, as well as affecting their structure and function. 

The most frequently hydroxylated amino acid residue in human proteins is proline. This is because collagen makes up about 25–35% of the protein in our bodies and contains a hydroxyproline at almost every 3rd residue in its amino acid sequence. Collagen consists of both 3‐hydroxyproline and 4‐hydroxyproline residues. Hydroxylation occurs at the γ-C atom, forming hydroxyproline (Hyp), which stabilizes the secondary structure of collagen due to the strong electronegative effects of oxygen. Proline hydroxylation is also a vital component of hypoxia response via hypoxia inducible factors. In some cases, proline may be hydroxylated instead on its β-C atom. These three reactions are catalyzed by large, multi-subunit enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase, prolyl 3-hydroxylase, and lysyl 5-hydroxylase, respectively. These enzymes require iron (as well as molecular oxygen and α-ketoglutarate). They consume oxygen (the oxidant) and ascorbic acid (vitamin C, the reductant). Deprivation of ascorbate leads to deficiencies in proline hydroxylation, which leads to less stable collagen, which can manifest itself as the disease scurvy. Since citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C, British sailors were given limes to combat scurvy on long ocean voyages; hence, they were called &quot;limeys&quot;.

Several other amino acids aside from proline are susceptible to hydroxylation, especially lysine, asparagine, aspartate and histidine. Lysine may be hydroxylated on its δ-C atom, forming hydroxylysine (Hyl). Several endogenous proteins contain hydroxyphenylalanine and hydroxytyrosine residues. These residues are formed are formed by hydroxylation of phenylalanine and tyrosine, a process in which the hydroxylation converts phenylalanine residues into tyrosine residues. Hydroxylation at C-3 of tyrosine gives 3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is a precursor to hormones and can be converted into dopamine.

===Hydroxylation enzymes===
* 17α-Hydroxylase
* Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase
* Dopamine β-hydroxylase
* Phenylalanine hydroxylase
* Tyrosine hydroxylase

==Synthetic hydroxylations==
Hydroxylations are well explored but only rarely practical in organic synthesis. Peroxytrifluoroacetic acid converts some arenes to phenols. Salts of peroxydisulfate converts phenols to quinols in the Elbs persulfate oxidation. Mixtures of ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide, the Fenton reagent, behaves similarly.

Installing hydroxyl groups into organic compounds can be effected by biomimetic catalysts, i.e. catalysts whose design is inspired by enzymes such as cytochrome P450.

Whereas many hydroxylations insert O atoms into bonds, some reactions &quot;add&quot; OH groups to unsaturated substrates. The Sharpless dihydroxylation is such a reaction: it converts alkenes into diols. The hydroxy groups are provided by hydrogen peroxide, which adds across the double bond of alkenes.

==Hydroxylation of methane==
Methane is one of the most studied substrates for hydroxylation because it is abundant in natural gas. Although methane is welcome as a fuel, it would be more valuable if it could be converted to methanol. Studies on the hydroxylation of methane spans both synthetic and biological approaches. Nature has evolved enzymes called methane monooxygenases, which are efficient but impractical for commercial applications. Instead, synthetic catalysts have received much attention, but they too are not yet of practical value.

<text>The Croatian Parliament () or the Sabor is the unicameral legislature of Croatia. Under the terms of the Croatian Constitution, the Sabor represents the people and is vested with legislative power. The Sabor is composed of 151 members elected to a four-year term on the basis of direct, universal and equal suffrage by secret ballot. Seats are allocated according to the Croatian Parliament electoral districts: 140 members of the parliament are elected in multi-seat constituencies. An additional three seats are reserved for the diaspora and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while national minorities have eight places reserved in parliament. The Sabor is presided over by a Speaker, who is assisted by at least one deputy speaker (usually four or five deputies).

The Sabor&#x27;s powers are defined by the Constitution and they include: defining economic, legal and political relations in Croatia, preservation and use of its heritage and entering into alliances. The Sabor has the right to deploy the Croatian Armed Forces abroad, and it may restrict some constitutional rights and liberties in wartime or in cases of imminent war or following natural disasters. The Sabor amends the borders of Croatia or the Constitution, enacts legislation, passes the state budget, declares war and decides on cessation of hostilities, adopts parliamentary resolutions and bylaws, adopts long-term national security and defence strategies, implements civil supervision of the armed forces and security services, calls referendums, performs elections and appointments conforming to the constitution and applicable legislation, supervises operations of the Government and other civil services responsible to the parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences and performs other duties defined by the constitution.

The oldest Sabor with extant records was held in Zagreb on 19 April 1273. This was the Sabor of Slavonia, and not of Croatia and Dalmatia. The earliest recorded Sabor of the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia dates to 1350 in Podgrađe near Benkovac. The Parliament session held in 1527 in Cetin affirmed the House of Habsburg as Croatian rulers. After this, the Sabor became a regular gathering of the nobility, and its official title gradually stabilised by 1558 as the Parliament of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. Since 1681, it has been formally called the Diet of the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia. In 1712, the Sabor once again invoked its prerogative to select the ruler, supporting what later became the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Since the mid-1800s, the Sabor has regularly met and its members have been regularly elected. Exercising its sovereignty once again on 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria-Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which later joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Sabor did not meet between 1918 and 1945, except for an unelected Sabor convened in 1942. The Sabor initially reconvened as an assembly of State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) in 1943 and evolved since through various structures following the November 1945 elections and several changes of the constitution. After the first multi-party elections since Communist rule and the adoption of the 1990 constitution, the Sabor was bicameral (Chamber of Representatives and Chamber of Counties) until 2001, when constitutional amendments changed it to the unicameral form currently used.

==Historical background==

The Sabor, in its various forms, has represented the identity and opinions of Croats from the diets of the medieval nobility to the modern parliament. The oldest Sabor whose records are preserved was held in Zagreb on 19 April 1273 as the &quot;Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis&quot; or &quot;Universitas nobilium Regni Sclavoniae&quot; (General diet of the entire kingdom of Slavonia or Community of the nobility of the kingdom of Slavonia). Its decisions had legislative power. The 1527 Parliament decision was a decisive event of fundamental importance for the extension and confirmation of Croatian statehood, as described by the Constitution of Croatia. The parliament freely chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as the new ruler of Croatia, after centuries of Croatian personal union with Hungary. Following the entry into the Habsburg Monarchy, the Sabor became a regular noble diet, and its official title gradually stabilised by 1558 to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. Since 1681 it has been formally styled as the &quot;Congregatio Regnorum Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae&quot; or &quot;Generalis Congregatio dominorum statuum et ordinum Regni&quot; (Diet of the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia or General Diet of the Estates of the Realm). In 1712, the Sabor once again invoked its prerogative to select the ruler, supporting what later became the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and electing Maria Theresa of Austria as monarch. This event is also specified by the Constitution of Croatia as a part of the foundation of unbroken Croatian statehood from the Middle Ages to the present.

In 1848, first modern Diet with the elected representatives was summoned (even high nobility and high dignitaries of the Catholic and Orthodox church remained &quot;ex officio&quot; members). The Sabor operated as the legislative authority during the existence of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (1848/1868 – 1918). The events of 1848 in Europe and in the Austrian Empire represent a watershed in Croatian society and politics, given their linkage to the Croatian national revival that strongly influenced and significantly shaped political and social events in Croatia from that point onwards to the end of the 20th century. At the time, the Sabor advocated the implicit severance of ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasizing links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. A period of neo-absolutism was followed by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, recognizing the limited independence of Croatia, together with reinvigorated claims of uninterrupted Croatian statehood. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to this sentiment were the Party of Rights (1861–1929) and the People&#x27;s Party. They were opposed by the National Constitutional Party that was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and 1918, which advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary. Another significant party formed in this era was the Serb People&#x27;s Independent Party, which would later form the Croat-Serb Coalition with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties. This Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radić, advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918. In the Kingdom of Dalmatia, two major parties were the People&#x27;s Party, a branch of the People&#x27;s Party active in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, and the Autonomist Party, which advocated maintaining the autonomy of Dalmatia, opposing the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s demands for unifying Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party was also linked to Italian irredentism.
By the 1900s, the Party of Rights also made electoral gains in Dalmatia. In Dalmatia, the Autonomists won the first three elections held there in 1861, 1864 and 1867, while those from 1870 to 1908 were won by the People&#x27;s Party. In 1861–1918, there were 17 elections in Croatia-Slavonia and 10 in Dalmatia.

Exercising its sovereignty once again on 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria-Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The council of the newly established state voted to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; however, the Sabor never confirmed that decision. The 1921 constitution defining the new kingdom as a unitary state, and the abolition of historical administrative divisions, effectively ended Croatian autonomy for the time and the Sabor did not convene until the 1940s. The Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 established the autonomous Province of Croatia, or Banovina of Croatia, in which the Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport, while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed ban (Viceroy or governor). Before any elections were held, the establishment was made obsolete with the beginning of World War II and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia which banned all political opposition. In 1942, three sessions of an unelected Sabor were held in the Independent State of Croatia; these were held between 23 February and 28 December 1942, when it was formally dissolved. The assembly had no real power as the state was under the direct rule of (the fascist) Ante Pavelić.

The post-World War II Sabor developed from the National Anti-fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), formed in 1943. In 1945, ZAVNOH transformed itself into the National Sabor of Croatia, preserving the continuity of Croatian sovereignty. After the war, the Communists ran unopposed in the 1945 elections; all opposition parties boycotted the elections due to coercion and intimidation by the OZNA secret police and the Communist Party, aimed at eliminating electoral dissent. Once in power, the Communists introduced a single-party political system, with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (from 1952 the League of Communists of Yugoslavia) as the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia (from 1952 the League of Communists of Croatia) as a branch party. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. 
During Communist rule, the Sabor went from a unicameral parliament as specified by the 1947 constitution, to bicameral in 1953, changing again in 1963 to as many as five chambers and then to three in 1974. The constitutional amendments of 1971 established the Presidency of the Sabor, and one of its functions became representing Croatia, as the Yugoslav constituent republics were essentially viewed as nation-states generally surrendering only their foreign and defence policies to the federation; the federal bodies were no longer independent of, but instead formed by, the republics (after 1974 constitution, this role was taken by newly formed Presidency of the Republic elected by the Sabor).

The first political party founded in Croatia since the beginning of the Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) on 17 June 1989. In December, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At this time, the Communist party decided to cancel political trials, release political prisoners and endorse a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow multiple political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the new parties. By the time of the first round of the first multi-party elections, held on 22 April 1990, there were 33 registered parties. There were single-seat constituencies for half of the seats and a single nationwide constituency (through election lists) for the remaining seats. Still, the most relevant parties and coalitions were the renamed Communist party (the League of Communists of Croatia — Party of Democratic Changes), the HDZ and the Coalition of People&#x27;s Accord (KNS), which included the HSLS, led by Dražen Budiša, and the HSS, which resumed operating in Croatia in December 1989. The runoff election, open to any candidate receiving at least 7% of the vote, was held on 6 May 1990. The HDZ led by Franjo Tuđman won ahead of the reformed Communists and the KNS. The KNS, led by the former leaders of the Croatian Spring (Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo), soon splintered into individual parties. On 8 October 1991, Croatia&#x27;s declaration of independence took effect. The HDZ maintained a parliamentary majority until the 2000 parliamentary elections when it was defeated by the SDP led by Račan. The HDZ returned to power in the 2003 elections, while the SDP remained the largest opposition party.
==Parliamentary powers==

The Parliament represents the citizens of the Republic of Croatia; it acts as the country&#x27;s legislature. It convenes regularly in two sessions each year, from 15 January to 15 July and from 15 September to 15 December; however, extraordinary sessions may be called by the President of Croatia, the government of Croatia or a majority of the parliamentary members. The sessions are open to the public. The parliament decides through simple majority votes, except in issues pertaining to (constitutionally recognised) ethnic minorities in Croatia, the constitution, electoral legislation, the scope and operational methods of governmental bodies and local government; in these cases, decisions are made by two-thirds majority votes. The parliament may authorise the government to enact regulations dealing with matters normally covered by parliamentary acts. Such regulations expire one year after the authorisation is issued. The authorisation does not apply to matters that must be decided upon by a parliamentary two-thirds vote. Legislation enacted by the parliament is either endorsed by the President of Croatia within eight days or referred to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia.
The members are granted parliamentary immunity; their criminal prosecution is possible only after parliamentary consent, except for crimes with five or more years of imprisonment mandated. The parliament may appoint investigative commissions for any matter of public interest.

The Croatian parliament&#x27;s powers are defined by the Constitution of Croatia. These include: defining economic, legal and political relations in the Republic of Croatia; preservation of Croatia&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage and its utilisation; and forming alliances with other states. The parliament has the right to deploy Croatian Armed Forces abroad. It may also restrict constitutional rights and liberties in wartime or in cases of imminent war or following natural disasters, although that constitutional provision is limited to specific rights—right to life, prohibition of torture, cruel or denigrating conduct or punishment, upholding of habeas corpus and freedoms of thought, conscience and religious views. In addition, in those circumstances parliamentary members&#x27; terms may be extended. (As these rights are defined by the constitution, the decision would require a two-thirds majority. Since Croatia never declared a state of war during the breakup of Yugoslavia, this option has not been exercised in practice.) The parliament reserves the right to amend the borders of Croatia. The parliament decides on constitutional amendments, enacts legislation, passes the state budget, declares war and decides on the cessation of hostilities, adopts declarations of policy of the parliament, adopts national defence strategy, representing a long-term defence resource planning document, and national defence strategy, which defines bases for establishment and implementation of institutions, measures and activities in response to general security issues and specific challenges and threats to Croatia, implements civil supervision of the armed forces and security services, calls referendums, performs elections and appointments conforming to the constitution and applicable legislation, supervises operations of the government (headed by the Prime Minister of Croatia) and other civil services responsible to the parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences and performs various other duties defined by the constitution. Becoming the Prime Minister of Croatia requires majority support in the parliament.

The Government is responsible to the parliament; some other institutions, such as the Croatian National Bank and the State Audit Office, also report directly to the parliament. The parliament appoints an ombudsman to promote and protect human rights and liberties established by the constitution, parliamentary legislation and treaties adopted by Croatia. The ombudsman is appointed for an eight-year term; the ombudsman&#x27;s work is independent. The ombudsman, as well as all other persons authorised to act on behalf of the parliament, is granted parliamentary immunity equal to that enjoyed by parliamentary members.

===Working bodies===
The table below lists all 29 of the main committees in the 11th Sabor.
The members of Sabor can be members of one or more of its committees. The working body has a president, vice-president and members of the working body from the ranks of representatives, unless otherwise specified in the Rules of Procedure. The composition of the working body generally corresponds to the party composition of the Parliament.

The parliamentary committees debate and discuss initiatives and motions ahead of the enactment of laws, other regulations and other matters within the authority of the Sabor. Prior to the debate on any bill proposed by the government or deputies at the Sabor session, the chairperson of the competent working body and the Legislation Committee are obligated to place that bill on the agenda of the session of the working body and conduct a debate on it. Furthermore, the Committees hold hearings on the petitions and proposals submitted to Sabor by citizens.

Members of the Croatian Parliament engage in various inter-parliamentary activities. Deputies form permanent delegations to inter-parliamentary organizations, such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and NATO Parliamentary Assembly.

==Speaker of the Parliament==

The members of the parliament elect the Speaker of the Parliament and one or more deputy speakers by a simple majority vote.

Since the first multi-party elections held after the start of Communist rule, there have been eight speakers of the parliament; the first five, executing the office until constitutional amendments in March 2001, were also speakers of the Chamber of Deputies (since the parliament was bicameral at the time). As of 16 May 2024, Gordan Jandroković (HDZ) is the 12th Speaker of the Sabor. There are five deputy speakers in the current parliament: Željko Reiner (HDZ), Ivan Penava (DP) and Furio Radin (Ind.), Sabina Glasovac (SDP) and Siniša Hajdaš Dončić (SDP).

The speaker of the parliament becomes the acting President of the Republic in the event of the death, resignation or incapacitation of the President of Croatia, as specified by the constitution. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman in 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the 2000 parliamentary elections, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.


==Composition==


The Constitution of Croatia mandates that the parliament consists of at least 100 members and no more than 160 members, elected by a direct secret ballot for four-year terms. Parliamentary elections are held within 60 days following the term&#x27;s expiration or parliamentary dissolution (the latter takes place with a parliamentary no-confidence vote or if the parliament fails to approve a state budget within 120 days after the government submits one for approval), and a new parliament must convene within 20 days after the elections.

As specified by the current electoral legislation in Croatia, 140 members of the Parliament are elected in multi-seat constituencies, up to 3 members are chosen by proportional representation to represent Croatian citizens residing abroad and 8 members represent ethnic and national communities or minorities (including &quot;undeclared&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, or otherwise other than constitutionally recognized groups).

The model of parliamentary elections is based on the Christmas Constitution (1990), but has been significantly modified four times since then, most recently in 1999.
The most recent substantial revision of the election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only for a list of candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.

===Previous parliamentary elections===

Since 1990, seven parliamentary elections have been held in Croatia. The elections held in 1990 were the first multi-party elections following 45 years of Communist rule. The Parliament had three chambers at the time; the candidates ran for all 80 seats in the Social-Political Council of Croatia, all 116 seats to the Municipalities Council of Croatia and all 160 seats to the Associated Labour Council of Croatia. The first round of the election saw a turnout of 85.5%; the turnout for the runoff election was 74.8%. In this election, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won 205 seats and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia won 107. Between then and 2007, five parliamentary elections were held for the Chamber of Deputies () of the parliament or the unicameral parliament since (in 1992, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2007). Starting with the 1992 elections, the number of seats first in the Chamber of Deputies, and then in the unicameral parliament, were significantly variable: ranging from 127 in 1995 to 153 in 2007. In the Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1992, when the number of seats in the parliament was limited to below 160, only 5 parties have won 10 seats or more in any one parliamentary election. These were the HDZ, the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS), the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and the SDP.

Several political parties, besides the HDZ, HSS, HNS, HSLS and SDP, have won parliamentary seats in the elections since 1990. These have been (in alphabetical order): the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar (previously named Rijeka Democratic Alliance), the Croatian Christian Democratic Union, the Croatian Citizen Party, the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja, the Croatian Democratic Peasant Party, the Croatian Independent Democrats, the Croatian Party of Pensioners, the Croatian Party of Rights, the Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević, the Dalmatian Action party, the Democratic Centre party, the Istrian Democratic Assembly, the Liberal Party, the Party of Liberal Democrats, the Serb Democratic Party, the Slavonia-Baranja Croatian Party, and the Social Democratic Action of Croatia party.
The following parties have won special seats reserved for representatives elected by minorities (also in alphabetical order): the Bosnian Democratic Party of Croatia, the Democratic Union of Hungarians of Croatia, the German People&#x27;s Union – National Association of Danube Swabians in Croatia, the Independent Democratic Serb Party, the Party of Democratic Action of Croatia, and the Serb People&#x27;s Party.

In addition, some independents have won seats through party lists by being elected as an independent running on a party&#x27;s list, and Ivan Grubišić&#x27;s list of non-partisan candidates has won seats as well. Since individuals (not parties) possess parliamentary seats once won, there also can be (and have been) instances where seat-holders became independent or switched to another political party.

(*)In the first multi-party elections in 1990 three parliamentary chambers were elected in a two-round majoritarian system: the Social-Political Council, the Council of Municipalities and the Council of Associated Labour. Turnout for the election each chamber varied. It was as follows: Social-Political council (84.5% in first round in all constituencies, 74.82% in second round in 51 of 80 constituencies), Council of Municipalities (84.1% in first round, 74.6% in second round) and Council of Associated Labour (76.5% in first round in all constituencies, 66% in second round in 103 of 160 constituencies).

==Chamber of Counties==

Under the Constitution of Croatia adopted in 1990, the parliament became bicameral. The Chamber of Deputies had been elected a few months earlier; its members enacted legislation creating a new territorial organisation of Croatia. This reorganisation included counties that were to be represented by the new Chamber of Counties (). The first election of members of the chamber was on 7 February 1993, with each of the counties acting as a three-seat constituency using proportional representation. In addition, as per Article 71 of the 1990 constitution, the President of Croatia was given the option of appointing up to 5 additional members of the Chamber of Counties; it could have as many as 68 members. The second and last election for the Chamber of Counties of the parliament was on 13 April 1997. The Chamber of Counties was abolished by a 2001 constitutional amendment.

==Publication of proceedings==
The Croatian Parliament publishes all its decisions in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. Article 90 of the constitution requires publication of all acts and other regulations in the gazette before they are legally binding. Narodne Novine is available through a paid subscription as print, or for free online. Parliamentary debates and other proceedings are the subject of news coverage by media of Croatia, and Saborska televizija was set up in 2007 in addition as an IPTV channel broadcasting all plenary sessions of the parliament. Finally, the Parliament&#x27;s Public Relations Department publishes a news bulletin available to all institutions and citizens of Croatia through a print paid subscription, and online for free.

==Parliamentary location==
The Sabor has convened in Zagreb since the 13th century, but there was no special building for this until the 18th century. Previously, sessions of the Sabor had been held in private houses, in royal estates in Gradec and at the bishop&#x27;s residence. During the Croatian-Ottoman Wars, which severely disrupted the functioning of the Croatian kingdom, the Sabor&#x27;s sessions became so impractical that the 1685 session decided to have the ban appoint a six-member committee to do the work of the Sabor when sessions were not possible. This body became operational in 1689 and had its mandate extended through the entire 18th and into the 19th century. This &quot;&quot; consisted of the ban, two high clerics and three or four noblemen, and it would bring forward numerous acts; it met in various places, usually Zagreb or Varaždin, but also in Čiče, Ludbreg, Kerestinec, Vienna, Želin, Bratislava, Klenovnik, Slunj, Glina, Petrinja, Rasinja, Ptuj and Budim.

In 1731, the government purchased houses at the site of the present building and construction of a new building started the next year. The Sabor first met in the new building on 6 May 1737. The building was originally designed to accommodate archives, the court and the office of the ban; however, the government of Zagreb County moved in as well in 1765. The ban&#x27;s office, the court and the archives moved out of the building in 1807, when a building across St. Mark&#x27;s Square was bought to accommodate them. Subsequently, the newly purchased building was named Banski dvori after its new primary purpose of housing the ban and his office. The Zagreb County government purchased buildings adjacent to the parliament in 1839 and commissioned a new building at the site. It was completed in 1849; in the meantime, the Sabor had to convene elsewhere; it met in a theatre building located on a corner of the square. The theatre building later became the Zagreb City Hall.

In 1907, the government of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia bought the parliament building and adjacent structures, starting construction of the present parliament building. At the same time, the Zagreb County government moved its headquarters elsewhere, leaving the Sabor as the sole user. The present parliament building was completed in 1911 using the design of Lav Kalda and Karlo Susan.

Due to the renovation works on the Sabor Palace following the events of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake, in 2024 the parliament has decided to temporarily relocate to the Črnomerec district, in the Petar Zrinski Barracks, the site of the . The exact date of the relocation and of the beginning of the reconstruction are not yet known.

<text>Georges de Rham (; 10 September 1903 – 9 October 1990) was a Swiss mathematician, known for his contributions to differential topology.

==Biography==
Georges de Rham was born on 10 September 1903 in Roche, a small village in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. He was the fifth born of the six children in the family of Léon de Rham, a constructions engineer. Georges de Rham grew up in Roche but went to school in nearby Aigle, the main town of the district, travelling daily by train. By his own account, he was not an extraordinary student in school, where he mainly enjoyed painting and dreamed of becoming a painter. In 1919 he moved with his family to Lausanne in a rented apartment in Beaulieu Castle, where he would live for the rest of his life. Georges de Rham started the Gymnasium in Lausanne with a focus on humanities, following his passion for literature and philosophy but learning little mathematics. On graduating from the Gymnasium in 1921 however, he decided not to continue with the Faculty of Letters in order to avoid Latin. He opted instead for the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lausanne. At the faculty he started out studying biology, physics and chemistry and no mathematics initially. While trying to learn some mathematics by himself as a tool for physics, his interest was raised and by the third year he abandoned biology to focus decisively on mathematics.

At the University he was mainly influenced by two professors, Gustave Dumas and Dmitry Mirimanoff, who guided him in studying the works of Émile Borel, René-Louis Baire, Henri Lebesgue, and Joseph Serret. After graduating in 1925, de Rham remained at the University of Lausanne as an assistant to Dumas. Starting work towards completing his doctorate, he read the works of Henri Poincaré on topology on the advice of Dumas. Although he found inspiration for a thesis subject in Poincaré, progress was slow as topology was a relatively new topic and access to the relevant literature was difficult in Lausanne. With the recommendation of Dumas, de Rham contacted Lebesgue and went to Paris for a few months in 1926 and, again, for a few months in 1928. Both trips were financed by his own savings and he spent his time in Paris taking classes and studying at the University of Paris and the Collège de France. Lebesgue provided de Rham with a lot of help in this period, both with his studies and supporting his first research publications. When he finished his thesis Lebesgue advised him to send it to Élie Cartan and, in 1931, de Rham received his doctorate from the University of Paris before a commission led by Cartan and including Paul Montel and Gaston Julia as examiners.
In 1932 de Rham returned to the University of Lausanne as an extraordinary professor. In 1936 he also became a professor at the University of Geneva and continued to hold both positions in parallel until his retirement in 1971.

De Rham was also one of the best mountaineers in Switzerland. As a member of the Independent High Mountain Group of Lausanne since 1944, he opened several difficult routes, some of them in the Valais Alps (such as the south ridge of the Stockhorn from Baltschieder) and Vaud Alps (such as L&#x27;Argentine and Pacheu). In 1944 he wrote a complete climbing guidebook of the Miroir d&#x27;Argentine, where he climbed routes until 1980. According to John Milnor, in 1933 de Rham encountered on one of his hikes James Alexander and Hassler Whitney, who were climbing together near the Weisshorn in Valais; this meeting was the beginning of a more than 40-year friendship between Whitney and de Rham.

==Mathematics research==
The theory of differential forms has classical roots, with the relation between forms and differential topology initiated in the early 20th century by Henri Poincaré and Élie Cartan, who observed the Poincaré lemma as well as the fact that not every closed differential form is exact. Cartan conjectured in 1928 that the Betti numbers of a smooth manifold could be encoded by differential forms. As a particular form of this, he conjectured that a closed form is exact if it integrates to zero over any submanifold without boundary, and that a submanifold without boundary is itself a boundary of another submanifold, if every closed form integrates to zero over it. De Rham, in his 1931 thesis, proved Cartan&#x27;s conjecture by decomposing an arbitrary 
differential form into the sum of a closed form and some number of &quot;elementary forms&quot;, which are differential forms associated to a smooth triangulation of the space.

Following this work, de Rham made several attempts to unify forms and submanifolds into a single kind of mathematical object. He identified the ultimate notion of a current in the 1950s, generalizing (and inspired by) Laurent Schwartz&#x27;s recent work on distributions. De Rham&#x27;s work on these topics is now usually formulated in the language of cohomology theory, although he did not do so himself. In this form, his thesis work has become foundational to the field of differential topology, while his theory of currents is basic to geometric measure theory and related fields. His work is particularly important for Hodge theory and sheaf theory.

In an additional part of his 1931 thesis, de Rham introduced higher-dimensional versions of the three-dimensional lens spaces and computed their homology, thereby establishing a necessary condition in order for two lens spaces to be homeomorphic.

The structure of a Riemannian product automatically implies a product structure of the holonomy groups. In 1952 De Rham considered the converse, proving that, if there is a decomposition of the tangent bundle into vector subbundles which are invariant under the holonomy group, then the Riemannian structure must decompose as a product. This result, now known as the &quot;de Rham decomposition theorem&quot;, has become a fundamental textbook result in Riemannian geometry.

<doc id="398703" wikidata="Q1439852" url="?curid=398703" title="Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents">
<text>The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) is a body for developing and setting computer software standards for heterogeneous and interacting agents and agent-based systems.

FIPA was founded as a Swiss not-for-profit organization in 1996 with the ambitious goal of defining a full set of standards for both implementing systems within which agents could execute (agent platforms) and specifying how agents themselves should communicate and interoperate in a standard way.

Within its lifetime the organization&#x27;s membership included several academic institutions and a large number of companies including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, BT (formerly British Telecom), Sun Microsystems, Fujitsu and many more. A number of standards were proposed, however, despite several agent platforms adopting the &quot;FIPA standard&quot; for agent communication it never succeeded in gaining the commercial support which was originally envisaged. The Swiss organization was dissolved in 2005 and an IEEE standards committee was set up in its place.

The most widely adopted of the FIPA standards are the Agent Management and Agent Communication Language (FIPA-ACL) specifications.

The name FIPA is somewhat of a misnomer as the &quot;physical agents&quot; with which the body is concerned exist solely in software (and hence have no physical aspect).

<text>The 13th (Western) Division was one of the Kitchener&#x27;s Army divisions in the First World War, raised from volunteers by Lord Kitchener. It fought at Gallipoli, in Mesopotamia (including the capture of Baghdad) and Persia.

==War service 1914–1915==

===1914===
The 13th (Western) Division was formed as part of the First New Army at Salisbury Plain in August 1914. During the formation of the division, Major-General Robert Kekewich was appointed as its first commander. On 5 November 1914, while on sick leave he committed suicide. Although initially meant for service in France, with the rest of the Kitchener New Armies, it was ordered to the Mediterranean as reinforcements for the Anglo-French expedition at Gallipoli.

===Gallipoli 1915===

The 13th (Western) Division landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula in July 1915 in preparation for the Battle of Sari Bair (The August Offensive) beginning on 6 August. Although all of its component infantry battalions arrived, the divisional artillery did not arrive for some months. Initially in reserve to the main break-out from Anzac by units of the New Zealand and Australian Division, the 38th and 39th Brigades were sent in as reinforcements as the attack stalled.

The 7th Gloucesters and the 8th Royal Welch Fusiliers were sent to support the Wellington battalion of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade when it made the decisive assault on Chunuk Bair on the morning of 8 August. Battalions of the division formed the core of the force (known as Baldwin&#x27;s Brigade after the commander, Brigadier-General Anthony Baldwin) to capture Hill Q on 9 August but were not in position in time and so spent the day encamped on a small plateau beneath Chunuk Bair known as The Farm. When the Ottomans counter-attacked on the morning of 10 August the 13th (Western) Division troops on Chunuk Bair and at The Farm, suffered many casualties.

By September 1915, the 13th (Western) Division had suffered nearly 5,500 killed, wounded or missing out of its original strength of 10,500 men. Of the thirteen battalion commanders, ten had become casualties. On 23 August, Major-General Sir Stanley Maude took over the shattered 13th (Western) Division, Shaw being invalided home. At the beginning of October the division was moved from Anzac to Suvla Bay. Even though the division was once again in reserve, it suffered casualties from the Ottoman artillery. The commanders at Gallipoli already realised that the Dardanelles Campaign was a lost cause. To Maude fell the task of making sure that the 13th (Western) Division slipped away in the night during the evacuation of the Suvla Bay positions. Maude, the methodical commander, recorded:


After being evacuated from Suvla, the 13th (Western) Division was ordered in December to reinforce the British forces at Cape Helles. No sooner than the division had arrived through W Beach, than the decision was made to evacuate this last foothold. As the division was preparing to fall back to the beaches, it was attacked by Ottoman units in the late afternoon and evening of 7 January 1916. The main thrust of the attack, the first action under the division&#x27;s new commander, fell on the 39th Brigade, and in particular the 7th North Staffords defending Fusilier Bluff, who drove off the attackers.

The British evacuation from Helles occurred on the night of 8/9 January 1916. The 13th (Western) Division, fresh from its defensive victory began to fall back to Gully Beach at By the last detachments holding the division&#x27;s trenches were on the beach waiting to be loaded onto the transports. At Maude was informed that there were not enough transports coming to Gully Beach to carry off the division. Maude and his headquarters staff, as well as the pickets that had been covering the beach site, had to make the run in the dark to W Beach in order to be transported out of the Helles. General William Birdwood wrote that he considered the 13th (Western) Division was the best division in the Dardanelles Army. Following its withdrawal, the 13th (Western) Division was sent to Egypt, where it was reunited with its artillery units, many of which had been stationed in Egypt while the rest of the division had been fighting in Gallipoli.

==War service 1916–1918==

===Mesopotamia (Kut) March–April 1916===

After a brief refit in Egypt where the division&#x27;s battalions were being brought back up to strength, the division was dispatched to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), as reinforcements for Anglo-Indian forces attempting to relieve the siege of Kut. It took until the end of March for the entire division to make the journey from Egypt to Basra and then from Basra up to the Tigris to join the rest of the Tigris Corps. The 13th (Western) Division discovered that the supply situation in Mesopotamia was very difficult, the port facilities at Basra were inadequate and lacking good roads or a railway, river transport was necessary to move supplies into the hinterland. There were insufficient numbers of boats to keep the Anglo-Indian force, which the 13th (Western) Division was joining, adequately supplied.

The 13th (Western) Division brought with it modern, heavy artillery, including howitzers and as the strongest unit available, became the spearhead of the attempt by the Tigris Corps to relieve the Kut garrison, beginning on 6 April 1916. The division fought at Hanna, Fallahiya, and Sanniyat. After taking the first two places, the 13th (Western) Division was stopped by the Ottoman forces under the command of Khalil Pasha at the Battle of the Sanniyat on 9 April 1916. During the fighting on 5–9 April 1916, four 13th (Western) Division men were awarded the Victoria Cross. The first was Captain Angus Buchanan for his actions on 5 April 1916. On 9 April 1916, Chaplain William Addison, Private James Fynn and Lieutenant Edgar Myles were awarded the Victoria Cross for saving wounded soldiers. In three days of battle, the division was reduced to 5,328 effectives.

Exhausted by its three days of fighting, the 13th (Western) Division became the reserve for the Tigris Corps during the next phase of the operation. On 16 April 1916, it supported the 3rd (Lahore) Division on the right bank of the Tigris, as it captured the Bait Isa line, part of the Es Sinn defences supporting the Sanniyat position on the opposite bank. Taking the Bait Isa line exposed the flank of the Sanniyat position to enfilading artillery and machine-gun fire. On the night of 16/17 April 1916, the Khalil Pasha committed his reserves to a counter-attack to retake Bait Isa. The counter-attack struck as the 13th (Western) Division was preparing to storm the next defensive position. Although the 13th (Western) Division and 3rd (Lahore) Division hung on to their gains, the Ottoman counter-attack had taken the steam out of the Anglo-Indian offensive.

With the 13th (Western) Division so depleted, it was reduced to providing machine-gun and artillery fire for the 7th (Meerut) Division when it made the final push to break the Ottoman lines at the Sanniyat. On 22 April 1916, the divisional artillery and machine-guns were used to support the abortive attack by the 7th (Meerut) Division. On 29 April 1916, following the Tigris Corps&#x27; failure to break the Ottoman siege and the sinking of the steamer &quot;Julnar&quot; as it attempted to steam upriver past the Ottoman defenders, the Kut garrison surrendered. At the end of August 13 (Western) Division was withdrawn to Amara to ease the supply situation.

===Baghdad, December 1916 – March 1917===
Between May and December 1916, the 13th (Western) Division refitted and re-equipped in preparation for the drive northward to capture Baghdad. In July, Major-General Maude was elevated to command the expanded and renamed Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. In his place, Brigadier General Cayley, formerly the commander of the 39th Brigade, was elevated to command of the division. On 12 December 1916, the division advanced from Sheik Sa&#x27;ad on Kut. At the Second Battle of Kut, the division helped drive the Ottoman forces from the town. After a brief pause, the division drove north, crossing the Diyala River, and participated in the capture of Baghdad on 11 March 1917. Following the capture of Baghdad, the 13th (Western) Division fought a number of battles to consolidate British control over the Baghdad vilayet. This included fighting at Dellis Abbas (27–28 March 1917), Duqma (29 March 1917), Nahr Kalis (9–15 April 1917), the passage of the Adhaim (18 April 1917) and the action of the Shatt al &#x27;Adhaim (30 April 1917). Despite the relative inaction of the British to advance further, the division also fought at the Second and Third Action of Jabal Hamrin (16–20 October 1917 and 3–6 December 1917).

===Mosul, February–October 1918===
Along with the rest of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, the 13th (Western) Division remained in the Baghdad vilayet for the rest of 1917 and the early part of 1918. The division fought its last engagement as a whole at the action of Tuz Khurmatli on 29 April 1918. In July 1918, the 39th Brigade was detached from the division and be assigned to Dunsterforce (Major General Lionel Dunsterville). The 40th Brigade was detached from the division, along with the divisional artillery, to support the drive to Mosul and north.

==Occupation and Demobilization==
With the conclusion of the war, the 13th (Western) Division remained in the Mosul area on occupation duties until evacuated at the end of 1918. In 1919, two of the division&#x27;s battalions, 6th East Lancashire and 6th Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, were transferred to the Army of Occupation. The rest of the division proceeded to Amara where it was demobilised on 17 March 1919.
