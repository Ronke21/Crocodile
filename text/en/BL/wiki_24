<text>Twinking is a type of behavior in role-playing games that is disapproved of by other players. A player who engages in such behavior is known as a twink. The precise definition of twinking varies depending on the variety of role-playing game:

*In &quot;pen and paper&quot; role-playing games, a twink is often synonymous with a munchkin, i.e. a powergamer who seeks to acquire power and loot at the expense of their teammates. 
*In MUDs – Multi-User Dungeons or Domains –a twink is a player who is variously anything from a munchkin to a newbie (new player) to a griefer, or a bad faith player. 
*In massively multiplayer online role-playing games, or MMORPGs, twinking refers to a character gaining equipment with the assistance of a higher level character, particularly by giving the low-level character higher level equipment that is otherwise unattainable. It can also be used to describe the process of keeping a video game character at a low level while using in-game currency, earned by a high-level character, to provide it with superior equipment.

A related term, smurfing also exists. Often used in video gaming, smurfing describes a situation in which &quot;a highly-skilled player creates a secondary account as a disguise to play against less proficient opponents.&quot; The term originates from two &quot;Warcraft II&quot; players employing the strategy under the names &quot;Papa Smurf&quot; and &quot;Smurfette&quot;.

==RPGs==
In role-playing video games, particularly MMORPGs, twinking refers to outfitting a new character or player with items or other resources that are not normally available to new or low-level characters. A twink in this usage is a type of powergamer and munchkin. The term can also refer to the twinked character itself (e.g., &quot;My twink has all the best gear.&quot;). In its most basic definition, a twink is a character with better gear than one could have easily acquired on one&#x27;s own.

Twinking is typically done by transferring higher-end equipment from the player&#x27;s (or their friend&#x27;s) more experienced characters (who often have excess gear that would be much more useful to the lower-level character). It can also be done by equipping the character with the best possible gear for their level range, and filling them with end-game enchantments.

Many new players dislike twinking of others&#x27; characters, since it gives a big advantage to established players starting a new character. Some new players do not like to have their own characters twinked, as they prefer to earn the equipment for themselves.

It is common for twinking items to be traded at good values due to persistent demand. Sometimes, this will go so far as to inflate twink equipment prices, as high-level players are willing to pay more than a newbie would be able to.

===Examples===
Twinking can happen whenever players can interact and trade with each other, regardless of how present other players can be in the game itself; the handheld roleplaying game &quot;Pokémon&quot;, as an example, allows players to trade their Pokémon with each other.

Twinking was once very common in the CORPG &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, when players would have their low-level characters taken by high-level characters to end-game areas to obtain the best armor, weapons, and skills available (different terms are used to describe this action: being &quot;carried through&quot;, &quot;Pushed through&quot;, &quot;boosted&quot;, &quot;getting a boost&quot;), as &quot;Guild Wars&quot; does not have a level limit on such things. These twinked characters would then return to low-level PvP areas to fight significantly disadvantaged opponents. This practice became so common that the &quot;Guild Wars&quot; development team introduced a patch prohibiting characters with high-level armor entering beginner arenas.

&quot;World of Warcraft&quot; includes items that are specifically intended to make twinking more viable but less disruptive. These items belong to the &quot;Heirloom&quot; rarity class and have a number of unique characteristics. Their most unusual attribute is that they bind to a player&#x27;s account rather than the character, allowing them to be handed down from higher-level characters to lower-level ones but prohibiting them from being transferred from veteran players to new players. Thus, the twinking player is still required to earn these items, even if the twinked character does not. The other distinguishing characteristics of Heirlooms are that they have no real level requirement and their properties scale with character level, making them usable by and useful to all characters equally regardless of level.

In addition to heirlooms, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; also includes an option whereby a character may pay 10 gold to disable experience-gain and thereby maintain a specific level. This enables the twink to more easily farm for Honor Points (the in-game currency used to purchase weapons and armour for PvP combat) in player versus player battlegrounds by permanently remaining at the highest playable level for their battleground bracket (e.g. level 19 for the 15–19 battleground bracket, level 74 for the 70–74 battleground bracket, etc.). The character can also attempt to obtain the best possible item per equipment slot available to that specific level. The character may attempt this solo, in groups, or with the help from high-level characters. By competing at the highest level allowed in the battleground bracket, and equipped with the best possible gear, twinks played with a significant advantage over regular players. New players as well as low-level players in the battleground bracket were often at a severe disadvantage in games that fielded numerous twinks. Because of the gear and/or experience advantage, twinks often easily overpowered new and low-level players, quickly eliminating them from play. Consequently, these players experienced little of the actual gameplay. Battlegrounds often had twinks playing for both factions, Horde and Alliance, leveling the playing field to an extent, but winning and losing could be grossly influenced by which faction fielded fewer twinks. However, because of the large twink communities, especially at lower level brackets, battlegrounds were often filled with organized teams of twinks competing against each other.

Another example of twinking can be found in the MMORPG &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, where twinking is performed by buffing base stats using items (stat buffing weapons, armour) and laddering implants (laddering is a method by which the character equips higher implants by climbing quality levels one by one as one does, a ladder). Once a high-stat buffing item is equipped, it stays equipped even if the stats required to initially equip it decline or wear off, though a penalty can be applied if the base stats fall too far below the equipping requirements. Twinking is an essential component to this game in both PvP and in soloing Instances within the game. Whereas twinking is seen in negative light in other MMORPGS, it is seen positively in &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;.

In other online RPGs, such as &quot;Dark Souls&quot;, twinking can be done through a few methods, including gaining the help of other players who are at a higher level in order to have them clear content before it should be accessible, memorizing the locations of particular powerful items, and utilizing very specific strategies to advance further in the storyline than should otherwise be possible. This has a more direct effect on game play, especially in any game which involves online player-versus-player (PvP) combat such as &quot;Dark Souls&quot;, as the result can be two players who appear to be evenly matched on the surface being vastly unbalanced in terms of items or weaponry available to them. While a game&#x27;s developers may not consider these tactics to be outright exploitation of the underlying game engine, often these tactics are &#x27;nerfed&#x27; in some way in order to discourage twinking, such as removing, repositioning, or reducing the effectiveness of certain items within the game to make the progression more linear between players.

Some games such as &quot;Borderlands 2&quot; feature an in-game method of transferring items between characters on the same account. This is done in &quot;Borderlands&quot; through a storage container located in the game&#x27;s central hub, allowing up to four items to be stored and retrieved by any of the player&#x27;s characters.

===Countermeasures===
*Many games have item restrictions that prevent low-level characters from using higher-level items and upsetting game balance; in &quot;Diablo II&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, most items require a minimum ability score or level to equip. This did not totally prevent the problem of higher-level characters handing down gold or very powerful gear; it just changed what could be used in this strategy.
*Some games, such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; (WoW), &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; (AO), &quot;EverQuest&quot; (EQ), and &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; (LOTRO) have certain items become restricted to one character—&quot;Soulbound&quot; (WoW), &quot;NoDrop&quot; (AO), &quot;No Trade&quot; (EQ), or &quot;Bound&quot; (LOTRO) —when the items are picked up, equipped, or used. These items cannot thereafter be transferred to other characters (even one&#x27;s own characters on the same realm/server, with some limited exceptions). Some items are bound to a specific account (&quot;Bind To Account&quot; in WoW, &quot;Heirloom&quot; in EQ, &quot;Bound to account&quot; in LOTRO) and cannot be transferred to other people&#x27;s accounts, but can be traded between characters on the same account.
*&quot;WoW&quot; further reduced twinking in Battlegrounds (player-versus-player combat arenas) by awarding experience points for Battleground victories, so that as PvP characters gain experience, they also gain levels and thus become disqualified from lower-level brackets. Additionally, some of the best-in-slot items became &quot;heirlooms&quot; that apply a percentage increase to all experience point gains. Players can disable experience point gain for an in-game fee, but must play in separate Battlegrounds as long as they do so where most of the other players will also be twinkers.
*&quot;WoW&quot; eliminated twinking in PvP combat arenas in patch 7.0.3, by removing all stats gained from equipment upon entry and instead giving the character predetermined PvP stats based on its class and specialization.
*&quot;Pokémon&quot; games use a badge system, which makes Pokémon above a certain level tougher to control, making random actions and falling asleep instead of obeying commands until the trainer has completed enough of the campaign.

==Online role-playing games==
In online role-playing games, twinking may include, but is not limited to
*Denial-of-service or &quot;DoS&quot; attacks
*Hacking the server
*Creating an invincible or extremely powerful character with which the twink will seek to dominate in role-play
*Aggravating and attacking the game administration or game community
*Exploit
*Cheating
*Powergaming
*Metagaming, being able to guess or preempt plot points based on prior knowledge from having previously played the game in question.

==Etymology==
There are several possible etymologies for the word. It may not have been derived from a single source, instead evolving from multiple convergent usages. Its exact origin is unclear.

The gay-slang usage of &quot;twink&quot; has been suggested as a likely origin. One of the connotations of this usage is &quot;a young/inexperienced person who can outfit himself fashionably because of financial benefits from an older/experienced sugar daddy.&quot; This parallels MMORPGs, where in-game money is a strong limiting factor in the virtual economy and gear is usually in the form of clothing and jewelry.

The word &quot;twink&quot; appeared in the &quot;Ultima Online: Renaissance&quot; playguide in the glossary of terms (copyrighted in 2000). It was asserted to have a meaning similar to its current one, but also included powerlevelling.

On the MUD &quot;Sojourn&quot;, which several creators of &quot;EverQuest&quot; played, &quot;twink&quot; was alternately used to refer to powerleveling and metagaming. As MUDs date to 1978, this use of the term may possibly predate later uses.

The term twink and twinking predated MMOs and was prevalent in many MUDs. The term came from flags on much of the high-end gear that cause gear to be displayed as (twinkling) &lt;gear name&gt;. It was not an alternate name for powerleveling, but could be used as a method of powerleveling.

<text>A nail is a protective plate characteristically found at the tip of the digits (fingers and toes) of all primates, corresponding to the claws in other tetrapod animals. Fingernails and toenails are made of a tough rigid protein called alpha-keratin, a polymer also found in the claws, hooves, and horns of vertebrates.

==Structure==

The nail consists of the nail plate, the nail matrix and the nail bed below it, and the grooves surrounding it.

=== Parts of the nail ===

The nail matrix is the active tissue (or germinal matrix) that generates cells. The cells harden as they move outward from the nail root to the nail plate. The nail matrix is also known as the &quot;matrix unguis&quot;, keratogenous membrane, or onychostroma. It is the part of the nail bed that is beneath the nail and contains nerves, lymph, and blood vessels. The matrix produces cells that become the nail plate. The width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip bone determines if the nail plate is flat, arched, or hooked. The matrix will continue to produce cells as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition. As new nail plate cells are made, they push older nail plate cells forward; and in this way older cells become compressed, flat, and translucent. This makes the capillaries in the nail bed below visible, resulting in a pink color.

The lunula (&quot;small moon&quot;) is the visible part of the matrix, the whitish crescent-shaped base of the visible nail. The lunula can best be seen in the thumb and may not be visible in the little finger. The lunula appears white due to a reflection of light at the point where the nail matrix and nail bed meet.
The nail bed is the skin beneath the nail plate. It is the area of the nail on which the nail plate rests. Nerves and blood vessels found here supply nourishment to the entire nail unit. Like all skin, it is made of two types of tissues: the dermis and the epidermis. The epidermis is attached to the dermis by tiny longitudinal &quot;grooves&quot; called matrix crests (&quot;cristae matricis unguis&quot;). In old age, the nail plate becomes thinner, and these grooves become more visible. The nail bed is highly innervated, and removal of the nail plate is often excruciatingly painful as a result.

The nail sinus (&quot;sinus unguis&quot;) is where the nail root is; i.e. the base of the nail underneath the skin. It originates from the actively growing tissue below, the matrix.

The nail plate (&quot;corpus unguis&quot;) sometimes referred to as the nail body, is the visible hard nail area from the nail root to the free edge, made of translucent keratin protein. Several layers of dead, compacted cells cause the nail to be strong but flexible. Its (transverse) shape is determined by the form of the underlying bone. In common usage, the word &quot;nail&quot; often refers to this part only. The nail plate is strongly attached to the nail bed and does not contain any nerves or blood vessels.

The free margin (&quot;margo liber&quot;) or distal edge is the anterior margin of the nail plate corresponds to the abrasive or cutting edge of the nail.
The hyponychium (informally known as the &quot;quick&quot;) is the epithelium located beneath the nail plate at the junction between the free edge and the skin of the fingertip. It forms a seal that protects the nail bed. The onychodermal band is the seal between the nail plate and the hyponychium. It is just under the free edge, in that portion of the nail where the nail bed ends and can be recognized in fair-skinned people by its glassy, greyish colour. It is not visible in some individuals while it is highly prominent on others.

==== Eponychium ====

Together, the eponychium and the cuticle form a protective seal. The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of almost invisible dead skin cells that &quot;ride out on&quot; and cover the back of the visible nail plate. The eponychium is the fold of skin cells that produces the cuticle. They are continuous, and some references view them as one entity. (Thus the names &quot;eponychium&quot;, &quot;cuticle&quot;, and &quot;perionychium&quot; would be synonymous, although a distinction is still drawn here.) It is the cuticle (nonliving part) that is removed during a manicure, but the eponychium (living part) should not be touched due to risk of infection. The eponychium is a small band of living cells (epithelium) that extends from the posterior nail wall onto the base of the nail. The eponychium is &quot;the end&quot; of the proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed nail plate. The perionyx is the projecting edge of the eponychium covering the proximal strip of the lunula.

The nail wall (&quot;vallum unguis&quot;) is the cutaneous fold overlapping the sides and proximal end of the nail. The lateral margin (&quot;margo lateralis&quot;) lies beneath the nail wall on the sides of the nail, and the nail groove or fold (&quot;sulcus matricis unguis&quot;) are the cutaneous slits into which the lateral margins are embedded.

==== Paronychium ====

The paronychium is the soft tissue border around the nail, and paronychia is an infection in this area.
The paronychium is the skin that overlaps onto the sides of the nail plate, also known as the paronychial edge. The paronychium is the site of hangnails, ingrown nails, and paronychia, a skin infection.

==== Hyponychium ====

The hyponychium is the area of epithelium, particularly the thickened portion, underlying the free edge of the nail plate. It is sometimes called the &quot;quick&quot;, as in the phrase &quot;cutting to the quick&quot;.

==Function==
A healthy fingernail has the function of protecting the distal phalanx, the fingertip, and the surrounding soft tissues from injuries. It also serves to enhance precise delicate movements of the distal digits through counter-pressure exerted on the pulp of the finger.
The nail then acts as a counter-force when the end of the finger touches an object, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the fingertip, although the nail itself has no nerve endings.
Finally, the nail functions as a tool enabling a so-called &quot;extended precision grip&quot; (e.g., pulling out a splinter in one&#x27;s finger), and certain cutting or scraping actions.

===Growth===

The growing part of the nail is under the skin at the nail&#x27;s proximal end under the epidermis, which is the only living part of a nail.

In mammals, the growth rate of nails is related to the length of the terminal phalanges (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails.

In humans, fingernails grow at an average rate of approx. a month, whereas toenails grow about half as fast (approx. average a month). Fingernails require three to six months to regrow completely, and toenails require twelve to eighteen months. Actual growth rate is dependent upon age, sex, season, exercise level, diet, and hereditary factors. 
The longest female nails known ever to have existed measured a total of 8.65 m (28 ft 4.5 in). Contrary to popular belief, nails do not continue to grow after death; the skin dehydrates and tightens, making the nails (and hair) appear to grow.

===Permeability===
The nail is often considered an impermeable barrier, but this is not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin, and the composition of the nail includes 7–12% water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including paraquat, a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans; urea which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use on hands and fingers; several fungicidal agents such as salicylic acid, miconazole branded Monistat, natamycin; and sodium hypochlorite which is the active ingredient in common household bleach (but usually only in 2–3% concentration).

==Clinical significance==
Healthcare and pre-hospital-care providers (EMTs or paramedics) often use the fingernail beds as a cursory indicator of distal tissue perfusion of individuals who may be dehydrated or in shock. However, this test is not considered reliable in adults. This is known as the CRT or blanch test. The fingernail bed is briefly depressed to turn the nail-bed white. When the pressure is released, the normal pink colour should be restored within a second or two. Delayed return to pink color can be an indicator of certain shock states such as hypovolemia.

Nail growth record can show the history of recent health and physiological imbalances, and has been used as a diagnostic tool since ancient times. Deep, horizontally transverse grooves known as &quot;Beau&#x27;s lines&quot; may form across the nails (horizontal, not along the nail from cuticle to tip). These lines are usually a natural consequence of aging, although they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, Mees&#x27; lines, small white spots, receded lunula, clubbing (convex), flatness, and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction, poisoning, or merely local injury.

Nails can also become thickened (onychogryphosis), loosened (onycholysis), infected with fungus (onychomycosis), or degenerate (onychodystrophy). A common nail disorder is an ingrowing toenail (onychocryptosis).

DNA profiling is a technique employed by forensic scientists on hair, fingernails, toenails, etc.

===Health and care===

The best way to care for nails is to trim them regularly. Filing is also recommended, as to keep nails from becoming too rough and to remove any small bumps or ridges that may cause the nail to get tangled up in materials such as cloth.

Bluish or purple fingernail beds may be a symptom of peripheral cyanosis, which indicates oxygen deprivation.

Nails can dry out, just like skin. They can also peel, break, and be infected. Toe infections, for instance, can be caused or exacerbated by dirty socks, specific types of aggressive exercise (long-distance running), tight footwear, and walking unprotected in an unclean environment. Common organisms causing nail infections include yeasts and molds (particularly dermatophytes).

Nail tools used by different people may transmit infections. Standard hygiene and sanitation procedures avoid transmission. In some cases, gel and cream cuticle removers can be used instead of cuticle scissors.
Nail disease can be very subtle and should be evaluated by a dermatologist with a focus in this particular area of medicine. However, most times it is a nail stylist who will note a subtle change in nail disease.

Inherited accessory nail of the fifth toe occurs where the toenail of the smallest toe is separated, forming a smaller &quot;sixth toenail&quot; in the outer corner of the nail. Like any other nail, it can be cut using a nail clipper.

Finger entrapment injuries are common in children and can include damage to the finger pulp and fingernail. These are usually treated by cleaning the area and applying a sterile dressing. Surgery may sometimes be required to repair the laceration or broken bones.

===Effect of nutrition===
Biotin-rich foods and supplements may help strengthen brittle fingernails.

Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient for vision, reproduction, cell and tissue differentiation, and immune function. Vitamin D and calcium work together in cases of maintaining homeostasis, creating muscle contraction, transmission of nerve pulses, blood clotting, and membrane structure. A lack of vitamin A, vitamin D, or calcium can cause dryness and brittleness.

Insufficient vitamin B12 can lead to excessive dryness, darkened nails, and rounded or curved nail ends. Insufficient intake of both vitamin A and B results in fragile nails with horizontal and vertical ridges. Some over-the-counter vitamin supplements such as certain multivitamins and biotin may help in growth of strong nails, although this is quite subjective. Both vitamin B12 and folate play a role in red blood cell production and oxygen transportation to nail cells. Inadequacies can result in discoloration of the nails.

Diminished dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to dry and brittle nails.

Protein is a building material for new nails; therefore, low dietary protein intake may cause anemia and the resultant reduced hemoglobin in the blood filling the capillaries of the nail bed reflects varying amounts of light incident on the nail matrix resulting in lighter shades of pink ultimately resulting in white nail beds when the hemoglobin is very low. When hemoglobin is close to 15 or 16 grams, most of the spectrum of light is absorbed and only the pink color is reflected back and the nails look pink.

Essential fatty acids play a large role in healthy skin as well as nails. Splitting and flaking of nails may be due to a lack of linoleic acid.

Iron-deficiency anemia can lead to a pale color along with a thin, brittle, ridged texture. Iron deficiency in general may cause the nails to become flat or concave, rather than convex. As oxygen is needed for healthy nails, an iron deficiency or anemia can lead to vertical ridges or concavity in the nails. RDAs for iron vary considerably depending on age and gender. The recommendation for men is 8 mg per day, while that of women aged 19–50 is 18 mg per day. After women hit age 50 or go through menopause, their iron needs drop to 8 mg daily.

==Society and culture==

===Fashion===


Manicures (for the hands) and pedicures (for the feet) are health and cosmetic procedures to groom, trim, and paint the nails and manage calluses. They require various tools such as cuticle scissors, nail scissors, nail clippers, and nail files. Artificial nails can also be fixed onto real nails for cosmetic purposes.

A person whose occupation is to cut, shape and care for nails as well as to apply overlays such as acrylic and UV gel is sometimes called a nail stylist. The place where a nail stylist works may be a nail salon or nail shop or nail bar.

Painting the nails with colored nail polish (also called nail lacquer and nail varnish) to improve the appearance is a common practice dating back to at least 3000 BC.

Acrylic nails are made out of acrylic glass (PMMA). When it is mixed with a liquid monomer (usually ethyl methacrylate mixed with some inhibitor) it forms a malleable bead. This mixture begins to cure immediately, continuing until completely solid in minutes. Acrylic nails can last up to 21 days but can last longer with touch-ups. To give acrylic nails color, gel polish, nail polish, and dip powders can be applied.

Gel nails can be used in order to create artificial nail extensions, but can also be used like nail polish. They are hardened using ultraviolet light. They last longer than regular nail polish and do not chip. They have a high-gloss finish and last for two to three weeks.

Nail wraps are formed by cutting pieces of fiberglass, linen, silk fabric, or another material to fit on the surface of the nail (or a tip attached prior), to be sealed onto the nail plate with a layer of resin or glue. They do not damage the nail and also provide strength to the nail but are not used to lengthen it. It can also be used to fix broken nails. However, the treatment is more expensive.

With the dip powder method, a clear liquid is brushed onto a nail and the nail is then placed into pigmented powder. Dip nails tend to last about a month, 2–3 weeks longer than gel and acrylic nails. It can be worn on natural nails, or with tips to create an artificial nail. Dip powder nails do not require any UV/LED light to be cured, instead they are sealed using an activator. The quickest way to remove dip powder is to drill, clip off, or buff out layers of the powder so, when they are soaking in acetone, they slide right off.

===Length records===

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; began tracking record fingernail lengths in 1955, when a Chinese priest was listed as having fingernails long.

The current record-holder for men, according to &quot;Guinness&quot;, is Shridhar Chillal from India who set the record in 1998 with a total of of nails on his left hand. His longest nail, on his thumb, was long.

The former record-holder for women was Lee Redmond of the U.S., who set the record in 2001 and as of 2008 had nails with a total length on both hands of , with the longest nail on her right thumb at . However, as of 2022, the record for women is held by Diana Armstrong from Minneapolis.

==Evolution in primates==

The nail is an &quot;unguis&quot;, meaning a keratin structure at the end of a digit. Other examples of &quot;ungues&quot; include the claw, hoof, and talon. The nails of primates and the hooves of running mammals evolved from the claws of earlier animals.

In contrast to nails, claws are typically curved ventrally (downwards in animals) and compressed sideways. They serve a multitude of functionsincluding climbing, digging, and fightingand have undergone numerous adaptive changes in different animal taxa. Claws are pointed at their ends and are composed of two layers: a thick, deep layer and a superficial, hardened layer which serves a protective function. The underlying bone is a virtual mold of the overlying horny structure and therefore has the same shape as the claw or nail. Compared to claws, nails are flat, less curved, and do not extend far beyond the tip of the digits. The ends of the nails usually consist only of the &quot;superficial&quot;, hardened layer and are not pointed like claws.

With only a few exceptions, primates retain plesiomorphic (original, &quot;primitive&quot;) hands with five digits, each equipped with either a nail or a claw. For example, nearly all living strepsirrhine primates have nails on all digits except the second toe which is equipped with a grooming claw. Tarsiers have a grooming claw on second and third toes. Less commonly known, a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of owl monkeys (&quot;Aotus&quot;), titis (&quot;Callicebus&quot;), and possibly other New World monkeys. The needle-clawed bushbaby (&quot;Euoticus&quot;) has keeled nails (the thumb and the first and the second toes have claws) featuring a central ridge that ends in a needle-like tip.

A study of the fingertip morphology of four small-bodied New World monkey species indicated a correlation between increasing small-branch foraging and:
# expanded apical pads (fingertips),
# developed epidermal ridges (fingerprints),
# broadened distal parts of distal phalanges (fingertip bones), and
# reduced flexor and extensor tubercles (attachment areas for finger muscles on bones).
This suggests that whereas claws are useful on large-diameter branches, wide fingertips with nails and epidermal ridges were required for habitual locomotion on small-diameter branches. It also indicates keel-shaped nails of &quot;Callitrichines&quot; (a family of New World monkeys) is a derived postural adaptation rather than retained ancestral condition.

An alternative theory is that the nails of primates evolved to enable silent movement through trees while stalking prey, replacing noisier claws to make ambush hunting more effective.

<text>James Wilkinson (March 24, 1757 – December 28, 1825) was an American soldier / officer, politician, and later discovered years to be Royal Spanish secret agent #13, who was associated with multiple scandals and controversies, including the Burr conspiracy.

He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War but he was twice compelled to resign. He was twice the Senior Officer of the U.S. Army, appointed to be the first Governor in the newly acquired western lands of the new Louisiana Purchase of 1803, later organized by the United States Congress and the third President, Thomas Jefferson as the new Louisiana Territory in 1804–1812, west of the Mississippi River, and commanded two unsuccessful military invasion campaigns in the St. Lawrence River valley theater north in Canada during the War of 1812. 

He died while seeking to serve as an envoy diplomat in Mexico City, the capital of the newly declared independent Mexico. 

Four decades later in 1854, following extensive archival research in the Royal Spanish archives in the capital of Madrid, American historian from Louisiana, Charles Gayarré found documents which exposed Gen. Wilkinson as having been a highly paid foreign agent and spy in the service of the old Kingdom of Spain and its Spanish Empire. In the years since Gayarré&#x27;s research became public, Wilkinson has been savagely condemned by subsequent American academic historians and politicians. 26th President Theodore Roosevelt claimed &quot;[I]n all our history, there is no more despicable character.&quot;

==Early life==
James Wilkinson was born on March 24, 1757, the son of Joseph Wilkinson and Alethea (Heighe) Wilkinson. Wilkinson&#x27;s birthplace was about three miles (5 km) northeast of Benedict, Charles County, Maryland, on a farm south of Hunting Creek in Calvert County.

Wilkinson&#x27;s grandfather had been sufficiently wealthy to buy a large property known as Stoakley Manor in Calvert County. Even though James Wilkinson&#x27;s family lived on a smaller estate than those of Maryland&#x27;s elite, they still saw themselves as members of the higher social class. According to historian Andro Linklater, Wilkinson grew up with the idea that &quot;the image of respectability excused the reality of betrayal&quot;. His father inherited Stoakley Manor but by then the family was in debt. Joseph Wilkinson died in 1763 and in 1764 Stoakley Manor was broken up and sold. Wilkinson&#x27;s older brother Joseph inherited what was left of the manor property after his father died. As the second son, James Wilkinson inherited no land.

Wilkinson&#x27;s father had left him with the last words &quot;My son, if you ever put up with an insult, I will disinherit you.&quot; Biographer Andro Linklater argued that this upbringing led to Wilkinson&#x27;s aggressive reaction toward perceived insults. Wilkinson&#x27;s early education by a private tutor was funded by his maternal grandmother. His study of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, also funded by his grandmother, was interrupted by the American Revolutionary War.

==Marriages==
Wilkinson married Ann Biddle (1742–1807) of the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia on November 12, 1778, in Philadelphia. She was a first cousin of Charles Biddle, an associate of Aaron Burr, and Wilkinson&#x27;s marriage to the dynamic Biddle helped his career as a politician and general. She died on February 23, 1807.

The couple had four sons: John (1780–1796), James Biddle (c. 1783–1813), Joseph Biddle (1785–1865), and Walter (born 1791). James and Walter both served as Captains in the U.S. Army. 

On March 5, 1810, Wilkinson married Celestine Laveau Trudeau, widow of Thomas Urquhart and daughter of Charles Laveau Trudeau. They were the parents of twin girls Marie Isabel and Elizabeth Stephanie as well as a son, Theodore. Celestine&#x27;s father, known in Louisiana as Don Carlos Trudeau, had served in the Spanish government of New Orleans. When the United States gained control of the city, he remained in New Orleans and anglicized his name.

Marie Isabel Wilkinson died in infancy. Elizabeth Stephanie Wilkinson (1816–1871) married Professor Toussaint Francois Bigot (1794–1869) in 1833. Theodore J. Wilkinson (1819–1853) resided in New Orleans.

==Revolutionary War service==

Wilkinson first served in a Maryland militia unit in the summer of 1775. He then served in Thompson&#x27;s Pennsylvania rifle battalion from September 1775 to March 1776, when he was commissioned as a captain in the 3rd New Hampshire Infantry, backdated to September 1775. He served as an aide to Nathanael Greene during the Siege of Boston, and participated in the placing of guns on the Dorchester Heights in March 1776. Following the British abandonment of Boston, Wilkinson went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene&#x27;s staff and was given command of an infantry company in the 3rd New Hampshire.

Sent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for Benedict Arnold&#x27;s army besieging Quebec, he arrived just in time to witness the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General John Burgoyne – which precipitated the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became aide to Arnold just prior to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. In August 1776, he left Arnold&#x27;s service and became an aide to General Horatio Gates.

When Gates sent him to Congress with official dispatches about the victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, Wilkinson kept the Continental Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he arrived, he embellished his own role in the victory, and was brevetted as a brigadier general on November 6, 1777, then appointed to the newly created Board of War. The promotion of a 20 year old over more senior colonels caused an uproar among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson&#x27;s gossiping seemed to indicate he was a participant in the Conway Cabal, a conspiracy to replace George Washington with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was compelled to resign in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress appointed him clothier-general of the Army, but he resigned on March 27, 1781, due to his &quot;lack of aptitude for the job&quot;.

==Kentucky ventures==
After his resignation from the Continental Army, Wilkinson reluctantly became a brigadier general in the Pennsylvania militia in 1782 and also a state assemblyman in 1783, due to the wishes of George Washington. He moved to Kentucky (at that time, just three counties still belonging to Virginia) in 1784, and he was active there in efforts to achieve independence from Virginia. In Kentucky, Wilkinson in 1788 vigorously opposed the new U.S. Constitution. Kentucky had very nearly achieved statehood under the old Articles of Confederation, and there was widespread disappointment when this was delayed because of the new constitution.

Leading up to Kentucky&#x27;s seventh convention regarding separation from Virginia in November 1788, Wilkinson attempted to gauge the support for Kentucky to seek union with Spain. Wilkinson&#x27;s ability to win people over with his charm and seeming sincerity got him elected committee chairman at the convention. He advocated for Kentucky to seek independence from Virginia first, and then to consider joining the Union of states as a second step. For many, joining the Union was conditional upon the Union negotiating with Spain to arrange free navigation on the Mississippi River, a contentious point which many doubted the eastern states would act upon.

Unable to gather enough support for his position at the convention, Wilkinson then approached Spanish Governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró with a proposal. His intention was to obtain a grant of 60,000 acres (243 km2) in the Yazoo lands, at the junction of the Yazoo River and the Mississippi (near present-day Vicksburg). The land was to serve as payment for Wilkinson&#x27;s efforts on behalf of Spain, and to serve as a refuge in the event he and his supporters had to flee from the United States. Wilkinson asked for and received a pension of $7,000 from Miró, while requesting pensions on behalf of several prominent Kentuckians, including: Harry Innes, Benjamin Sebastian, John Brown, Caleb Wallace, Benjamin Logan, Isaac Shelby, George Muter, George Nicholas, and even Humphrey Marshall (who at one time was a bitter rival of Wilkinson&#x27;s).

However, by 1788 Wilkinson had apparently lost the confidence of officials in Spain. Miró was not to grant any of the proposed pensions and was forbidden from giving money to support a revolution in Kentucky. Furthermore, Wilkinson continued to secretly receive funds from Spain for many years.

==Second military career==
===Northwest Indian War===

In May 1791, Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson led a subsequent raid that August, intended to create a distraction that would aid St. Clair&#x27;s march north. In the Battle of Kenapacomaqua, Wilkinson killed 9 Wea and Miami, and captured 34 Miami as prisoners, including a daughter of Miami war chief Little Turtle. Many of the confederation leaders were considering terms of peace to present to the United States, but when they received news of Wilkinson&#x27;s raid, they readied for war. Wilkinson&#x27;s raid thus had the opposite effect, uniting the tribes against St. Clair instead of distracting them. St. Clair&#x27;s horrific defeat would take place shortly after.

===Betrayal of Wayne===
When the United States government reorganized the Army as the Legion of the United States, President George Washington was faced with the decision of whom to name as its commanding general. The two major candidates for this promotion were Wilkinson and Anthony Wayne. In the end, the cabinet chose Wayne due to Wilkinson&#x27;s suspected involvement with the Spanish government. The cabinet promoted Wilkinson to brigadier general as consolation, since the President was aware of Wilkinson&#x27;s fragile ego.

Wilkinson developed a jealousy of Wayne, but he maintained an ostensible respect toward the general. Throughout the Ohio campaign, Wilkinson secretly tried to undermine him. Wilkinson wrote anonymous negative letters to local newspapers about Wayne and spent years writing negative letters to politicians in D.C. Wilkinson also urged contractors not to perform, in the hope that Wayne&#x27;s campaign would fail and that he would be appointed to replace Wayne. Wilkinson&#x27;s refusal of an invitation to Wayne&#x27;s Christmas party also created suspicion. Wayne eventually developed a full-fledged hatred for Wilkinson, after receiving a tip from Henry Knox. In August 1794, Wayne had led the Legion against the Indians in the Battle of Fallen Timbers; the battle was a significant victory for the United States, yet Wilkinson had criticized Wayne&#x27;s actions during the battle, simply to antagonize him.

Wilkinson proceeded to file formal complaints against Wayne and his decisions to President Washington. Upon finding out about the complaints against him, Wayne decided to launch an investigation into Wilkinson&#x27;s history with the Spanish. During all of this time, Wilkinson had renewed his secret alliance with the Spanish government (through the Governor of Louisiana Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet), alerting them to the actions of both the US and the French occupancy in North America. When Spanish couriers were intercepted carrying payments for Wilkinson, Wayne&#x27;s suspicions were confirmed and he attempted to court martial Wilkinson for his treachery. However, Wayne developed a stomach ulcer and died on December 15, 1796; there was no court-martial. Instead, Wilkinson began his first tenure as Senior Officer of the Army, which lasted for about a year and a half. He continued to pass on intelligence to the Spanish in return for large sums in gold, but most of his information was of little value. Wilkinson claimed credit for undermining George Rogers Clark plan to become &quot;Major General in the Armies of France and Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River&quot; and for preventing supplies from being shipped down the Ohio River. He submitted receipts of $8,640 to Spanish Governor Carondelet for his efforts.

===Quasi-War with France===
Wilkinson was transferred to the southern frontier in 1798. During the Quasi-War crisis of the late 1790s between France and the United States, he was given the third-place rank in the U.S. Army behind George Washington (who, having been succeeded as president by Adams, died in December 1799) and Alexander Hamilton. Among other duties, Wilkinson was charged by Hamilton with establishing a &quot;Reserve Corps&quot; of American troops in the lower Ohio River Valley, who would seize the lower Mississippi River Valley and New Orleans in the event of war with France and her ally Spain.

Despite the end of the crisis in mid-1800 and Hamilton being discharged from the Army, Wilkinson, for unknown reasons, continued the plan for the establishment of the base which he named &quot;Cantonment Wilkinson&quot; after himself. Located in the Indiana Territory (now southern Illinois), the base operated from January 1801 to late 1802 before finally being abandoned. Archaeologists from Southern Illinois University have located the remains of this base, which is producing much previously unknown information and artifacts from the daily life of the frontier army.

Wilkinson served his second, longer term as Senior Officer of the Army from June 15, 1800, until January 27, 1812, when former Secretary of War Henry Dearborn was promoted to major general over Wilkinson.

On 30 April 1801, Wilkinson issued an order to remove all queues or pigtails, which had been worn in the army since the Revolution. This order was highly unpopular with both officers and men, leading to several desertions and threats of resignation. One senior officer, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Butler, was eventually court martialed in 1803 for failing to cut his hair. Andrew Jackson, who &quot;loathed Wilkinson,&quot; took up for Butler and sent a series of letters on the matter to Thomas Jefferson, who ultimately declined to intervene.

===Service under President Jefferson===
Wilkinson remained senior officer of the United States Army under President Thomas Jefferson. Along with Mississippi Territorial and the newly named Orleans Territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne, Wilkinson shared the honor of taking possession of the Louisiana Purchase on behalf of the United States on December 20, 1803. At this time, Wilkinson renewed his treasonous relationship with Spanish colonial officials, offering advice to them on how to contain American expansion in exchange for the restoration of his pension. Among other things, Wilkinson tipped off the Spanish to the object of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and provided advice to the Marquess of Casa Calvo to aid in his negotiations over the Texas–Louisiana border. Wilkinson also provided advice to the Spanish on how to intercept at least two other Jefferson sponsored expeditions to explore the Louisiana Purchase.

Wilkinson also served as the designated United States Indian agent in the south at this time and negotiated the Treaty of Chickasaw Bluffs with the Chickasaw (signed October 24, 1801), and the Treaty of Fort Adams with the Choctaw, signed December 17, 1801, the Treaty of Fort Confederation in 1802, and the Treaty of Hoe Buckintoopa (signed August 31, 1803).

===Territorial Governor of Louisiana===
Wilkinson was appointed by President Jefferson to be the first Governor of Louisiana Territory in the spring of 1805 with an additional salary of $2,000. His secretary, Dr. Joseph Brown, was the brother-in-law of Vice President Aaron Burr, and they were headquartered in St. Louis.

===Connections with Aaron Burr===
In 1804–05, Wilkinson met in person with Aaron Burr, and they exchanged letters regarding Burr&#x27;s conspiracy. After Burr&#x27;s arrest, he claimed he was leading a group of settlers to take up residence on land in Texas which he had leased from the Spanish government in Mexico. The government charged Burr with treason and claimed he intended to separate the then-western states and territories from the United States and establish an independent nation.

Since Wilkinson was both the senior brigadier general of the United States Army and the Louisiana governor, Burr cultivated his support. In 1806 Burr is supposed to have sent a coded, unsigned letter (the &quot;Cipher Letter&quot;, which Burr later denied having written) to Wilkinson, which stated that he was ready to commence his movement to Texas. Burr&#x27;s subsequent efforts to recruit participants in his plans became public, raising fears that he was conspiring with England to start a war with Spain. Wilkinson became fearful that his role in Burr&#x27;s plans and/or his spying for Spain would be exposed. In October 1806 Wilkinson sent to President Jefferson a letter in which he painted Burr&#x27;s actions in the worst possible light, while portraying himself as innocent of any involvement. Jefferson ordered Burr&#x27;s arrest, and Burr was apprehended near Natchez, Mississippi.

Wilkinson testified at Burr&#x27;s trial, and the documents presented as evidence included the &quot;cipher letter&quot;, which Wilkinson had given the prosecution. However, the letter was clearly altered to minimize Wilkinson&#x27;s culpability. This forgery, coupled with Wilkinson&#x27;s obviously self-serving testimony, had the effect of making Burr seem to be the victim of an overzealous government. The grand jury nearly produced enough votes in favor of indicting Wilkinson for misprision of treason, and foreman John Randolph said of Wilkinson that he was a &quot;mammoth of iniquity&quot;, the &quot;most finished scoundrel&quot;, and &quot;the only man I ever saw who was from the bark to the very core a villain.&quot;

During Burr&#x27;s trial, Wilkinson placed New Orleans under martial law, against the will of Governor Claiborne, and imprisoned several people whom he thought may be able to connect him to Burr, along with attorneys who tried to defend them.

He was removed from the Territorial Governor&#x27;s office after being publicly criticized for heavy-handed administration and abuse of power (and replaced with Meriwether Lewis). In addition, his actions around the Burr conspiracy became public, which aroused the public against him and led to two Congressional inquiries into his private ventures and intrigues. President James Madison, who had succeeded Jefferson in 1809, ordered a military court-martial in 1811, which exonerated Wilkinson.

===War of 1812===
On March 2, 1813, Wilkinson was commissioned a major general during the War of 1812 with Britain, with whom Spain was allied. The Mobile District, now coastal Mississippi and Alabama, had remained under Spanish control following the U.S. annexation of the Republic of West Florida in 1810. On May 14, 1812, the claimed portion of West Florida east of the Pearl River was assigned to the Mississippi Territory, though at the time, the area around Mobile Bay remained under the control of Spanish Florida. Following that Congressional declaration of annexation, and an act of February 12, 1813, (3 Stat. L. 472) authorizing the President to occupy that area, Wilkinson sailed from New Orleans to Mobile in April 1813 with a force of 600. There he received the surrender of the Spanish commander, effectively implementing the inclusion of the Mobile District in the Mississippi Territory.

He was then assigned to the St. Lawrence River theater of war, following Henry Dearborn&#x27;s reassignment. Wilkinson engaged in two failed campaigns (the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm and the Second Battle of Lacolle Mills. He was relieved from active duty and court-martialed in early 1815, but he was ultimately cleared. He was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815. In 1816, Wilkinson published &quot;Memoirs of My Own Times&quot;, in a final attempt to clear his name.

General Wilkinson may not have been a competent commander in conventional operations in the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm and the Battle of Lacolle Mills, but he excelled at guerrilla warfare tactics. Before the Battle of Bladensburg, General Wilkinson helped conceive a strategy of using the militia dominated forces as guerrilla fighters against the incoming British attack on the Capitol. Wilkinson and other American commanders tried to convince the American government to use all the militia in hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, and harassment against the British forces by the flanks and rear. But President James Madison and James Monroe disapproved of the plan. Madison and Monroe wanted to fight a set piece battle by placing the militia in linear defensive formations to fight the British head on. This led to ultimate disaster and defeat as the British easily routed the militia and burned the Capitol.

==Spanish Secret Agent==
In April 1787, Wilkinson made a highly controversial trip to New Orleans, which was the capital of Spanish colonial Louisiana. At that time, Americans were allowed to trade on the Mississippi River, but they had to pay a hefty tariff. Wilkinson met with Spanish Governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró and managed to convince him to allow Kentucky to have a trading monopoly on the River; in return he promised to promote Spanish interests in the west. On August 22, 1787, Wilkinson signed an expatriation declaration and swore allegiance to the King of Spain to satisfy his own commercial needs. The &quot;Spanish Conspiracy&quot;, as it is known, was initiated by Wilkinson&#x27;s &quot;First Memorial&quot;, a 7,500-word report written before he left New Orleans for Charleston, to the Spanish concerning the &quot;political future of western settlers&quot; and to convince Spain to &quot;admit us [Kentuckians] under protection as vassals&quot;. This was encoded with myriad symbols, numbers, and letters that was decoded via a complex English-Spanish cipher code-named &quot;Number 13&quot;, which became the basis for his pseudonym, &quot;Agent 13&quot;.
Wilkinson&#x27;s involvement with the Spanish (as Agent 13) was widely suspected in his own day, and it was proved in 1854, with Louisiana historian Charles Gayarré&#x27;s publication of the American general&#x27;s correspondence with Esteban Rodríguez Miró, Louisiana&#x27;s colonial governor between 1785 and 1791.

==Last years==
After the end of his military career, Wilkinson unsuccessfully sought to be appointed as U.S. Envoy to Mexico. This was during the period of the Mexican War of Independence against Spain, which was won in 1821. In that year, Wilkinson requested a Texas land grant. While awaiting the Mexican government&#x27;s approval of his land scheme, Wilkinson died in Mexico City on December 28, 1825, at the age of 68. He was buried in Mexico City.

==Later view==
Some 65 years after the general&#x27;s misdeeds, then-Governor of New York, Theodore Roosevelt, condemned him in print: &quot;In all our history, there is no more despicable character.&quot; Historian Robert Leckie characterized him as &quot;a general who never won a battle or lost a court-martial&quot;, while Frederick Jackson Turner called Wilkinson &quot;the most consummate artist in treason that the nation ever possessed&quot;. George Rogers Clark biographer Temple Bodley said of Wilkinson, &quot;He had considerable military talent, but used it only for his own gain.&quot; It has been speculated but never proven that Wilkinson had Anthony Wayne assassinated by poison. Wilkinson is documented secretly undermining him throughout his later career, benefited from his death, and would replace him as commander after his death.

==Legacy==
* Frankfort, Kentucky&#x27;s downtown was created from land owned by Wilkinson, and he designed the layout. A major street, which runs along historic Liberty Hall, was named Wilkinson Street.
* New Orleans has a short street called Wilkinson named for James Wilkinson, in the French Quarter near Jackson Square. There is also a Wilkinson Street in Mandeville, Louisiana. Many of the oldest streets in Mandeville, close to Lake Pontchartrain, are named after prominent New Orleans residents of the late 18th and early 19th centuries or for Battle of New Orleans heroes.
* Wilkinson County, Georgia, is named for Wilkinson. A Georgia historical marker on the courthouse square gives a brief biography of the general and identifies him as the source of the county&#x27;s name. (The entry on the county in the usually reliable reference &quot;Georgia Place Names&quot;, by the late Kenneth Krakow, confuses James Wilkinson with James Marion Wilkinson, a Valdosta politician and railroad executive who was born decades after the county was founded.)
* Wilkinson County, Mississippi, is named for General Wilkinson as well. It was there in the Old Natchez District that Wilkinson spent much of his time, allegedly plotting the Burr Conspiracy; Fort Adams (then an important U.S. Army post) was constructed by Wilkinson as the most southwesterly point in the U.S. and the last American stop on the Mississippi River before entering Spanish territory.
* Wilkinson was an avid supporter of the military&#x27;s short-hair codes. He attempted to prosecute Colonel Thomas Butler, a veteran of both the Revolution and the Indian wars, for keeping his long hair. Colonel Butler died before the trials closed. He never did cut his long, braided queue prior to his death and a possibly apocryphal story tells that his last request was for a hole to be drilled in his casket so that the queue could hang out and taunt Wilkinson even in death.
*Wilkinson was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1789.
* Washington Irving parodied Wilkinson as General Von Poffenburgh in his 1809 &quot;A History of New-York&quot;.

<text>William Holmes McGuffey (September 23, 1800 – May 4, 1873) was an American college professor and president who is best known for writing the &quot;McGuffey Readers&quot;, the first widely used series of elementary school-level textbooks. More than 120 million copies of &quot;McGuffey Readers&quot; were sold between 1836 and 1960, placing its sales in a category with the Bible and Webster&#x27;s Dictionary.

== Early years ==

William Holmes McGuffey, born September 23, 1800, was the son of Alexander and Anna (Holmes) McGuffey near Claysville in West Finley Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, which is 45 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. His family, who had strong opinions about education and religion, immigrated from Scotland to the United States in 1774. In 1802, the McGuffey family moved farther out into the frontier at Tuscarawas County, Ohio. He attended country school, and after receiving special instruction at Youngstown, he attended Greersburg Academy in Darlington, Pennsylvania.

== Early career and college education ==
At the age of 14, he was a roving instructor in a one-room schoolhouse in Calcutta, Ohio. He traveled through the frontier of Ohio, Kentucky, and western Pennsylvania. He was &quot;one of an army of half-educated young men who tramped the roads and trails drumming up &#x27;subscription scholars&#x27;.&quot; His students generally brought their Bibles, because there were few textbooks at that time. He taught children from the age of six to twenty-one. He taught in frontier schools, often eleven hours a day and six days a week.

In between jobs as a teacher, he attended and graduated in 1826 from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Washington College, where he became an instructor. He was close friends with Washington College&#x27;s President Andrew Wylie and lived in Wylie&#x27;s house for a time; they often would walk the three miles to Washington College together.

== Career and life ==

McGuffey left Washington College in 1826 to become a professor of ancient languages at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 1832, he was transferred to the chair of moral philosophy.

In 1829, he was licensed as a minister in the Presbyterian Church at Bethel Chapel. He preached frequently during the remainder of his life. 

Truman and Smith, a Cincinnati publisher, wanted to publish a series of four graded readers for schoolchildren. Based upon a recommendation from Harriet Beecher Stowe, they hired McGuffey. His brother Alexander Hamilton McGuffey wrote the fifth and sixth readers for the &quot;McGuffey Readers&quot; series. His books sold over 120 million copies and still continue to be used for homeschooling.

In 1836, he left Miami to become president of Cincinnati College, where he also served as a distinguished teacher and lecturer. He left Cincinnati in 1839 to become the 4th president of Ohio University, which he left in 1843 to become president of what was then called the Woodward Free Grammar School in Cincinnati, one of the country&#x27;s earliest public schools.

From 1843 to 1845, he was a professor in Woodward College in Cincinnati. While in Cincinnati he began the preparation of an &quot;Eclectic&quot; series of readers and spellers, which became popular, and have been many times revised and reissued. From 1845 till his death, he occupied the chair of moral philosophy and political economy in the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.

== Personal life ==

He was married to Harriet Spinning of Dayton, Ohio, in 1827. They had five children, who were expected to act with submission and obedience, according to the diary of one of their daughters. McGuffey believed in the importance of education and religion to live successful lives.

McGuffey and Harriet had as many as three slaves while at Virginia. One of these enslaved individuals was William Gibbons, who was hired out to them. Gibbons was literate. He was said to be self-taught and also said to have been instructed by McGuffey&#x27;s daughter Maria. He later became a minister in Charlottesville and Washington, D.C. 

Harriet was ill during the summer of 1850 and was taken to her parents&#x27; home in Woodside by McGuffey. Her health did not improve as hoped and she died on July 3. She was buried in Woodside Cemetery. He later married Miss Laura Howard, daughter of Dean Howard of the University of Virginia. They had one daughter, Anna. She died at the age of four. 

During the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era, McGuffey was generous in his donations to the poor and African Americans. McGuffey died May 4, 1873, at the University of Virginia, and is buried in the University of Virginia Cemetery, in Charlottesville, Virginia.

== Influences ==
McGuffey was Henry Ford&#x27;s favorite author and was always proud of his exposure to McGuffey&#x27;s teachings, which &quot;reinforced an ordered, rigid, and straightforward view of the world where white was white and black was black&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Named for William Holmes McGuffey&#x27;s influential primers that first appeared in 1836 and remained in print until 1921, the McGuffey longevity awards recognize long-lived, still-in-use textbooks of excellence.

<text>Patrick Chamoiseau (; born 3 December 1953) is a French author from Martinique known for his work in the créolité movement. His work spans a variety of forms and genres, including novels, essays, children&#x27;s books, screenplays, theatre and comics. His novel &quot;Texaco&quot; was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1992.

==Biography==
Chamoiseau was born on 3 December 1953 in Fort-de-France, Martinique, where he resides. After he studied law in Paris, France, he returned to Martinique, inspired by Édouard Glissant to take a close interest in Creole culture.

In 1981, Chamoiseau was the co-author, with Georges Puisy, of a historical work on the Antilles under the reign of Napoléon Bonaparte, &quot;Delgrès : les Antilles sous Bonaparte&quot;. In 1989, he was the co-author of &quot;Éloge de la créolité&quot; (&quot;In Praise of Creoleness&quot;) with Jean Bernabé and Raphaël Confiant.

Chamoiseau has received several awards. In 1990, he received the Prix Carbet for &quot;Antan d&#x27;enfance&quot;, the first book in an autobiographical trilogy collectively titled &quot;Une enfance créole.&quot; His 1992 novel &quot;Texaco&quot; has been described as &quot;a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon&#x27;s &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; and Césaire&#x27;s &quot;Return to My Native Land&quot;.&quot; In 1999, Chamoiseau was honoured with a Prince Claus Award for his contribution to Caribbean society.

Chamoiseau&#x27;s writing style has sometimes been compared to that of Louis-Ferdinand Céline, for how they explore the relationship between the written and the oral.

== Writing style and approach ==
=== Masculinity versus femininity ===
The dynamics and relationship between men and women have been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean. The concept of &quot;masculinity&quot; versus &quot;femininity&quot; is a literary theme indicative of Caribbean literature. Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works. However, as there are a larger number of male writers that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven and takes the &quot;masculinist&quot; perspective.

Chamoiseau has often been criticized as a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Créolité movement in the Antilles archipelago. The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers. The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than on the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. 

However, his literary work in the children&#x27;s story &quot;Kosto et ses deux enfants&quot; (from &quot;Émerveilles&quot;) is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature. The representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; in the story, this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure.&quot;&quot;

=== &quot;Créolité&quot; ===
A question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is: &quot;What does it mean to be Caribbean?&quot; This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is &quot;Creoleness&quot;. Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers. This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of &quot;Americanness&quot; in that it existed prior to America, and that &quot;Americanness&quot; excludes it interaction with the indigenous population. 

This relates to Patrick Chamoiseau&#x27;s writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness. &quot;Creole Folktales&quot; is a prime example from his works. The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral. Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.

<text>According to the Book of Judges, Deborah (, &quot;Dəḇōrā&quot;) was a prophetess of Judaism, the fourth Judge of pre-monarchic Israel, and the only female judge mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. Many scholars contend that the phrase, &quot;a woman of Lappidoth&quot;, as translated from biblical Hebrew in Judges 4:4 denotes her marital status as the wife of Lapidoth. Alternatively, &quot;lappid&quot; translates as &quot;torch&quot; or &quot;lightning&quot;, therefore the phrase, &quot;woman of Lappidoth&quot; could be referencing Deborah as a &quot;fiery woman.&quot; Deborah told Barak, an Israelite general from Kedesh in Naphtali, that God commanded him to lead an attack against the forces of Jabin king of Canaan and his military commander Sisera (Judges 4:6–7); the entire narrative is recounted in chapter 4.

Judges 5 gives the same story in poetic form. This passage, often called &quot;The Song of Deborah&quot;, may date to as early as the twelfth century BCE, and is perhaps the earliest sample of Hebrew poetry.

==Bible narrative==

In the Book of Judges, it is stated that Deborah was a prophetess, a judge of Israel and the wife of Lapidoth. She rendered her judgments beneath a date palm tree between Ramah in Benjamin and Bethel in the land of Ephraim.

The people of Israel had been oppressed by Jabin, the king of Canaan, whose capital was Hazor, for twenty years. Stirred by the wretched condition of Israel she sends a message to Barak, the son of Abinoam, at Kedesh in Naphtali, and tells him that the Lord God had commanded him to muster ten thousand troops of Naphtali and Zebulun and concentrate them upon Mount Tabor, the mountain at the northern angle of the great plain of Esdraelon. At the same time she states that the Lord God of Israel will draw Sisera, commander of Jabin&#x27;s army, to the Kishon River. Barak declines to go without the prophet. Deborah consents, but declares that the glory of the victory will therefore belong to a woman. As soon as the news of the rebellion reaches Sisera, he collects nine hundred chariots of iron and a host of people.

Then Deborah said, according to :

As Deborah prophesied, a battle is fought (led by Barak), and Sisera is completely defeated. He escapes on foot while his army is pursued as far as Harosheth Haggoyim and destroyed. Sisera comes to the tent of Jael and lies down to rest. He asks for a drink, she gives him milk and he falls asleep. While he is asleep she hammers a tent-pin through his temple.

The Biblical account of Deborah ends with the statement that after the battle, there was peace in the land for 40 years ().

===The Song of Deborah===
The Song of Deborah is found in Judges 5:2–31 and is a victory hymn, sung by Deborah and Barak, about the defeat of Canaanite adversaries by some of the tribes of Israel. The song itself differs slightly from the events described in Judges 4. The song mentions six participating tribes: Ephraim, Benjamin, Machir—a group associated with the Tribe of Manasseh—Zebulun, Issachar and Naphtali, as opposed to the two tribes in Judges 4:6 (Naphtali and Zebulun) and does not mention the role of Jabin (king of Hazor). The song also rebukes three other tribes (Reuben, Dan, and Asher) for their lack of patriotism, not mentioning the tribes of Gad, Simeon and Judah. Michael Coogan writes that for the redactors of the Song of Deborah, that the Canaanite general Sisera ends up being murdered by a woman (Jael)—the ultimate degradation—&quot;is a further sign that Yahweh ultimately is responsible for the victory&quot;.

Though the presence of victory hymns is conventional in the Hebrew Bible, the Song of Deborah is unusual in that it is a hymn that celebrates a military victory of two women: Deborah, the prophetess and Jael, the warrior. Jael—the heroine of the Song of Deborah—shares parallels with the main character of the Book of Judith, who uses her beauty and charm to kill an Assyrian general who has besieged her city, Bethulia.

The Song of Deborah is commonly identified as among the oldest texts of the Bible, but the date of its composition is controversial. Many scholars claim a date as early as the 12th century BCE, while others claim it to be as late as the 3rd century BCE. Some hold that the song was written no earlier than the 7th century BCE.

==Traditional chronology==
Traditional Jewish chronology places Deborah&#x27;s 40 years of judging Israel () from 1107 BC until her death in 1067 BC. The &quot;Dictionary of World Biography: The Ancient World&quot; claims that she might have lived in the period between 1200 BC to 1124 BC. Based on archaeological findings, different biblical scholars have argued that Deborah&#x27;s war with Sisera best fits the context of either the second half of the 12th century BC or the second half of the 11th century BC. Sisera is a non-Semitic name, and the story is set &quot;in the days of Shamgar,&quot; a hero famous for killing 600 Philistines. Many scholars, such as Łukasz Niesiołowski-Spanò, believes the story is really about the Sea Peoples. One archaeological stratum of Hazor dating from around 1200 BCE shows signs of catastrophic fire.

Some scholars like Israel Finkelstein, who associated first monarchy of Israel with Gibeon-Gibeah polity of the early to mid 10th century BC, placed the background of the Song of Deborah in the early 10th century BC associating with the Late Iron Age I (c. 1050–950 BCE) destruction of Megiddo, which dates to c. 1000-985 BCE. However, this is not a mainstream idea.

<doc id="398002" wikidata="Q1938083" url="?curid=398002" title="Nothing Gold Can Stay (album)">
<text>Nothing Gold Can Stay is the debut studio album by American rock band New Found Glory, released on May 1, 1999, through independent record label Eulogy Recordings. At the time, the band was then named &quot;A New Found Glory&quot;, but later dropped the indefinite article &quot;A&quot; due to some fans struggling to find their records in stores. The original pressings of the album contained samplings from several films including &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983), &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985), and &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; (1996), as well as Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;, after which the album is named.

On the strength of the release, Richard Reines, co-founder of Drive-Thru Records, signed the band after paying Eulogy a $5,000 license fee in order to re-release the album on October 19, 1999. Propelled by debut single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; sold in excess of 300,000 copies. The record was responsible for breaking the band in the United States and has been noted for its influence on contemporary pop punk music.

==Background and recording==
Following the band&#x27;s underground success with the release of debut EP &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Girls&quot; (1997), they soon caught the attention of independent label Eulogy Recordings, and the quintet subsequently signed in order to increase distribution of their music. The album was recorded on a low budget with the members having to self-fund the sessions. Jordan Pundik recalls, &quot;I was working in Walgreens, I remember borrowing money off my sister to pay for the recording and everybody getting on me for not throwing in enough.&quot; Chad Gilbert also said that the album &quot;wasn&#x27;t recorded too well&quot;, but also praised its rawness by adding, &quot;It sounds more real than a lot of other records&quot;. Pundik worked alongside primary lyricist and rhythm guitarist Steve Klein to pen the tracks. &quot;When me and Steve would work on the songs, he&#x27;d come and pick me up in his punk-rock station wagon, with stickers all over the back. It didn&#x27;t have a stereo, just a boombox. We&#x27;d sit in his room at his parents&#x27; house, and we&#x27;d work on lyrics and melodies with sheets of paper everywhere&quot;. Pundik also said that a five-year relationship during high school inspired the lyrics to &quot;Winter of &#x27;95&quot;. &quot;I was with her for 5 years, she was the only thing I knew, so that played a big part. I remember listening to a Gameface record on vinyl, but was writing my own lyrics for the song at the same time in my head&quot;. Gilbert reflects on the album as &quot;100 percent, without a doubt, the most honest, simple, pure record. We were just a bunch of kids who grew up in the suburbs. We never expected to leave Florida, we were just making a record we could play locally and sell to friends. Then, eventually, it took us so many other places&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

Upon release in 1999, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; received positive reviews. Mike DaRonco of AllMusic gave the album a positive four star review. He wrote, &quot;With an abundance of Lifetime/Promise Ring rip-off bands crawling out from under every suburban nook and cranny, A New Found Glory pull out all the right hooks and harmonies. Reminiscing about the days of walking to the beach, holding hands with a loved one and loudly singing Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. But, they&#x27;re also about trying to pick up the pieces of a shattered relationship by writing a song about it. Just sit back, listen, and relate to their heartfelt days of love lost and found.&quot; Michael Dabaie of &quot;College Music Journal&quot; awarded the album a &quot;super&quot; four-star rating. Describing the sound as &quot;abrasive yet extremely catchy&quot; he also opined that the album was &quot;pop-punk with substance and a stiff backbone.&quot;

A decade after the album&#x27;s release, Brendan Manley of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; covered the album in two separate articles for the magazine. Discussing the album in the &quot;10 Classic Albums of &#x27;99&quot; feature, he wrote, &quot;Like its title implies, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; is the sonic transcript of a glorious, fleeting time for NFG, and for pop-punk. But just as gold never loses its luster, it&#x27;s only fitting that 10 years later, &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; still shines&quot;. Later, during a separate article covering the band&#x27;s history, Manley noted their lasting influence on modern pop-punk music; &quot;New Found Glory are still at the forefront of the scene they helped create&quot;. Gabe Saporta of Midtown also said of &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;; &quot;The record has so many little quirks - so many things that made you feel like [NFG] were friends of yours, who were fucking around in the studio and happened to create something magical&quot;. Also, when Jared Logan was producing Fall Out Boy&#x27;s debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by &quot;handing over the first two New Found Glory records&quot;.

<text>Thomas Michael Glavine (born March 25, 1966) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball, for the Atlanta Braves (1987–2002, 2008) and New York Mets (2003–2007).

With 164 victories during the 1990s, Glavine earned the second-highest number of wins as a pitcher in the National League, second only to teammate Greg Maddux&#x27;s 176. He was a five-time 20-game winner and two-time Cy Young Award winner, and one of only 24 pitchers (and just six left-handers) in major league history to earn 300 career wins. He was the Most Valuable Player of the 1995 World Series as the Braves beat the Cleveland Indians.

In 2014, Glavine was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving 91.9% of the votes cast.

==Early years==
Glavine was born in Concord, Massachusetts, and raised in Billerica, Massachusetts. Glavine attended Billerica Memorial High School, where he was an excellent student and a letterman in ice hockey as well as baseball. He was a four-year member of the honor roll and the National Honor Society. In hockey, he scored 47 goals and 47 assists in 23 high school games, and as a senior, he was named the Merrimack Valley&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. In baseball, he led his team to the Division I North Title and the Eastern Massachusetts Championship as a senior. He graduated from high school in 1984 with honors. Glavine was elected to the Billerica Memorial/Howe High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Professional career==
Glavine was drafted by both the Los Angeles Kings in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft (in the fourth round, 69th overall—two rounds ahead of future National Hockey League star Brett Hull and five rounds ahead of Luc Robitaille, both 2009 Hockey Hall of Fame inductees), and the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball organization in the second round of the 1984 amateur baseball draft. Glavine elected to play baseball and made his major league debut on August 17, 1987.

===Atlanta Braves (1987–2002)===

Glavine had mixed results during his first four seasons in the majors, compiling a 33–43 record from 1987 to 1990, including a 17-loss performance in 1988. His fortunes turned around in 1991, when he won 20 games and posted a 2.55 earned run average. It was his first of three consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins, and saw him earn his first National League Cy Young Award. Glavine was the ace of the 1991 Braves&#x27; starting rotation that included Steve Avery, Charlie Leibrandt, and another future NL Cy Young Award winner and Hall of Fame inductee, John Smoltz. His season helped ensure a dramatic reversal in the Braves&#x27; competitive fortunes as they won the National League pennant and earned a trip to the World Series, though they lost to the Minnesota Twins in seven games. In an era of the diminishing 20-game winner (there were none in the majors in 2006 and 2009), Glavine became the last major league pitcher to win 20 games in three straight years (1991–1993).

Atlanta, long thought of as a perennial cellar dweller, was lifted in the 1990s into one of the most successful franchises in the game on the strength of its stellar pitching staff and solid hitting. After the Braves signed free-agent Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs in 1993, Glavine, Maddux, and Smoltz formed one of the best pitching rotations in baseball history. Among them, they won seven Cy Young Awards during the period of 1991 to 1998. Glavine won his second Cy Young Award in 1998, going 20–6 with a 2.47 ERA. Years later, after Glavine joined the Mets and Maddux played for the San Diego Padres, the three (along with Smoltz who still pitched for Atlanta) all recorded wins on the same day, June 27, 2007. The Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in six games in the 1995 World Series, and Glavine was named the Series MVP. He won two games during that series: Game 2 and Game 6. In Game 6, he pitched eight innings of one-hit shutout baseball.

In addition to the championship won with the Braves in 1995, he pitched in four other World Series with the team (in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1999) when the Braves lost to the Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays, and New York Yankees twice, respectively.

===New York Mets (2003–2007)===
In 2003, Glavine left Atlanta to play for the rival New York Mets, signing a four-year, $42.5 million deal. Glavine&#x27;s performance had slumped in the second half of 2002 and he was ineffective in his two postseason starts, so Atlanta refused to guarantee a third year on his contract. Glavine struggled in his first year as a Met. For the first time since 1988, he failed to win 10 games, also posting his first losing record in that span, 9–14. He also allowed his first career grand slam, hit by José Vidro of the Expos on September 19. Glavine did get to enjoy a personal highlight at the end of the season, however, when the Mets called up his brother Mike to join the team.

Glavine began 2004 well, highlighted by a May 23 one-hit shutout of the Colorado Rockies and selection to the National League All-Star team. However, he struggled again during a second half marred by losing front teeth in a car accident while riding in a taxicab. He went on to post a slightly better record, though still a losing one, going 11–14. He started off 2005 slowly, but rebounded after advice from pitching coach Rick Peterson, who encouraged Glavine to begin pitching inside more often (including a change-up in) and incorporate a curveball in his repertoire. Glavine&#x27;s turnaround helped him earn National League Pitcher of the Month in September. He finished the season with a 13–13 record and a respectable 3.53 ERA.

The Mets&#x27; faith in Glavine was rewarded when he returned to his old form during the 2006 season. He finished one victory shy of the NL lead in wins and was selected to the All-Star team. That season Tom Glavine became the first Mets left-hander in nearly 30 years to start at least thirty games in four consecutive seasons. Glavine and the Mets got a scare in August 2006. His pitching shoulder was tested for a blood clot because he was suffering from coldness in his left ring finger. This was originally thought to be a symptom of Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome, which had been diagnosed in 1990. According to the pitcher, &quot;Doctors... picked something up when they did the ultrasound.&quot; The results of that new test showed the problem could be treated with medicine, and Glavine resumed pitching on September 1, against the Houston Astros.

Glavine finished the 2006 season with a fine 15–7 record and a 3.82 ERA, as the Mets won the National League Eastern Division, allowing him to make his first playoff appearance since leaving the Braves. He started Game 2 of the Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching six shutout innings and surrendering only four hits to pick up the win, as the Mets went on to sweep the series from the Dodgers. He then started Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching seven shutout innings to pick up the win, helped by Carlos Beltrán&#x27;s two-run home run. Glavine&#x27;s postseason scoreless innings streak ended in his next start. He suffered the loss in Game 5 while the Mets went on to drop the series to the Cardinals in seven games.

Glavine re-signed with the Mets for the 2007 season, needing only 10 wins to reach 300 wins for his career. He started his fourth Opening Day game as a Met in the 2007 season.

On August 5, 2007, Glavine won his 300th game, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on ESPN&#x27;s Sunday Night Baseball. In the game, he also was 1 for 2 with a run batted in and a walk. He pitched innings and won 8–3, bringing his lifetime record to 300–197. Glavine is the 23rd pitcher to win 300 games, and the fifth left-handed pitcher to do so, joining Eddie Plank, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Steve Carlton. (Randy Johnson won his 300th game on June 4, 2009, becoming the 24th pitcher and 6th left-hander to do so.)

On September 30, 2007, Glavine started the final game of the Mets&#x27; 2007 regular season against the Florida Marlins. The Mets, tied with the Philadelphia Phillies after having squandered a seven-game lead over the prior sixteen games, needed a win to either win the division or force a playoff game with the Phillies for the division. Glavine made one of the worst starts of his career, allowing seven runs while recording only one out, and the Mets were eliminated from playoff contention with an 8–1 loss.

Glavine declined a one-year, $13 million contract option for the 2008 season with the Mets on October 5, 2007, ending his tenure with the team. However, he did collect a $3 million buyout when he declined the $13 million option.

===Return to Atlanta Braves (2008) and retirement===
On November 18, 2007, Glavine rejoined the Braves, seemingly bringing his career full circle, with a one-year contract worth $8 million. On April 18, 2008, Glavine was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his 22-year career.

On May 14, 2008, Glavine won his first game with the Atlanta Braves since September 19, 2002. This was also his 304th win, and it occurred while the Atlanta Braves were playing against the Philadelphia Phillies. Coincidentally, both his win on September 19, 2002, and May 14, 2008, were against the Phillies.

On August 14, 2008, Glavine appeared in his final game. He started against the Chicago Cubs, and he gave up seven runs in only four innings. A few days later, he was placed on the disabled list because of a recurring shoulder injury.

On February 19, 2009, Glavine agreed to return to Atlanta by signing a $1 million, one-year contract that included another $3.5 million in possible bonuses based on roster time. However, the Braves released Glavine on June 3, 2009, as he was completing his rehab assignment. On June 20, Glavine announced he would not pitch for the rest of the season. On February 11, 2010, he officially retired from the sport, having strongly hinted at that decision throughout the prior few months.

On the date of his retirement, Glavine agreed to take a job as a special assistant to Braves president John Schuerholz starting in the 2010 season. He was a guest analyst for some Braves games for several seasons. Following the death of his father in 2021, Glavine announced that he would be taking a break from broadcasting during the 2022 season. He returned to the broadcast booth in a part-time role in 2023.

The Braves retired Glavine&#x27;s #47 on August 6, 2010.

On July 29, 2021, Glavine was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Board of Directors.

==Pitching style==

Glavine, a left-hander, gradually lost velocity over the latter part of his career. Even at the end of his career, he was an effective starting pitcher in the National League due to his excellent control and deception, changing speeds, and locating pitches off the outside corner of the strike zone. His most common approach was to begin by locating his circle changeup off the outside corner, then follow with alternating fastballs and changeups to confuse the hitter. While batters frequently made contact with his pitches, the substantial movement he placed on them made drives very soft, resulting in easily fielded ground balls and fly outs. Glavine&#x27;s consistency was also highlighted by his durability; beginning with his first full year, in 1988, he started at least 25 games every season and was never placed on the disabled list until his final season—at age 42. In addition to his excellent changeup and well-controlled fastball, Glavine had a plus-curve ball, a slider, and a tailing two-seam fastball. Despite being a left-handed pitcher, Glavine was often more effective against right-handed batters. Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully noted that this attribute was likely due to Glavine pitching from the extreme right edge of the pitching rubber.

Like longtime Atlanta teammates Greg Maddux and John Smoltz, Glavine was one of the better-hitting pitchers of his generation. He had a career .186 batting average—decent for a modern pitcher—and hit over .200 in nine seasons, with a career-best of .289 in 1996. He had a good eye, drawing a high number of walks (for a pitcher), which, combined with his hits, gave him a career on-base percentage of .244. Because Glavine got on base almost a quarter of the time he came at bat, opposing pitchers were never able to treat him as an automatic out in the lineup. In 2004, Glavine walked as often as he struck out (10 times each). Glavine&#x27;s 201 sacrifice bunts prior to 2007 ranked second among active players at the time, only behind Omar Vizquel. Glavine won four Silver Slugger Awards, ranking him second all-time for pitchers behind Mike Hampton, while being the most among Cy Young Award Winners and Hall of Famer pitchers.

==Players&#x27; union representative==
Starting in 1991, Tom Glavine served as the Atlanta Braves team representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association, succeeding former NL Most Valuable Player and Braves icon Dale Murphy in the position. Prior to and during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Tom Glavine was heavily involved in negotiations between the union and team owners and was frequently interviewed and quoted in the press about the talks. Ultimately, the strike caused the cancellation of the 1994 World Series and lasted months. When play resumed in 1995, Glavine was frequently booed by Braves fans for his role in the players&#x27; union and was criticized for it in the local Atlanta press.

==Personal life==
Glavine and his wife Christine married in 1998 and have a blended family of five children. One of their sons, Peyton, was selected in the 2017 MLB draft but chose to play at Auburn University. He currently pitches in the Washington Nationals organization. They live in Johns Creek, Georgia, and Glavine coaches his sons&#x27; hockey teams. Glavine is a Roman Catholic and is a member of Catholic Athletes for Christ.

Glavine is known for being humble about his accomplishments and an avid golfer, so a good friend, Jack Kennedy, gifted Glavine six dozen golf balls that display his uniform number, 47, on one side and the number of losses he had in his career on the other, 203. The gift was given around the time Glavine received the phone call that he would be a first-ballot Hall of Fame inductee.

<text>Essaouira ( ; ), known until the 1960s as Mogador (, or ), is a port city in the western Moroccan region of Marrakesh-Safi, on the Atlantic coast. It has 77,966 inhabitants as of 2014.

The foundation of the city of Essaouira was the work of the Moroccan &#x27;Alawid sultan Mohammed bin Abdallah, who made an original experiment by entrusting it to several architects in 1760, in particular Théodore Cornut and Ahmed al-Inglizi, who designed the city using French captives from the failed French expedition to Larache in 1765, and with the mission of building a city adapted to the needs of foreign merchants. Once built, it continued to grow and experienced a golden age and exceptional development, becoming the country&#x27;s most important commercial port but also its diplomatic capital between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century.

Medina of Essaouira was designated by the UNESCO a World Heritage Site in 2001.

== Name and etymology ==
The name of the city is usually spelled &quot;Essaouira&quot; in Latin script, and in Arabic script. Both spellings represent its name in Moroccan Arabic, &quot;aṣ-Ṣwiṛa&quot;. This is the diminutive (with definite article) of the noun &quot;ṣuṛ&quot; which means &quot;wall (as round a yard, city), rampart&quot;. The pronunciation with pharyngealized /sˁ/ and /rˁ/ is a typically Moroccan development. In Classical Arabic, the noun is &quot;sūr&quot; (, with plain /s/ and /r/), diminutive &quot;suwayrah&quot; (); this is the only form cited in all dictionaries of Classical Arabic. Hence, the spelling of the name in Arabic script according to the classical pronunciation is &quot;al-Suwayrah&quot; (with &quot;sīn&quot; not &quot;ṣād&quot;).

Until the 1960s, Essaouira was generally known by its Portuguese name, &quot;Mogador&quot;. This name is probably a corruption of &quot;Amegdul&quot; (), which was mentioned by the 11th-century geographer al-Bakrī. The name &quot;Mogador&quot; originated from the Phoenician word &quot;Migdol&quot;, meaning &#x27;small fortress&#x27;.

==History==
Archaeological research shows that Essaouira has been occupied since prehistoric times. The bay at Essaouira is partially sheltered by the island of Mogador, making it a peaceful harbor protected against strong marine winds.

===Antiquity===
Essaouira has long been considered one of the best anchorages of the Moroccan coast. The Carthaginian navigator Hanno visited in the 5th century BCE and established the trading post of Arambys.

Around the end of the 1st century BCE or early 1st century CE, the Berber king of Mauretania Juba II established a Tyrian purple factory, processing the murex and purpura shells found in the intertidal rocks at Essaouira and the Iles Purpuraires. This dye colored the purple stripe in the togas worn by the Senators of Imperial Rome.

A Roman villa was excavated on Mogador island. A Roman vase was found as well as coinage from the 3rd century CE. Most of the artifacts are now visible in the Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah Museum and the Rabat Archaeological Museum.

===Early modern period===

During the Middle Ages, a Muslim saint named Sidi Mogdoul was buried in Essaouira, probably giving its origin to the name &quot;Mogador&quot;.

====Portuguese establishment (1506–1510)====

In 1506, the king of Portugal, D. Manuel I, ordered a fortress to be built there, named Castelo Real de Mogador. Altogether, the Portuguese are documented to have seized six Moroccan towns and built six stand-alone fortresses on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, between the river Loukos in the north and the river of Sous in the south. Four of them only had a short duration: Graciosa (1489), São João da Mamora (1515), Castelo Real of Mogador (1506–10) and Aguz (1520–25). Two became permanent urban settlements: Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gué (modern Agadir, founded in 1505–06), and Mazagan, founded in 1514–17. Following the 1541 Fall of Agadir, the Portuguese had to abandon most of their settlements between 1541 and 1550, although they were able to keep Ceuta, Tangier and Mazagan.

The fortress of Castelo Real of Mogador fell to the local resistance of the Regraga fraternity four years after its establishment, in 1510.
During the 16th century, powers including Spain, England, the Netherlands and France tried in vain to conquer the locality. Essaouira remained a haven for the export of sugar and molasses and as an anchorage for pirates.

====De Razilly expedition (1629)====

France was involved in an early attempt to colonize Mogador in 1629. As Richelieu and Père Joseph were attempting to establish a colonial policy, Admiral Isaac de Razilly suggested they occupy Mogador in 1626, which he had reconnoitered in 1619. The objective was to create a base against the Sultan of Morocco and asphyxiate the harbour of Safi.

He departed for Salé on 20 July 1629 with a fleet composed of the ships &quot;Licorne&quot;, &quot;Saint-Louis&quot;, &quot;Griffon&quot;, &quot;Catherine&quot;, &quot;Hambourg&quot;, &quot;Sainte-Anne&quot;, &quot;Saint-Jean&quot;. He bombarded the city of Salé, destroyed three corsair ships, and then sent the &quot;Griffon&quot; under Captain Treillebois to Mogador. The men of Razilly saw the fortress of Castelo Real in Mogador and landed 100 men with wood and supplies on Mogador island, with the agreement of Richelieu. After a few days, however, the &quot;Griffon&quot; reembarked the colonists and departed to rejoin the fleet in Salé.

After these expeditions, France signed a treaty with Abd el-Malek II in 1631, giving France preferential treatment, known as &quot;capitulations&quot;: preferential tariffs, the establishment of a Consulate, and freedom of religion for French subjects.

===Foundation of modern Essaouira (1760–1770)===
The present city of Essaouira was built during the mid-eighteenth century by the Moroccan King. Mohammed III tried to reorient his kingdom toward the Atlantic for increased exchanges with European powers, choosing Mogador as his key location. One of his objectives was to establish a harbour at the closest possible point to Marrakesh. The other was to cut off trade from Agadir in the south, which had been favouring a political rival of Mohammed III, and the inhabitants of Agadir were forced to relocate to Essaouira.

For 12 years, Mohammed III directed a French engineer, Théodore Cornut, and several other Moroccan and European architects and technicians to build the fortress and city along modern lines. Originally called &quot;Souira&quot; (&quot;the small fortress&quot;), the name became &quot;Es-Saouira&quot; (&quot;the beautifully designed&quot;).

Thédore Cornut designed and built the city itself, particularly the Kasbah area, corresponding to the royal quarters and the buildings for Christian merchants and diplomats. Other parts were built by other architects, including Moroccan architects especially from Fez, Marrakesh, and Rabat. The harbour entrance, with the &quot;Porte de la Marine&quot;, was built by an English renegade by the name of Ahmed el Inglizi (&quot;Ahmed the English&quot;) or Ahmed El Alj (&quot;Ahmed the Renegade&quot;). Mohammed III took numerous steps to encourage the development of Essaouira including closing off the harbour of Agadir to the south in 1767 so that southern trade could be redirected through Essaouira. European communities in the northern harbour of Rabat-Salé were ordered to move to Essaouira through an ordinance of 21 January 1765.

From the time of its rebuilding by Muhammad III until the end of the nineteenth century, Essaouira served as Morocco&#x27;s principal port, offering the goods of the caravan trade to the world. The route brought goods from sub-Saharan Africa to Timbuktu, then through the desert and over the Atlas Mountains to Marrakesh. The road from Marrakesh to Essaouira is a straight line, explaining the king&#x27;s choice of this port among the many others along the Moroccan coast.

===Jewish presence===
Mohammed III encouraged Moroccan Jews to settle in the town and handle the trade with Europe. Jews once comprised the majority of the population, and the Jewish quarter (or mellah) contains many old synagogues. The town also has a large Jewish cemetery. The city flourished until the caravan trade died, superseded by direct European shipping trade with sub-Saharan Africa. Changes in trade, the founding of Israel, the resulting wars with Arab states, and the independence of Morocco all resulted in Sephardic Jews leaving the country. As of 2017, Essaouira had only three Jewish inhabitants. On 15 January 2020, King Mohammed VI visited Bayt Dakira, a Jewish heritage house, in Essaouira.

===European trade and diplomacy===
In the 19th century, Essaouira became the first seaport of Morocco, with trade volumes about double those of Rabat. The city functioned as the harbour for Marrakesh, as it was only a few days from the inland city. Diplomatic and trade representations were established by European powers in Essouira. In the 1820s, European diplomats were concentrated in either Tangier or Essaouira.

===French interventions and Protectorate===

Following Morocco&#x27;s alliance with Algeria&#x27;s Abd-El-Kader against France, Essaouira was bombarded and briefly occupied by the French Navy under the Prince de Joinville on 16 August 1844, in the Bombardment of Mogador, an important battle of the First Franco-Moroccan War.

From 1912 to 1956, Essaouira was part of the French protectorate of Morocco. Mogador was used as a base for a military expedition against Dar Anflous, when 8,000 French troops were located outside the city under the orders of Generals Franchet d&#x27;Esperey and Brulard. The Kasbah of Dar Anflous was taken on 25 January 1913. In 1930, brothers, Michel and Jean Vieuchange used Essaouira as a base before Michel set off into the Western Sahara to try to find Smara.

France had an important administrative, military and economic presence. Essaouira had a Franco-Moroccan school, still visible in Derb Dharb street. Linguistically, many Moroccans of Essaouira speak French fluently today.

===Recent years===
In the early 1950s film director and actor Orson Welles stayed at the Hotel des Iles just south of the town walls during the filming of his 1952 classic version of &quot;Othello&quot; which contains several memorable scenes shot in the labyrinthine streets and alleyways of the medina. Legend has it that during Welles&#x27; sojourn in the town he met Winston Churchill, another guest at the Hotel des Iles. A bas-relief of Orson Welles is located in a small square just outside the medina walls close to the sea. Several other film directors have utilized Essaouira as a location due to the photogenic and atmospheric qualities.

The town was used in the filming of &quot;The Game of Thrones&quot; as the home of the Army of the Unsullied. The scene of the rows of crucified slaves were props to cover the Portuguese cannons.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Essaouira became something of a hippie hangout.

==Geography==
Essaouira is protected by a natural bay partially shielded from wave action by the Iles Purpuraires. A broad sandy beach extends from the harbour south of Essaourira, at which point the Oued Ksob discharges to the ocean; south of the discharge lies the archaeological ruin, the Bordj El Berod. The Canary Current is responsible for the generally southward movement of ocean circulation and has led to enhancement of the local fishery. The village of Diabat lies about five kilometres () south of Essaouira, immediately south of the Oued Ksob.

Essaouira connects to Safi to the north and to Agadir to the south via the N1 road and to Marrakech to the east via the R 207 road. There is a small airport some away from the town, which schedules several flights a week to Paris-Orly, London-Luton and Brussels-South (Charleroi) and daily to Casablanca.
===Climate===
Essaouira&#x27;s climate is semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk/BSh&quot;), with mild temperatures year round. The gap between highs and lows is small and summers are warm while winters are mild. Annual rainfall is usually . The highest temperature ever recorded in Essaouira was on 18 April 2017. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 29 January 2005. The lowest maximum temperature ever recorded was on 15 February 2018. The highest minimum temperature ever recorded was on 13 October 2017. The maximum amount of precipitation recorded in one day was on 8 March 2013.
==Essaouira today==
The Medina of Essaouira (formerly &quot;Mogador&quot;) is a UNESCO World Heritage listed city, an example of a late 18th-century fortified town, as transferred to North Africa by European colonists. 
===Accommodation===
There are only a handful of modern purpose-built hotels within the walls of the old city. Newer international hotels have been built along the sea front, with local planning regulations restricting buildings to 4 storeys in height. There are also many privately owned riads, also known as &quot;dars&quot;, that may be rented on a daily or weekly basis.

===Activities===

The medina is home to many small arts and crafts businesses, notably cabinet making and &#x27;thuya&#x27; wood-carving (using roots of the Tetraclinis tree), both of which have been practised in Essaouira for centuries.

The fishing harbour, suffering from the competition of Agadir and Safi, remains rather small, although the catches (sardines, conger eels) are surprisingly abundant due to the coastal upwelling generated by the powerful trade winds and the Canaries Current. Essaouira remains one of the major fishing harbours of Morocco. 

Essaouira is also renowned for its kitesurfing and windsurfing, with the powerful trade wind blowing almost constantly onto the protected, almost waveless, bay. Several world-class clubs rent top-notch material on a weekly basis. The township of Sidi Kaouki is located 25 km south of Essaouira and is becoming one of the best locations in Morocco for surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing. There are several businesses in Sidi Kaouki which offer gear rental.

Essaouira is also a center of argan oil production. It has become a tourist attraction due to the tree-climbing goats who are unique to the region, as argan trees are the only type the goats climb.

==Education==

There is a French international school in Essaouira, Groupe scolaire Eric-Tabarly.

==Culture==
Since 1998, the Gnaoua Festival of World Music is held in Essaouira, normally in the last week of June. It brings together artists from all over the world. Although focused on gnaoua music, it includes rock, jazz and reggae. Known as the &quot;Moroccan Woodstock&quot; it lasts four days and attracts around 450,000 spectators annually.

<doc id="398028" wikidata="Q592503" url="?curid=398028" title="Night (memoir)">
<text>Night is a 1960 memoir by Elie Wiesel based on his Holocaust experiences with his father in the Nazi German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944–1945, toward the end of the Second World War in Europe. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about his loss of faith and increasing disgust with humanity, recounting his experiences from the Nazi-established ghettos in his hometown of Sighet, Romania, to his migration through multiple concentration camps. The typical parent–child relationship is inverted as his father dwindled in the camps to a helpless state while Wiesel himself became his teenaged caregiver. His father died in January 1945, taken to the crematory after deteriorating from dysentery and a beating while Wiesel lay silently on the bunk above him for fear of being beaten too. The memoir ends shortly after the United States Army liberated Buchenwald in April 1945. 

After the war, Wiesel moved to Paris and in 1954 completed an 862-page manuscript in Yiddish about his experiences, published in Argentina as the 245-page &quot;Un di velt hot geshvign&quot; (&quot;And the World Remained Silent&quot;). The novelist François Mauriac helped him find a French publisher. Les Éditions de Minuit published 178 pages as &quot;La Nuit&quot; in 1958, and in 1960 Hill &amp; Wang in New York published a 116-page translation as &quot;Night&quot;.

Translated into 30 languages, the book ranks as one of the cornerstones of Holocaust literature. It remains unclear how much of &quot;Night&quot; is memoir. Wiesel called it his deposition, but scholars have had difficulty approaching it as an unvarnished account. The literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that the pruning of the text from Yiddish to French transformed an angry historical account into a work of art.

&quot;Night&quot; is the first in a trilogy—&quot;Night&quot;, &quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Day&quot;—marking Wiesel&#x27;s transition during and after the Holocaust from darkness to light, according to the Jewish tradition of beginning a new day at nightfall. &quot;In &quot;Night&quot;,&quot; he said, &quot;I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end—man, history, literature, religion, God. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with night.&quot;

==Background==

Elie Wiesel was born on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian mountains of northern Transylvania (now Romania), to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah (née Feig). The family lived in a community of 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses at the beginning of the book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.

That changed at midnight on Saturday, 18 March 1944, with the invasion of Hungary by Nazi Germany, and the arrival in Budapest of SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann to oversee the deportation of the country&#x27;s Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. From 5 April, Jews over the age of six had to wear a 10 x 10 cm (3.8 x 3.8 in) yellow badge on the upper-left side of their coats or jackets. Jews had to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors could no longer be published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked.

As the Allies prepared for the liberation of Europe, the mass deportations began at a rate of four trains a day from Hungary to Auschwitz, each train carrying around 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian Jews are recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival. The transports comprised most of the Jewish population outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital.

Between 16 May and 27 June, 131,641 Jews were deported from northern Transylvania. Wiesel, his parents and sisters—older sisters Hilda and Beatrice and seven-year-old Tzipora—were among them. On arrival Jews were &quot;selected&quot; for the death or forced labour; to be sent to the left meant work, to the right, the gas chamber. Sarah and Tzipora were sent to the gas chamber. Hilda and Beatrice survived, separated from the rest of the family. Wiesel and Chlomo managed to stay together, surviving forced labour and a death march to another concentration camp, Buchenwald, near Weimar. Chlomo died there in January 1945, three months before the 6th Armored Division of the United States Army arrived to liberate the camp.

==Synopsis==
===Moshe the Beadle===

&quot;Night&quot; opens in Sighet in 1941. The book&#x27;s narrator is Eliezer, an Orthodox Jewish teenager who studies the Talmud by day, and by night &quot;weep[s] over the destruction of the Temple&quot;. To the disapproval of his father, Eliezer spends time discussing the Kabbalah with Moshe the Beadle, caretaker of the Hasidic shtiebel (house of prayer).

In June 1941 the Hungarian government expelled Jews unable to prove their citizenship. Moshe is crammed onto a cattle train and taken to Poland. He manages to escape, saved by God, he believes, so that he might save the Jews of Sighet. He returns to the village to tell what he calls the &quot;story of his own death&quot;, running from one house to the next: &quot;Jews, listen to me! It&#x27;s all I ask of you. No money. No pity. Just listen to me!&quot;

When the train crossed into Poland, he tells them, it was taken over by the Gestapo, the German secret police. The Jews were transferred to trucks, then driven to a forest in Galicia, near Kolomay, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen, making Moshe &quot;Night&#x27;s&quot; first unheeded witness.

===Sighet ghettos===

The Germans arrived in Sighet around 21 March 1944, and shortly after Passover (8–14 April that year) arrested the community leaders. Jews had to hand over their valuables, were not allowed to visit restaurants or leave home after six in the evening, and had to wear the yellow star at all times. Eliezer&#x27;s father makes light of it:

The SS transfer the Jews to one of two ghettos, each with its own council or &quot;Judenrat&quot;, which appoints Jewish police; there is also an office for social assistance, a labor committee, and a hygiene department. Eliezer&#x27;s house, on a corner of Serpent Street, is in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family can stay in their home, although the windows on the non-ghetto side have to be boarded up. He is happy at first: &quot;We should no longer have before our eyes those hostile faces, those hate-laden stares. ... The general opinion was that we were going to remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then everything would be as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto—it was illusion.&quot;

In May 1944 the &quot;Judenrat&quot; is told the ghettos will be closed with immediate effect and the residents deported. Eliezer&#x27;s family is moved at first to the smaller ghetto, but they are not told their final destination, only that they may each take a few personal belongings. The Hungarian police, wielding truncheons and rifle butts, march Eliezer&#x27;s neighbours through the streets. &quot;It was from that moment that I began to hate them, and my hate is still the only link between us today.&quot;

===Auschwitz===

Eliezer and his family are among the 80 people crammed into a closed cattle wagon. On the third night one woman, Madame Schächter—&quot;Night&#x27;s&quot; second unheeded witness—starts screaming that she can see flames, until the others beat her. Men and women are separated on arrival at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the extermination camp within the Auschwitz complex. Eliezer and his father are &quot;selected&quot; to go to the left, which meant forced labour; his mother, Hilda, Beatrice and Tzipora to the right, the gas chamber. (Hilda and Beatrice managed to survive.)

The remainder of &quot;Night&quot; describes Eliezer&#x27;s efforts not to be parted from his father, not even to lose sight of him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father&#x27;s decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man&#x27;s caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father&#x27;s existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer&#x27;s need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people.

His loss of faith in human relationships is mirrored in his loss of faith in God. During the first night, as he and his father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children&#x27;s bodies into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence. At that moment he and his father are ordered to go to their barracks. But Eliezer is already destroyed. &quot;[T]he student of the Talmud, the child that I was, had been consumed in the flames. There remained only a shape that looked like me.&quot; There follows a passage that Ellen Fine writes contains the main themes of &quot;Night&quot;—the death of God and innocence, and the &quot;défaite du moi&quot; (dissolution of self), a recurring motif in Holocaust literature:

With the loss of self goes Eliezer&#x27;s sense of time: &quot;I glanced at my father. How he had changed! ... So much had happened within such a few hours that I had lost all sense of time. When had we left our houses? And the ghetto? And the train? Was it only a week? One night – &quot;one single night&quot;?&quot;

===Buna===

In or around August 1944 Eliezer and his father are transferred from Birkenau to the work camp at Monowitz (known as Buna or Auschwitz III), their lives reduced to the avoidance of violence and the search for food. Their only joy is when the Americans bomb the camp. God is not lost to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: &quot;Where is God? Where is he?&quot; Not heavy enough for the weight of his body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.

Fine writes that this is the central event in &quot;Night&quot;, a religious sacrifice—the binding of Isaac and crucifixion of Jesus—described by Alfred Kazin as the literal death of God. Afterwards the inmates celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, but Eliezer cannot take part: &quot;Blessed be God&#x27;s name? Why, but why would I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled ... How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces? ... But now, I no longer pleaded for anything. I was no longer able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused.&quot;

===Death march===

In January 1945, with the Soviet army approaching, the Germans decide to flee, taking 60,000 inmates on a death march to concentration camps in Germany. Eliezer and his father are marched to Gleiwitz to be put on a freight train to Buchenwald, a camp near Weimar, Germany, 350 miles (563 km) from Auschwitz.

Resting in a shed after marching over , Rabbi Eliahou asks if anyone has seen his son. They had stuck together for three years, &quot;always near each other, for suffering, for blows, for the ration of bread, for prayer&quot;, but the rabbi had lost sight of him in the crowd and was now scratching through the snow looking for his son&#x27;s corpse. &quot;&quot;I hadn&#x27;t any strength left for running. And my son didn&#x27;t notice. That&#x27;s all I know&quot;.&quot; Eliezer does not tell the man that his son had indeed noticed his father limping, and had run faster, letting the distance between them grow: &quot;And, in spite of myself, a prayer rose in my heart, to that God in whom I no longer believed. My God, Lord of the Universe, give me strength never to do what Rabbi Eliahou&#x27;s son has done.&quot;

The inmates spend two days and nights in Gleiwitz locked inside cramped barracks without food, water or heat, sleeping on top of one another, so that each morning the living wake with the dead underneath them. There is more marching to the train station and onto a cattle wagon with no roof. They travel for ten days and nights, with only the snow falling on them for water. Of the 100 in Eliezer&#x27;s wagon, 12 survive the journey. The living make space by throwing the dead onto the tracks:

===Buchenwald, liberation===

The Germans are waiting with megaphones and orders to head for a hot bath. Wiesel is desperate for the heat of the water, but his father sinks into the snow. &quot;I could have wept with rage ... I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here ... I yelled against the wind ... I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen.&quot; An alert sounds, the camp lights go out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him.

His father is in another block, sick with dysentery. The other men in his bunk, a Frenchman and a Pole, attack him because he can no longer go outside to relieve himself. Eliezer is unable to protect him. &quot;Another wound to the heart, another hate, another reason for living lost.&quot; Begging for water one night from his bunk, where he has lain for a week, Chlomo is beaten on the head with a truncheon by an SS officer for making too much noise. Eliezer lies in the bunk above and does nothing for fear of being beaten too. He hears his father make a rattling noise, &quot;Eliezer&quot;. In the morning, 29 January 1945, he finds another man in his father&#x27;s place. The Kapos had come before dawn and taken Chlomo to the crematorium.

Chlomo missed his freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were making their way towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is transferred to the children&#x27;s block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and they are to be moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o&#x27;clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army. Wiesel looks at himself in a mirror for the first time since the ghetto and sees only a corpse.

==Writing and publishing==
===Move to France===
Wiesel wanted to move to Palestine after his release, but because of British immigration restrictions was sent instead by the &quot;Oeuvre au Secours aux Enfants&quot; (Children&#x27;s Rescue Service) to Belgium, then Normandy. In Normandy he learned that his two older sisters, Hilda and Beatrice, had survived. From 1947 to 1950 he studied the Talmud, philosophy and literature at the Sorbonne, where he was influenced by the existentialists, attending lectures by Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Buber. He also taught Hebrew, and worked as a translator for the Yiddish weekly &quot;Zion in Kamf&quot;. In 1948, when he was 19, he was sent to Israel as a war correspondent by the French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;arche&quot;, and after the Sorbonne became chief foreign correspondent of the Tel Aviv newspaper &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;.

===1954: &quot;Un di Velt Hot Geshvign&quot;===
Wiesel wrote in 1979 that he kept his story to himself for ten years. In 1954 he wanted to interview the French prime minister, Pierre Mendès-France, and approached the novelist François Mauriac, a friend of Mendès-France, for an introduction. Wiesel wrote that Mauriac kept mentioning Jesus: &quot;Whatever I would ask – Jesus. Finally, I said, &#x27;What about Mendès-France?&#x27; He said that Mendès-France, like Jesus, was suffering ...&quot;

Wiesel started writing on board a ship to Brazil, where he had been assigned to cover Christian missionaries within Jewish communities, and by the end of the journey had completed an 862-page manuscript. He was introduced on the ship to Yehudit Moretzka, a Yiddish singer travelling with Mark Turkov, a publisher of Yiddish texts. Turkov asked if he could read Wiesel&#x27;s manuscript. It is unclear who edited the text for publication. Wiesel wrote in &quot;All Rivers Run to the Sea&quot; (1995) that he handed Turkov his only copy and that it was never returned, but also that he (Wiesel) &quot;cut down the original manuscript from 862 pages to the 245 of the published Yiddish edition.&quot;

Turkov&#x27;s &quot;Tzentral Varband für Polishe Yidn in Argentina&quot; (Central Union of Polish Jews in Argentina) published the book in 1956 in Buenos Aires as the 245-page &quot;Un di velt hot geshvign&quot; (; &quot;And the World Remained Silent&quot;). It was the 117th book in a 176-volume series of Yiddish memoirs of Poland and the war, &quot;Dos poylishe yidntum&quot; (&quot;Polish Jewry&quot;, 1946–1966). Ruth Wisse writes that &quot;Un di Velt Hot Geshvign&quot; stood out from the rest of the series, which survivors wrote as memorials to their dead, as a &quot;highly selective and isolating literary narrative&quot;.

===Unpublished Hebrew manuscript===
In the late 1950s, Wiesel wrote a manuscript that he intended to turn into a special, expanded Hebrew-language version of &quot;Night&quot;. However, before completion, Wiesel places the unfinished text in his archive, later discovered in 2016 by Wiesel&#x27;s friend, Yoel Rappel, a historian and curator of his archive at Boston University.

The archived version included harsh criticisms of Jews who were too optimistic about the future, Jewish leaders who did not speak up, and Wiesel&#x27;s Hungarian neighbors who &quot;joyously watched the Jews&quot; being deported. These were not included in the English-language version later published in 1960.

According to Rappel, this version of &quot;Night&quot; was intended for an Israeli audience, including survivors from Auschwitz and Buchenwald living in Israel.

===1958: &quot;La Nuit&quot;===
Wiesel translated &quot;Un di Velt Hot Geshvign&quot; into French and in 1955 sent it to Mauriac. Even with Mauriac&#x27;s help they had difficulty finding a publisher; Wiesel said they found it too morbid. Jérôme Lindon of Les Éditions de Minuit, Samuel Beckett&#x27;s publisher, agreed to handle it. Lindon edited the text down to 178 pages. Published as &quot;La Nuit&quot;, a title chosen by Lindon, it had a preface by Mauriac and was dedicated to Chlomo, Sarah and Tzipora.

===1960: &quot;Night&quot;===
Wiesel&#x27;s New York agent, Georges Borchardt, encountered the same difficulty finding a publisher in the United States. In 1960 Arthur Wang of Hill &amp; Wang in New York—who Wiesel writes &quot;believed in literature as others believe in God&quot;—paid a $100 pro-forma advance and published that year a 116-page English translation by Stella Rodway as &quot;Night&quot;. The first 18 months saw 1,046 copies sell at $3 each, and it took three years to sell the first print run of 3,000 copies, but the book attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews and meetings with literary figures like Saul Bellow.

By 1997 &quot;Night&quot; was selling 300,000 copies a year in the United States. By 2011 it had sold six million copies in that country, and was available in 30 languages. Sales increased in January 2006 when it was chosen for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club. Republished with a new translation by Marion Wiesel, Wiesel&#x27;s wife, and a new preface by Wiesel, it sat at no. 1 in &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for paperback non-fiction for 18 months from 13 February 2006, until the newspaper removed it when a significant portion of sales were ascribed to educational usage rather than retail sales. It became the club&#x27;s third bestseller to date, with over two million sales of the Book Club edition by May 2011.

==Reception==
Reviewers have had difficulty reading &quot;Night&quot; as an eyewitness account. According to literary scholar Gary Weissman, it has been categorized as a &quot;novel/autobiography&quot;, &quot;autobiographical novel&quot;, &quot;non-fictional novel&quot;, &quot;semi-fictional memoir&quot;, &quot;fictional-autobiographical novel&quot;, &quot;fictionalized autobiographical memoir&quot;, and &quot;memoir-novel&quot;. Ellen Fine described it as &quot;témoignage&quot; (testimony). Wiesel called it his deposition.

Literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that &quot;Night&quot;″s impact stems from its minimalist construction. The 1954 Yiddish manuscript, at 862 pages, was a long and angry historical work. In preparing the Yiddish and then the French editions, Wiesel&#x27;s editors pruned mercilessly. Franklin argues that the power of the narrative was achieved at the cost of literal truth, and that to insist that the work is purely factual is to ignore its literary sophistication. Holocaust scholar Lawrence Langer argues similarly that Wiesel evokes, rather than describes: &quot;Wiesel&#x27;s account is ballasted with the freight of fiction: scenic organization, characterization through dialogue, periodic climaxes, elimination of superfluous or repetitive episodes, and especially an ability to arouse the empathy of his readers, which is an elusive ideal of the writer bound by fidelity to fact.&quot;

Franklin writes that &quot;Night&quot; is the account of the 15-year-old Eliezer, a &quot;semi-fictional construct&quot;, told by the 25-year-old Elie Wiesel. This allows the 15-year-old to tell his story from &quot;the post-Holocaust vantage point&quot; of &quot;Night&#x27;s&quot; readers. In a comparative analysis of the Yiddish and French texts, Naomi Seidman, professor of Jewish culture, concludes that there are two survivors in Wiesel&#x27;s writing, a Yiddish and French. In re-writing rather than simply translating &quot;Un di Velt Hot Geshvign&quot;, Wiesel replaced an angry survivor who regards &quot;testimony as a refutation of what the Nazis did to the Jews,&quot; with one &quot;haunted by death, whose primary complaint is directed against God ...&quot; &quot;Night&quot; transformed the Holocaust into a religious event.

Seidman argues that the Yiddish version was for Jewish readers, who wanted to hear about revenge, but the anger was removed for the largely Christian readership of the French translation. In the Yiddish edition, for example, when Buchenwald was liberated: &quot;Early the next day Jewish boys ran off to Weimar to steal clothing and potatoes. And to rape German &quot;shiksas&quot; [&quot;un tsu fargvaldikn daytshe shikses&quot;]. The historical commandment of revenge was not fulfilled.&quot; In the 1958 French and 1960 English editions, this became: &quot;On the following morning, some of the young men went to Weimar to get some potatoes and clothes—and to sleep with girls [&quot;coucher avec des filles&quot;]. But of revenge, not a sign.&quot;

Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s promotion of &quot;Night&quot; came at a difficult time for the genre of memoir, Franklin writes, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, was found to have fabricated parts of his autobiography, &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; (2003). She argues that Winfrey&#x27;s choice of &quot;Night&quot; may have been intended to restore the book club&#x27;s credibility.

Wiesel wrote in 1967 about a visit to a rebbe (a Hasidic rabbi) who he had not seen for 20 years. The rebbe is upset to learn that Wiesel has become a writer, and wants to know what he writes. &quot;Stories,&quot; Wiesel tells him, &quot; ... true stories&quot;:

<text>Shevchenko ( ; alternative spellings Schevchenko, Ševčenko, Shevcenko, Szewczenko, Chevchenko) is a family name of Ukrainian origin. It is derived from the Ukrainian word &quot;shvets&quot; ( and Czech: &quot;švec&quot;), literally meaning &quot;cobbler or shoemaker&quot;, and the suffix &quot;-enko&quot;, denoting Ukrainian descent. It is somewhat equivalent to occupational surnames: French: Cordonnier, Italian: Crispino, Spanish: Zapatero, German: Schumacher, Schumann, Schubert, and English: Shoemaker, Shoesmith, also Laster.

<text>Plan Dalet (, &quot;Tokhnit dalet&quot; &quot;Plan D&quot;) was a Zionist military plan executed during the 1948 Palestine war for the conquest of territory in Mandatory Palestine in preparation for the establishment of a Jewish state. The plan was the blueprint for Israel&#x27;s military operations starting in March 1948 until the end of the war in early 1949, and so played a central role in the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight known as the Nakba. 

The plan was requested by the Jewish Agency leader and later first prime minister of Israel David Ben-Gurion, and developed by the Haganah and finalized on March 10, 1948. Historians describe Plan Dalet, in which Zionist forces shifted to an offensive strategy, as the beginning of a new phase in the 1948 Palestine war.

The plan was a set of guidelines to take control of Mandatory Palestine, declare a Jewish state, and defend its borders and people, including the Jewish population outside of the borders, &quot;before, and in anticipation of&quot; the invasion by regular Arab armies. Plan Dalet specifically included gaining control of areas wherever Yishuv populations existed, including those outside the borders of the proposed Jewish state.

The plan&#x27;s tactics involved laying siege to Palestinian Arab villages, bombing neighbourhoods of cities, forced expulsion of their inhabitants, and setting fields and houses on fire and detonating TNT in the rubble to prevent any return. Zionist military units possessed detailed lists of neighborhoods and villages to be destroyed and their Arab inhabitants expelled.

This strategy is subject to controversy, with some historians characterizing it as defensive, while others assert that it was an integral part of a planned strategy for the expulsion, sometimes called an ethnic cleansing, of the area&#x27;s native inhabitants.

== Etymology ==
Its name comes from the letter Dalet (ד), the fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, after plans named Aleph (א), Bet (ב), and Gimel (ג) were revised.

==Background==
===Avnir plan===
In the summer of 1937, the commander of their forces in the Tel Aviv area, Elimelech Slikowitz (nicknamed Avnir) received an order from Ben-Gurion, according to the official history of the Haganah. Ben-Gurion, anticipating an eventual British withdrawal from the country after the Peel Report, asked Avnir to prepare a plan for the military conquest of the whole of Palestine. This Avnir Plan provided a blueprint for future plans. The blueprint was refined in subsequent adjustments (A, B, C) before emerging in its final form over a decade later as Plan Dalet.

===Four adjustments===
From 1945 onward, the Haganah designed four general military plans, the implementation of the final version of which eventually led to the creation of Israel and the dispossession of the Palestinians:
* Plan Aleph (Plan A), drawn up in February 1945 to complement the political aim of a unilateral declaration of independence. It was designed to suppress Palestinian Arab resistance to the Zionist takeover of parts of Palestine.
* Plan Bet (Plan B), produced in September 1945, emerged in May 1947 and was designed to replace Plan Aleph in the context of new developments such as Britain&#x27;s submission of the &quot;problem of Palestine&quot; to the United Nations and growing opposition from surrounding Arab states to the Zionist partition plan.
* Plan Gimel (Plan C), also known as &quot;May Plan&quot;, produced in May 1946, emerged in November/December 1947, in the wake of the UN Partition Plan. It was designed to enhance Zionist military and police mobilisation and enable action as needed.
* Plan Dalet (Plan D), of March 1948, is the most noteworthy. Guided by a series of specific operational plans, the broad outlines of which were considered as early as 1944, Plan Dalet was drawn up to expand Jewish-held areas beyond those allocated to the proposed Jewish State in the UN Partition Plan. Its overall objective was to seize as much territory as possible in advance of the termination of the British Mandate—when the Zionist leaders planned to declare their state.

===UN Partition plan===
On November 29, 1947, the United Nations voted to approve the Partition Plan for Palestine for ending the British Mandate and recommending the establishment of an Arab state and a Jewish state. In the immediate aftermath of the UN&#x27;s approval of the Partition plan, the Jewish community expressed joy, while the Arab community expressed discontent. On the day after the vote, a spate of Arab attacks left at least eight Jews dead, one in Tel Aviv by sniper fire, and seven in ambushes on civilian buses that were claimed to be retaliations for a Lehi raid ten days earlier.

From January onward, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention of a number of regiments of the Arab Liberation Army (consisting of volunteers from Arab countries) inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria. Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni came from Egypt with several hundred men of the Army of the Holy War. Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, al-Husayni organised the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem. To counter this, the Yishuv authorities tried to supply the Jews of the city with food by using convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but the operation became more and more impractical as the number of casualties in the relief convoys surged. By March, Al-Hussayni&#x27;s tactic, sometimes called &quot;The War of the Roads&quot;, had paid off. Almost all of Haganah&#x27;s armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and the Haganah had lost more than 100 troops. According to Benny Morris, the situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated Negev and North of Galilee was equally critical. According to Ilan Pappé, in early March, the Yishuv&#x27;s security leadership did not seem to regard the overall situation as particularly troubling, but instead was busy finalising a master plan.

This situation caused the United States to withdraw their support for the Partition plan, thus encouraging the Arab League to believe that the Palestinians, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to partition. The British, meanwhile, decided on 7 February 1948, to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.

==Plan Dalet==
In 1947, David Ben-Gurion reorganised Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Military equipment was procured from stockpiles from the Second World War and from Czechoslovakia and was brought in Operation Balak. There is some disagreement among historians about the precise authors of Plan Dalet. According to some, it was the result of the analysis of Yigael Yadin, at that time the temporary head of the Haganah, after Ben-Gurion invested him with the responsibility to come up with a plan in preparation for the announced intervention of the Arab states. According to Ilan Pappé the plan was conceived by the &quot;consultancy&quot;, a group of about a dozen military and security figures and specialists on Arab affairs, under the guidance of Ben-Gurion. It was finalised and sent to Haganah units in early March 1948. The plan consisted of a general part and operational orders for the brigades, which specified which villages should be targeted and other specific missions. The general section of the plan was also sent to the Yishuv&#x27;s political leaders.

===Text===
The Hebrew text of Plan Dalet was published in 1972 in volume 3, part 3 of &quot;Sefer Toldot Hahaganah&quot; ( History of the Haganah), Appendix 48, pp. 1955-60. An English translation of the text of Plan Dalet was published for the first time as an appendix to Khalidi&#x27;s 1988 reprint of &quot;Plan Dalet: Master Plan for the Conquest of Palestine&quot; in the Journal of Palestine Studies.

===Purpose===
In this plan, the Haganah also started the transformation from an underground organization into a regular army. The reorganization included the formation of brigades and front commands. The stated goals included in addition to the reorganization, gaining control of the areas of the planned Jewish state as well as areas of Jewish settlements outside its borders. The control would be attained by fortifying strongholds in the surrounding areas and roads, conquering Arab villages close to Jewish settlements and occupying British bases and police stations (from which the British were withdrawing).

The introduction of the plan states:
:(a) The objective of this plan is to gain control of the areas of the Hebrew state and defend its borders. It also aims at gaining control of the areas of Jewish settlements and concentrations which are located outside the borders (of the Hebrew state) against regular, semi-regular, and small forces operating from bases outside or inside the state.
:(b) This plan is based on three previous plans:
:# Plan B, September 1945.
:# The May 1946 Plan [this is Plan Gimel]
:# Yehoshua Plan, 1948 [an earlier version of Plan Dalet named after , a Haganah commander killed December 1947] 
:(c) Since these plans were designed to deal with the situation inside the country (the first two plans deal with the first phase of incidents, while the third plan deals with the possibility of invasion by regular armies from the neighboring countries), the aim of Plan D is to fill the gaps in the previous three plans and to make them more suitable for the situation expected to obtain at the end of British rule in the country.
Later on, the plan states:
:f) Generally, the aim of this plan is not an operation of occupation outside the borders of the Hebrew state. However, concerning enemy bases lying directly close to the borders which may be used as springboards for infiltration into the territory of the state, these must be temporarily occupied and searched for hostiles according to the above guidelines, and they must then be incorporated into our defensive system until operations cease.

According to the Israeli chief of military intelligence Yehoshafat Harkabi, Plan Dalet called for the conquest of Arab towns and villages inside and along the borders of the area allocated to the proposed Jewish State in the UN Partition Plan. 

According to David Tal,

:The strategy called for the fortification and stabilization of a continuous Jewish-controlled line within the areas of the designated Jewish State and along its putative borders, and for the harassment of, and interference with, the Arab forces as they moved in. The success of this strategy depended on three elements: &quot;{&#x27;}cleansing{&#x27;}&quot; the area along the Jewish States&#x27;s borders of an Arab presence; fortifying the Jewish settlements along the line of advance of the Arab column; and &quot;{&#x27;}hit-and-run{&#x27;}&quot; raids against the Arab troops as they advanced.

Ilan Pappé distinguishes between the general section of Plan Dalet and the operational orders given to the troops. According to Pappé the general section of the plan, which was distributed to politicians, was misguiding as to the real intentions of the Haganah. The real plan was handed down to the brigade commanders &quot;not as vague guidelines, but as clear-cut operational orders for action&quot;. Along with the general section, &quot;each brigade commander received a list of the villages or neighborhoods that had to be occupied, destroyed, and their inhabitants expelled&quot;.

===Tactics===
The plan section 3, under &quot;(b) Consolidation of Defense Systems and Fortifications&quot; calls for the occupation of police stations, the control of government installations, and the protection of secondary transportation arteries. Part 4 under this heading includes the following controversial paragraphs:

:Mounting operations against enemy population centers located inside or near our defensive system in order to prevent them from being used as bases by an active armed force. These operations can be divided into the following categories:
::Destruction of villages (setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines in the debris), especially those population centers which are difficult to control continuously.
::Mounting search and control operations according to the following guidelines: encirclement of the village and conducting a search inside it. In the event of resistance, the armed force must be destroyed and the population must be expelled outside the borders of the state.
:The villages which are emptied in the manner described above must be included in the fixed defensive system and must be fortified as necessary.
:In the absence of resistance, garrison troops will enter the village and take up positions in it or in locations which enable complete tactical control. The officer in command of the unit will confiscate all weapons, wireless devices, and motor vehicles in the village. In addition, he will detain all politically suspect individuals. After consultation with the [Jewish] political authorities, bodies will be appointed consisting of people from the village to administer the internal affairs of the village. In every region, a [Jewish] person will be appointed to be responsible for arranging the political and administrative affairs of all [Arab] villages and population centers which are occupied within that region.

The paragraph &quot;(g) Counterattacks Inside and Outside the Borders of the State&quot; inter alia states:
:Counterattacks will generally proceed as follows: a force the size of a battalion, on average, will carry out a deep infiltration and will launch concentrated attacks against population centers and enemy bases with the aim of destroying them along with the enemy force positioned there.

==Implementation==
Plan Dalet was first implemented in the first days of April, starting with Operation Nachshon. This marked the beginning of the second stage of the war in which, according to Benny Morris, the Haganah passed from the defensive to the offensive. Nachshon&#x27;s objective was lifting the blockade on Jerusalem. Fifteen hundred men from Haganah&#x27;s Givati brigade and Palmach&#x27;s Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between April 5–20.
The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last 2 months were trucked into Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population. 

The success of the operation was assisted by the death of Al-Hussayni in combat. From April 4–14, the first large-scale operation of the Arab Liberation Army ended in a debacle, having been roundly defeated at Mishmar HaEmek, coinciding with the loss of their Druze allies through defection.

On April 9, paramilitary groups Irgun and Lehi, supported by the Haganah and Palmach, perpetrated the Deir Yassin massacre, killing at least 107 Arab villagers, including women and children. The event was widely publicized and had a deep effect on the Arab population&#x27;s morale, greatly contributing to the Palestinian expulsion and flight. Israeli historian Ilan Pappé wrote in his book &quot;The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine&quot; (2006) that &quot;The systematic nature of Plan Dalet is manifested in Deir Yassin, a pastoral and cordial village that had reached a non-aggression pact with the Hagana in Jerusalem, but was doomed to be wiped out because it was within the areas designated in Plan Dalet to be cleansed.&quot; According to historian Benny Morris, Walid Khalidi also emphasized &quot;the connection between the Haganah&#x27;s &quot;Plan Dalet&quot; [...] and what happened in Deir Yassin, explicitly linking the expulsion of the inhabitants to the Haganah’s overall planning.&quot;

As part of Plan Dalet, the Haganah, Palmach and Irgun captured the urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa (see Battle of Haifa), Safed, Beisan, Jaffa, and Acre, violently expelling more than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs.

The British had, at that time, essentially withdrawn their troops. The situation moved the leaders of the neighboring Arab states to intervene, but their preparations had not been finalised, and they could not assemble sufficient forces to turn the tide of the war. Many Palestinian hopes lay with the Arab Legion of Transjordan&#x27;s monarch, King Abdullah I, but he had no intention of creating a Palestinian-run state, since he hoped to annex as much of the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine as he could.

The Haganah launched Operation Yiftah and Operation Ben-Ami to secure the Jewish settlements of Galilee, and Operation Kilshon, which created a united front around Jerusalem.

===Operations===

The 8 of 13 operations marked with an asterisk (*) were executed outside territories allocated for a Jewish state according to the demarcations of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and before the entry of Arab regular armies into areas allotted for an Arab state.

===Outcome===
By the end of the war, approximately 800,000 Palestinians were displaced in total, and hundreds of villages were destroyed.

==Historiography==
In his article &quot;The Fall of Haifa&quot; in the December 1959 issue of the Middle East Forum, the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi placed the Battle of Haifa within a new Zionist offensive and discernible shift in strategy, without naming the offensive. The scholarship of Khalidi and his colleagues at this time responded to the Israeli narrative that the Palestinian exodus was a result of evacuation orders from Arab leaders, then espoused in English most prominently by Jon Kimche and his younger brother David Kimche. 

On May 21, 1961, the Irish journalist Erskine Childers published his article &quot;The Other Exodus&quot; in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, to which Jon Kimche responded immediately, accusing Childers of being influenced by Khalidi. Childers, Kimche, and Khalidi then argued publicly in a traingular debate in the pages of &quot;The Spectator&quot; until August 4, 1961. In November 1961, Khalidi published &quot;Plan Dalet: Master Plan for the Conquest of Palestine&quot; with details about the plan in the journal of the Middle East Forum. Khalidi wrote in 1988 that as of then the exchanges in &quot;The Spectator&quot; had never published in full in the US, and that there had not been a detailed account of Plan Dalet or previous plans in Israeli and non-Israeli writings on 1948.

===Controversy about intent===
The intent of Plan Dalet is subject to much controversy, with historians on the one extreme asserting that it was defensive, and historians on the other extreme asserting that the plan aimed at maximum conquest and expulsion.

According to the French historian Henry Laurens, the importance of the military dimension of plan Dalet becomes clear by comparing the operations of the Jordanian and the Egyptian armies. The ethnical homogeneity of the coastal area, obtained by the expulsions of the Palestinians eased the halt of the Egyptian advance, while Jewish Jerusalem, located in an Arab population area, was encircled by Jordanian forces.

According to &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies&quot;, whilst there may be controversy whether Plan Dalet was a centralized plan of ethnic cleansing, it could as well be a case of Haganah forces discovering that they could carry out ethnic cleansing at the local and regional level, as their offensive drove out large numbers of Arabs.

The plan was neither understood nor used by the senior field officers as a blanket instruction for the expulsion of the Palestinians. But, in providing for the expulsion or destruction of villages that had resisted or might threaten the Yishuv, it constituted a strategic-doctrinal and &quot;carte blanche&quot; for expulsions by front, brigade, district and battalion commanders (who in each case argued military necessity) and it gave commanders, post facto, formal, persuasive cover for their actions. However, during April–June, relatively few commanders faced the moral dilemma of having to carry out the expulsion clauses. Townspeople and villagers usually left their homes before or during battle, and Haganah rarely had to decide about, or issue, expulsion orders...&quot;.

In his book on the birth of the Palestinian refugee problem Israeli historian Benny Morris discusses the relevance of the idea of &quot;population transfer&quot; in Zionist thinking. Morris concludes that there was Zionist support for transfer &quot;in the 1930s and early 1940s&quot;, and that while this &quot;transfer thinking&quot; had conditioned the Yishuv&#x27;s hearts and minds to accept it as natural and inevitable when it happened, it &quot;was not tantamount to pre-planning, and did not issue in the production of a policy or master plan of expulsion; the Yishuv and its military forces did not enter the 1948 War, which was initiated by the Arab side, with a policy or plan for expulsion&quot;.

On the intent of Plan Dalet Morris writes:
&quot;The essence of the plan was the clearing of hostile and potentially hostile forces out of the interior of the territory of the prospective Jewish State, establishing territorial continuity between the major concentrations of Jewish population and securing the future State&#x27;s borders before, and in anticipation of, the invasion [by Arab states]. The Haganah regarded almost all the villages as actively or potentially hostile.&quot;

Benny Morris also wrote that &quot;Nahshon heralded a shift from the defensive to the offensive and marked the beginning of the implementation of &quot;tochnit dalet&quot; (Plan D)&quot; Morris also stated that:

&quot;The Haganah shift of strategy was decided on incrementally during the first half of April: each decision appeared to be, and in large measure was, a response to a particular, local challenge. But by the end of the period it was clear that a dramatic conceptual change had taken place and that the Yishuv had gone over to the offensive and was now engaged in a war of conquest. That war of conquest was prefigured in Plan D.&quot;

Ilan Pappé writes that although &quot;official Israeli historiography&quot; considers the implementation of Plan Dalet to have been a shift from defence to offence, in reality Zionist forces had already been on the offense and conducting ethnic cleansing since December 1947. Pappé writes that &quot;If there were a turning point in April, it was the shift from sporadic attacks and counter-attacks on the Palestinian civilian population towards the systematic mega-operation of ethnic cleansing that now followed.&quot;

Military historian David Tal writes, &quot;the plan did provide the conditions for the destruction of Palestinian villages and the deportation of the dwellers; this was not the reason for the plan&#x27;s composition&quot;, and that &quot;its aim was to ensure full control over the territory assigned to the Jews by the partition resolution, thus placing the Haganah in the best possible strategic position to face an Arab invasion&quot;.

====Historians asserting that the plan aimed at maximum conquest and expulsion====
Walid Khalidi, General Secretary of the Institute for Palestine Studies, offered this interpretation in an address to the American Committee on Jerusalem:
&quot;As is witnessed by the Haganah&#x27;s Plan Dalet, the Jewish leadership was determined to link the envisaged Jewish state with the Jerusalem &quot;corpus separatum&quot;. But the corpus separatum lay deep in Arab territory, in the middle of the envisaged Palestinian state, so this linking up could only be done militarily.&quot;

Khalidi calls Plan Dalet a &quot;master plan for the conquest of Palestine&quot;. He points to the Zionist ideas of transfer and of a Jewish state in all of Palestine, and to the offensive character of the military operations of the Zionists as the main proof of his interpretation.

Israeli historian Ilan Pappé asserts that Plan Dalet was a &quot;blueprint for ethnic cleansing&quot; which &quot;spelled it out clearly and unambiguously: the Palestinians had to go ... The aim of the plan was in fact the destruction of both rural and urban areas of Palestine.&quot;

====Historians asserting that the plan was defensive====
Israeli historian Yoav Gelber considers that although it provided for counter-attacks, Plan Dalet was a defensive operation with the goals of (1) protection of the borders of the upcoming Jewish state according to the partition line; (2) securing its territorial continuity in the face of invasion attempts; (3) safeguarding freedom of movement on the roads and (4) enabling continuation of essential daily routines. Gelber rejects what he calls the &quot;Palestinian-invented&quot; version of Plan Dalet. Gelber says: &quot;The text clarified unequivocally that expulsion concerned only those villages that would fight against the Hagana and resist occupation, and not all Arab hamlets&quot;.

<text>Cannaregio () is the northernmost of the six historic &quot;sestieri of Venice&quot;. It is the second largest &quot;sestiere&quot; by land area and the largest by population, with 13,169 people .

Isola di San Michele, the historic cemetery island, is associated with the district.

== History ==
The Cannaregio Canal, which was the main route into the city until the construction of a railway link to the mainland, gave the district its name (Canal Regio is Italian for Royal Canal). Development began in the eleventh century as the area was drained and parallel canals were dredged. Although elegant palazzos were built facing the Grand Canal, the area grew primarily with working class housing and manufacturing. Beginning in 1516, Jews were restricted to living in the Venetian Ghetto. It was enclosed by guarded gates and no one was allowed to leave from sunset to dawn. However, Jews held successful positions in the city such as merchants, physicians, money lenders, and other trades. Restrictions on daily Jewish life continued for more than 270 years, until Napoleon Bonaparte conquered the Venetian Republic in 1797. He removed the gates and gave all residents the freedom to live where they chose.

In the 19th century, civil engineers built a street named Strada Nuova through Cannaregio, and a railway bridge and road bridge were constructed to connect Venice directly to Mestre. Today, the areas of the district along the Grand Canal from the train station to the Rialto Bridge are packed with tourists, but the rest of Cannaregio is residential and relatively peaceful, with morning markets, neighborhood shops, and small cafés.

<doc id="398049" wikidata="Q240051" url="?curid=398049" title="Ryoko Tani">
<text>is a Japanese politician and retired female judoka.

Competing in the extra-lightweight (48 kg) class, she won a record seven world titles and five Olympic medals including two golds at Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004. After her retirement, the International Judo Federation named her &quot;best female judoka ever&quot;.

In 2010, she was elected to the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Japanese parliament.

== Early and personal life ==
Ryoko Tamura was born in Higashi-ku, Fukuoka on September 6, 1975. She started judo at the age of seven.

She studied literature at Teikyo University and joined Toyota in 1998.

In 2003, she married Yoshitomo Tani, an Olympian and professional baseball player then with Orix BlueWave. The wedding reception reportedly cost $3 million. The couple has two sons, born in 2005 and 2009.

==Sporting career==
Standing at , Tani fought in the extra-lightweight (48 kg) division her whole career and, unlike many of her opponents, she never had to cut weight before a competition.

Her first major title was at the 1990 Fukuoka International Women&#x27;s Judo Championships, a tournament she went on to win 13 years in a row.

In 1993, she won her first world title and received her fourth dan. She went on to win the biennial world championships in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007. She did not compete in 2005 as she was expecting her first child. This record seven wins was only beaten by French judoka Teddy Riner in 2015, in an era when world championships had become annual events.

She competed in five Olympic Games and won as many medals. At Barcelona 1992, aged only 16 years old, she defeated in the semi-final veteran British fighter and 4-time world champion Karen Briggs, but she lost the final by a small margin against the reigning world champion, Cécile Nowak of France. This was followed by a 4-year, 84-match winning streak that led her to her second Olympic final at Atlanta 1996. Tani was the clear favorite against the relatively unknown North-Korean Kye Sun Hui, but she was unable to live up to the expectations. Kye resisted all her attacks and scored an advantage towards the end of the fight. Tani&#x27;s second Olympic silver was a huge setback, and the Japanese media talked of an &quot;Olympic curse&quot;. Reflecting on this years later, Tani said, &quot;there was never a curse … in 1992, I was 16, I was lacking experience … in 1996, I was 20&quot;.

After 1996, she remained unbeaten for 12 years. At Sydney 2000, she had a tough semi-final against North Korea&#x27;s Cha Hyon-hyang, but she left no chance to her opponent in the final, Lyubov Bruletova of Russia. After only 36 seconds, Tani delivered an uchi mata (inner-thigh throw) and was awarded an ippon and the gold medal. Four years later in Athens, she scored a series of ippon-victories to reach the final, in which she dominated France&#x27;s Frédérique Jossinet, taking an early koka lead that she confirmed with a waza-ari in the last seconds of the fight. She was the first woman judoka to win two Olympic golds.

In Beijing in 2008, she saw her hopes of a third-straight gold evaporate when judges awarded penalty points to Romania&#x27;s Alina Dumitru after both competitors failed to show much aggression. Looking stunned, Tani fought desperately after the final controversial penalty call, but with only seconds left she had no time to mount an attack. She defeated Russia&#x27;s Lyudmila Bogdanova for bronze.

She retired from competition in 2010. In a career spanning around 20 years, she was only defeated 5 times. In 2011, the International Judo Federation named her &quot;best female judoka ever&quot; at its 60th anniversary gala in Paris.

=== Selection controversy ===

Tani lost the 2007 All-Japan Weight Class Judo Championship, which doubles as the qualifier for Olympics and the World Championships on those years when the events take place, but was selected as Japan&#x27;s representative anyway by the All Japan Judo Federation (AJJF). She then won the gold medal in the Rio de Janeiro World Championships. Tani lost the All-Japan again in April 2008, to 21-year-old Emi Yamagishi. Again, the AJJF selected Tani for Japan&#x27;s team in place of Yamagishi. The AJJF refused to answer questions about Tani&#x27;s selection after the decision, but later said that Tani was selected because &quot;She is especially strong against international opponents&quot;. The selection prompted Philip Brasor, media commentator for the Japan Times to ask &quot;...maybe Tani is the better choice, but why have qualifying bouts in the first place?&quot;. The AJFF uses qualifying bouts as only one criterion considered for selection, with performance in international events as another.

==Popularity and legacy==
Tani followed in the footsteps of Kaori Yamaguchi, who in 1984 had become the first Japanese woman to ever win a world championship – the sport had long been a male preserve. Yamaguchi was the inspiration for the character of Yawara Inokuma, the heroine of Naoki Urasawa&#x27;s popular manga and anime series &quot;Yawara!&quot; who prepares for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. When Tani represented Japan in Barcelona, she was viewed by the Japanese public as a real-life Yawara and was soon nicknamed Yawara-chan or Tawara.

Thanks to her success and cheerful personality, Tani grew immensely popular in Japan. She appeared in numerous TV commercials and her wedding ceremony, broadcast live on Japanese television, was followed by 20 million spectators. The birth of her first child also became a major press event, with camera crews waiting for the first glimpse of her emergence from the hospital. The characters of Ryoko Izumo and Ryoko Kano from the &quot;World Heroes&quot; and &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History&quot; fighting video games series, respectively, were both loosely based on her.

Tani is credited for the boom in women&#x27;s judo witnessed by Japan in the 1990s, leading to the rise of a new generation of competitors. Because she did not let her marriage put an end to her sporting career, and won her last world title as a young mother, she is also viewed as a symbol of the changing role of women in Japanese society.

==Political career==

Tani was introduced to politics by Ichiro Ozawa. On May 10, 2010 the Democratic Party announced that she would represent the party as a proportional candidate in the Summer 2010 House of Councillors election. Tani initially stated that she still intended to pursue her judo career, but she eventually retired from judo after she won the seat in question.

In July 2012, she left the Democratic Party for the newly created and short-lived People&#x27;s Life First. Later that same year, she was one of the founding members of the People&#x27;s Life Party, alongside her mentor Ichiro Ozawa. Tani was approached by several parties in the lead up to the July 2016 election, but Ozawa demanded she remain with the party, as her defection would have meant the party fell below the minimum requirement of five Diet members and lost its official party status. In June 2016 Tani announced her decision to remain with the party until the election, but not seek a second term.

<doc id="398057" wikidata="Q5261452" url="?curid=398057" title="Derby Dam">
<text>Derby Dam is a diversion dam built from 1903 to 1905 on the Truckee River, located about east of Reno in Storey and Washoe counties in Nevada, United States. It diverts water into the Truckee Canal that would otherwise enter Pyramid Lake. The canal feeds Lake Lahontan reservoir in the Carson River watershed, where it is used for irrigation.

It was the first project of the newly organized U.S. Reclamation Service (known today as the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation), organized by the Reclamation Act of 1902.

As a result of the diversion, Winnemucca Lake lost inflow and dried up, and Pyramid Lake lost more than in elevation, resulting in the near-extinction of the Lahontan cutthroat trout.

The dam is operated by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District. It was named after the Derby Southern Pacific Railroad station.

== History ==
The dam was constructed for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation following an authorization for construction issued on March 14, 1903. Construction commenced on October 2, 1903, and was completed on May 20, 1905.

The project was authorized on March 14, 1903, by Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock. The dam is an original feature of the Newlands Reclamation Project, named after Nevada Congressman Francis Newlands, who sponsored the Reclamation Act. Not surprisingly, a dam in Newlands, Nevada launched the project. It was the first of five projects authorized and built under the Reclamation Act of 1902.

With passage of the act, the federal government assumed a major role in designing and constructing large-scale irrigation projects throughout the West. The diversion dam is part of the network of water storage, diversion, and conveyance structures that provides water for irrigating about of farmland in an area that receives less than of annual precipitation.

The dam is not designed for water storage. It is a low high concrete structure that diverts water from the Truckee River into the Truckee Canal and then two main project canals, the Southside Main Canal (&quot;V&quot; Line) and the Northside Main Canal (&quot;T&quot; Line). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as the &quot;Derby Diversion Dam.&quot;

== Environmental impact ==

Water diverted at Derby Dam to farms in Lahontan Valley constitutes as much as three-fourths of the flow of the Truckee River, the largest diversion of water from the Truckee River after it flows from Lake Tahoe.

The reduction in flow to Pyramid Lake and the inability of Lahontan cutthroat trout (the &quot;salmon-trout&quot; as described by Frémont) to bypass the dam for spawning eliminated them from Lake Lahontan and its tributaries and caused the near extinction of the species. But in 1979 a remnant population of the original Pyramid Lake cutthroat trout was discovered in a small brook on Pilot Peak, on the Nevada/Utah border. This population was used to successfully restock Lake Lahontan.

<doc id="398070" wikidata="Q3571153" url="?curid=398070" title="Diversion dam">
<text>A diversion dam is a dam that diverts all or a portion of the flow of a river from its natural course. Diversion dams do not generally impound water in a reservoir; instead, the water is diverted into an artificial water course or canal, which may be used for irrigation or return to the river after passing through hydroelectric generators, flow into a different river or be itself dammed forming an onground or groundwater reservoir or a storm drain.

An early diversion dam is the Ancient Egyptian Sadd el-Kafara Dam at Wadi Al-Garawi, which was located about twenty five kilometres south of Cairo. Built around 2600 BC for flood control, the structure was 102 metres long at its base and 87 metres wide. It was destroyed by a flood while it was still under construction.

==Classification==
Diversion dams are one of three classifications of dams which include: storage dams, detention dams, and diversion dams. Storage dams are used to store water for extended lengths of time. The stored water then can be used for irrigation, livestock, municipal water supply, recreation, and hydroelectric power generation. Detention dams are built to catch surface runoff to prevent floods and trap sediment by regulating the flow rate of the runoff into channels downstream. Diversion dams are used to raise the water level in order to redirect the water to the designated location. The diverted water can be used for supplying irrigation systems or reservoirs.

==Purpose==
Diversion dams are installed to raise the water level of a body of water to allow the water to be redirected. The redirected water can be used to supply irrigation systems, reservoirs, or hydroelectric power generation facilities. The water diverted by the diversion dam to the reservoirs can be used for industrial applications or for municipal water supply.

==Construction==
The design a diversion dam will fall into one of four basic types: embankment style dams, buttress style dams, arch style dams, and gravity style dams.

===Embankment style diversion dam===

Embankment style diversion dams are constructed to counteract the force of the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with enough weight to withstand the force. Embankment dams are commonly made from materials in the surrounding area where the dam is being built. The materials generally include: sand, gravel, and rocks. The combination of these building materials with either clay or an impervious membrane gives the embankment dam its integrity. As a result, the combination of its simple construction and locally available building materials the cost of building an embankment dam is lower than the other types of dams.

===Buttress style diversion dam===
Buttress style diversion dams are designed using angle supports on the downstream side of the dam. The supports are fixed to the wall of the dam in order to help counteract the force of the water on the dam. Buttress style dams are built across wide valleys that do not have a solid bedrock foundation. Bedrock is solid rock that makes up the upper part of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Bedrock can be made from sedimentary, igneous, and metaphoric rock origins. Buttress dams require extensive steel framework and labor. As a result, buttress style dams are expensive to construct and are seldom built today.

===Arch style diversion dam===

Arch style diversion dams are designed using an arch shape with the top of the arch facing upstream. The arch shape provides extra strength to counteract the force of the water. Arch style dams are generally constructed in narrow canyons. Arch style dams are commonly made from concrete. To ensure the dam&#x27;s integrity, a solid contact between the bedrock foundation and the dam&#x27;s concrete base is required. The dome style dam is a type of arch dam. The dome style dam curves in both the horizontal plane and vertical plane. The arch style dam only curves in the horizontal.

===Gravity style diversion dam===

Gravity style diversion dams are built to counteract the force of the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with enough weight to withstand the force. Gravity dams are commonly constructed using masonry or cement. The foundations of the gravity dams are generally constructed on top of a solid bedrock foundation. However, gravity dams can be built over unconsolidated ground as long as proper measures are put in place to stop the flow of water under the dam. If water were to get under the dam, the dam could fail.

<text>Sarah Chang (; born Young Joo Chang; December 10, 1980) is a Korean American classical violinist. Recognized as a child prodigy, she first played as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1989. She enrolled at Juilliard School to study music, graduated in 1999, and continued university studies. Especially during the 1990s and early to mid-2000s, Chang had major roles as a soloist with many of the world&#x27;s major orchestras.

==Early life and education==
Chang was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in Cherry Hill and Voorhees Township, New Jersey. Her mother Myoung-Jun Chang is a composer and her father Min-Soo Chang was a violinist and music teacher. Chang&#x27;s parents moved to the United States from South Korea in 1979 for her father&#x27;s advanced music degree at Temple University. Her mother took composition classes at the University of Pennsylvania. Chang has said that although she &quot;never actually lived in Korea... I do still feel very strongly it&#x27;s where my roots are.&quot; Her younger brother Michael (born 1987) has a degree from Princeton University.
In 1986, when Chang was 5 years old, she auditioned for and was accepted to the Juilliard School by performing the Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor. Chang spent her weekends attending music classes at Juilliard and shopping in New York City with her parents. When Chang was 6 years old, she started studying with Isaac Stern outside school. In 1989, she began working with Dorothy DeLay at her studio in New York where her father had received his musical lessons, and at the Aspen Music Festival and School. A former student and assistant to DeLay, Hyo Kang, also provided training to Chang.

Following her 1999 high school graduation in New Jersey, she returned to Juilliard for university and studied with DeLay.

Chang learned from a family environment to naturally speak Korean.

Due to her musical accomplishments, Chang is among a very small number of professional figures recognized as a child prodigy.

==Career==

===Early work===
Her mother trained her to play one-finger melodies on the piano at age 3. For her fourth birthday, she was given a 1/16-sized violin. Upon hearing her play at a dinner party, Philadelphia Orchestra concertmaster Norman Carol asked music director Riccardo Muti to listen to her. At age 8, she auditioned alongside Muti and Zubin Mehta, who was the music director of the New York Philharmonic. Both granted her immediate engagements.

In 1991, when Chang was 10 years old, she recorded her first album, &quot;Debut&quot;; it was released by EMI Classics on August 18, 1992 and quickly reached the Billboard chart of classical best-sellers. Chang quickly rose to fame and became known on an international scale, performing up to 150 concerts a year. In 2006, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked her as one of the Top Eight Achieving Females in the United States. In the interview accompanying the feature, she said: &quot;I think having a career at such an early age kept me focused. We schedule at least two to three years in advance in the classical industry. I felt so grounded and so grateful to already know what it was that I wanted to do with my life.&quot;

===2002–2005===

In 2002, Chang performed in Pyongyang, North Korea. She said: &quot;The concert was full of government officials. Every single last seat. It was invitation only, but it was an unbelievable experience. Frightening and exhilarating at the same time. And I just thought about how lucky I am. I am so fortunate to be a musician, and at that moment, I genuinely felt that music is the one and only universal language.&quot;

Chang took part in watchmaker Movado&#x27;s global advertising campaign &quot;The Art of Time&quot; with Pete Sampras and composer Wynton Marsalis. For the 2004 Olympics, she was selected to carry the Olympic torch in New York. In 2005, the Yale School of Music dedicated a chair in Sprague Hall in Chang&#x27;s name. After that, Chang toured for a year with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in a Sextet program of summer festivals leading to a concert at the Berlin Philharmonie.

===2007–present===
Chang played a recital at Carnegie Hall on April 7, 2007, accompanied by the British pianist Ashley Wass. She continued to perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Esa-Pekka Salonen and appear with the former at the Hollywood Bowl and Walt Disney Concert Hall throughout 2008. On March 27 and 28, 2008, she played for San Antonio, Texas audiences at the Majestic Theater, a performance preceded by an appearance (to meet and inspire young as well as seasoned musicians at no charge) at Antonio Strad Violin in the same city. From May 2009 to June 2010, she held recital tours across Europe, North America, and Asia with pianist Andrew von Oeyen; a July 2010 recording of the two was eventually released. On February 12, 2010, she gave a recital at the Barbican Hall in London. Chang made an appearance at the University of Southern California in March 2010, playing Max Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Op. 26. She performed at the Hollywood Bowl in August 2010.

== Instruments ==
Sarah Chang owns several violins. Her main instrument is the 1717 Guarneri del Gesu by the Cremonese luthier, Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù which she purchased from her mentor, Isaac Stern.

Chang uses a variety of bows: she has said that she prefers a Pajeot for Mozart and Bach; a Sartory for the Tchaikovsky and Sibelius concerti; and two Dominique Peccattes for other music.

Chang has performed with the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Boston Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Montréal Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, orchestras in London, England, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Notable recital engagements have included her Carnegie Hall debut and performances at the Kennedy Center, Orchestra Hall, Symphony Hall, Barbican Centre, Philharmonie, and Concertgebouw.

As a chamber musician, Chang has collaborated with Pinchas Zukerman, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Yefim Bronfman, Martha Argerich, Leif Ove Andsnes, Stephen Kovacevich, Yo-Yo Ma, Lynn Harrell, Lars Vogt, and the late Isaac Stern. She has made several chamber recordings with current and former members of the Berlin Philharmonic, including the Sextet and Piano Quintet of Dvořák and the &quot;Souvenir de Florence&quot; of Tchaikovsky.

In January 2011, Chang disclosed in an interview with Evan Solomon of &quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot; (CBC) that President Obama had appointed her to the Presidential Commission on Russian Relations and that she was taking on a new role as State Department Special Cultural Envoy. She had already been promoting and supporting childhood musical education for many years. She has also been a cultural ambassador for the U.S.; for instance, she was invited to play in Pyongyang, North Korea, with a South Korean orchestra in 2002.

<text>The Philadelphia City Council, the legislative body of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, consists of ten members elected by district and seven members elected at-large. The council president is elected by the members from among their number. Each member&#x27;s term is four years, and there are no limits on the number of terms a member may serve.

== History ==
While William Penn&#x27;s original 1691 charter for the city of Philadelphia included a &quot;common council&quot; with appointed members, no records exist of this body ever having been convened. Its successor, the Proprietor&#x27;s Charter of 1701, constituted the city as a municipal corporation with a non-elected council made up of major city officials who selected their own successors. The colonial city government was abolished during the American Revolution and replaced in 1789 with an elected council including fifteen aldermen and thirty common councillors; these then elected a mayor and recorder who also were members of the council. In 1796, a bicameral city council was created including a 20-member Common Council elected annually and 12-member Select Council elected every three years; the sizes of both bodies increased with the population of the city, peaking at 149 members of Common Council and 41 in Select Council, the largest municipal legislature in the US. It was replaced with a single 21-member chamber in 1919, which remained in effect until the adoption of a Home Rule charter in 1951.

== Composition and term ==

The 1951 Home Rule Charter established the council as the legislative arm of Philadelphia municipal government, consisting of seventeen members. Ten council members are elected by district and seven from the city at large. At-large council members are elected using limited voting with limited nomination in which voters may only select five candidates on the ballot, and which guarantees that two minority-party or independent candidates are elected. Each is elected for a term of four years with no limit on the number of terms that may be served.

The members of City Council elect from among themselves a president, who serves as the regular chairperson of council meetings. In consultation with the majority of council members, the President appoints members to the various standing committees of the council. The president is also responsible for selecting and overseeing most Council employees.

== Legislative process ==

Every proposed ordinance is in the form of a bill introduced by a Council member. Before a bill can be enacted, it must be referred by the president of the council to an appropriate standing committee, considered at a public hearing and public meeting, reported out by the committee, printed as reported by the committee, distributed to the members of the council, and made available to the public. Passage of a bill requires the favorable vote of a majority of all members. A bill becomes law upon the approval of the mayor. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the council may override the veto by a two-thirds vote.

Under the rules of the council, regular public sessions are held weekly, usually on Thursday morning at 10:00am, in Room 400, City Hall. Council normally breaks for the summer months of July and August.

== Gerrymandering ==

In a 2006 computer study of local and state legislative districts, two of the city&#x27;s ten council districts, the 5th and the 7th, were found to be among the least compact districts in the nation, giving rise to suspicions of gerrymandering. The Committee of Seventy, a non-partisan watchdog group for local elections, asked candidates for council in 2007 to support a list of ethics statements, including a call for fair redistricting, which should take place after the 2010 United States Census. In 2011, the council approved a redistricting map with more compact boundaries, eliminating the gerrymandered borders of the 5th and 7th districts; it took effect for the 2015 elections.

== Councilmanic prerogative ==

&quot;Councilmanic prerogative&quot; is the legislative practice where a Philadelphia city council member has final say over land use in their district. Chicago has a similar practice called &quot;aldermanic prerogative&quot;. This unwritten practice affords council people who represent a geographically defined district unchecked power over land use decisions as it is custom for the 16 other council members to defer to them. A Pew study from 2015 uncovered that 726 of 730 Council votes on land use decisions were unanimous with only six total dissenting votes. This system can lead to conflicts of interest between council members and developers who want to change land use zoning or want to buy property below market rates in order to sell it at a higher price. Since 1981, of six council members convicted of misconduct all revolved around land-use.

Critics of councilmanic prerogative argue that it undermines government transparency and accountability, often operating in obscurity, thereby hindering development, fostering public mistrust, favoring political insiders, and allowing narrow interests to override broader city goals. 
District council members argue that prerogative appropriately empowers elected representatives to oversee land use projects, allowing them to safeguard their communities&#x27; interests, enhance development quality, and secure funding for local initiatives, based on their intimate knowledge of the neighborhoods they represent.

<doc id="398081" wikidata="Q178663" url="?curid=398081" title="Meknes">
<text>Meknes (, ) is one of the four Imperial cities of Morocco, located in northern central Morocco and the sixth largest city by population in the kingdom. Founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids as a military settlement, Meknes became the capital of Morocco during the reign of Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), son of the founder of the Alaouite dynasty. Sultan Ismail created a massive imperial palace complex and endowed the city with extensive fortifications and monumental gates. The city recorded a population of 632,079 in the 2014 Moroccan census. It is the seat of Meknès Prefecture and an important economic hub in the region of Fès-Meknès.

==Etymology==
Meknes is named after an Amazigh (Berber) tribe historically known as the Miknasa ( in Amazigh languages).

==History==

===Early history (8th–16th centuries)===
Volubilis, a major Roman-era settlement in Morocco and one of its early urban centres, is located near the site of the current city of Meknes. The current city and its name, however, originate with a Berber tribe called the Miknasa who settled this region around the 10th century. A group of small unfortified Miknasa villages known as &quot;miknāsat al-zaytūn&quot; were established here in the 10th century. The Almoravids founded a fortress or fortified settlement just south of these villages after conquering the area in the 11th century. Originally called Tagrart or Taqrart, this Almoravid settlement formed the beginnings of what is now the old medina of Meknes. The Nejjarine Mosque, often reputed to be the oldest mosque in the city, dates back to the Almoravid period and may have served as the central mosque of the Almoravid settlement. The mosque that became the present-day Grand Mosque of Meknes is believed to have been first built by the Almoravids in the 12th century.

The fortress resisted the military advance of the Almohads, who destroyed the city after a long siege in the 12th century. However, at the beginning of the 13th century the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir (ruled 1199–1213) rebuilt the city and its fortifications, as well as its Grand Mosque. The city enjoyed relative prosperity in this period, before being conquered again by the new Marinid dynasty in 1244. The first kasbah (citadel or governor&#x27;s district) of Meknes was created afterwards by sultan Abu Yusuf Ya&#x27;qub in 1276 CE – the same year that the citadel of Fes el-Jdid was built in nearby Fes, the new capital. During this period, Meknes was frequently the residence of Marinid princes (often appointed there as governors) and especially of viziers. The Mosque of the Kasbah (the later Mosque of Lalla Aouda) was also founded and first built in 1276. The Marinids also carried out major restorations to the Grand Mosque in the 14th century and built the major madrasas of the city near it. The latter included the Bou Inania Madrasa (built in 1336) and two other madrasas, &quot;Madrasa al-Qadi&quot; and &quot;Madrasa Shuhud&quot;, all built by Sultan Abu el-Hassan.

After the end of the Marinid and Wattasid periods, however, Meknes suffered from neglect as the new Saadian dynasty (16th and early 17th century) focused their attention on their capital at Marrakesh and neglected the old northern cities of Morocco.

===The reign of Moulay Isma&#x27;il (17th–18th centuries)===

It wasn&#x27;t until the Alaouite dynasty in the second half of the 17th century that Meknes received renewed attention. Under Moulay Rashid (ruled 1666–1672), the first Alaouite sultan to unite Morocco under his rule, Fes became the capital once more and his brother, Moulay Isma&#x27;il ibn Sharif, governed Meknes. Upon Rashid&#x27;s death in 1672, Moulay Isma&#x27;il became sultan and chose Meknes as his new capital. In addition to his possible attachment to the city as a governor, a number of reasons may have favoured this choice. One may have been the fact that Ismail had to fight hard to reconquer both Fes and Marrakesh from his rival nephew (Ahmad al-Mahriz, son of Moulay Rashid) during the first years of his reign, which may have rendered him skeptical towards both cities as possible centers of power. Moreover, Moulay Rashid had garrisoned much of Fes with his own contingents from the Tafilalt and eastern Morocco while Moulay Isma&#x27;il was forming his own personal royal guard composed of Black slaves (&quot;&#x27;abid&quot;) from Sub-Saharan Africa, and there may have been concerns that not all these contingents could be garrisoned simultaneously in Fes. The &quot;ulema&quot; (religious scholars) of Fes were also particularly disapproving of his ways, including his use of slaves (many of whom were of Muslim background), and maintained tense relations with him throughout his reign. Choosing Meknes thus removed him from the influence of traditional elites and allowed him to build a fresh base from which he hoped to exercise absolute power. The threat of Ottoman attacks from the east (from Algeria) and the increasing insecurity in central Morocco due to tribal migrations from the Atlas and Sahara regions may have also persuaded Ismail that Meknes, situated further west, was more defensible than Fes.

Whatever the reasons, Ismail made Meknes the center of Morocco in his time and he embarked on the construction of a new monumental palace-city on the south side of the old city. Its construction continued throughout the 55 years of his reign, beginning immediately after his accession to the throne in 1672. Existing structures dating from the earlier medieval kasbah of the city were demolished to make way; the name of the large public square in front of the Kasbah today, &quot;el-Hedim&quot; (or Place el-Hedim), means &quot;the rubble&quot; and came from the masses of rubble and debris which were piled here during the demolition. Labour was carried out by paid workers as well as by contingents of slaves, particularly Christian prisoners of war. Estimates on the total number of workers involved range from 25,000 and 55,000. Nonetheless, frequently-told stories about the tens of thousands of Christian slaves used for labour and the large underground dungeons where they were kept are somewhat exaggerated and originate from the accounts of European ambassadors who visited Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s court (often to negotiate the release of prisoners from their countries). In reality, the number of Christian slaves was likely closer to a few thousand at most and the chambers popularly called &quot;prisons&quot; were actually storage rooms for grain and supplies.

It was also in Moulay Ismail&#x27;s reign that the Jewish inhabitants of the city were moved to a new &quot;Mellah&quot; or Jewish district to the west, near the Kasbah, not unlike the Mellah of Fes or that of Marrakesh. The Mellah was located between the old medina, west of Place el-Hedim, and the more outlying quarter of Madinat al-Riyad al-Anbari. Both the Mellah and Madinat ar-Riyad were part of an urban extension ordered by Isma&#x27;il in the western angle between the old city and the Kasbah. Moulay Isma&#x27;il also undertook works throughout the old city too. He refortified the walls and built new monumental city gates such as Bab Berda&#x27;in and Bab Khemis. He also built several other kasbahs or garrison forts throughout the city to house his &quot;&#x27;abid&quot; troops and help protect (and control) the rest of the town, such as the Kasbah Hadrash and the Kasbah Tizimi. He carried out renovations to the Grand Mosque and the nearby Madrasa al-Qadi (which he devotes to students from the Tafilalt), and founded the Zitouna Mosque. Khnata bent Bakkar, one of his wives who was vizier (minister) under him (and briefly became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Morocco in 1728 after his death), was responsible for founding the Bab Berda&#x27;in Mosque, completed in 1709.One of the last constructions before his death, carried out between 1721 and 1725, was the Heri al-Mansur, a palace on the far southern edge of the kasbah which included vast stables. The monumental gate known as Bab al-Mansur al-&#x27;Alj, overlooking Place al-Hedim, was only finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. His son and brief successor, Moulay Ahmad ad-Dhahabi, carried out modifications to his father&#x27;s mausoleum during his two brief reigns (in 1727–28 and 1728–29) and was himself buried here in 1729.

===Later Alaouite period (18th–20th centuries)===
Following Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s death, however, the political situation in Morocco degenerated into relative anarchy as his sons competed for power. Meknes lost its status as capital and suffered damage in the 1755 earthquake. The city was neglected and many parts of the enormous imperial kasbah fell into disrepair. The site received only occasional royal attention in the following centuries. Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah, who ruled between 1757 and 1790, built a number of projects in the city. He added the Dar al-Bayda Palace in the Agdal garden to the southeast of the main palace complex, which was later turned into a royal military academy. He constructed the Er-Roua Mosque in the southern part of Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s Kasbah, which became the largest mosque in Meknes. He also renovated and added a &quot;qubba&quot; over the tomb of Sidi Mohammed ben Aissa (just outside the city walls) and built the current minarets of the Grand Mosque and the Nejjarine Mosque in the old city. The Dar al-Kebira, however, was abandoned and progressively transformed into a residential neighbourhood where the inhabitants constructed their houses within and between the former palace structures of Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s time. In the early 19th century, Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman added a loggia structure in front of Bab al-Mansur which served as a meeting place for ceremonies and the governor&#x27;s tribunal, though this structure was later removed.

===Recent history (20th–21st centuries)===
After the installation of French colonial rule in Morocco in 1912, the French administration created a new city (&quot;Ville Nouvelle&quot;) on a nearby plateau across the valley on the northeast side of the old city. The capital of Morocco was moved from Fes to Rabat, further marginalizing cities like Meknes (which is near Fes). Some traditional Muslim authorities and officials were retained, but Meknes was reorganized under a new French municipal and military regime. This also led to a greater influence of the cities over their surrounding countryside and growing urbanization. The city became a transportation hub for people and goods traveling from east to west or from north to south across the country, in addition to hosting extensive military barracks. The population of Meknes grew from 25,000 at the beginning of the century to over 140,000 by the mid-20th century. Some roads in the old city were widened to accommodate greater circulation, but most of the new development took place in the &quot;Ville Nouvelle&quot;. The new French authorities took interest in the conservation of historic monuments in the old city; the madrasas, for example, were restored in 1922. During this period Meknes also became a center of agriculture and viniculture, led mainly by French colonists who appropriated large amounts of land nearby.

Nonetheless, Meknes, like other cities, also hosted resistance to French authority. In 1937, a particularly serious and violent revolt erupted following attempts to divert the local river to benefit the French settler population during a time of food shortages for the native Moroccan population. A violent suppression of protests took place in the city which results in 13 dead and more injured. Following Morocco&#x27;s independence in 1956, the changes which began or accelerated under French rule continued to run their course. Large scale rural migration increased the population of the city and intensified the urbanization process (as elsewhere in the country). Industries developed around the city&#x27;s perimeter, but at the same time the old elites and bourgeois families moved away to the coastal cities like Casablanca and Rabat.

These changes also contributed to the relative neglect of the old city. According to the ICOMOS Heritage at Risk report of 2000, the historic city of Meknes contains insufficient drainage systems, and as a result, suffers from inundation and leakage in certain areas. Still, some conservation and restoration efforts have taken place in recent years, motivated in part by the revenues of tourism. As of 2023, a number of major restoration projects were planned or underway, led by ADER-Fès (&quot;Agence pour la Dédensification et la Réhabilitation de la Médina de Fès&quot;), a quasi-governmental agency based in Fez. The projects include proposed restorations to the historic city walls, to the Heri es-Swani, and to the Bou Inania Madrasa, along with other improvements to parking and tourism infrastructure.

==Geography==
Meknes is located in a strategic position in the heart of Morocco. To its south and south-east are the rich cedar forests and mountains of the Middle Atlas mountains with the cities Ifrane and Azrou; and more to the south are the rich oases of Tafilalt. To the west are the two largest metropolitan areas of Morocco: Casablanca and Rabat. To the north is the mountainous north of Morocco with the cities of Tangier and Tétouan. Oujda and Fes lie east of Meknes.

===Climate===
Meknes has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with continental influences. Its climate is similar to some inland cities in southern Portugal (such as Beja or Évora) and some areas of southern Spain. The temperatures shifts from cool in winter to hot days in the summer months of June–September. Afternoon temperatures generally rise 10–14 °C above the low on most days. The winter highs typically reach only in December–January, whereas night temperatures average . Snow is rare.

===Districts - Quartiers (in French) ===
===Prefecture===

Meknes is the seat of the prefecture of Meknès, which consists of 6 municipalities (including the city Meknes) and 15 rural communes.

==Historic monuments and landmarks==
The main historic monuments of the city are concentrated in the medina (old city) and the vast former Kasbah of Moulay Ismail to the south. The most notable monuments are listed below.

===Place el-Hedim===

Often compared to the Jemaa el-Fnaa square in Marrakesh, el-Hedim Square (Place el-Hedim) is a vast plaza at the southern end of the old city, before the main gates of Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s former royal palace complex. The square&#x27;s name, el-Hedim, means &quot;the rubble/debris&quot; and refers to the demolitions which Moulay Isma&#x27;il carried out here during the construction of his palaces. He left this open space as a public square to separate his palace from the rest of the city. Since then, the square has become the focus of various activities including evening entertainers such as storytellers, acrobats, and musicians.

===Mosques and madrasas===
* Grand mosque of Meknes: The old city&#x27;s most important mosque and one of its oldest, covering about 3,500 square meters and was founded in the 12th century by the Almoravids, although renovated multiple times since.
* Madrasa Bou Inania: The city&#x27;s most famous madrasa (school for higher learning in Islamic sciences) was established by the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan in 1335-36 but is now named after his son Abu Inan (who may have later restored it). Open to tourists today, it is one of the most richly decorated buildings in the city.
* Nejjarine Mosque: Often reputed to be the oldest in the city, this mosque also dates back to the Almoravid period, though it has been modified multiple times.
* Lalla Aouda Mosque: The main mosque of the city&#x27;s former kasbah and of Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s palaces, it was first founded in the Marinid era but completely rebuilt by Moulay Isma&#x27;il between 1672 and 1678. Its prominent minaret is visible from the adjoining Place Lalla Aouda (Lalla Awda Square).
* Bab Berda&#x27;in Mosque: The mosque, located near the northern gate of the medina (Bab Berda&#x27;in) was completed in 1709 on the orders of Morocco&#x27;s first female minister, Khnata bent Bakkar. The mosque was the site of a tragedy in 2010 when its historic minaret collapsed, killing 41 people. The mosque has since been repaired and its minaret rebuilt.
* Ar-Roua Mosque: The largest mosque in Meknes, it was built by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah between 1757 and 1790. It is located near the Heri al-Mansur palace in the southern part of the Kasbah of Moulay Isma&#x27;il.
* Zitouna Mosque: A large mosque founded by Sultan Moulay Isma&#x27;il around 1687.
* Zawiya of Sidi Mohammed Ben Aissa: Also known as the Mausoleum of Sheikh al-Kamel. An important mausoleum and religious complex (&quot;zawiya&quot;) just outside the city walls to the northwest, originally dating from the late 18th century but restored later. Mohamed ben &#x27;Aissa, founder of the Aissawiya, a major Sufi brotherhood in Morocco, is buried here. He is considered the patron saint of Meknes, and his annual &quot;moussem&quot; (festival) is one of the most intense and was historically known for its displays of self-mutilation.
* Zawiya of Sidi Kaddour el-Alami: A richly-decorated mosque and religious complex honoring the tomb of Sidi Kaddour el-Alami, a famous Moroccan poet who died in 1850.
===Fortifications and gates===
* Bab Mansur al-&#x27;Alj: The most famous gateway of the city (also known as Bab Mansour or Bab el-Mansur), this gate overlooks the southern end of Place el-Hedim and acted as the ceremonial grand entrance to the Kasbah of Moulay Isma&#x27;il. It was begun in the later years of Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s reign and finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. Its name comes from the architect and designer of the gate, Mansour al-&#x27;Alj (the &quot;Victorious Apostate&quot;), a former Christian slave who converted to Islam. It is notable for its size and its rich decoration consisting of &quot;darj-wa-ktaf&quot; motifs carved into brick, filled with colourful &quot;zellij&quot; (mosaic tilework), and topped by a long and elaborate Arabic inscription painted on tile.
*Bab Jama&#x27; an-Nouar: Another ornate gate located next to Bab Mansur; also called Bab al-Nuwwar in some sources.
*Bab ad-Dar al-Kebira: The monumental gate entrance to the Dar al-Kebira palace, dating to 1679–80.
* Bab el-Khemis: A monumental western gate of the city, near the former Mellah, dating from 1687 under the reign of Moulay Ismail and richly decorated with motifs and &quot;zellij&quot; similar to Bab al-Mansur.
* Bab al-Barda&#x27;in: The monumental northern gate of the city, also built by Moulay Isma&#x27;il and richly decorated.
* Borj Belkari: A bastion tower built in the 17th century as a part of the defensive walls of the Kasbah of Sultan Moulay Ismail in Meknes, Morocco. Since 2003 it holds a pottery museum.
===Imperial Palaces of Moulay Isma&#x27;il===
The palace complex or &quot;imperial city&quot; of Sultan Moulay Isma&#x27;il was constructed over his entire 55-year reign from 1672 to 1727 (with some elements finished or remodeled shortly after). It occupies the site of the city&#x27;s former medieval kasbah (citadel) and stretches over an area approximately four times larger than the old city itself. It was composed of several autonomous palaces along with vast gardens, religious buildings, and other amenities. The complex was also notable for its impressive infrastructure, which included a water supply system with a hydraulic system of wells, norias (water extraction mechanism powered by wheel), canals, and underground pipes which distributed water to the royal city&#x27;s many buildings. It also contained numerous monumental granaries and underground warehouses which stockpiled supplies that could allegedly sustain the city for a siege of ten years. Below is a list of some of its main areas and monuments.

* Place Lalla Aouda: A vast open square which stands behind (southeast of) Bab al-Mansur, which served as the former &quot;mechouar&quot; of the palace. It precedes the former Dar al-Kebira palace and gives access to the Lalla Aouda Mosque.
* Dar el-Kebira: The oldest palace in the kasbah, finished in 1679 and itself composed of multiple palaces. Its name means &quot;the Great House&quot;. It was the private residence of the sultan and his family, connected directly to the Lalla Aouda Mosque and the later royal mausoleum. The palace fell into ruin after Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s death (and after the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake), and has since become a residential neighbourhood where common people built their houses amidst the remains of Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s massive palace walls, still visible in various places.
* Mausoleum of Moulay Isma&#x27;il: The royal mausoleum and funerary complex of Moulay Isma&#x27;il and some of his family members and successors. It was built under his reign but significantly modified by Ahmad ad-Dhahabi between 1727 and 1729. The funerary complex was originally entered from the dar al-Kebira to the north but is nowadays entered by a 20th-century gate to the south. Still considered a religious site today, it is also open to tourists. It is composed of relatively austere courtyards leading to a richly-decorated indoor patio chamber, which in turn grants access to the tomb chamber of the sultan.
* Qubbat al-Khayyatin and the Qara Prison: The Qubbat al-Khayyatin is a standalone audience chamber or throne room where Moulay Isma&#x27;il once received foreign ambassadors. Underground, right next to it, is a large subterranean vaulted space known as the Qara Prison or Habs Qara. Although frequently described as a prison for Christian slaves, scholars agree that it was in fact a storage area and granary, one of many such structures throughout the royal city.
* Dar al-Makhzen: This vast walled enclosure, much larger and more rationally organized than the Dar el-Kebira, contained extensive gardens and two more main palaces in Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s time, some of which have been restored or adapted for current use as one of the royal residences of the King of Morocco. The enclosure, generally known as the Dar al-Makhzen (not to be confused with the royal palaces of the same name in Fez and elsewhere), was divided into two sections. The western section was mostly occupied by the Bahrawiya Gardens but also contained a long narrow palace on its northern edge known as the Dar al-Madrasa (&quot;House of the School&quot;), most likely another private palace of the sultan. The eastern section, which is still entered via an ornate royal gate on its eastern perimeter (north of Heri es-Swani), was mostly occupied by the Qasr al-Muhannasha (&quot;Palace of the Labyrinth&quot;). This palace consisted of roughly eight large courtyards or garden enclosures and acted as both a reception palace and an administrative palace.
* Heri as-Swani and the Sahrij (Agdal Basin): The Sahrij or Agdal Basin is an enormous water basin or artificial lake south of the Dar al-Makhzen, which was originally a part of the royal city&#x27;s water supply system. It measures 148.75 by 319 meters and is, on average, 1.2 meters deep. Next to it, on its eastern side, is an enormous structure composed of two parts: the &quot;House of the Ten Norias&quot; or Dar al-Ma (&quot;House of Water&quot;) and the Heri as-Swani (also spelled as Heri es-Souani). The first of these is a monumental building of vaulted passages and domed chambers which contained a number of wheel-powered hydraulic mechanisms (norias) which drew water from the phreatic table underground to the surface, after which it was delivered into the Sahrij or redistributed to the city. The second part, the Heri as-Swani, is attached to the south side of this building and is made up of 22 rows of monumental arches which once held up a vaulted roof (which has since collapsed). Although frequently misidentified as the &quot;royal stables&quot; of the palace, this structure was, once again, a massive granary and storehouse. Grain was originally delivered to the building by mules who climbed onto a roof terrace and dropped the grain directly into holes pierced above each vaulted chamber.
* Heri al-Mansur: One of the last constructions of Moulay Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s reign, built between 1721 and 1725, its name means &quot;Granary/silo of Victory&quot;, but it was also known as Dar al-Mansur or Qasr al-Mansur (&quot;Palace of Victory&quot;). It is located on the far southern perimeter of the Kasbah and consists of a massive building which seems to have served as a palace, fortress, and storehouse. The basement was taken up by storage rooms while the upper floor held reception rooms for the palace with views over the surrounding area. Located next to it were the Royal Stables of Moulay Isma&#x27;il (often misidentified today with the Heri as-Swani), which were reputed to be one of the palace city&#x27;s most impressive features. It consisted of horse stalls sheltered under two parallel arcades (rows of arches) which stretched for 1200 meters on either side of a water canal which provided water for the horses. Unfortunately, the stables have not been preserved and very little remains of them today.
===Synagogues===
*The Rabbi Meir Toledano Synagogue still stands in Meknes today. According to tradition, it was first built in the 13th century and rebuilt by the Toledano family in 1646.
*The Etz Hayeem synagogue in Meknes is also a historical synagogue.
===Museums===
* Dar Jamaï Museum: The best-known museum in Meknes, housing a number of artifacts and art objects from the city and other regions in Morocco. It is housed in a late 19th-century palace with gardens and ornate rooms built in 1882 by Mokhtar ben Larbi Jamai, who served as Grand Vizier under Sultan Moulay Hassan (ruled 1873–1894). His family also built the Jamai Palace in Fes.
* Musée de Meknès (Meknes Museum): A small museum housed in a structure just northeast of Bab al-Mansur, exhibiting artifacts from all over Morocco.
===Outlying sites===
The ruins of the Roman town of Volubilis (Oualili), another UNESCO World Heritage Site, are about half an hour to the north, as is the village and important pilgrimage site of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun.

==Economy==
Meknes is an economic centre in Morocco with various products from three sectors (agriculture, industry and services), which makes the city economically competitive and attractive for investment.

===Competitiveness===
A December 2015 World Bank report classified Meknes as one of the three most competitive cities in Africa. Two of those three competitive African cities are Moroccan: Meknes and Tangier.

===Agriculture===
Meknes is considered to be the capital of agriculture in Morocco. And the Saïss plain is one of the most fertile and rich plains in Morocco and Meknes is the centre of this plain.

Each year Meknes holds the International Agriculture Show in Morocco (French: Salon International de l&#x27;Agriculture au Maroc) since April 2006. This agriculture show has an area of more than 250000 square meters, with more than 60 countries participating, and more than 1200 exhibitors.
The lands around Meknes area are known to be fertile and productive. The high elevation, fertility and the fresh water of those lands favor the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, most notably: peaches, nectarines, prunes, apples, potatoes, onions and garlic. Meknes is also known for its olives and olive oil. Livestock raising, particularly sheep and cattle, is widespread. Meknes has large industrial units for milk and dairy production that fulfill most of the needs of the region.

===Industry===
Industry in Meknes is of light type, most of it is related to food processing especially in the Commune of Mejjat, and chemical and para-chemical industry in other industrial zones like the Agropolis industrial and agribusiness zone. Add to those the textile and metallic manufacturing which are old industries in the city. The year 2016 marks a new era of industry in the city of Meknes; it includes electrical wire, embedded systems, and automotive parts production companies.

====Major companies====
===Services===
Many of the services products in Meknes are related to tourism due to the attractions of the old city district (the &quot;medina&quot;).

==Transport==

===Road===
The geographical location of the city of Meknes makes it one of the important transport hubs in Morocco. The city is accessed via the A2 expressway with two exits, one to the east of the city and another to the west.

<doc id="398085" wikidata="Q55504" url="?curid=398085" title="Battle of Azaz (1125)">
<text>The Battle of Azaz was a major battle fought between king Baldwin II&#x27;s crusader forces and the Muslims, led by Aq-Sunqur al-Bursuqi, the Seljuq atabeg of Mosul on 11 June 1125. Being one of the bloodiest confrontations before the Second Crusade, the battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Crusaders, causing disturbances of power in the Levant and weakened Seljuk domination in the area. Contemporary chronicler Matthew of Edessa even states that the remnants of al-Bursuqi&#x27;s army were chased all the way to Aleppo. The battle effectively lifted the siege of the town of Azaz and prevented it from falling to Turkoman hands. (One authority says the battle was fought on June 13.)

==Background==
Joscelin I of Edessa had captured Azaz in northern Syria from the atabeg of Aleppo in 1118. The next year the Crusaders under Roger of Salerno were severely defeated at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, and King Baldwin II of Jerusalem was captured while patrolling in Edessa in 1123.

==Prelude==
In 1124 Baldwin II was released, and almost immediately he laid siege to Aleppo on October 8, 1124. This caught the attention of al-Bursuqi, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul. Al-Bursuqi marched south to relieve the siege of Aleppo, which was nearing the point of surrender in January 1125 after a three-month siege. In spite of the city being &quot;the greatest prize the war could offer&quot;, Baldwin cautiously withdrew without a fight.

==Battle==
Later, al-Bursuqi (who had received troops also by Toghtekin of Damascus) besieged the town of Azaz, to the north of Aleppo, in territory belonging to the County of Edessa. Baldwin II, Leo I of Armenia, Joscelin I, and Pons of Tripoli, with a force of 1,100 knights from their respective territories (including knights from Antioch, where Baldwin was regent), as well as 2,000 infantry, met al-Bursuqi outside Azaz, where the Seljuk atabeg had gathered his much larger force. Baldwin pretended to retreat, thereby drawing the Seljuks away from Azaz into the open where they were surrounded. After a long and bloody battle, the Seljuks were defeated and their camp captured by Baldwin, who took enough loot to ransom the prisoners taken by the Seljuks (including the future Joscelin II of Edessa).

===Casualties===
The number of Muslim troops killed was more than 1,000, according to Ibn al-Athir. William of Tyre gave 24 dead for the Crusaders and 2,000 for the Muslims. Fulcher of Chartres suggested 5 emirs and 2,000 soldiers dead, while Matthew of Edessa estimated 15 emirs and 5,000 troops killed.

==Aftermath==
Al-Bursuqi retired to Aleppo, leaving his son Masud as governor and crossed the Euphrates to Mosul, where he gathered troops to renew the fight. Apart from relieving Azaz, this victory allowed the Crusaders to regain much of the influence they had lost after their defeat at Ager Sanguinis in 1119. Baldwin planned to attack Aleppo as well, but Antioch, which passed to Bohemund II when he came of age in 1126, ceased cooperating with Edessa and the plan fell through. Aleppo and Mosul were united under the much stronger ruler Zengi in 1128, and Crusader control of northern Syria began to weaken.

<doc id="398093" wikidata="Q12428" url="?curid=398093" title="Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)">
<text>The Battle of Dorylaeum took place during the First Crusade on 1 July 1097 between the crusader forces and the Seljuk Turks, near the city of Dorylaeum in Anatolia. Though the Turkish forces of Kilij Arslan nearly destroyed the Crusader contingent of Bohemond, other Crusaders arrived just in time to reverse the course of the battle.

==Background==
The crusaders had left Nicaea on 26 June 1097, with a deep distrust of the Byzantines, who had taken the city without their knowledge after the lengthy siege of Nicaea. In order to simplify the problem of supplies, the Crusader army had split into two groups; the weaker led by Bohemond of Taranto, his nephew Tancred, Robert Curthose, Robert of Flanders, and the Byzantine general Tatikios in the vanguard, and Godfrey of Bouillon, his brother Baldwin of Boulogne, Raymond IV of Toulouse, Stephen II of Blois, and Hugh of Vermandois in the rear.

On 29 June, they learnt that the Turks were planning an ambush near Dorylaeum (Bohemond noticed that his army was being shadowed by Turkish scouts). The Turkish force consisted of Kilij Arslan and his ally Hasan of Cappadocia, along with help from the Danishmends, led by the Turkish prince Gazi Gümüshtigin. Contemporary figures place the number of Turks as between 25,000 and 30,000, with more recent estimates between 6,000 and 8,000 men.
However, several sources give much higher Turkish numbers: 150,000 men according to Raymond of Aguilers and 360,000 men reported by Fulcher of Chartres, neither of which are considered possible by modern historians due to the lack of supplies for so many men and horses, and the Turkish use of hit-and-run horse archer tactics, indicating a smaller army.

Bohemond&#x27;s force probably numbered about 10,000 (not counting a large number of noncombatants), the majority on foot. Military figures of the time often imply perhaps several men-at-arms, spearmen, archers or crossbowmen per knight (i.e., a stated force of 500 knights is assumed to contain an additional 1,500 soldiers), so it seems reasonable that Bohemond had with him approximately 2,000 cavalry and 8,000 foot soldiers.

On the evening of 30 June, after a three-day march, Bohemond&#x27;s army made camp in a meadow on the north bank of the river Thymbres, near the ruined town of Dorylaeum, believed to be the site of the modern city of Eskişehir.

==Battle==

On 1 July, Bohemond&#x27;s force was surrounded outside Dorylaeum by Kilij Arslan. Godfrey and Raymond had separated from the vanguard, and the Turkish army attacked at dawn, taking Bohemond&#x27;s army (not expecting such a swift attack) entirely by surprise, shooting arrows into the camp. Bohemond&#x27;s knights had quickly mounted but their sporadic counterattacks were unable to deter the Turks. The Turks were riding into camp, cutting down noncombatants and unarmoured foot soldiers, who were unable to outrun the Turkish horses and were too disoriented and panic-stricken to form lines of battle. To protect the unarmoured foot and noncombatants, Bohemond ordered his knights to dismount and form a defensive line, and with some trouble gathered the foot soldiers and the noncombatants into the centre of the camp; the women acted as water-carriers throughout the battle. While this formed a battle line and sheltered the more vulnerable men-at-arms and noncombatants, it also gave the Turks free rein to maneuver on the battlefield.

The Turkish mounted archers attacked in their usual style – charging in, shooting their arrows, and quickly retreating before the crusaders could counterattack. The archers did little damage to the heavily armoured knights, but inflicted heavy casualties on their horses and on the unarmoured foot soldiers. Bohemond had sent messengers to the other Crusader army and now struggled to hold on until help arrived, and his army was being forced back to the bank of the Thymbris river. The marshy riverbanks protected the crusaders from mounted charge, as the ground was too soft for horses, and the armoured knights formed a circle protecting the foot soldiers and noncombatants from arrows, but the Turks kept their archers constantly supplied and the sheer number of arrows was taking its toll, reportedly more than 2,000 falling to horse-archers. Bohemond&#x27;s knights were impetuous – although ordered to stand ground, small groups of knights would periodically break ranks and charge, only to be slaughtered or forced back as the Turkish horses fell back beyond range of their swords and arrows, while still shooting at them with arrows, killing many of the knights&#x27; horses out from under them. And although the knights&#x27; armour protected them well (the Turks called them &#x27;men of iron&#x27;) the sheer number of arrows meant that some would find unprotected spots and eventually, after so many hits, a knight would collapse from his wounds.

Just after midday, Godfrey arrived with a force of 50 knights, fighting through the Turkish lines to reinforce Bohemond. Through the day small groups of reinforcements (also from Raymond, and Hugh, as well as Godfrey) arrived, some killed by the Turks, others fighting to reach Bohemond&#x27;s camp. As the Crusader losses mounted, the Turks became more aggressive and the Crusader army found itself forced from the marshy banks of the river into the shallows. But the Crusaders held on, and after approximately 7 hours of battle, Raymond&#x27;s knights arrived (it is unclear if Raymond was with them, or if they arrived ahead of Raymond), launching a vicious surprise attack across the Turkish flank that turned them back in disarray and allowed the Crusaders to rally.

The Crusaders had formed a line of battle with Bohemond, Tancred, Robert Curthose, and Stephen on the left wing, Raymond, Robert II of Flanders in the center and Godfrey and Hugh on the right, and they rallied against the Turks, proclaiming &quot;hodie omnes divites si Deo placet effecti eritis&quot; (&quot;today if it pleases God you will all become rich&quot;). Although the ferocity of the Crusader attack took the Turks by surprise, they were unable to dislodge the Turks until a force led by bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate, arrived in mid-afternoon, perhaps with Raymond in the van, moving around the battle through concealing hills and across the river, outflanking the archers on the left and surprising the Turks from the rear. Adhemar&#x27;s force fell on the Turkish camp, and attacked the Turks from the rear. The Turks were terrified by the sight of their camp in flames, and by the ferocity and endurance of the knights, since the knights&#x27; armour protected them from arrows and even many sword cuts, and they promptly fled, abandoning their camp and forcing Kilij Arslan to withdraw from the battlefield.

==Aftermath==
The crusaders did indeed become rich, at least for a short time, after capturing Kilij Arslan&#x27;s treasury. The Turks fled and Arslan turned to other concerns in his eastern territory. Arslan punitively took the male Greek children from the region extending from Dorylaeum to Iconium, sending many as slaves to Persia. On the other hand, the crusaders were allowed to march virtually unopposed through Anatolia on their way to Antioch. It took almost three months to cross Anatolia in the heat of the summer, and in October they began the Siege of Antioch.

With the Crusader army moved onwards towards Antioch, emperor Alexios I Komnenos achieved part of his original intent in inviting the Crusaders in the first place: the recovery of Seljuk-held imperial territories in Asia Minor. John Doukas re-established Byzantine rule in Chios, Rhodes, Smyrna, Ephesus, Sardis, and Philadelphia in 1097–1099. This success is ascribed by Alexios&#x27; daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and falseness.

The &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; did praise the Turkish army&#x27;s bravery and superhuman efforts at Dorylaeum. It stated &quot;Had the Turks been Christian, they would have been the finest of races.&quot;

<text>Afghanistan is a mountainous landlocked country at the crossroads of Central Asia and South Asia. Some of the invaders in the history of Afghanistan include the Maurya Empire, the ancient Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great, the Rashidun Caliphate, the Mongol Empire led by Genghis Khan, the Ghaznavid Empire of Turkic Mahmud of Ghazni, the Ghurid Dynasty of Muhammad of Ghor the Timurid Empire of Timur, the Mughal Empire, various Persian Empires, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and most recently the United States with a number of allies in response to the September 11 attacks. A reduced number of NATO troops remained in the country in support of the government. Just prior to the American withdrawal in 2021, the Taliban regained control of the capital Kabul and most of the country. They changed Afghanistan&#x27;s official name to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

==Purpose==
From a geopolitical perspective, controlling Afghanistan is vital in acquiring a passage through Central Asia or controlling the rest of South Asia, reflecting its geographic position in the region. Afghanistan played an important part in the Great Game power struggles. Historically, the conquest of Afghanistan has also played an important role in the invasion of India from the west through the Khyber Pass.

==History of Afghanistan==

===Persian conquests===
While relatively little detail is known, parts of the region of modern day Afghanistan came under rule of the Medians for a short time.

Afghanistan fell to the Achaemenid Empire after it was conquered by Darius I of Persia. The area was divided into several provinces called satrapies, which were each ruled by a governor, or satrap. These ancient satrapies included: Aria (Herat); Arachosia (Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, Bamiyan and Quetta); Bactriana (Balkh); and Gandhara (Kabul and Peshawar).

===Macedonian, Indian, and Kushan conquests===
Alexander the Great invaded what is today Afghanistan in 330 BC as part of war against Persia. Comprising the easternmost satrapies of Persia, Afghanistan provided some challenging battles in his conquest of the remaining lands of Persia. Renamed Bactria, and settled with his Ionian veterans, Alexander began his invasion of India from what is now Jalalabad, attacking the Indus River basin through the Khyber Pass. Several cities in Afghanistan are named for Alexander, including Alexandria Arachosia, now called Kandahar (a contraction of &quot;Iskandahar&quot;). Following the death of Alexander and the partition of his kingdom, the Province of Bactria was under the rule of Alexander&#x27;s former general, Seleucus, who now formed the Seleucid dynasty, with its capital in Babylon. Seleucus was defeated by Mauryan king Chandragupta Maurya who annexed modern-day Kandhara and other parts of lower Afghanistan into his empire. Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta would patronize Buddhism all over the empire which would lead be the dominant religion in the region until the Islamic conquest of the region. The Greek soldiers in Bactria, based on the remoteness of their territory, declared independence, defeated Seleucid armies sent to reconquer them, and founded the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, which lasted for more than three centuries in Afghanistan. This Greek kingdom called Bactria carried on Greek culture while completely cut off from Europe for three centuries. One of the cities, Ai-Khanoum was excavated in 1970s, showing a complete Greek city with an acropolis, amphitheater, temples, and numerous statues. Greek art has been found in Bactria showing influence from Indian Buddhist art creating something of an hybrid artistic style. Bactrian King Menander I converted to Buddhism after staging multiple theological and philosophical debates between his Greek priests and Indian Buddhist monks. Menander I is remembered in Buddhist Sutras as &quot;King Milinda of the Yunani&quot;. The Ionian origin of the Greek veterans who settled Bactria is remembered to this day by the Afghan word for Greeks, which is &quot;Ionani&quot;. Bactrian Greeks left a legacy of coinage, architecture, and Buddhist art, which comprised the Gandhara culture, especially the Greco-Buddhist art affecting all of East Asia to this day. The last Greek kingdom in Afghanistan was conquered by the Kushan invaders in the first century AD, a full three centuries after Alexander. However, the Greek language continued to be used by the Kushans in their coinage for the next several centuries.

===Conquest by Arab caliphates===
In 1459, the following the disintegration of the Sasanian and Roman Empires, leaders in the world theater for the last four centuries and arch-rivals, the area was again invaded from the west, this time by Umar, second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, in the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan, eventually resulting in the willing conversion of most of its inhabitants to Islam. This occurred over many centuries by Afghans willingly converting or by Afghan leaders who pressured certain populations in the land to convert such as Abdul Rahman Khan forcing the Nuristanis to convert to Islam. This was one of many Muslim conquests following the establishment of a unified state in the Arabian Peninsula by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At its height, Muslim control - during the period of the Umayyad Caliphate - extended from the borders of China to Southern France (modern-day Spain and Portugal), the Middle East, North Africa, parts of Southern Europe, parts of Southeast Europe, parts of Central Asia, and parts of South Asia.

===Mongol conquests===
In the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire (1219–1221), Genghis Khan invaded the region from the northeast in one of his many conquests to create the huge Mongol Empire. His armies slaughtered thousands in the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, Jalalabad,Bamyan, etc. After Genghis Khan returned to Mongolia, there was a rebellion in the region of Helmand which was brutally put down by his son and successor, Ogedei Khan, who killed all male residents of Ghazni and Helmand in 1222; the women were enslaved and sold. Thereafter, most parts of Afghanistan other than the extreme southeast remained under Mongol rule as part of the Ilkhanate and the Turko-Mongol Chagatai Khanate.

The Hazaras claim to be descendants of the Mongol (Turko-Mongol) and Turkic invaders mixed with the local indigenous Turkic and Iranic populations, though this is disputed because the first mention of Hazara people is made by Babur in the 16th century. Additionally, many areas of Afghanistan are named after Mongol and Turkic leaders, including Band-e-Timur (meaning &quot;Timur&#x27;s block&quot;) in Maywand District in Kandahar Province, the only district never taken from the Taliban throughout the western invasion of the 21st century, Jaghatu District in Ghazni Province, and Jaghatu District in Maidan Wardak province (named in honor of the Turko-Mongol Chagatai Khanate) and the village of Wech Baghtu in Shah Wali Kot District in Kandahar province, named after Batu.

===Conquest by Timur and the Mughal Empire===
From 1383 to 1385, the Afghanistan area was conquered from the north by Timur, leader of neighboring Transoxiana (roughly modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and adjacent areas), and became a part of the Timurid Empire. Timur was from a Turko-Mongol tribe and although a Muslim, saw himself more as an heir of Genghis Khan. Timur&#x27;s armies caused great devastation and are estimated to have caused the deaths of 17 million people. He brought great destruction on Afghanistan&#x27;s south, slaughtering thousands and enslaving an equal number of women. Allied with the Uzbeks, Hazaras, and other Turkic communities in the north his dominance over Afghanistan was long-lasting, allowing him for his future successful conquests in Central Anatolia against the Ottomans.

In the next period, no part of Afghanistan ever came under rule of various Delhi Sultanate. After the slow disintegration of the Timurid Empire in 1506, the Mughal Empire was later established in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India by Babur in 1526, who was a descendant of Timur through his father and possibly a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother. By the 17th century, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India, but later declined during the 18th century.

===British invasions: 1838–1842, 1878–1880, and 1919===
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Afghanistan was invaded three times from British India.

The First Anglo-Afghan War of 1838–1842 was conducted with the intention of limiting Russian influence in the country and quelling raiding from across the border. Within four years the British were expelled. After the Indian Mutiny, the British launched a second invasion, the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878–1880, for much the same reasons but did not attempt to maintain a permanent presence. A third conflict broke out in 1919. It lasted for three months, from May to August, and ended in a compromise that saw Afghanistan reassert its independence and control over its relations with other countries while agreeing to a border with British India known as the Durand Line. This line is still the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan today.

===Soviet invasions: 1929, 1930, and 1979===

The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1929 against the Saqqawists and again in 1930 to fight the Basmachi movement.

The Soviet Union, along with other countries, was a direct supporter of the new Afghan government after the Saur Revolution in April 1978. However, Soviet-style reforms introduced by the government such as changes in marriage customs and land reform were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and Islam. The oppressive nature of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which executed political prisoners and purged the government of any opposition, was also seen unfavorably by the Afghan population. By 1979, fighting between the Afghan government and various other factions within the country, some of which were supported by the United States and other countries, led to a virtual civil war. In a phone call to the Kremlin in March 1979, Afghan Prime Minister Nur Muhammad Taraki requested military assistance. This was refused by Soviet prime minister Alexei Kosygin on behalf of the Politburo.

After Taraki was murdered the new Afghan Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin repeated requests for Soviet military support, at least to protect his residence. Finally, in December, the Politburo decided to deal with the situation in Afghanistan, and in early December sent special forces which attacked Amin&#x27;s palace and killed him, putting the exiled Babrak Kamal in his place. These forces were subsequently reinforced by the 40th Army which entered Afghanistan on 24 December 1979. As the Kremlin foresaw, this intervention would cause problems around the world for the USSR, with the policy of détente and, not least, at the forthcoming Olympic Games due to take place in summer 1980 in Moscow. The result was a far-reaching boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, supported not only by the United States but by many of the 65 other invited countries that did not take part.

At its greatest extent the Soviet military contingent in Afghanistan numbered 100,000 personnel. This presence remained for a decade and kick-started US and Saudi funding for Islamic mujahideen groups opposed to both the Afghan government and the Soviet military presence. The local mujahideen, along with fighters from several different Arab nations (Pathan tribes from across the border also participated in the war; they were supported by the Pakistani ISI), fought the Soviet forces to a standstill. On 24 January 1989, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s Politburo took the decision to withdraw most of the Soviet forces, while continuing to provide military assistance to the Afghan government. Eventually, in-fighting within the Mujahideen led to the rise of warlords in Afghanistan, and from them emerged the Taliban. The Soviets left behind the only highway in the country as well as many concrete structures built in the major cities, and airfields that are still in use (e.g. at Bagram).

===American invasion and counterinsurgency: October 2001 – August 2021===

On 7 October 2001 the United States began an invasion of Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. The invasion was launched to capture Osama bin Laden, who was the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, and was being sheltered by the Taliban. The US military forces did not capture him, though they toppled the Taliban government and disrupted bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda network. On 2 May 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed by US forces in Pakistan. The Taliban leadership persisted by hiding throughout Afghanistan, largely in the southeast, and launched guerrilla attacks against forces of the United States, its allies, and the government of President Ashraf Ghani.

In 2006, the US forces turned over security of the country to NATO-deployed forces in the region, integrating 12,000 of their 20,000 soldiers with NATO&#x27;s 20,000. The remainder of the US forces continued to search for Al-Qaeda militants. The Canadian military assumed leadership and almost immediately began an offensive against areas where the Taliban guerrillas had encroached. At the cost of a few dozen of their own soldiers, the British, American, and Canadian forces managed to kill over 1,000 alleged Taliban insurgents and sent thousands more into retreat. Many of the surviving insurgents, however, began to regroup and soon after began to engage both NATO and Afghan National Army forces, starting a protracted war that lasted until 2021, with the withdrawal of Western forces and the Taliban takeover of Kabul.

<text>Yehoshua Porath (; January 13, 1938 – November 24, 2019) was an Israeli historian and professor of Middle East history.

==Academic career==
Yehoshua Porath was a lecturer in the History of Muslim Countries at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He specialized in the history of Palestinian nationalism. Porat won the Landau Prize and the Ben-Zvi Prize for his book on Yonatan Ratosh. His other research included:

* Communism in Arab Israeli communities
* Maronite Peasants&#x27; Revolt in Lebanon 1858-1860
* Palestine, Arab unity and British policy 1930–1945

==Political views==
Porath was on the Meretz list in the 1992 Israeli elections for the Knesset. He later readjusted his political views. He opposed the Oslo accords between PLO and Israel. In the 1996 elections he participated in the campaign of the Likud party and supported Benjamin Netanyahu for prime minister. The change in his political affiliations came due to the issue of whether or not the PLO would change the anti-Israel articles in its covenant. Porath was asked to translate recordings of the meeting of the Palestine National Council which had pledged to make the changes. Porath argued they had not, despite the Meretz and Labor parties insisting that they had.

Since 1967 he argued that peace must be reached with Jordan and that this could not be done with representatives of Palestinian Arabs.

Porath defined himself as a &quot;moderate, liberal and secular center man.&quot; He opposed the reestablishment of Jewish community in Gaza after the Six Day War, but opposed their forced removal in the Disengagement of 2005.

He was active in the Secular Movement and the Free People&#x27;s Movement and had been an active member of the Shinui party. &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that his wife said he &quot;loved the Bible as a text.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He lived in Jerusalem, and was married to Penina. They had two children. He died on November 24, 2019, in Jerusalem and was buried the next day in Kibbutz Nahshon cemetery.

==Published works in English==
* &quot;The Emergence of the Palestinian-Arab National Movement, 1918–1929&quot;, Cass (1974) 
* &quot;In Search of Arab Unity, 1930–1945&quot;, Cass (1986)

The character is later resurrected as a ghola, appearing in &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s novels which complete the original series.

Chani is portrayed by actress Sean Young in the David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), and by Barbora Kodetová in the 2000 John Harrison miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The character is played by Zendaya in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its .

==Character overview==
===&quot;Dune&quot;===
In &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul&#x27;s prescience begins manifesting itself through dreams while he is still living in his ancestral home on the planet Caladan; he sees Chani in these visions, though they have not yet met. Paul and the Atreides come to the desert planet Arrakis, but Paul&#x27;s father Duke Leto is soon killed by the Harkonnens and Paul and his mother Lady Jessica are forced to flee into the desert. They are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the planet&#x27;s native Fremen, and Chani is the Fremen woman put in charge of protecting and guiding Paul. They soon become lovers, and Paul rises as a religious leader among the Fremen, and is called Muad&#x27;Dib.

Already a talented warrior before meeting Paul, Chani becomes deadly after training by Paul and Jessica in the Bene Gesserit martial arts called the &quot;weirding way&quot; by the Fremen. Chani later manages to bring Paul out of the deep spice trance he falls into after using spice essence to enhance his powers. Paul and Chani&#x27;s first child, Leto II (not to be confused with their later son, Leto II Atreides), is killed as an infant in a Corrino raid on their home in the deep desert.

To cement his control of the Empire after deposing Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Paul takes Shaddam&#x27;s daughter, the Princess Irulan, as his wife. Chani understands the political reasons, but Paul reassures her:

&quot;I swear to you now ... that you&#x27;ll need no title. That woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing and we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the Landsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of desire.&quot;
Jessica adds:

&quot;Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she&#x27;ll live as less than a concubine—never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she&#x27;s bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine—history will call us wives.&quot;
===&quot;Dune Messiah&quot;===
Twelve years later in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Paul remains completely loyal to Chani. With their breeding program in mind, the Bene Gesserit are desperate to regain control of Paul&#x27;s bloodline, and are fearful of the effect Chani&#x27;s &quot;wild&quot; genes may have on their offspring. Wishing to rid himself of their machinations, Paul negotiates with the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam: &quot;You may have my seed, but not my person ... Irulan banished and inseminated ... You may have my seed for your plans, but no child of Irulan&#x27;s will sit on my throne.&quot; Artificial insemination is prohibited in the wake of the Butlerian Jihad, and the idea of it is as horrific to the Sisterhood as the loss of the &quot;precious Atreides genes&quot;.

Irulan, herself Bene Gesserit-trained, secretly feeds Chani contraceptives to prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. However, Chani eventually changes to an ancient Fremen diet to enhance fertility; Irulan is unable to interfere, and Chani soon becomes pregnant. Tragically, Chani dies giving birth to the twins Ghanima and Leto II. His intricate plan coming to fruition, the Tleilaxu agent Scytale offers to &quot;resurrect&quot; Chani as a ghola in return for Tleilaxu control of the empire, but Paul has him killed. Through his prescience, Paul can see that Chani&#x27;s death during childbirth is far less painful and cruel than her possible future fates had she survived.

===&quot;Children of Dune&quot;===
Despite her death, Chani lives on as part of the Other Memory of her pre-born twins. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, this ancestral self is summoned by Ghanima for her guidance, but Chani&#x27;s persona nearly possesses Ghanima completely. Leto II manages to save his sister from this Abomination by summoning Paul through his own Other Memory; Paul threatens Chani, who releases her hold on Ghanima. At the end of the novel, Chani&#x27;s memory-self becomes a guardian against Ghanima&#x27;s other ancestral memories who may try to possess her, allowing her daughter&#x27;s personality to continue and grow in safety.

===&quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;===
According to &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, a version of Chani&#x27;s memory-self also exists in Leto II. By the time of the novel, Leto is able to allow his ancestral memories to speak through his mouth without threat of Abomination. At one point, he allows Chani to speak through him.

===&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;===
In the 2006 Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson sequel &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, gholas of Paul and Chani are among the others created to assist mankind in the climactic battle with what turns out to be the thinking machines.

In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), Paul ultimately duels another Paul Atreides ghola — named Paolo — created by the Face Dancers and twisted by the sadistic ghola of Baron Harkonnen himself. Paul is mortally wounded, but the trauma restores his memories and he manages to heal himself. Later, on the recovering planet Dune, the awakened gholas of Paul and Chani go about restoring the planet to its former glory. They have reverted to the ways of the ancient Fremen, resolving to lead simple lives and unafraid of the plots and schemes that had threatened them in their previous lives. Now able to devote all of his attention to her, Chani remarks that Paul has finally learned how to treat his wife. As the novel closes, Paul reaffirms his love for Chani, telling her he has loved her for five thousand years.

==In adaptations==
Chani is portrayed by actress Sean Young in the David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot; (1984),

Barbora Kodetová plays Chani in the John Harrison miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; (2000) and its sequel &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot; (2003). Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; wrote that &quot;Kodetová is divine as Chani in both her sensitivity and fierceness&quot;.

Zendaya portrays Chani in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 sequel, &quot;&quot;. Zendaya&#x27;s portrayal of Chani, along with Timothée Chalamet&#x27;s Paul, were added to &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; in October 2021. Villeneuve&#x27;s depiction of Chani is relatively different from her portrayal in the books: where Herbert wrote her as fiercely loyal to Paul and his cause, in the film Chani is shown to grow increasingly alarmed at Paul&#x27;s rise in power and doubtful of his proclaimed love for her. When he pledges to marry Princess Irulan and gains the Emperor&#x27;s power, Chani refuses to bow to him and departs on a sandworm. Villeneuve notes that &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; was written partly to make clear Herbert&#x27;s intention that Paul was an anti-hero, with Chani&#x27;s depiction in the film serving as set-up for Villeneuve&#x27;s planned &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; adaptation.

<doc id="398109" wikidata="Q7996093" url="?curid=398109" title="Whitehouse.com">
<text>whitehouse.com is a political entertainment website that first came online in May 1996. According to a statement on the web, it was originally created by Ransom Scott as a known place where uncensored discussion of government policies could occur before adult content was added to make it more profitable. In June 2022, adult content was added back to the website, but was later removed again.

==Controversy==
The site&#x27;s hosting of adult content paralleled the dot-com bubble, when Internet development focused on the promotion of websites with .com domains. A person seeking information about the White House, the American landmark residence/place-of-work, might expect to find such a thing at a .com address. The possibility of a minor making this mistake was especially noted. Because of the explicit and commercial content of the site, it was frequently cited as one of the most egregious examples of domain name misuse, up until the domain was sold. 

The website whitehouse.org, a humor site that formerly satirized the former U.S. president George W. Bush, remains controversial for similar reasons, although less so because its content is usually much less explicit.

In 2006, &quot;PC World&quot; ranked Whitehouse.com #13 on its list of &quot;The 25 Worst Web Sites&quot;.

==Opposition==
In December 1997, a cease and desist letter arrived from the White House, stating: &quot;…we do not challenge your right to pursue it or to exercise your First Amendment rights, but we do challenge your right to use the White House, the President, and the First Lady as a marketing device. For adult internet users, that device is, at the least, part of a deceptive scheme. For younger Internet users, it has more disturbing consequences.&quot; The letter had no effect and the site stayed up.

==Statuses and uses==

In 2004, Dan Parisi decided to sell the domain, primarily because his son would be going into kindergarten the next year. The sale did not occur. As of 2003, Parisi was making US$1 million annually from the site alone. Parisi had said he did not want to sell the domain name to anyone in the adult entertainment industry, and even claimed to have turned down what was essentially a blank check from a buyer hiding his identity behind his broker.

In November 2005, the domain appeared to be used for a real estate site. In December 2005 it contained only Google ads, with a notice that a site for investigating people by checking their public records would be coming. In March 2006, whitehouse.com called itself &quot;America&#x27;s Free Speech Forum&quot;. It advertised a cartoon contest and presented links to Associated Press political news stories. In July 2006, the site was a real estate site again, and forwarded to www.house.com. As of November 2006, the site was a search engine for people, which searched over 90 million White Pages listings and 14 million Yellow Pages listings. As of June–October 2007, the site had once again changed and now claimed to be &quot;your source for up-to-date information to help you keep track of the major party candidates for President.&quot;

Until early 2009, the domain redirected to the previous real estate website again. The site was being used for home loan modification and debt consolidation, with the disclaimer reading that is not &quot;affiliated or endorsed by the U.S. Government&quot;. As of September 2009, the site was a local New Jersey-centered video hosting site. The site&#x27;s main purpose was to host videos of local town hall meetings in New Jersey.

As of July 2010, the site was a blank page with large black letters stating, &quot;Future site of WhiteHouse.com&quot; with no other information or link. As of Sept 2010, the site returned with the Banner Heading of WhiteHouseLawyers.com. The site&#x27;s purported main purpose was to provide a search portal for personal injury / disability lawyers based on users location. But upon testing user input including name, phone, state, and e-mail, no listing of lawyers was provided. Later that month the site advertised financial aid opportunities. As of June 2011, the site again redirected to www.house.com.

As of October 2015, the domain was parked, displayed a picture of the White House and text advertisement &#x27;search results&#x27; relating to the White House, Washington D.C. or adult services. As of June 2016, the site displayed a blank page with black letters stating, &quot;WhiteHouse.com Official Site&quot;. The subtext read, &quot;Celebrating our 19th Anniversary (1997-2016)&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Most Famous Adult Site coming back Summer 2016&quot;.

As of April 2017, the site was once again parked, with similar content as in its October 2015 version. As of August 2017, the site was being used to protest the Trump administration in the wake of the Unite the Right rally. As of November 2017, the site was again a parked domain. By January 2018, the site contained a collection of brief political news stories with the slogan &quot;Where Hate does not Live!&quot;. The website claims to be owned and operated by WhiteHouse Network LLC. WHOIS data suggests the domain is administrated by Dan Parisi.

As of May 2020, the site was offering information about the COVID-19 pandemic, plus an opinion poll on the Trump administration&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States. It still listed &quot;WhiteHouse Network LLC&quot; as its owner. A misspelled disclaimer at the footer of the site claims &quot;WhiteHouse Beta is not affiliated or endorsed by U.S. Government&quot;[sic]. As of January 2020, the site offers betting for senate and house election results. 

In 2022, the website relaunched as a &quot;Adult &amp; Free Speech Site&quot; with adult content once again.
In 2023 it shows polls and urges visitors to bet on certain topics; however, there is no adult content on the website as of the 24th of June, 2023.

==Legacy==
This type of behavior with trademarks led the United States government to the passage of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. The ACPA, however, protects only the registration of trademarks as domain names and would not help the U.S. government with the registration of the names of its offices or agencies.

<text>The Ballon d&#x27;Or (; ) is an annual football award presented by French magazine &quot;France Football&quot; since 1956 to honour the player deemed to have performed the best over the previous season.

Conceived by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran, the Ballon d&#x27;Or was based exclusively on voting by football journalists up until 2006. Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and was widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d&#x27;Or was expanded to include all players of any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016.

Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and was known as the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d&#x27;Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award, The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player. In 2022, &quot;France Football&quot; modified the rules for the Ballon d&#x27;Or. The timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season, and it was also determined that an international jury of specialized journalists, with one representative per country, from the top 100 in the latest FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking would elect the winner of the award. UEFA co-organizes the Ballon d&#x27;Or gala since 2024, with &quot;France Football&quot; retaining the voting system and the Ballon d&#x27;Or name.

Lionel Messi won the Ballon d&#x27;Or a record eight times, followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five. Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten each won the award three times, while Alfredo Di Stéfano, Franz Beckenbauer, Kevin Keegan, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Ronaldo have each won it twice. Rodri is the current holder of the award, having won its most recent edition in 2024.
== Overview ==

The Ballon d&#x27;Or is widely regarded as football&#x27;s most prestigious and valuable individual award. Prior to 2007, it was based exclusively on voting by football journalists and was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media. Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award, until it was merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award cementing its new worldwide claim. Stanley Matthews of England was the inaugural winner of the award. Liberia&#x27;s George Weah, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed and the Ballon d&#x27;Or was expanded to include all players of any origin, active at European clubs; two years later, Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American to claim the award, and he is still the youngest winner ever at 21 years and 96 days old. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from clubs around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016.

Lionel Messi holds the record for most Ballon d&#x27;Or wins with eight, while five-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo earned the most nominations with eighteen. Messi is the only player to win the award with three different teams and also the only one to win it while playing outside Europe, as well as being the player with the most podiums, finishing in the top-three a record fourteen times. Three players have won the award three times each: Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten. With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French players have won the second most Ballons d&#x27;Or, underneath Argentina in first with eight. Players from Germany (1972, 1981) and the Netherlands (1988) occupied the top-three spots in a single year. German (1972) and Italian (1988–1990) clubs achieved the same feat, including two individual years dominated by Milan players (1988, 1989), a unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unprecedented dominance (2009–2012, 2015, 2016) and Barcelona (2010) became the second club to occupy the top-three. The award shows a bias in favour of attacking players, and, over time, it has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs. Prior to 1995, ten leagues supplied Ballon d&#x27;Or winners, whereas only England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United States have supplied winners since then. Spain&#x27;s La Liga has the most Ballon d&#x27;Or winners overall, with twenty-four wins shared between Barcelona and Real Madrid; with twelve wins each, the two Spanish clubs also lead the overall club ranking for producing the most winners.

Between 2010 and 2015 inclusive, the award was merged with a similar one, the FIFA World Player of the Year award, to create the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or, which was awarded to the world&#x27;s best male player before FIFA and &quot;France Football&quot; decided not to continue the merging agreement. The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or are considered as winners by both award organizations. After 2011, UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the tradition of the original Ballon d&#x27;Or of specifically honouring a football player from Europe. In 2020, Groupe Amaury, to which &quot;France Football&quot; belongs, decided that no award would be given for the year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on association football. The widespread public opinion is that the 2020 Ballon d&#x27;Or should have been awarded to Robert Lewandowski.

&quot;France Football&quot; modified the rules for the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2022. They changed the timing so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season. It was also decided that an international jury of specialized journalists, with one representative per country, from the top 100 in the latest FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking would determine the winner of the award; the plebiscite had previously been open to all countries since 2007. UEFA co-organizes the Ballon d&#x27;Or gala since 2024, with &quot;France Football&quot; retaining the voting system and the Ballon d&#x27;Or name.

=== Criteria ===
The Ballon d&#x27;Or is awarded based on three main criteria:
:1) Individual performances, decisive and impressive character;
:2) Team performances and achievements;
:3) Class and fair play.
Nevertheless, critics have occasionally described the award as a &quot;popularity contest&quot;, criticizing its voting process, its bias in favour of attacking players, and the idea of systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.

== Winners ==




Note: Until 2021, the Ballon d&#x27;Or was awarded based on player performance during the calendar year. Since 2022, jurors have been instructed to take into account the previous season.

=== Special awards ===

==== Super Ballon d&#x27;Or ====
An honorary award, under the name Super Ballon d&#x27;Or, was awarded to Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1989, who was voted the best multiple-time Ballon d&#x27;Or winner ahead of Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini.

In addition Diego Maradona received an honorary Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1995 for his services to football dubbed the Golden Ballon d&#x27;Or. Pelé also received a similar award during the 2013 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or ceremony dubbed the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or Prix d&#x27;Honneur.

==== Football Player of the Century ====
In 1999, &quot;France Football&quot; voted Pelé as the Football Player of the Century after consulting their former Ballon d&#x27;Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes, while Stanley Matthews, Omar Sívori and George Best refused to vote, and Lev Yashin had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di Stéfano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and George Weah two players for fifth place. Pelé was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving almost double the number of points earned by the second place, Diego Maradona.

==== &quot;Le nouveau palmarès&quot; ====
To coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2016, &quot;France Football&quot; published an internationalized reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d&#x27;Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pelé—seven times—and Diego Maradona—twice—Garrincha, Mario Kempes, and Romário were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners. The original recipients, however, remain unchanged.

==== Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team ====
An all-time all-star team, the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team, was published in December 2020 by &quot;France Football&quot;, honouring football&#x27;s greatest players of all time. A second and a third team were also published.

<doc id="398113" wikidata="Q1466205" url="?curid=398113" title="Thiruvananthapuram International Airport">
<text>Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is an international airport that serves Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, India. Established in 1932, it is the first airport in the state of Kerala and the fifth international airport of India, officially declared in 1991. The airport, spread over an area of , the airport is approximately due west from the city centre and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, from Kovalam beach, from Technopark and from Vizhinjam International Seaport. It shares a visible proximity to Shankumugham Beach making it the nearest airport to a water body in India as it is just about 0.6 miles (approx. 1 km) away from the Arabian Sea. It is also the southern most international/domestic airport in the Indian subcontinent.

The airport is the second-busiest airport in the state of Kerala, eighth-busiest airport in India in terms of international traffic and the 16th overall in India, as of 2024. In the financial year 2023-24, the airport handled over 4.4 million passengers, with a total of over 30,000 aircraft movements.
In addition to civil operations, the airport headquarters the Southern Air Command (India) of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Coast Guard for their operations. IAF has an exclusive apron to handle all their operations. Thiruvananthapuram Airport also caters to the Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology, which carries out pilot training activities. The airport hosts Air India&#x27;s narrow body maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) unit consisting of twin hangars for servicing Boeing 737-type aircraft, servicing mostly Air India Express aircraft.

==History==
The airport was established in 1932 as part of the Royal Flying Club under the initiative of Lt. Col. Raja Goda Varman, husband of Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, the &quot;Rani&quot; of Attingal and Travancore Kingdom. Raja Goda Varman, a trained pilot, felt the need for an airport to accommodate Travancore in the aviation map of India and requested the Travancore Durbar to initiate the process of establishing an aerodrome. A detailed report was made and presented to the King by Consort Prince in this regard. It may be mentioned that the King was the brother of Lt. Col. Raja&#x27;s wife, and the colonel&#x27;s children were the heirs to the throne.

In 1935, on the royal patronage of Maharaja Chithira Thirunal, Tata Airlines made its maiden flight to the airport using DH.83 Fox Moth aircraft under command of India&#x27;s first pilot Nevill Vintcent carrying Jamshed Navoroji, a Tata company official, and Kanchi Dwarakadas, commercial agent of Travancore in Karachi, with a special mail from the Viceroy of British India, Lord Willingdon, wishing birthday greetings to the Maharaja.

The first flight took off on 1 November 1935, carrying mails of Royal Anchal (Travancore Post) to Bombay. In 1938, the Royal Government of Travancore acquired a Dakota as the Maharaja&#x27;s private aircraft and placed the first squadron of the Royal Indian Air Force (Travancore) for protection of the state from aerial attacks. After Independence, the airstrip was used for domestic flights with the construction of a new domestic terminal, Terminal 1.

International operations were initiated by Air India to cities in the Arabian Peninsula in the late 1970s using Boeing 707. By the early 80s, the then-Indian Airlines started service to Colombo, followed by service to Male. Later, Gulf Air, Sri Lankan Airlines (then Air Lanka) and Air Maldives (now Maldivian) started operations. These were followed by Indian Airlines, which started a service to Sharjah. On 1 January 1991, TIA was upgraded to an international airport, making it the fifth international airport of India after Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta.

On 1 March 2011, the first flight operated from the new international terminal, Terminal 2. IX 536 (Air India Express) from Sharjah marked the first arrival. Air India Express operated the first departure to Dubai from this new terminal. IndianOil Skytanking is the company that introduced single-man refuelling in India and started refuelling operations at Trivandrum in March 2016.

This was the main hub for the defunct Kairali Airlines from 9 January 2013 to 2017.

In November 2018, the Central Government cleared a proposal by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for leasing out six of its airports, including Thiruvananthapuram. The following month, AAI commenced an international competitive bidding process to award Operations, Management and Development (OMD) contracts for the six airports.
The Adani Group, GMR Group and Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) participated in the bidding process that was won by the Adani Group.

Since some public interest litigations were filed concerning the bidding process for the airport, the Union Cabinet gave its approval for awarding the airport to Adani subject to the outcome of Writ Petition. Accordingly, AAI signed a letter of agreement with Adani in September 2020.
Adani Thiruvananthapuram International Airport Limited (ATIAL), floated by the Adani Group to run the airport, would operate, manage and develop the airport for fifty years.
As per the agreement, ATIAL would get control of the airport only after a concession agreement was executed and the performance bank guarantee was paid and subject to clearance of legal hurdles.

==Alppasi and Panguni festival processions==
For decades, the airport has been traditionally pausing operations and reschedules flights twice a year to enable religious processions to pass through the airfield. The airport issues a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) twice yearly before the runway is closed for the bi-annual Alppasi festival, which falls in October–November, and for the Panguni festival, which is held during March–April.
The processions used to pass through the same route even before the airport was established in 1932. The temple issues special passes to participants in the &#x27;aarattu&#x27; to pass through the airfield&#x27;s operational areas.
The procession is escorted by priests, members of the erstwhile Travancore Royal family, caparisoned elephants, police band and armed and mounted police personnel besides large number of devotees and is a grand spectacle for onlookers.

<doc id="398114" wikidata="Q3268741" url="?curid=398114" title="Flying bomb">
<text>A flying bomb is a manned or unmanned aerial vehicle or aircraft carrying a large explosive warhead, a precursor to contemporary cruise missiles. In contrast to a bomber aircraft, which is intended to release bombs and then return to its base for re-use, a flying bomb crashes into its target and is therefore destroyed in its attack.

The term flying bomb is most frequently associated with two specific Second World War weapons, the German V-1 and the Japanese Ohka. The former was unpiloted, as the first known cruise missile ever deployed in combat; the latter carried a pilot on a kamikaze mission.

==Historic exemplars==
&quot;The Sphere&quot; of March 13, 1915 published an article on &quot;The Possibilities of an Aerial Torpedo Controlled by Wireless&quot;, suggested by a &quot;correspondent to the Sphere&quot; and declared feasible by an &quot;aviation expert&quot;.

The first attempt to build a flying bomb (alternatively called an &quot;aerial torpedo&quot; in the Navy) was undertaken by Elmer Sperry for the US Navy in 1916, called the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane, and was based on a Curtiss N-9 seaplane. This led to a mission-specific Curtiss design, the Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb, which was almost completely unsuccessful. The US Army also tried to develop a flying bomb in World War I, the Kettering Bug, but the war ended before the program could mature. The functioning but unsuccessful German Mistel flying bomb was essentially an enormous shaped charge mounted on a repurposed twin-engined medium bomber&#x27;s airframe (most often a Junkers Ju 88) in place of the cockpit, that was guided by a fighter sitting on top. The fighter first took a course towards the target, then released the Mistel which would continue to its target. The best known example of a flying bomb is the German V-1, many of which targeted London in 1944 during World War II.

==Types==
Flying bombs may be powered or unpowered, piloted or unpiloted, although unpowered flying bombs such as the United States Navy Bat and German &quot;Hagelkorn&quot; (&quot;Hailstone&quot;) and Fritz X designed during World War II are usually referred to as glide bombs. Flying bombs are analogous to modern cruise missiles such as the jet-powered Tomahawk and rocket-powered Exocet, in that they are equipped with wings to provide lift over a long distance and generally have engines that operate up until impact. This is significantly different from ballistic missiles, which are launched on a ballistic trajectory and do not rely on lift to reach their targets.

<text>In molecular biology and genetics, transcriptional regulation is the means by which a cell regulates the conversion of DNA to RNA (transcription), thereby orchestrating gene activity. A single gene can be regulated in a range of ways, from altering the number of copies of RNA that are transcribed, to the temporal control of when the gene is transcribed. This control allows the cell or organism to respond to a variety of intra- and extracellular signals and thus mount a response. Some examples of this include producing the mRNA that encode enzymes to adapt to a change in a food source, producing the gene products involved in cell cycle specific activities, and producing the gene products responsible for cellular differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes, as studied in evolutionary developmental biology.

The regulation of transcription is a vital process in all living organisms. It is orchestrated by transcription factors and other proteins working in concert to finely tune the amount of RNA being produced through a variety of mechanisms. Bacteria and eukaryotes have very different strategies of accomplishing control over transcription, but some important features remain conserved between the two. Most importantly is the idea of combinatorial control, which is that any given gene is likely controlled by a specific combination of factors to control transcription. In a hypothetical example, the factors A and B might regulate a distinct set of genes from the combination of factors A and C. This combinatorial nature extends to complexes of far more than two proteins, and allows a very small subset (less than 10%) of the genome to control the transcriptional program of the entire cell.

== In bacteria ==

Much of the early understanding of transcription came from bacteria, although the extent and complexity of transcriptional regulation is greater in eukaryotes. Bacterial transcription is governed by three main sequence elements:
* Promoters are elements of DNA that may bind RNA polymerase and other proteins for the successful initiation of transcription directly upstream of the gene.
* Operators recognize repressor proteins that bind to a stretch of DNA and inhibit the transcription of the gene.
* Positive control elements that bind to DNA and incite higher levels of transcription.
While these means of transcriptional regulation also exist in eukaryotes, the transcriptional landscape is significantly more complicated both by the number of proteins involved as well as by the presence of introns and the packaging of DNA into histones.

The transcription of a basic bacterial gene is dependent on the strength of its promoter and the presence of activators or repressors. In the absence of other regulatory elements, a promoter&#x27;s sequence-based affinity for RNA polymerases varies, which results in the production of different amounts of transcript. The variable affinity of RNA polymerase for different promoter sequences is related to regions of consensus sequence upstream of the transcription start site. The more nucleotides of a promoter that agree with the consensus sequence, the stronger the affinity of the promoter for RNA Polymerase likely is.

In the absence of other regulatory elements, the default state of a bacterial transcript is to be in the “on” configuration, resulting in the production of some amount of transcript. This means that transcriptional regulation in the form of protein repressors and positive control elements can either increase or decrease transcription. Repressors often physically occupy the promoter location, occluding RNA polymerase from binding. Alternatively a repressor and polymerase may bind to the DNA at the same time with a physical interaction between the repressor preventing the opening of the DNA for access to the minus strand for transcription. This strategy of control is distinct from eukaryotic transcription, whose basal state is to be off and where co-factors required for transcription initiation are highly gene dependent.

Sigma factors are specialized bacterial proteins that bind to RNA polymerases and orchestrate transcription initiation. Sigma factors act as mediators of sequence-specific transcription, such that a single sigma factor can be used for transcription of all housekeeping genes or a suite of genes the cell wishes to express in response to some external stimuli such as stress.

In addition to processes that regulate transcription at the stage of initiation, mRNA synthesis is also controlled by the rate of transcription elongation. RNA polymerase pauses occur frequently and are regulated by transcription factors, such as NusG and NusA, transcription-translation coupling, and mRNA secondary structure.

== In eukaryotes ==

The added complexity of generating a eukaryotic cell carries with it an increase in the complexity of transcriptional regulation. Eukaryotes have three RNA polymerases, known as Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III. Each polymerase has specific targets and activities, and is regulated by independent mechanisms. There are a number of additional mechanisms through which polymerase activity can be controlled. These mechanisms can be generally grouped into three main areas:
*Control over polymerase access to the gene. This is perhaps the broadest of the three control mechanisms. This includes the functions of histone remodeling enzymes, transcription factors, enhancers and repressors, and many other complexes
*Productive elongation of the RNA transcript. Once polymerase is bound to a promoter, it requires another set of factors to allow it to escape the promoter complex and begin successfully transcribing RNA.
*Termination of the polymerase. A number of factors which have been found to control how and when termination occurs, which will dictate the fate of the RNA transcript.
All three of these systems work in concert to integrate signals from the cell and change the transcriptional program accordingly.

While in prokaryotic systems the basal transcription state can be thought of as nonrestrictive (that is, “on” in the absence of modifying factors), eukaryotes have a restrictive basal state which requires the recruitment of other factors in order to generate RNA transcripts. This difference is largely due to the compaction of the eukaryotic genome by winding DNA around histones to form higher order structures. This compaction makes the gene promoter inaccessible without the assistance of other factors in the nucleus, and thus chromatin structure is a common site of regulation. Similar to the sigma factors in prokaryotes, the general transcription factors (GTFs) are a set of factors in eukaryotes that are required for all transcription events. These factors are responsible for stabilizing binding interactions and opening the DNA helix to allow the RNA polymerase to access the template, but generally lack specificity for different promoter sites. A large part of gene regulation occurs through transcription factors that either recruit or inhibit the binding of the general transcription machinery and/or the polymerase. This can be accomplished through close interactions with core promoter elements, or through the long distance enhancer elements.

Once a polymerase is successfully bound to a DNA template, it often requires the assistance of other proteins in order to leave the stable promoter complex and begin elongating the nascent RNA strand. This process is called promoter escape, and is another step at which regulatory elements can act to accelerate or slow the transcription process. Similarly, protein and nucleic acid factors can associate with the elongation complex and modulate the rate at which the polymerase moves along the DNA template.

===At the level of chromatin state===

In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is highly compacted in order to be able to fit it into the nucleus. This is accomplished by winding the DNA around protein octamers called histones, which has consequences for the physical accessibility of parts of the genome at any given time. Significant portions are silenced through histone modifications, and thus are inaccessible to the polymerases or their cofactors. The highest level of transcription regulation occurs through the rearrangement of histones in order to expose or sequester genes, because these processes have the ability to render entire regions of a chromosome inaccessible such as what occurs in imprinting.

Histone rearrangement is facilitated by post-translational modifications to the tails of the core histones. A wide variety of modifications can be made by enzymes such as the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs), and histone deacetylases (HDACs), among others. These enzymes can add or remove covalent modifications such as methyl groups, acetyl groups, phosphates, and ubiquitin. Histone modifications serve to recruit other proteins which can either increase the compaction of the chromatin and sequester promoter elements, or to increase the spacing between histones and allow the association of transcription factors or polymerase on open DNA. For example, H3K27 trimethylation by the polycomb complex PRC2 causes chromosomal compaction and gene silencing. These histone modifications may be created by the cell, or inherited in an epigenetic fashion from a parent.

===At the level of cytosine methylation===

Transcription regulation at about 60% of promoters is controlled by methylation of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides (where 5’ cytosine is followed by 3’ guanine or CpG sites). 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine (see Figure). 5-mC is an epigenetic marker found predominantly within CpG sites. About 28 million CpG dinucleotides occur in the human genome. In most tissues of mammals, on average, 70% to 80% of CpG cytosines are methylated (forming 5-methylCpG or 5-mCpG). Methylated cytosines within 5’cytosine-guanine 3’ sequences often occur in groups, called CpG islands. About 60% of promoter sequences have a CpG island while only about 6% of enhancer sequences have a CpG island. CpG islands constitute regulatory sequences, since if CpG islands are methylated in the promoter of a gene this can reduce or silence gene transcription.

DNA methylation regulates gene transcription through interaction with methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins, such as MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2. These MBD proteins bind most strongly to highly methylated CpG islands. These MBD proteins have both a methyl-CpG-binding domain as well as a transcription repression domain. They bind to methylated DNA and guide or direct protein complexes with chromatin remodeling and/or histone modifying activity to methylated CpG islands. MBD proteins generally repress local chromatin such as by catalyzing the introduction of repressive histone marks, or creating an overall repressive chromatin environment through nucleosome remodeling and chromatin reorganization.

Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a gene. The binding sequence for a transcription factor in DNA is usually about 10 or 11 nucleotides long. As summarized in 2009, Vaquerizas et al. indicated there are approximately 1,400 different transcription factors encoded in the human genome by genes that constitute about 6% of all human protein encoding genes. About 94% of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are associated with signal-responsive genes occur in enhancers while only about 6% of such TFBSs occur in promoters.

EGR1 protein is a particular transcription factor that is important for regulation of methylation of CpG islands. An EGR1 transcription factor binding site is frequently located in enhancer or promoter sequences. There are about 12,000 binding sites for EGR1 in the mammalian genome and about half of EGR1 binding sites are located in promoters and half in enhancers. The binding of EGR1 to its target DNA binding site is insensitive to cytosine methylation in the DNA.

While only small amounts of EGR1 transcription factor protein are detectable in cells that are un-stimulated, translation of the &quot;EGR1&quot; gene into protein at one hour after stimulation is drastically elevated. Expression of EGR1 transcription factor proteins, in various types of cells, can be stimulated by growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, stress and injury. In the brain, when neurons are activated, EGR1 proteins are up-regulated and they bind to (recruit) the pre-existing TET1 enzymes which are highly expressed in neurons. TET enzymes can catalyse demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. When EGR1 transcription factors bring TET1 enzymes to EGR1 binding sites in promoters, the TET enzymes can demethylate the methylated CpG islands at those promoters. Upon demethylation, these promoters can then initiate transcription of their target genes. Hundreds of genes in neurons are differentially expressed after neuron activation through EGR1 recruitment of TET1 to methylated regulatory sequences in their promoters.

The methylation of promoters is also altered in response to signals. The three mammalian DNA methyltransferasess (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) catalyze the addition of methyl groups to cytosines in DNA. While DNMT1 is a “maintenance” methyltransferase, DNMT3A and DNMT3B can carry out new methylations. There are also two splice protein isoforms produced from the &quot;DNMT3A&quot; gene: DNA methyltransferase proteins DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2.

The splice isoform DNMT3A2 behaves like the product of a classical immediate-early gene and, for instance, it is robustly and transiently produced after neuronal activation. Where the DNA methyltransferase isoform DNMT3A2 binds and adds methyl groups to cytosines appears to be determined by histone post translational modifications.

On the other hand, neural activation causes degradation of DNMT3A1 accompanied by reduced methylation of at least one evaluated targeted promoter.

=== Through transcription factors and enhancers ===

====Transcription factors====

Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a given gene. There are approximately 1,400 transcription factors in the human genome and they constitute about 6% of all human protein coding genes. The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. The fact that these transcription factors work in a combinatorial fashion means that only a small subset of an organism&#x27;s genome encodes transcription factors.
Transcription factors function through a wide variety of mechanisms. In one mechanism, CpG methylation influences binding of most transcription factors to DNA—in some cases negatively and in others positively. In addition, often they are at the end of a signal transduction pathway that functions to change something about the factor, like its subcellular localization or its activity. Post-translational modifications to transcription factors located in the cytosol can cause them to translocate to the nucleus where they can interact with their corresponding enhancers. Other transcription factors are already in the nucleus, and are modified to enable the interaction with partner transcription factors. Some post-translational modifications known to regulate the functional state of transcription factors are phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation and ubiquitylation.
Transcription factors can be divided in two main categories: activators and repressors. While activators can interact directly or indirectly with the core machinery of transcription through enhancer binding, repressors predominantly recruit co-repressor complexes leading to transcriptional repression by chromatin condensation of enhancer regions. It may also happen that a repressor may function by allosteric competition against a determined activator to repress gene expression: overlapping DNA-binding motifs for both activators and repressors induce a physical competition to occupy the site of binding. If the repressor has a higher affinity for its motif than the activator, transcription would be effectively blocked in the presence of the repressor.
Tight regulatory control is achieved by the highly dynamic nature of transcription factors. Again, many different mechanisms exist to control whether a transcription factor is active. These mechanisms include control over protein localization or control over whether the protein can bind DNA. An example of this is the protein HSF1, which remains bound to Hsp70 in the cytosol and is only translocated into the nucleus upon cellular stress such as heat shock. Thus the genes under the control of this transcription factor will remain untranscribed unless the cell is subjected to stress.

====Enhancers====

Enhancers or cis-regulatory modules/elements (CRM/CRE) are non-coding DNA sequences containing multiple activator and repressor binding sites. Enhancers range from 200 bp to 1 kb in length and can be either proximal, 5’ upstream to the promoter or within the first intron of the regulated gene, or distal, in introns of neighboring genes or intergenic regions far away from the locus. Through DNA looping, active enhancers contact the promoter dependently of the core DNA binding motif promoter specificity. Promoter-enhancer dichotomy provides the basis for the functional interaction between transcription factors and transcriptional core machinery to trigger RNA Pol II escape from the promoter. Whereas one could think that there is a 1:1 enhancer-promoter ratio, studies of the human genome predict that an active promoter interacts with 4 to 5 enhancers. Similarly, enhancers can regulate more than one gene without linkage restriction and are said to “skip” neighboring genes to regulate more distant ones. Even though infrequent, transcriptional regulation can involve elements located in a chromosome different from one where the promoter resides. Proximal enhancers or promoters of neighboring genes can serve as platforms to recruit more distal elements.

====Enhancer activation and implementation====

Up-regulated expression of genes in mammals can be initiated when signals are transmitted to the promoters associated with the genes. Cis-regulatory DNA sequences that are located in DNA regions distant from the promoters of genes can have very large effects on gene expression, with some genes undergoing up to 100-fold increased expression due to such a cis-regulatory sequence. These cis-regulatory sequences include enhancers, silencers, insulators and tethering elements. Among this constellation of sequences, enhancers and their associated transcription factor proteins have a leading role in the regulation of gene expression.

Enhancers are sequences of the genome that are major gene-regulatory elements. Enhancers control cell-type-specific gene expression programs, most often by looping through long distances to come in physical proximity with the promoters of their target genes. In a study of brain cortical neurons, 24,937 loops were found, bringing enhancers to promoters. Multiple enhancers, each often at tens or hundred of thousands of nucleotides distant from their target genes, loop to their target gene promoters and coordinate with each other to control expression of their common target gene.

The schematic illustration in this section shows an enhancer looping around to come into close physical proximity with the promoter of a target gene. The loop is stabilized by a dimer of a connector protein (e.g. dimer of CTCF or YY1), with one member of the dimer anchored to its binding motif on the enhancer and the other member anchored to its binding motif on the promoter (represented by the red zigzags in the illustration). Several cell function specific transcription factor proteins (in 2018 Lambert et al. indicated there were about 1,600 transcription factors in a human cell) generally bind to specific motifs on an enhancer and a small combination of these enhancer-bound transcription factors, when brought close to a promoter by a DNA loop, govern the level of transcription of the target gene. Mediator (coactivator) (a complex usually consisting of about 26 proteins in an interacting structure) communicates regulatory signals from enhancer DNA-bound transcription factors directly to the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) enzyme bound to the promoter.

Enhancers, when active, are generally transcribed from both strands of DNA with RNA polymerases acting in two different directions, producing two eRNAs as illustrated in the Figure. An inactive enhancer may be bound by an inactive transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor may activate it and that activated transcription factor may then activate the enhancer to which it is bound (see small red star representing phosphorylation of a transcription factor bound to an enhancer in the illustration). An activated enhancer begins transcription of its RNA before activating a promoter to initiate transcription of messenger RNA from its target gene.
====Regulatory landscape====

Transcriptional initiation, termination and regulation are mediated by “DNA looping” which brings together promoters, enhancers, transcription factors and RNA processing factors to accurately regulate gene expression. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) and more recently Hi-C techniques provided evidence that active chromatin regions are “compacted” in nuclear domains or bodies where transcriptional regulation is enhanced. The configuration of the genome is essential for enhancer-promoter proximity. Cell-fate decisions are mediated upon highly dynamic genomic reorganizations at interphase to modularly switch on or off entire gene regulatory networks through short to long range chromatin rearrangements. Related studies demonstrate that metazoan genomes are partitioned in structural and functional units around a megabase long called Topological association domains (TADs) containing dozens of genes regulated by hundreds of enhancers distributed within large genomic regions containing only non-coding sequences. The function of TADs is to regroup enhancers and promoters interacting together within a single large functional domain instead of having them spread in different TADs. However, studies of mouse development point out that two adjacent TADs may regulate the same gene cluster. The most relevant study on limb evolution shows that the TAD at the 5’ of the HoxD gene cluster in tetrapod genomes drives its expression in the distal limb bud embryos, giving rise to the hand, while the one located at 3’ side does it in the proximal limb bud, giving rise to the arm. Still, it is not known whether TADs are an adaptive strategy to enhance regulatory interactions or an effect of the constrains on these same interactions.
TAD boundaries are often composed by housekeeping genes, tRNAs, other highly expressed sequences and Short Interspersed Elements (SINE). While these genes may take advantage of their border position to be ubiquitously expressed, they are not directly linked with TAD edge formation. The specific molecules identified at boundaries of TADs are called insulators or architectural proteins because they not only block enhancer leaky expression but also ensure an accurate compartmentalization of cis-regulatory inputs to the targeted promoter. These insulators are DNA-binding proteins like CTCF and TFIIIC that help recruiting structural partners such as cohesins and condensins. The localization and binding of architectural proteins to their corresponding binding sites is regulated by post-translational modifications. DNA binding motifs recognized by architectural proteins are either of high occupancy and at around a megabase of each other or of low occupancy and inside TADs. High occupancy sites are usually conserved and static while intra-TADs sites are dynamic according to the state of the cell therefore TADs themselves are compartmentalized in subdomains that can be called subTADs from few kb up to a TAD long (19). When architectural binding sites are at less than 100 kb from each other, Mediator proteins are the architectural proteins cooperate with cohesin. For subTADs larger than 100 kb and TAD boundaries, CTCF is the typical insulator found to interact with cohesion.

===Of the pre-initiation complex and promoter escape===

In eukaryotes, ribosomal rRNA and the tRNAs involved in translation are controlled by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and RNA polymerase III (Pol III) . RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is responsible for the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) within the cell. Particularly for Pol II, much of the regulatory checkpoints in the transcription process occur in the assembly and escape of the pre-initiation complex. A gene-specific combination of transcription factors will recruit TFIID and/or TFIIA to the core promoter, followed by the association of TFIIB, creating a stable complex onto which the rest of the General Transcription Factors (GTFs) can assemble. This complex is relatively stable, and can undergo multiple rounds of transcription initiation.
After the binding of TFIIB and TFIID, Pol II the rest of the GTFs can assemble. This assembly is marked by the post-translational modification (typically phosphorylation) of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II through a number of kinases. The CTD is a large, unstructured domain extending from the RbpI subunit of Pol II, and consists of many repeats of the heptad sequence YSPTSPS. TFIIH, the helicase that remains associated with Pol II throughout transcription, also contains a subunit with kinase activity which will phosphorylate the serines 5 in the heptad sequence. Similarly, both CDK8 (a subunit of the massive multiprotein Mediator complex) and CDK9 (a subunit of the p-TEFb elongation factor), have kinase activity towards other residues on the CTD. These phosphorylation events promote the transcription process and serve as sites of recruitment for mRNA processing machinery. All three of these kinases respond to upstream signals, and failure to phosphorylate the CTD can lead to a stalled polymerase at the promoter.

==In cancer==
In vertebrates, the majority of gene promoters contain a CpG island with numerous CpG sites. When many of a gene&#x27;s promoter CpG sites are methylated the gene becomes silenced. Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer. For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see regulation of transcription in cancer). Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered expression of microRNAs. In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of BRCA1 may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers).

<text>Field Marshal Robert Cornelis Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala (6 December 1810 – 14 January 1890) was a British Indian Army officer. He fought in the First Anglo-Sikh War and the Second Anglo-Sikh War before seeing action as chief engineer during the second relief of Lucknow in March 1858 during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He also served in the Second Opium War as commander of the 2nd division of the expeditionary force which took part in the Battle of Taku Forts, the surrender of Peking&#x27;s Anting Gate and the entry to Peking in 1860. He subsequently led the punitive expedition to Abyssinia in July 1867, defeating the Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia with minimal loss of life among his own forces and rescuing the hostages of Tewodros.

== Military career ==

=== Early career ===
Born the son of Major Charles Frederick Napier, who was wounded at the storming of Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) in Java on (26 August 1810) and died some months later, and Catherine Napier (née Carrington), Napier was educated at Addiscombe Military Seminary before being commissioned into the Bengal Engineers on 15 December 1826. He attended the Royal Engineer Establishment at Chatham with the rank of ensign from 7 June 1827 before being promoted to lieutenant on 28 September 1827 and being sent to India in November 1828. After commanding a company at Delhi, he was employed in the irrigation works of the Public Works Department until 1836 when he returned to England for leave on account of his poor health. Promoted to captain on 25 January 1841, he was appointed garrison engineer at Sirhind in 1842.

=== First Anglo-Sikh War ===
Napier served under Sir Hugh Gough during the First Anglo-Sikh War and commanded the Bengal Engineers at the Battle of Mudki in December 1845. He was severely wounded at the Battle of Ferozeshah in December 1845 while storming the Sikh camp and was also present at the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846. Promoted to brevet major on 3 April 1846, he was chief engineer at the siege of the fortress of Kote Kangra in the Punjab by Brigadier-General Wheeler in May 1846.

=== Second Anglo-Sikh War ===
Having been appointed as consulting engineer to the Punjab resident and to the Council of Regency of the Punjab, Napier was called to direct the siege of Multan in September 1848 at the outset of the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He was wounded during the siege but managed to recover sufficiently to be present at the successful storming of Multan in January 1849 and at the surrender of the fortress of Chiniot shortly thereafter. He took part in the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 and accompanied Sir Walter Gilbert as he pursued the Sikhs all the way to Rawalpindi and was present at the surrender ceremony of the Sikh Army. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 7 June 1849 and became chief engineer to the Board of Administration of Punjab Province at the end of the War.

=== North-West Frontier ===
In December 1852 Napier took command of a column in the first Hazara expedition, and in November 1853 against the Afridis on the North-West frontier. He crushed the Afridi Pashtun rebellion in the North-West Frontier Province and was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel on 28 November 1854 and the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 15 April 1856.

=== Indian Rebellion of 1857 ===

Napier was appointed military secretary and adjutant general to Sir James Outram, whose forces took part in the actions leading to the first relief of Lucknow in September 1857. He remained as chief engineer until the second relief in November 1857, when he was badly wounded while crossing an exposed space with Outram and Sir Henry Havelock to meet with Sir Colin Campbell. He recovered sufficiently to be present at the capture of Lucknow in March 1858.

Napier then joined Sir Hugh Rose as second-in-command for the march on Gwalior and commanded the 2nd Brigade at the Battle of Morar in June 1858. After Gwalior was captured by the British, Napier and his 700 men pursued, caught and defeated Tatya Tope&#x27;s force of 12,000 men on the plains of Jaora Alipur. After Sir Hugh Rose&#x27;s departure, Napier assumed command of the Gwalior division and helped capture Paori in August 1858, routed Prince Ferozepore at Ranode in December 1858 and secured the surrender of Man Singh and Tatya Tope, ending the war, in January 1859.

== China ==
In January 1860, during the Second Opium War, Napier assumed command of the 2nd Division of the expeditionary force under Sir James Hope Grant. In the Battle of Taku Forts he led the assault on the main northern fort on 21 August 1860 where he counted six bullet holes in his clothing and equipment. The Anting Gate in Peking was surrendered to Napier on 13 October 1860 and he was responsible for protecting Lord Elgin&#x27;s line of march into Peking on 24 October 1860. He was promoted to brevet major-general on 15 February 1861 and to the substantive rank of colonel on 18 February 1861.

Napier became the military member of the Council of the Governor-General of India in 1861, acting for a short while as Governor-General after the sudden death of Lord Elgin. He assumed command of the Bombay Army with the local rank of lieutenant general on 7 February 1865 and received promotion to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general on 1 March 1867 before taking command of the punitive expedition to Abyssinia July 1867.

== Abyssinia ==
Napier achieved his greatest fame as an army officer when he led the expedition of 1868 against Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian ruler was holding a number of Protestant missionaries hostage, in his mountain capital of Magdala, as well as two British diplomats who had attempted to negotiate their freedom (Tewodros had unwisely taken them hostage as well). After months of planning and other preparations, the advance guard of engineers landed at Zula on the Red Sea to construct a port on 30 October 1867; Napier himself arrived in Zula on 2 January 1868, and on 25 January 1868 led his troops south into the Ethiopian Highlands.

The expedition involved crossing of mountainous terrain lacking roads or bridges occupied by local people with a known history of hostility towards outsiders. The expedition overcame the first obstacle, the terrain, by thorough logistical planning and engineering ability. Shrewd diplomacy dealt with the second obstacle, local opposition. On the one hand, Napier made it clear to the Ethiopians that the sole intent of the British force was to rescue the imprisoned Europeans—not conquest; on the other, Napier met with local potentates such as Ras Kassa (the future Emperor Yohannes IV) and arranged to purchase needed supplies with the 4.35 million Maria Theresa thalers (the preferred currency of the area) the British had purchased from the mint in Vienna. What helped Napier was the general disaffection with, if not hostility to, Tewodros, and a desire to replace him, held by several native leaders, as well as a general sense that his hostage-taking was bound to lead to trouble.

Napier&#x27;s troops reached the foot of Magdala on 9 April 1868. The next day, Good Friday, he defeated the 9,000 troops still loyal to Tewodros at the Battle of Magdala for the loss of only 2 British lives. Although Emperor Tewodros surrendered his hostages and made repeated efforts for a negotiated surrender, the distrustful Napier pressed on and ordered an assault on the mountain redoubt on 13 April 1868. The British captured Magdala, and Emperor Tewodros killed himself, leaving a grandiose statement that he preferred to &quot;fall into the hands of God, rather than man.&quot; Napier then ordered the destruction of Tewodros&#x27; artillery and the burning of Magdala as revenge for Tewodros&#x27;s hostage taking; his palace was sacked by members of the expedition.

After the Ethiopian campaign, Napier was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Freeman of the City of London. He was also elevated to the peerage as Baron Napier of Magdala on 11 July 1868 and granted an annuity for life.

== Later career ==
Napier became Commander-in-Chief, India, with the local rank of full general in April 1870, and having been promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 1 April 1874, he became Governor of Gibraltar in June 1876. In February 1878, however, he was recalled to London and appointed to command an expeditionary force which was being prepared in anticipation of a war with Russia. When war did not break out he returned to his duties in Gibraltar. In November 1879 he represented Queen Victoria at Madrid as ambassador extraordinary upon the occasion of Alfonso XII of Spain&#x27;s second marriage and in December 1879 he became a member of the Royal Commission on the organization of the army. Standing down as Governor of Gibraltar, he was promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1883.

Napier was also honorary colonel of the 3rd London Rifle Volunteer Corps and colonel-commandant of the Royal Engineers. In January 1887 he was appointed Constable of the Tower of London.

Napier died of influenza at his residence in London on 14 January 1890. He was given a state funeral and buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 21 January 1890.

== Legacy ==
In 1883 the British government installed one Armstrong 100 ton gun in a battery in Gibraltar that they named the Napier of Magdala Battery and in 1891 a statue of Napier on horseback by Sir Joseph Boehm was unveiled in front of Carlton House Gardens in London: it was moved to Queen&#x27;s Gate, Kensington in 1920.

The descendants of the Third City of London Rifle Volunteer Corps are located within Napier House Army Reserve Centre, Grove Park, London; the building is named in his honour.

== Honours ==
Napier&#x27;s honours included:
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) – 27 April 1868 (KCB – 27 July 1858)
* Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) – 16 September 1867

== Family ==
In June 1840 Napier married Anne Pearse; they had three sons and three daughters before his wife died in childbirth in 1849. In April 1861 he married Maria Cecilia Smythe Scott: they had six sons and three daughters.

<text>A computer-animated film is an animated film that was created using computer software to appear three-dimensional. While traditional 2D animated films are now made primarily with the help of computers, the technique to render realistic 3D computer graphics (CG) or 3D computer-generated imagery (CGI), is unique to computer animation.

This is a list of theatrically released feature films that are entirely computer-animated.

==Released films==
Release date listed is the &quot;first&quot; public theatrical screening of the completed film. This may mean that the dates listed here may &quot;not&quot; be representative of when the film came out in a particular country.

The country or countries listed reflects the places where the production companies for each title are based. This means that the countries listed for a film might not reflect the location where the film was produced or the countries where the film received a theatrical release. If a title is a multi-country production, the country listed first corresponds with the production company that had the most significant role in the film&#x27;s creation.

<text>The Honda VF and VFR series is a range of motorcycles first introduced in 1982 by Honda featuring V4 engines (hence the &quot;VF&quot; prefix).

==History==

In 1969 Honda revealed the CB750 superbike, establishing the template for the Universal Japanese Motorcycle with a range of transverse inline-fours. Relishing technological innovation, Honda unexpectedly moved on to adopt the V4 (&quot;VF&quot;) configuration. However, some of the early VF models suffered mechanical problems, mainly as a result of poor quality camshafts (the &quot;chocolate cams&quot;). Honda, alarmed that they were losing their hard-won reputation for reliability, moved to introduce the VFR750 motorcycles featuring gear-driven over head cams and a very high build quality. The first three or four iterations of VFR motorcycles re-established Honda&#x27;s reputation for quality, and the motorcycles received almost universal praise from journalists and riders alike.

The VFR was originally a 750 cc, but became an 800 cc in due course. New models featured technological innovation, such as a single-sided swingarm, linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. The VFR1200 became the first motorcycle to feature a dual-clutch transmission. Not all of these innovations proved popular with riders, who often preferred the simple robustness of the earlier models.

Honda also developed a limited edition VFR, the Honda RC30, as a homologation racing platform. This motorcycle achieved some racing success, but the introduction of very light inline-four motorcycles by competing firms led Honda to downgrade its racing plans.

Honda&#x27;s VF model lineup had engine capacities ranging from 400 cc to 1,000 cc. Another Honda, the shaft-driven ST1100 also featured a V4 engine, but this touring motorcycle does not form part of the VF series.

==V4 engine==

Prior to its adoption by Honda, the V4 design had been used only rarely for motorcycles, most notably by Matchless. In modern times, the V4 configuration has been embraced by Aprilia, Ducati, Suzuki, Yamaha &amp; Norton.

Compared to an in-line four, the advantages of a 90° V4 engine include compactness, narrow width, and perfect primary balance giving a smooth and nearly vibration-free operation. A disadvantage is that it is more expensive to manufacture, and, just like a V-twin, more difficult to locate ancillaries and inlet &amp; exhaust systems.

==VF Models==

In 1982 VF models were introduced to the public at the Cologne Motorcycle Show with a V4 engine mounted in a square-tube steel frame. That very year, reliability and quality control problems arose, possibly due to new automated production equipment at Honda&#x27;s plant in Hamamatsu, Japan. Regardless, Honda sold out its first year&#x27;s inventory of Sabres and the Magnas were not far behind. 1983 saw the engine revised to correct the problems from the previous production year and the introduction of the V65 and the Interceptor. Cam-wear problems surfaced during 1984 in the larger displacement bikes, which, by the time it was corrected, led to eight factory cam revisions over the course of just one year.

==VFR750F &amp; VFR800F==

The 748 cc VFR750F (RC24) was introduced in 1986, and was over-engineered in a bid to re-establish a reputation for reliability. It had an alloy beam frame, gear driven cams. This version underwent constant revision of the non-US models with later revisions including changing wheel sizes from 16&quot; front &amp; 18&quot; rear to 17&quot; front and rear, larger diameter forks and the fairing was slightly modified. After this was a series of VFR models which featured various innovations, including a single-sided swingarm, linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. In due course the geared cam drive was dropped in favour of cheaper chain-drive.

A total redesign of the engine to a new one based on the RVF750R (RC45) and a slight capacity increase led to later models being designated the &quot;VFR800F&quot;.

==VFR1200F==

A much larger capacity VFR model, the VFR1200F, was revealed at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. The new narrow-angle SOHC V4 engine does not use the V-Tec design of the smaller VFRs. It has an optional six-speed push-button operated dual clutch transmission with three modes: automatic, sport and manual. The modes are similar to those on the Honda DN-01 but with a conventional gearbox shifted automatically, similar to a &quot;Tiptronic&quot; system, and without a hand-operated clutch rather than a hydrostatic drive.

To date, the VFR1200 has not sold particularly well, as buyers have tended to favour the smaller VFR800F (RC79).

Honda have permitted the Ariel Motor Company, British makers of the Ariel Atom sports car, to use the VFR1200&#x27;s V4 engine in a new motorcycle, the Ariel Ace.

==Race Models==
Honda developed the RC30 as a homologation racing version which was used from 1988 to 1993. It was the first large capacity motorcycle to use a single-sided swingarm.. The RC30 was succeeded in 1994 by the RC45.

<text>Cedrus libani, commonly known as cedar of Lebanon, Lebanon cedar, or Lebanese cedar (), is a species of tree in the genus &quot;Cedrus&quot;, a part of the pine family, native to the mountains of the Eastern Mediterranean basin. It is a large evergreen conifer that has great religious and historical significance in the cultures of the Middle East, and is referenced many times in the literature of ancient civilisations. It is the national emblem of Lebanon and is widely used as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens.

==Description==

&quot;Cedrus libani&quot; can reach in height, with a massive monopodial columnar trunk up to in diameter. The trunks of old trees ordinarily fork into several large, erect branches. The rough and scaly bark is dark grey to blackish brown, and is run through by deep, horizontal fissures that peel in small chips. The first-order branches are ascending in young trees; they grow to a massive size and take on a horizontal, wide-spreading disposition. Second-order branches are dense and grow in a horizontal plane. The crown is conical when young, becoming broadly tabular with age with fairly level branches; trees growing in dense forests maintain more pyramidal shapes.

===Shoots and leaves===
The shoots are dimorphic, with both long and short shoots. New shoots are pale brown, older shoots turn grey, grooved and scaly. &quot;C. libani&quot; has slightly resinous ovoid vegetative buds measuring long and wide enclosed by pale brown deciduous scales. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals and concentrated at the proximal end of the long shoots, and in clusters of 15–35 on the short shoots; they are long and wide, rhombic in cross-section, and vary from light green to glaucous green with stomatal bands on all four sides.

===Cones===
&quot;Cedrus libani&quot; produces cones beginning at around the age of 40. Its cones are borne in autumn, the male cones appear in early September and the female ones in late September. Male cones occur at the ends of the short shoots; they are solitary and erect about long and mature from a pale green to a pale brown color. The female seed cones also grow at the terminal ends of short shoots. The young seed cones are resinous, sessile, and pale green; they require 17 to 18 months after pollination to mature. The mature, woody cones are long and wide; they are scaly, resinous, ovoid or barrel-shaped, and gray-brown in color. Mature cones open from top to bottom, they disintegrate and lose their seed scales, releasing the seeds until only the cone rachis remains attached to the branches.

The seed scales are thin, broad, and coriaceous, measuring long and wide. The seeds are ovoid, long and wide, attached to a light brown wedge-shaped wing that is long and wide. &quot;C. libani&quot; grows rapidly until the age of 45 to 50 years; growth becomes extremely slow after the age of 70.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Cedrus&quot; is the Latin name for true cedars. The specific epithet refers to the Lebanon mountain range where the species was first described by French botanist Achille Richard; the tree is commonly known as the Lebanon cedar or cedar of Lebanon. Two distinct types are recognized as varieties: &quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;libani&quot; and &quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;brevifolia&quot;.

&quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;libani&quot;: Lebanon cedar, cedar of Lebanon – grows in Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey. &quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;stenocoma&quot; (the Taurus cedar), considered a subspecies in earlier literature, is now recognized as an ecotype of &quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;libani&quot;. It usually has a spreading crown that does not flatten. This distinct morphology is a habit that is assumed to cope with the competitive environment, since the tree occurs in dense stands mixed with the tall-growing &quot;Abies cilicica&quot;, or in pure stands of young cedar trees.

&quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;brevifolia&quot;: The Cyprus cedar occurs on the island&#x27;s Troodos Mountains. This taxon was considered a separate species from &quot;C. libani&quot; because of morphological and ecophysiological trait differences. It is characterized by slow growth, shorter needles, and higher tolerance to drought and aphids. Genetic relationship studies, however, did not recognize &quot;C. brevifolia&quot; as a separate species, the markers being indistinguishable from those of &quot;C. libani&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;libani&quot; is endemic to elevated mountains around the Eastern Mediterranean in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. The tree grows in well-drained calcareous lithosols on rocky, north- and west-facing slopes and ridges and thrives in rich loam or a sandy clay in full sun. Its natural habitat is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with an annual precipitation of ; the trees are blanketed by a heavy snow cover at the higher elevations. In Lebanon and Turkey, it occurs most abundantly at elevations of , where it forms pure forests or mixed forests with Cilician fir (&quot;Abies cilicica&quot;), European black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;), Turkish pine (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;), and several juniper species. In Turkey, it can occur as low as .

&quot;C. libani&quot; var. &quot;brevifolia&quot; grows in similar conditions in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus at medium to high elevations ranging from .

==History and symbolism==
In the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest great works of literature, the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and his friend Enkidu travel to the legendary Cedar Forest to kill its guardian and cut down its trees. While early versions of the story place the forest in Iran, later Babylonian accounts of the story place the Cedar Forest in Lebanon.

The Lebanon cedar is mentioned several times in the Bible. Hebrew priests were ordered by Moses to use the bark of the Lebanon cedar in the treatment of leprosy. Solomon also procured cedar timber to build the Temple in Jerusalem. The Hebrew prophet Isaiah used the Lebanon cedar (together with &quot;oaks of Bashan&quot;, &quot;all the high mountains&quot; and &quot;every high tower&quot;) as examples of loftiness as a metaphor for the pride of the world and in Psalm 92:12 it says &quot;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon&quot;.

===National and regional significance===

The Lebanon cedar is the national emblem of Lebanon, and is displayed on the flag of Lebanon and coat of arms of Lebanon. It is also the logo of Middle East Airlines, which is Lebanon&#x27;s national carrier. Beyond that, it is also the main symbol of Lebanon&#x27;s &quot;Cedar Revolution&quot; of 2005, the 17 October Revolution, also known as the &quot;Thawra&quot; (&quot;Revolution&quot;) along with many Lebanese political parties and movements, such as the Lebanese Forces. Finally, Lebanon is sometimes metonymically referred to as the Land of the Cedars.

Arkansas, among other US states, has a Champion Tree program that records exceptional tree specimens. The Lebanon cedar recognized by the state is located inside Hot Springs National Park and is estimated to be over 100 years old.

==Cultivation==
The Lebanon cedar is widely planted as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens.

When the first cedar of Lebanon was planted in Britain is unknown, but it dates at least to 1664, when it is mentioned in &quot;Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber&quot; by John Evelyn. In Britain, cedars of Lebanon are known for their use in London&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery.

&quot;C. libani&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).

===Propagation===
In order to germinate &quot;Cedrus libani&quot; seeds, potting soil is preferred, since it is less likely to contain fungal species which may kill the seedling in its early stages. Before sowing it is important to soak the seed at room temperature for a period of 24 hours followed by cold stratification (~3–5°C) for two to four weeks. Once the seeds have been sown, it is recommended that they be kept at room temperature (~20°C) and in the vicinity of sunlight. The soil should be kept slightly damp with low frequency watering. Over-watering may cause damping off which will quickly kill the seedlings. Initial growth will be around 3–5cm the first year and will accelerate subsequent years.

==Uses==
Cedar wood is prized for its fine grain, attractive yellow color, and fragrance. It is exceptionally durable and immune to insect ravages. Wood from &quot;C. libani&quot; has a density of 560 kg/m3; it is used for furniture, construction, and handicrafts. In Turkey, shelterwood cutting and clearcutting techniques are used to harvest timber and promote uniform forest regeneration. Cedar resin (cedria) and cedar essential oil (cedrum) are prized extracts from the timber and cones of the cedar tree.

==Ecology and conservation==
Over the centuries, extensive deforestation has occurred, with only small remnants of the original forests surviving. Deforestation has been particularly severe in Lebanon and on Cyprus; on Cyprus, only small trees up to tall survive, though Pliny the Elder recorded cedars tall there. Attempts have been made at various times throughout history to conserve the Lebanon cedars. The first was made by the Roman emperor Hadrian; he created an imperial forest and ordered it marked by inscribed boundary stones, two of which are in the museum of the American University of Beirut.

Extensive reforestation of cedar is carried out in the Mediterranean region. In Turkey, over 50 million young cedars are planted annually, covering an area around . Lebanese cedar populations are also expanding through an active program combining replanting and protection of natural regeneration from browsing goats, hunting, forest fires, and woodworms. The Lebanese approach emphasizes natural regeneration by creating proper growing conditions. The Lebanese state has created several reserves, including the Chouf Cedar Reserve, the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the Tannourine Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri.

Because during the seedling stage, differentiating &quot;C. libani&quot; from &quot;C. atlantica&quot; or &quot;C. deodara&quot; is difficult, the American University of Beirut has developed a DNA-based method of identification to ensure that reforestation efforts in Lebanon are of the cedars of Lebanon and not other types.

==Diseases and pests==
&quot;C. libani&quot; is susceptible to a number of soil-borne, foliar, and stem pathogens. The seedlings are prone to fungal attacks. &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, a necrotrophic fungus known to cause considerable damage to food crops, attacks the cedar needles, causing them to turn yellow and drop. &quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; (commonly known as honey fungus) is a basidiomycete that fruits in dense clusters at the base of trunks or stumps and attacks the roots of cedars growing in wet soils. The Lebanese cedar shoot moth (&quot;Parasyndemis cedricola&quot;) is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae found in the forests of Lebanon and Turkey; its larvae feed on young cedar leaves and buds.

<text>Bela Palanka (Serbian Cyrillic: Бела Паланка, ) is a town and municipality located in the Pirot District of southeastern Serbia. According to the 2022 census, the population of the town is 7,140, and the population of the municipality is 9,947. In ancient times, the town was known as Remesiana in Dacia Mediterranea. The name &quot;Bela Palanka&quot; means &#x27;white town&#x27;.
==History==
===Ancient Bela Palanka===
The town was originally settled by the Dacians and was known under the ancient name of Aiadava or Aeadaba. Thracians inhabited the area until their assimilation into contemporary ethnic groups in the area.

After the Romans conquered Moesia in 75 BC, the new castrum (imperial domain with estates) and municipium was known initially as &quot;Ulpianorum&quot; and then &quot;Remesiana&quot; (Moesi) and stood along the Via Militaris between Naissus and Serdica.

Emperor Justinian had following strongholds in the district of Remesiana:
The patron saint of Romania, Nicetas of Remesiana, was a 4th-century bishop at Remesiana. Peter the Hermit was defeated by the Byzantines in the north and regrouped at an evacuated Bela Palanka, gathering the harvest before heading to Constantinople.

Excavations include well-preserved castrum dating to 4th century and a hoard of 260 coins minted during the rule of Constantine I, Theodosius I, Tiberius Claudius Nero. During the 1096 People&#x27;s Crusade the town, left abandoned by its inhabitants, was briefly occupied by the pilgrims led by Peter the Hermit, Walter of Breteuil and Rainald of Breis.

===Ottoman Empire===
During the centuries of Ottoman control, Bela Palanka was the site of a major caravanserai (or &quot;han&quot;) along the Tsarigrad Road. Ottoman authorities ordered the first such caravanserai be built in the settlement (then named &quot;Izvor&quot;) from wood in 1598-99, during the Long Turkish War, largely due to persistent attacks on travelers by hajduks. This structure deteriorated after a few decades and was replaced by a larger and more durable caravanserai made of stone, commissioned by the local governor, Musa Pasha. This han differed from others in the region because of its large size and because it had separate large rooms for harems of dignitaries. The interior of the han was painted by an artist brought from Buda. To honor its patron, the name of the settlement was then changed to Musa-paša Palanka, from which the town&#x27;s current name was derived.

===Modern Serbia===

From 1929 to 1941, Bela Palanka was part of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

==Geography==
Bela Palanka is a small town in the southeast of the country and is surrounded by countryside and mountains such as Golaš. The town is accessible from the nearby city of Niš by the Niš Express buses that run from Niš to Pirot, Babušnica, Dimitrovgrad, and Sofia.

===Climate===
Bela Palanka has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csb&quot;), that&#x27;s very close to a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;).


==Settlements==
Aside from the town of Bela Palanka, the municipality consists of the following villages:

<text>Remesiana (Byzantine Greek: Ρεμεσιανισία) was an ancient Roman city and former bishopric, which remains an Eastern Orthodox and also a Latin Catholic titular see, located around and under the modern city of Bela Palanka in Serbia.

Remesiana was declared an Archaeological Sites of Great Importance in 1987, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.

== History ==
Remesiana was built after the Roman conquest of Moesia, in the area of the town Aiadava. It was on the route of ancient Via Militaris road between Naissus and Serdica in Dacia Mediterranea.

=== Districts ===
Byzantine Emperor Justinian had the following strongholds in the district of Remesiana :
Brittura, Subaras, Lamponiana, Stronges, Dalmatas, Primiana, Phrerraria, Topera, Tomes, Cuas, Tzertzenutzas, Stens, Aeadaba, Destreba, Pretzouries, Cumudeba, Deurias, Lutzolo, Rhepordenes, Spelonca, Scumbro, Briparo, Tulcoburgo, Longiana, Lupophantana, Dardapara, Burdomina, Grinciapana, Graecus and Drasimarca.

====Localities====
*Briparo

=== Site of the Assembly ===
Austrian historian Karl Patsch&#x27;s opinion that the provincial assembly of Moesia Superior sat at Remesiana, based upon the fact that some inscriptions were discovered, &quot;inaugurated between 202 and 209 by Ulpiana in honour of Septimius Severus and Julia Augusta,&quot; is not correct. 

One can see in a recently discovered inscription of identical content that these inscriptions were inaugurated in 202. However, that year Septimius Severus returned from the east to Rome and probably passed through Remesiana and on that occasion the inscriptions were inaugurated.

== Ecclesiastical History ==
Remesiana was import enough in the Late Roman province of Dacia Mediterranea to become (circa 300 AD) one of the suffragans of its capital&#x27;s Metropolitan, the Archdiocese of Serdica, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
It was suppressed circa 500 AD.

Only two residential &quot;Suffragan Bishops of Remesiana&quot; are historically documented :
* Saint Nicetas of Remesiana (fl. ca. 335–414), friend of Paulinus of Nola, and to whom Gennadio di Marsiglia dedicated a brief biographical note in &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot;, patron saint of Romania, canonized by both Catholic and Orthodox churches
* Diogenianus, participant at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449.

=== Titular see ===
Remesiana is an Eastern Orthodox titular see, within the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Remesiana is also a Roman Catholic titular see since circa 1890, when the diocese as nominally restored as Latin titular bishopric of Remesiana (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Remesianen(sis) (Latin adjective).

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :
* Joseph-Marie Leray, Sacred Heart Missionaries (M.S.C.) (born France) (1897.07.27 – death 1929.10.17) as first Apostolic Vicar of Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) (1897.07.27 – 1927) and emeritate

They have played their home games at Legends Field (formerly CommunityAmerica Ballpark) since 2003, when the team began as a member of the Northern League. In 2011, the team joined the modern American Association. In 2018, the T-Bones won their first-ever American Association championship by defeating the St. Paul Saints. While named the T-Bones, the team&#x27;s mascot was named Sizzle. On January 21, 2021, the team announced a partnership with the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and a rebranding to the Kansas City Monarchs, one of the founding teams of that league.

The Monarchs defeated the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks in the 2021 American Association championship, claiming the franchise&#x27;s third title. They then added a fourth championship in 2023, defeating the Chicago Dogs.

==History==

The team was founded in 1993 as the Duluth–Superior Dukes (representing Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin), a charter member of the Northern League. The Dukes were mostly unsuccessful in their history, but won the Northern League championship in 1997, though league records do not reflect such continuity.

=== Northern League (2003–2010) ===

The T-Bones broke ground on the park now known as Legends Field on September 4, 2002, and played their first home game on June 6, 2003, just over nine months later. In their inaugural season, the team finished 43–46, but enjoyed a banner season from Eddie Pearson, who led the league in batting average (.362), RBIs (78), and hits (124) and was named 2003 Northern League Most Valuable Player.

The T-Bones finished the 2004 regular season with a 48–48 record. However, the T-Bones won the second-half South Division title and faced the Schaumburg Flyers in the first round of the playoffs. The T-Bones lost the best-of-five series 3–2. For the year, T-Bones player Eddie Pearson received the Most Valuable Player Award, Rick Muntean received Co-Executive of the Year, and the team received Organization of the Year. Several league records were set by T-Bones players: Jonathan Krysa set records for innings pitched (), total batters faced, and games started (24); Rick Prieto set new records for walks (78) and runs (97) while tying the league record for triples (10); and Eddie Pearson set the intentional walks record with 17.

The T-Bones accumulated a 45–49 record in 2005. They finished second in the first half with a record of 27–19, just missing the playoff berth, but never contended in the second half due to the loss of several key players.

In 2006, Jonathan Krysa, a failed 26th round Houston Astros draft pick who lasted only a couple seasons in the minor leagues, was named Northern League Pitcher of the Year with a record of 13–5 and a 3.74 ERA. The T-Bones finished third in both halves of the season. They led the second-half race until the final week, when a disastrous season-ending road trip ended their hopes. On October 16, the T-Bones announced the firing of manager, &quot;Dirty&quot; Al Gallagher, who had been the team&#x27;s first and only manager. He was replaced by Andy McCauley.

During the 2006 campaign, the team hosted the Northern League All-Star Game on July 18 in front of 5,975 fans. Eight T-Bones were selected to the East Division squad, which won the game 7–6, scoring two runs in the bottom of the ninth. Kansas City closer Byron Embry earned the win and T-Bones infielder Chad Sosebee drove in the winning run. The highlight of the night, though, was the appearance of 94-year-old Buck O&#x27;Neil, a former Kansas City Monarchs star who took one at-bat for each side, drawing walks each time. He became the oldest person to ever appear in a professional baseball game.

The team hired former Schaumburg manager Andy McCauley to replace Gallagher in 2007. They began the season with only two players carried over from the previous year, and released them by mid-season for a complete turnover of its 22-man roster. The T-Bones finished deep in last place in the Southern Division in the first half, but moved into the lead during the second half and held that lead until a late-season collapse left them in second-place finish. The team&#x27;s overall 44–52 record was one game worse than the previous season&#x27;s franchise record. Despite their finish, the organization was named Northern League Organization of the Year.

In 2008, the Northern League contracted to six teams, and a single-division full season schedule was used. The T-Bones finished only marginally better (46–50) than the two previous seasons, but nonetheless qualified as the fourth team in the playoffs. They swept the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks in the best-of-five semifinal round of the playoffs and then defeated the Gary SouthShore RailCats three games to one to win the Northern League championship.

The T-Bones matched their previous season&#x27;s record (46–50) and finish (fourth in a six-team league) in 2009, but could not advance past the first round, losing that series 3–2 to Gary. Shortly after the end of the season, the team announced that hitting coach Tim Doherty had been promoted to manager for the following season, replacing Andy McCauley.

The Northern League expanded to eight teams again for 2010, but maintained the same playoff format, allowing the top four finishers into the postseason. The T-Bones enjoyed their most successful season under new manager Tim Doherty, winning 58 games and setting a new league record with 162 home runs, exceeding the previous high by more than 30%. They led through much of the year, but faded in the stretch to finish in second place, three games behind Fargo-Moorhead. T-Bones second baseman Jason Blackwood led the Northern League in home runs (31), RBI (86), runs scored (82), hits (141), total bases (271), and slugging percentage (.636) while finishing third in batting average (.331), and was named 2010 Northern League Player of the Year. The team beat the Joliet Jackhammers three games to two in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept in three games by Fargo-Moorhead in the finals. The T-Bones were named Northern League Organization of the Year for the second time in four seasons, and CommunityAmerica Ballpark was named &quot;Northern League Playing Surface of the Year&quot; for the second-straight season.

=== American Association (2011–present) ===

On October 13, 2010, the T-Bones left the Northern League, along with the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, Gary SouthShore RailCats, and the Winnipeg Goldeyes to join the American Association (AA) for the 2011 season. The team fell out of the race early and finished fifth (last) in their division, though their 48–52 record was better than any third-place finisher in the other two divisions. Outfielder Ray Sadler was the offensive leader, hitting .315 with 22 HR (second in the AA) and a league-leading 100 RBI. Outfielder Keanon Simon led the team with a .332 average and tied for the league lead with 16 triples, while catcher Kala Kaaihue tied Sadler with 22 homeruns. Kris Johnson finished third in the AA with a 3.23 ERA.

The T-Bones, in their second year in the American Association, finished second in their division with a 51–49 record, but did not qualify for the 2012 playoffs. This was the first season for the T-Bones under Kenny Hook. The 2013 T-Bones finished in third in their division with a 40–60 record, posting the worst record in franchise history. After the season, manager Kenny Hook&#x27;s contract was not renewed. In 2014, Kansas City&#x27;s record improved to 48–52 under first-year manager John Massarelli, finishing third in the Central Division. The 2015 T-Bones were left in a distant second place with a 49–50 record,  games behind Sioux City. In a tight 2016 Central Division that saw the top three teams finish two games apart, the T-Bones were the lone team left out of the division race, finishing in last place with a 42–58 record. Despite this, second baseman Brett Wiley was named a postseason American Association All-Star. John Massarelli did not return as manager after this season.

Before the 2017 season, the T-Bones hired longtime Can-Am League manager Joe Calfapietra. The move paid immediate dividends as the T-Bones posted their best season since moving to the AA, finishing 57–43, tying the Gary SouthShore RailCats and Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks for the American Association wild card slot. The RailCats, however earned the playoff spot on a tiebreaker. Closer Cody Winiarski was named American Association Reliever of the Year.

In 2018, the T-Bones posted their best season in franchise history, going 62–37. They finished  games behind Sioux City, but ended  games ahead of Wichita, securing their first playoff berth since moving to the American Association. They ousted Sioux City in five games, moving on to face St. Paul in the American Association finals, where the T-Bones prevailed in four games for their first AA crown and second league title in franchise history. Pitcher Tommy Collier led the league with 12 wins and 140 strikeouts, while Todd Cunningham was named an American Association Postseason All-Star. Joe Calfapietra earned the Manager of the Year Award.

After trailing by ten games in late July 2019, the T-Bones rallied to capture their first division title, winning the South Division with a 58–42 record, one game ahead of both Sioux City and the Cleburne Railroaders. In the playoffs, Sioux City eliminated Kansas City in four games.

Following years of sliding attendance and mounting debt, the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas evicted the T-Bones from T-Bones Stadium on October 14, 2019, for failure to pay nearly US$700,000 of rent and utility payments. Days later, the Unified Government approved a stadium lease with an organization trying to purchase the T-Bones. The purchase was completed, and the new five-year lease has three five-year options.

In 2020, the league announced that the T-Bones were not selected as one of six teams to participate in a condensed season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They went on hiatus for the season, with plans to return in 2021. The T-Bones partnered with the Unified Government and the Kansas City Royals, the Major League Baseball franchise across the river in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri, to host a group of Royals players and coaches at T-Bones Stadium as the club&#x27;s &quot;alternate training site&quot; for summer training.

Kansas City won the 2021 American Association championship, going a perfect 6-0 in the postseason and sweeping the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks in the best-of-five Finals. The season was highlighted by posting a league-best and franchise-record 69 wins, as well as setting AA records with 149 homers and 664 runs scored. Infielder Ryan Grotjohn and Outfielder Gabriel Guerrero both earned postseason All-Star nods, Joe Calfapietra earned the Manager of the Year nod, and Guerrero was Finals MVP.

The 2022 campaign saw the American Association shuffle divisional alignments from North-South to East-West. Nonetheless, the Monarchs earned a third straight division title with a league-best 65-35 record to take the West crown, only to succumb in the semifinals to eventual champion Fargo-Moorhead. Starting pitcher Matt Hall earned AA Starting Pitcher of the Year honors after posting a league-record 1.10 ERA while the club shattered their own year-old league records by scoring 696 runs and blasting 165 home runs, while also setting league records in slugging percentage (.505), walks (478), grand slams (8), and total bases (1,767). 

In 2023, the Monarchs once more took the West with a league-best 59-40 record before going 7-2 through the playoffs, dispatching the Chicago Dogs in four games to win the best-of-five Miles Wolff Cup series, matching the league record set by the Winnipeg Goldeyes with their third American Association title. Catcher Chris Herrmann earned Postseason All-Star honors and was named American Association Player of the Year after slashing .355/.439/.617 with 23 home runs and a league-high 88 RBI. Jan Hernandez took homer Finals MVP honors.

<text>In investment banking, an arranger is a provider of funds in the syndication of a debt. They are entitled to syndicate the loan or bond issue, and may be referred to as the &quot;lead underwriter&quot;. This is because this entity bears the risk of being able to sell the underlying securities/debt or the cost of holding it on its books until such time in the future that they may be sold. They do not necessarily acquire all the debt - this may be split into various parts and sold to a variety of Arrangers.

Prior to the syndication of a loan and at the point where the loan documentation is signed, the title of &quot;Bookrunner&quot; is allocated to the bank that commits to provide the loan. This may be shared amongst several investors depending on the size of the deal. The &quot;Arranger&quot; is the entity (or entities) that subsequently agrees and negotiates the project financing structure. They will not necessarily be the same entity, although they often are.

Upon final signing of the full syndicate, the Bookrunner title may be forfeited to another lender. If amendments are made to the loan, the banks that committed to the original loan may retain their involvement in the deal as &quot;Mandated Arrangers&quot;. The Bookrunner title is then assigned to the banks comprising the new lender group.

A bank may also be referred to as a &quot;lead arranger&quot;, implying that they are more senior in the hierarchy of Arrangers involved in the deal.

For a coordinated series of bilaterals the Mandated Arranger title is allocated to the coordinators.

<text>Sebastian Lewis Shaw (29 May 1905 – 23 December 1994) was an English actor, theatre director, novelist, playwright and poet. During his seven decade career, he appeared in dozens of stage performances and more than 40 film and television productions.

Shaw was born and brought up in Holt, Norfolk, and made his acting debut at age eight at a London theatre. He studied acting at Gresham&#x27;s School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although he worked primarily on the London stage, he made his Broadway debut in 1929, when he played one of the two murderers in &quot;Rope&#x27;s End&quot;. He appeared in his first film, &quot;Caste&quot;, in 1930 and quickly began to create a name for himself in films. He described himself as a &quot;rotten actor&quot; as a youth and said his success was primarily due to his good looks. He claimed to mature as a performer only after returning from service in the Royal Air Force during World War II.

Shaw was particularly known for his performances in productions of Shakespeare plays which were considered daring and ahead of their time. In 1966, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he remained for a decade and delivered some of his most acclaimed performances. He also wrote several poems and a novel, &quot;The Christening&quot;, in 1975. In 1983, he appeared in the third installment of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; Trilogy, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, as the redeemed Anakin Skywalker, as well as Skywalker&#x27;s ghost in the original 1983 theatrical release of the film.

== Early life==
Shaw was one of three children born to Geoffrey Shaw, the music master at Gresham&#x27;s School, a Norfolk independent boarding school, where Shaw began his education. His uncle, Martin Shaw, was a composer of church music, and his family&#x27;s love of music heavily influenced Shaw&#x27;s career path.

==Career==
===Early career===
Shaw made his acting debut at age eight on the London stage as one of the juvenile band in &quot;The Cockyolly Bird&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in Chelsea on New Year&#x27;s Day of 1914. During his time at Gresham&#x27;s, he also played Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, his first of many performances from the works of William Shakespeare; schoolmate W. H. Auden, who would go on to become a highly regarded poet, portrayed Katherina in the play opposite him. After Gresham&#x27;s, Shaw planned to become a painter and spent two years at the Slade School of Fine Art before switching his interests to acting; regarding the change, his father informed him, &quot;I wondered when you would come to your senses.&quot; He earned a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in Bloomsbury, London. Actor Charles Laughton enrolled in the academy at the same time as Shaw, who later said his first impression of Laughton was &quot;a poor fat boy&quot;. Although Shaw and his fellow students initially felt pity for Laughton, they were quickly impressed with his talent.

Shaw appeared in regional theatres in Bristol, Liverpool and Hull. In 1925, he performed in London as the Archangel in &quot;The Sign of the Sun&quot;, and played first Lewis Dodd and then the Major in separate productions of &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;. He received instruction in verse speaking under famed theatre director William Bridges-Adams in the Stratford Festival Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he played some of his early Shakespeare roles, including Romeo in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Ferdinand in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Prince Hal in &quot;Henry IV&quot; in 1926. He was criticised for the audacity he displayed in the latter role. When Prince Hal takes on his kingship and rejects the self-indulgent character Falstaff, convention of the day called for Prince Hal to change from a jovial drinking partner to an arrogant snob, but Shaw saw the view as simple-minded and contradictory toward Shakespeare&#x27;s script. Instead, he displayed inward regrets about leaving Falstaff and accepting the new responsibilities. The interpretation was criticised at the time but, years later, became the standard approach to the character.

Shaw made his Broadway debut in 1929, when he played the murderer Wyndham Brandon in Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s stage thriller, &quot;Rope&#x27;s End&quot;. In 1929, he married Margaret Delamere and lived with her in Albany, an apartment complex off Piccadilly in Westminster. The two would eventually have a daughter together named Drusilla (born 1932). He returned to the works of William Shakespeare in 1931, playing Claudio in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; at London&#x27;s Fortune Playhouse. In 1932 he once again played Romeo at the Embassy Theatre. Other works around this period included productions of Ivor Novello&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Sisters&quot; in 1933, &quot;Double Door&quot; alongside actress Sybil Thorndike in 1934, J.M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;A Kiss for Cinderella&quot; in 1937, and Robert Morley&#x27;s &quot;Goodness, How Sad&quot; in 1938.

The first film Shaw appeared in was &quot;Caste&quot; in 1930. He soon began to make a name for himself in films such as &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; in 1935, &quot;Men Are Not Gods&quot; in 1936 and &quot;Farewell Again&quot; in 1937. He was making about £300 a week during this stage of his career, a significant sum higher than the salary of the British Prime Minister of the time. He brought what the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; described as a &quot;smooth villainy&quot; to the role of Frank Sutton in &quot;The Squeaker&quot; in 1937, while in 1939 he played the hero Cdr. David Blacklock alongside Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in &quot;The Spy in Black&quot;, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s first collaboration. Shaw described himself as a film buff and called Academy Award-winning actor Spencer Tracy his &quot;great god of all screen actors&quot;; he was so impressed by Tracy&#x27;s technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple, while Shaw claimed to find it so difficult to master himself.

===Second World War and post-war career ===

When the Second World War broke out, Shaw took a break from acting and joined the Royal Air Force. On 25 April 1941 he was commissioned as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch and over the next three months was speedily promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, Flying Officer and Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Shaw saw little action in the service and was told the only chance he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs, while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned his commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.

Immediately upon returning to London after the war, Shaw lost his Albany flat and his acting contract, and essentially had to restart his acting career. Although he had made twenty films before the war and had already begun to develop a reputation as a strong leading man, in later years he would describe himself as &quot;a rotten actor&quot; in the 1930s who landed roles based mainly on his good looks. He used the phrase &quot;a piece of cinema beefcake&quot; to describe himself as an actor during that period. He felt that after his return home from military service, he learned to act properly and began to mature as a performer. Shaw&#x27;s Royal Air Force experience was put to good use when he played a pilot in &quot;Journey Together&quot;, the 1946 RAF training film in which actor Edward G. Robinson coached actor Richard Attenborough in the rudiments of flying.

In 1945, Shaw returned to the Embassy Theatre to direct Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Gambler&quot;. Significant theatre roles that decade included Hercules in &quot;The Thracian Horses&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in 1946, Mr. Hern-Lawrence in Florida Scott-Maxwell&#x27;s experimental &quot;I Said to Myself&quot; at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate in 1947, Sir James Kirkham in &quot;His Excellency&quot; at Prince&#x27;s Theatre in 1950, and Filmer Jesson, MP, in Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;His House in Order&quot; at New Theatre in 1951. In 1956, he played the title role in the first British production of Hugo von Hofmannsthal&#x27;s &quot;Everyman&quot;. That same year, he wrote the lyrics to his father&#x27;s ballad-opera, &quot;All at Sea&quot;, which played at the Royal College of Music. In 1957, he played Lucifer in &quot;Brother Lucifer&quot; in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and a sinister Venetian agent in Jonathan Griffin&#x27;s &quot;The Hidden King&quot; in Edinburgh.

As Shaw grew older, his reputation as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts. In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla. Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with Joan Ingpen, the well-known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point that she took his surname, until Shaw&#x27;s death. During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of the disc jockey John Peel, whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy, he said he did not feel comfortable with the arrangement. He felt it disrupted his mother&#x27;s friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship.

In 1965, British theatre director William Gaskill was named artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, where he hoped to re-establish a repertoire. He approached Shaw, who had made his acting début at the Royal Court Theatre as a youth, and Shaw agreed to return. There he delivered several performances over the next year, including General Conrad von Hotzendorf in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot;; various roles in Ann Jellicoe&#x27;s &quot;Shelley&quot;; Sir Francis Harker in N.F. Simpson&#x27;s &quot;The Cresta Run&quot; and Pte Atterclife in John Arden&#x27;s &quot;Serjeant Musgrave&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

=== Royal Shakespeare Company ===

In 1966, Shaw joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he spent the next decade of his career and eventually became an associate artist. He mostly appeared in Shakespeare plays, including the title role in &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, Edmund of Langley in &quot;Richard II&quot;, the King in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, Ulysses in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and Leonato in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; described his performance in the title role of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; as &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot; described his performance as Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; as &quot;unrivalled in his complacency and sense of circumstance&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; described his performance of Gloucester in &quot;King Lear&quot; as &quot;doleful&quot; and his performance of Duncan in &quot;Macbeth&quot; as &quot;decent&quot;. Many of the company&#x27;s Shakespearean productions at the time were considered interpretive and modern, which drew criticism from some traditionalists, but Shaw defended the experimental nature of the shows and rejected the notion that plays should be restricted to preconceived interpretations.

During his time with the company, he also demonstrated what the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; called a &quot;crusty charm&quot; as Sir Oblong Fitz Oblong in Robert Bolt&#x27;s children&#x27;s play &quot;The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew&quot;. He was also noted as possessing a gift for dry comedy during this period of his acting career, exemplified by his roles in Maxim Gorky&#x27;s plays &quot;Enemies&quot; and &quot;Summerfolk&quot;. He demonstrated a particular knack for Russian comedy in Jonathan Miller&#x27;s productions of the Anton Chekhov plays &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;Ivanov&quot;.

In 1978, Shaw earned acclaim for his performance as a judge in the stage debut of &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; at the Mermaid Theatre. The production won Laurence Olivier Awards for Best Play and Best Actor (Tom Conti). Although 73 years old, Shaw did not let his age slow down his career. During the run of this production a mugger tried to steal his money, but Shaw chased him down, tackled him and recovered his property. Later that year, he was painted in the nude by his nephew, Brian Ocean. During his later years, Shaw suffered a physical disability that made him tremble, which had a negative impact on his television roles, particularly when handling cups or trays of drinks. One of his later television appearances was in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, a 1979 mini-series based on the novel by Charles Dickens. Around this time, he also voiced the part of Squire Beltham in a radio production of &quot;The Adventures of Harry Richmond&quot;, which the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said was &quot;remembered with affection&quot;. He lent his voice to several radio performances, both Shakespearean and modern, including protagonist John Tanner in the five-hour &quot;Man and Superman&quot; by George Bernard Shaw.

=== Writing career ===
Shaw wrote &quot;Take a Life&quot;, his first play, in 1961. He directed a production of the show at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre, where he also played the lead role of the Detective. That same year he played two lead roles in George Bernard Shaw plays at the Dublin Theatre Festival: &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; and &quot;Candida&quot;. Around this time, he also wrote an outline for a television comedy series about four girls sharing a flat, inspired by his real-life daughter, who was in her early twenties and living in a flat with other girls her age. The series was submitted to the Granada Television company, which expressed interest in the show and said it was one of two under consideration for television. The company ultimately chose the other show, the long-running British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Shaw agreed to take certain roles only on the condition that he have complete freedom to rewrite his dialogue. When he appeared in &quot;It Happened Here&quot;, a 1966 World War II film, he wrote many of his own lines, which the filmmakers later said &quot;gave his dialogue an individual slant which enhanced his performance&quot;. He also helped in other aspects of the filmmaking, including casting; he introduced the filmmakers to Fiona Leland, who would be cast as the wife of Shaw&#x27;s character in &quot;It Happened Here&quot;. He wrote other plays, including &quot;The Ship&#x27;s Bell&quot;, &quot;The Cliff Walk&quot;, &quot;The Glass Maze&quot; and &quot;Cul de Sac&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Poems&quot;, a collection of his personal poetry, which saw a limited print of 300 copies by publisher Exeter University.

Shaw wrote &quot;The Christening&quot;, his only novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who believes that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney&#x27;s childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both of his mother and a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick&#x27;s house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver&#x27;s exposure.

A description in the book cover flap reads, &quot;In this tender, sensitive and blackly comic novel, Sebastian Shaw, the distinguished Shakespearean actor, explores areas of sexual and emotional encounter that are rarely seen and, unfortunately, too rarely understood.&quot; Shaw originally planned to call the novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but later said he was glad he did not due to the popularity of Mario Puzo&#x27;s book of that name. He was said to have been working on another novel shortly after &quot;The Christening&quot; was completed, but no others were ever published.

Shaw&#x27;s memoirs were published posthumously in 2016.

=== &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ===

In 1982, Shaw was chosen for the brief but significant role of redeemed, unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the third and final film in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. As in the previous films, David Prowse and Bob Anderson played the costumed scenes, while James Earl Jones and Ben Burtt provided the voice and breaths of Darth Vader. Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard the second Death Star when Luke Skywalker (Hamill) unmasks his dying father. Since this scene was the unequivocal emotional climax of the film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role. Contrary to popular belief, Shaw was familiar with the previous two &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and enjoyed them particularly for the visual effects, which he described in an interview with science-fiction film magazine &quot;Starlog&quot; as &quot;brilliant techniques which, in many ways, were revolutionary, something quite new.&quot;

When Shaw arrived at the set for filming, he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid, the actor playing Emperor Palpatine. When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there, Shaw responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, dear boy, I think it&#x27;s something to do with science-fiction.&quot; His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by Richard Marquand, was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue.

When the film was re-released on DVD in 2004, a few changes were made: the unmasking scene with Hamill remained mostly the same, but Shaw&#x27;s eyebrows were digitally removed to maintain continuity with the injuries Darth Vader suffers at the end of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. His naturally brown eyes were also colored blue to match those of Hayden Christensen, who portrayed Anakin in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film, in which he is a Force ghost of Anakin. Shaw&#x27;s image in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 DVD release. This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be among the most controversial changes in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; re-releases.

Although Shaw&#x27;s unmasking scene lasted only two minutes and seven seconds and included just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw, he received more fan mail and autograph requests from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; than he had for any role in the rest of his career. He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film.

=== Later career ===

Shaw remained active in his later years; along with fellow Royal Shakespeare Company actors Ian Richardson, John Nettles, Martin Best and Ann Firbank, he engaged in discussions and workshops with acting teachers and students in the early 1980s. Although appearances in films became far less common in his later career, he received much acclaim for his performance as the Cold War spy Sharp in Clare Peploe&#x27;s &quot;High Season&quot; at the New York Film Festival in 1987; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; said Shaw played the role with &quot;endearing, sweet gravity&quot;. One of his last performances was in the Christmas season of 1988 and 1989, when he played the wizard in a stage production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at the Barbican Centre. &quot;The Times&quot; said audiences were &quot;delighted to recognise his honeyed threats from behind the great carapace that disguised the Wizard of Oz&quot;. Shaw became an honorary life-member at the Garrick Club, which included such past members as writers Charles Dickens, J.M. Barrie, Kingsley Amis and A.A. Milne; artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais; and composer Edward Elgar.

==Death==
Shaw died of natural causes on 23 December 1994 at the age of 89 in Brighton, Sussex, England. A memorial service was held on 15 February 1995 at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, commonly known as the &quot;Actors&#x27; Church&quot; due to its long association with the theatre community. Actors Ian Richardson and Ben Kingsley read works by William Shakespeare, stage actress Estelle Kohler read &quot;How Do I Love Thee?&quot; by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, actress Sheila Allen read &quot;Life&quot; by English poet George Herbert and actor Kenneth Branagh read from the works of Canon Henry Scott Holland. One of Shaw&#x27;s own poems, &quot;Gemini&quot;, was also read by Alan Ravenscroft. Baritone Stephen Varcoe sang by Johannes Brahms, accompanied by Graham Johnson on the piano, and guitarist Martin Best performed and sang his composition of &quot;Ariel&#x27;s Songs&quot; from &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Shaw was survived by his partner Joan Ingpen, daughter Drusilla MacLeod (ex-wife of John MacLeod of MacLeod), sisters Susan Bonner-Morgan and Penelope Harness, and sister-in-law Olga Young.His other long term companion Harriet Ravenscroft pre-deceased him.

<doc id="398166" wikidata="Q2265812" url="?curid=398166" title="Sebastian Shaw (character)">
<text>Sebastian Hiram Shaw is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He has been frequently depicted as an adversary of the X-Men.

A mutant, Shaw possesses the ability to absorb energy and transform it into his own raw strength. He is the leader of the New York branch of the Hellfire Club, an exclusive secret society composed of mutants bent on world domination, although to the public, he is a legitimate businessman and ordinary human. He once funded the mutant-hunting Sentinel program to keep it under his thumb.

Kevin Bacon portrays Shaw in the 2011 film &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne, Sebastian Shaw first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #129 (Jan. 1980), during the &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; storyline. John Byrne based the appearance of Sebastian Shaw on British actor Robert Shaw, who had died in 1978.

==Fictional character biography==
Sebastian Shaw was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His power first manifested shortly after he was accepted to engineering school and his father Jacob Shaw died after he contracted an incurable disease. Sebastian Shaw devoted himself to his studies and created Shaw Industries, becoming a millionaire by age 30 and a billionaire by age 40.

===Joining the Hellfire Club===
Shaw became engaged to a woman named Lourdes Chantel, also a mutant, and was soon initiated into the Hellfire Club thanks to his vast fortune along with Warren Worthington II (father of Warren Worthington III), Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Sir James Braddock (father of Brian and Betsy Braddock), having caught the attention of Ned Buckman, then White King of Hellfire Club&#x27;s New York Branch. Shaw became part of the Council of the Chosen, earning the rank of Black Bishop. Lourdes did not trust Buckman, and feared that Shaw&#x27;s ambition and the nature of the Hellfire Club would corrupt him.

===Taking over===
Lourdes is soon seemingly killed by Sentinels in a battle. Upon discovering that Ned Buckman, the White King of the Council, is supporting Steven Lang&#x27;s &quot;Project: Armageddon&quot; and its Sentinels, he executes a coup, using Emma Frost&#x27;s telepathy to make Buckman kill all the Council of the Chosen, including his own White Queen, Paris Seville, and then himself. Shaw proclaims himself Black King, remakes the Council of the Chosen into his Inner Circle and gathers Emma Frost, Harry Leland and the non-mutant cyborg Donald Pierce as the Lords Cardinal of Hellfire Club. At Shaw&#x27;s side is Tessa, who, unbeknownst to him, is a spy working for Charles Xavier.

As the leader of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, Shaw starts plans to dominate the world through force, money and power. His connections to top officials of corporations and government, acquired via the Club and through his position as CEO of Shaw Industries, make him a powerful enemy. Shaw becomes a major supporter and builder of Sentinels. This activity brings him into frequent contact with the major players of Project Wideawake, Senator Robert Kelly and Henry Peter Gyrich, to whom he appears to be an anti-mutant bigot.

===Meeting the X-Men===
Shaw sets his eyes on the X-Men, scheming to capture and study them for use in breeding an army of powerful mutants for the Hellfire Club. He employs the superpowered assassin Warhawk to plant a bug in Cerebro, ensuring the Hellfire Club would be aware of newly manifested mutants at the same moment as the X-Men themselves, as well as giving them access to secret details of their powers and fighting techniques. However, the Club&#x27;s operatives prove ineffective at defeating the X-Men in the field, and the first two mutants they locate in this manner are lost.

Now aware of the Hellfire Club&#x27;s existence, the X-Men infiltrate their headquarters, where they are defeated and captured. However, they escape before Shaw can put them to use. Shaw&#x27;s control of the Hellfire Club grows more tenuous as Pierce proves to be a mutant-hating traitor to the Club and a new recruit to the Inner Circle, Selene, sets her sights on replacing Shaw as the chairman. The Hellfire Club is forced to battle alongside the X-Men against Nimrod, a Sentinel from the future, and though victorious, two key members perish in the fight. After the battle, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men become allies of sorts, with Magneto and Storm filling the position of White King. Arguing that Shaw&#x27;s support of the Sentinels is endangering the Inner Circle, Magneto, Selene and Emma vote him out of the Club.

===Keeping in power===
Months later, Shaw was attacked by his son, Shinobi Shaw, who phased his hand into his father&#x27;s chest to induce a coronary. Shaw was then supposedly blown up in his Swiss Mountain chalet by a bomb set by his son. Shinobi shortly became the new Black King of Hellfire Club; however, Shaw survived, albeit with a scar on his face crossing his left eye, which was removed successfully by Madelyne Pryor (seemingly a sentient psionic construct of X-Man) using her psionic powers during their affair after his reappearance. Shaw became part of a new Inner Circle alongside Selene, Madelyne and Trevor Fitzroy, a descendant of Sebastian himself in an alternate future.

Shaw&#x27;s first move upon recovery from the bomb was to contact the mutant named Holocaust, who had crossed over from the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline. In exchange for a new armored containment suit, Holocaust agreed to help Shaw capture X-Force, which he did with ease. Shaw then had Tessa telepathically brainwash X-Force to hunt down Cable, but Cable used his own emergent telepathy to break the conditioning and free his team. Shaw&#x27;s relationship with Holocaust declined soon after.

Shaw&#x27;s later exploits included vying for control of the Elixir Vitae, thought to be a cure for the Legacy Virus; associations with the British intelligence agency Black Air and an unnamed time-manipulator; and hunting down X-51, the Machine Man. Then, Shaw was apparently ousted from his position as Black King by Selene, who installed the demon Blackheart in his place. This arrangement did not last long, as Selene and Blackheart were defeated and Shaw has since returned to power.

He attempted to use Lady Mastermind to control Tessa (now called &quot;Sage&quot;) and Storm&#x27;s team of X-Men, who were searching for Destiny&#x27;s prophetic diaries. Then, after Professor X was &quot;outed&quot; as a mutant, Shaw apparently returned to his capitalist roots and converted the NY branch of the Hellfire Club into a strip club, which was in fact a safe haven for mutants regardless of affiliation. Using telepathic strippers, Shaw gleaned secrets from the minds of his patrons, who come in just to have a good decadent time. Thanks to the aid of his employees, Shaw pretended to be a telepath himself.

After a few months, though, Shaw made a play to become the new Lord Imperial of the entire Club worldwide, and invited Sage to help him. Shaw also invited Courtney Ross (who was actually her evil counterpart Sat-Yr-9) and Sunspot to join him as the White Queen and Black King. All three accepted, but Sage effectively betrayed Shaw when she did not warn him that Pierce might try to assassinate him. Shaw met with the X-Men, claiming to be somewhat reformed, just before Pierce&#x27;s attack. He was then wounded by Pierce, but remained strong enough to literally knock Pierce&#x27;s head off. However, he was too hurt to maintain his Club position and was replaced by Sunspot, who is now the current Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club.

===Illusion===
Later, it seemed he had joined forces with a new Inner Circle which included Cassandra Nova, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Emma Frost/Perfection, the latter of whom had since joined the X-Men. As the story arc continued to unfold, the Hellfire Club made their attack as they each targeted an individual member of Cyclops&#x27; team of X-Men. Shaw himself defeated Colossus. In the end however, it is revealed that the entire Hellfire Club was not real, and all were mental images created by Emma Frost&#x27;s mind, which was infected with a special &quot;programming&quot; by Cassandra Nova in an attempt to revive her. The Shaw duplicate vanished after being defeated by Cyclops.

===X-Men: Endangered Species===
Shaw appears incognito (with an image-inducer) at a funeral for a mutant boy named Landru. When confronted by Professor X, he merely states that he was paying his respects. Xavier overhears his thoughts of a possible coup against Sunspot during the service. When Shaw notices him watching, he quickly creates a Psi-Shield to hide his thoughts.

===Mister Sinister and the Cronus Machine===
Some time after this Shaw appears at a Hellfire Club dinner hosted by Sunspot and is alerted to a device left to him by his father exploding elsewhere in the compound resulting in the insanity of two club menials and Shaw asking his manservant for a file labelled &quot;Kronos&quot;. After being upbraided over the explosion and deaths by da Costa he is ordered to investigate. Shaw however knows the cause. The explosion in the Hellfire Club was caused by the activation of a machine developed beneath the Alamogordo genetics plant in Las Cruces, New Mexico by Mister Sinister. In the past Sinister had worked here (disguised as a Dr. Milbury) alongside Brian Xavier, Kurt Marko and Irene Adler who had been gathered for him by Jacob Shaw, Sebastian&#x27;s father, as they all had the X-gene and Sinister predicted their children would be mutants. Sinister then experimented of these children (including Cain Marko, Charles Xavier and Sebastian himself), imprinting himself on their DNA. Sinister&#x27;s machine, dubbed the Cronus device, was designed to activate soon after his death and would activate these hidden copies until Sinister could be reborn in one of them. Jacob, wanting to protect his son, created the device in the Hellfire Club from Sinister&#x27;s notes to alert and protect Sebastian from the Cronus device. Shaw travelled to New Mexico to visit another of the children to confirm his theory, running into Xavier and Gambit who were investigating a hit list with the children&#x27;s names on it. Following them he is present when they are attacked by mercenaries under the employ of Amanda Mueller, a former associate of Sinister&#x27;s. Xavier is captured and Gambit and Shaw team up to save Xavier. It is revealed that Mueller wants to house the powers (though not the personality) of Sinister herself and so is assassinating the children, having undergone the procedure herself. She shoots Xavier, who is already struggling to stop Sinister from taking over his body, which allows him to take over. Sinister in Xavier&#x27;s body stops Mueller but is in turn confronted by Shaw and Gambit who destroy the Cronus device while Xavier casts Sinister out of his mind. With the threat gone, Shaw leaves.

===Original Sin===
Later, Shaw joins forces with Claudine Renko, a.k.a. Miss Sinister, a female clone of Mister Sinister. Together they manipulate Wolverine into defeating the new members of the Inner Circle, try to take control of Logan&#x27;s son, Daken, and set up a trap against Xavier. Shaw also attempts to kill Xavier but is stopped by Daken. Shaw is eventually confronted by Wolverine and begins to fight. Shaw&#x27;s powers initially protect him from being injured by Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium claws, allowing him to fare extremely well. The ending of the fight takes place off panel and Wolverine appears with his body and claws soaked with blood, which he soon confirms belongs to Shaw.

===Dark Reign===
During her early days as the White Queen as seen during the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Sebastian Shaw sends Emma to convince Namor to join the Hellfire Club. Instead, Namor takes her to his kingdom and they begin a relationship. Believing Emma to have betrayed him for Namor, Shaw sends a reprogrammed Sentinel to Atlantis, attacking the two and destroying the kingdom. As Namor confronts Shaw for his treachery, Selene takes telepathic hold of Emma, erasing her memories of Namor, who vows revenge on Shaw. In the present, Emma reveals that her initial battle with Phoenix unlocked her memories of Namor. She makes a pact with him, seducing Shaw and using her telepathy to make Namor believe she has executed him, while secretly telepathically incapacitating Shaw. Per their deal, Namor vows to protect mutant-kind as his own people, while Emma, more determined to fill her role as a leader of mutant-kind, contacts Cyclops to have Shaw captured by the X-Men for &quot;crimes against mutant-kind.&quot; Approaching him later in his cell, Emma reveals that she has captured Shaw for Namor and on the basis that the Sentinels he commissioned were ones later used by Cassandra Nova to destroy Genosha. She sentences him to remember nothing but the faces of the Genoshan victims using her telepathy.

===Necrosha===
Shaw is targeted by Selene along with all those who failed her in her attempt to ascend to godhood. It is revealed that sometime after M-Day he had his son, Shinobi Shaw killed. Selene sends Shinobi and Harry Leland after Shaw and Donald Pierce.

===Utopia===
Due to Namor&#x27;s presence on Utopia, Emma realizes that Shaw&#x27;s continued existence poses a threat to the agreement she had made with Namor earlier. She decides to finally kill him, but her plans are exposed when Shadowcat accidentally picks up her thoughts during a psi-conversation between her and Colossus. While disgusted at Frost&#x27;s intended actions, Shadowcat offers her a compromise. As she currently exists as a ghost, she is the perfect tool for making Shaw disappear.

Fantomex, Shadowcat and Emma then take him aboard E.V.A., whilst they work out how to dispose of him. Emma wakes Shaw up and asks him to recount the early days of the Hellfire Club. Emma and two other dancers were the closest of friends, when one night, Emma was offered, by Shaw, the position of Queen. The only stipulation was that one of the two girls had to die. She stated she did not care which one was killed and watched as Shaw proceeded to kill both. Present day, Emma starts to question Shaw further when Fantomex, bored with Emma&#x27;s &quot;woe is me&quot; recounts of her history, drops the floor from under Shaw. Emma goes into a rage at Fantomex, as Fantomex was unaware that Shaw could absorb energy, such as that from hitting the ground from such heights.

Shaw proceeds to engage Frost&#x27;s group, stating that he would rather die than see Emma go on breathing a moment longer. Helped by a maimed Fantomex, the former White Queen tricks Shaw into allowing her into his mind, and (with a little encouragement from Shadowcat), as opposed to killing him, finds the most landlocked place in his mind, the point safest from Namor&#x27;s rage, and wipes his memory. Shaw&#x27;s attitude immediately changes, and he seems to have no recollection of who he is, where he is, or the identities of anyone around him. In response to his asking who she is, Emma Frost simply rebuffs him, and asks him who &quot;he&quot; is, coldly telling him that he always said he was a &quot;self-made man&quot; and now is his chance to prove it. She then leaves with the rest of her expedition, leaving a pondering Shaw kneeling in the mud.

===Schism/Regenesis===
Hope Summers and the Lights find Shaw, assuming him to be a new mutant. When they extract him and bring him back to Utopia, Cyclops is not exactly happy to see him.

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
After the Avengers invaded Utopia in &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Shaw along with the kids in Utopia were taken to the Avengers Academy. It is revealed that Shaw read the file on him and now knows everything about his past although he claims not to remember it. Wolverine distrusts Shaw and insists that he should be imprisoned. Shaw relents and is imprisoned in a cell that absorbs kinetic energy, meaning that Shaw would be unable to break it by building up his own kinetic energy by punching it. Shaw however, asks for books to keep him occupied and uses a book to hit himself for 8 hours straight, allowing him to build up enough energy to break out of the cell and into the storm drain. Hercules, Tigra and Madison Jeffries try to stop him, but are quickly defeated. Elsewhere, the young mutants from Utopia, now joined by Ricochet, Wiz Kid and Hollow, confront the Academy students. Shortly after this, Shaw appears to the teenagers. Before a battle between both parties can become serious, X-23 and Finesse warn their friends that Shaw&#x27;s body language indicates that he doesn&#x27;t mean to hurt anyone, but to help the mutant children to escape. After both sides agree that the mutant children shouldn&#x27;t be confined against their will, they fake a battle to justify their escape in front of the cameras at the Academy.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
In &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Sebastian Shaw represents Shaw Industries during a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Wilson Fisk of Fisk Industries, Darren Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Shingen Harada of the Yashida Corporation, Frr&#x27;dox of Shi&#x27;ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms. They and Dario Agger discuss his and Roxxon Energy Corporation&#x27;s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Sebastian Shaw also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.

===Residing on Krakoa===
In the new phase of the X-Men, beginning with the dual miniseries &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Shaw joins the Quiet Council of Krakoa, a ruling body consisting of 14 mutants. He is also part of the Hellfire Trading Company, responsible for smuggling Krakoa&#x27;s new remedies through the black market.

During this new phase, he is part of the cast of the Marauders.

When the anti-mutant organisation Orchis managed to mount a successful offensive on Krakoa, simultaneously framing the mutants for sabotaging the drugs they had been giving humans to suggest they had been trying to kill innocent people, Shaw openly defected from Krakoa to assist Orchis. He even accepted a demand to sacrifice his mutant powers to associate with Orchis, believing that he could profit from claiming Krakoa&#x27;s natural resources for himself. Unfortunately for Shaw, when he tried to use his business connections he learned that he had been kicked out of the Hellfire Club by the new White King, the Kingpin, and while he had the legal authority to control Krakoa in practise he had no access to any of its resources, and when he tried to claim the land for himself Shaw&#x27;s troops were driven off by Charles Xavier, who was still residing on the island.

==Powers and abilities==
Shaw is a mutant with the unique ability to absorb all kinetic and thermal energy directed at him and use it to augment his strength, speed, stamina and recuperation capabilities to superhuman levels. He absorbs the energy of any impact he is struck by, including not only direct physical blows, but also the impact of bullets and throwing weapons, and less successfully, concussive energy beams; notably Cyclops&#x27; optic blasts. By absorbing successive blows from an opponent, Shaw can surpass the physical abilities of said opponent and then overpower them. His speed is the attribute most dramatically increased by his power; after absorbing enough energy he can attack more quickly than opponents can react. He is sometimes shown to be capable of absorbing the cutting, piercing and thrusting energy from a blade. His powers can enable his body to withstand cutting from adamantium, but only for a short time.

In the past, Shaw has been limited to a certain amount of energy and would lose consciousness when he surpassed his capabilities. Subsequently, however, Shaw has been shown to now be able to take in an indefinite amount of energy without any ill effects. The power he absorbs dissipates over time, and exposure to the elements causes it to drain rapidly. Without any absorbed energy, Shaw is merely a strong ordinary human in excellent physical condition, but regularly works to keep his strength at a superhuman level. In one instance, he was shown to spend time hitting a wall after waking to build up his power reserves before starting the day. Shaw also can forgo sleep if he receives enough energy. Often he will have his mercenaries pummel him so that he would not need to sleep for some time.

Shaw also has a successful business acumen and access to sophisticated weaponry. He not only prides himself on his power and the connections it allows him, but on knowing his opponents and how best to defeat them, whether in battle or in business. He also possesses technology that can block telepathic intrusions by Professor X.

<doc id="398168" wikidata="Q287873" url="?curid=398168" title="Andrea del Boca">
<text>Andrea del Boca (born 18 October 1965 in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine actress and singer. She began her career as a child actress and subsequently became popular in the 1980s and 1990s for her roles in telenovelas, such as &quot;Estrellita mía&quot;, &quot;Celeste&quot;, &quot;Antonella&quot; and &quot;Perla negra&quot;. She has also appeared in numerous films and several theatre productions. Del Boca has won three Martín Fierro Awards.

== Career ==
Del Boca made her debut as a four-year-old in the TV series &quot;Nuestra galleguita&quot; where she played a deaf-mute girl. In 1970, she started to play in the series &quot;Alta comedia&quot; and won the prestigious Martín Fierro Award for 1971 in the &quot;Revelación&quot; category, an equivalent of the Best New Artist. In 1972, she appeared in her first film, &quot;Había una vez un circo&quot;, alongside a trio of popular clowns called Los Payasos de la Tele. She achieved a wide popularity in Argentina at the age of seven when she played the part of a little orphan Pinina in &quot;Papá corazón&quot; on Canal 13 in 1973. In the same year she appeared in the film &quot;Andrea&quot;, followed by a film adaptation of &quot;Papá corazón&quot; in 1974, &quot;Papá Corazón se quiere casar&quot;, and &quot;Un mundo de amor&quot; (&quot;A World of Love&quot;) in 1975.

From 1979 to 1980 she played the leading role in the telenovela &quot;Andrea Celeste&quot; with Alberto Argibay, Ana María Picchio and Raúl Taibo, and subsequently in &quot;Señorita Andrea&quot;, both broadcast on Argentine public television ATC. In the same year, she released her first music album. She then appeared in a number of TV miniseries on ATC throughout 1981. In 1982, she played the lead in &quot;Cien días de Ana&quot; alongside actor and singer Silvestre, and relocated to New York to study acting. In the following years, she took part in several theatrical productions.

In 1987, she returned in the telenovela &quot;Estrellita mía&quot; on the Telefe network, with Ricardo Darín as her partner. She recorded two music albums for Warner Music Group, &quot;Con amor&quot; and &quot;Te amo&quot;, released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. In 1991, Del Boca played the title role in &quot;Celeste&quot; on Canal 13, alongside Gustavo Bermúdez. The telenovela was one of the precursors in the genre addressing such topics as HIV/AIDS and homosexuality, and was popular with the TV audience. In 1992, she starred in &quot;Antonella&quot;, again accompanied by Bermúdez. In this series, she contributed the theme song &quot;Para este amor&quot; and portrayed a charismatic heroine, very different from the ones she had played in previous telenovelas. In 1993, she appeared in the film &quot;Funes, a Great Love&quot; directed by Raúl de la Torre, where she played an alcoholic lesbian prostitute. In the same year, &quot;Celeste&quot; was resumed as &quot;Celeste siempre Celeste&quot;, in which Del Boca played a double role: Celeste and her sister, Clara.

In late 1994, she appeared in the telenovela &quot;Perla negra&quot; on Telefe alongside Argentine sex symbol Gabriel Corrado. It was another success and was popular also internationally. The series featured Del Boca&#x27;s song &quot;El amor&quot; as the musical theme, taken from her new album of the same name, recorded for Philips Records. Her next film, de la Torre-directed &quot;Peperina&quot;, was released in 1995, but received negative feedback from the critics. In 1996, Del Boca was reunited with Corrado as the main characters in &quot;Zíngara&quot;, which also used her song &quot;Tonta, pobre tonta&quot; as the music theme. The telenovela was a story of a young woman experiencing amnesia and being raised as a gypsy, but failed to repeat the success of Del Boca&#x27;s previous series. Her next telenovela, &quot;Mía sólo mía&quot;, premiered in 1997, but did not turn out a big success either. Del Boca subsequently limited her television activity and in 1998 only made a guest appearance in the series &quot;Chiquititas&quot;.

In 2000, she returned to film in the romantic comedy &quot;Apariencias&quot; directed by Alberto Lecchi, and from 2001 to 2002, she played the main character in the TV series &quot;El sodero de mi vida&quot;. Her role in the latter earned her the second Martín Fierro Award, this time for the Best Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2005, she was honoured with a special Martín Fierro Award and played the title role in the telenovela &quot;Sálvame María&quot; on Canal 9 which was filmed entirely in San Luis Province. The following year she starred in the short series &quot;Gladiadores de Pompeya&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in one episode of the series &quot;Mujeres asesinas&quot; and joined the judging panel of a TV show selecting the cast for the Argentine version of &quot;High School Musical&quot; in which she also played a small role. In 2008, she hosted a popular TV show &quot;La mamá del año&quot; which revolved around motherhood and joined the series &quot;Por amor a vos&quot; as a recurring character. She also started presenting another TV show, &quot;Hoy puede ser&quot;.

In 2010, she starred in the telenovela &quot;Alguien que me quiera&quot; alongside Osvaldo Laport, but the production did not achieve expected ratings. In 2011, she took part in the theatre play &quot;Eva y Victoria&quot; in which she portrayed Eva Perón, alongside Graciela Dufau who played Victoria Ocampo. The play was taken on a tour in Argentina. In autumn Del Boca premiered &quot;Tiempo de pensar&quot;, a TV series she co-produced and starred in, tackling the issue of gender violence, stereotypes and female representation in the media. Between 2013 and 2014, she starred in the telenovela &quot;Esa mujer&quot;, which she also produced. The role earned her a nomination to a Martín Fierro Award.

In 2016, it was reported that Del Boca had acquired as much as 36 million Argentine pesos from public funds to produce her next telenovela, &quot;Mamá corazón&quot;. It caused a major controversy and a backlash against the actress, and even though the series was almost completed, it was never aired. In 2019, she appeared in another theatre play, &quot;Brujas&quot;, with Leonora Balcarce, Andrea Bonelli, Romina Ricci and Viviana Saccone, which was a critical and commercial success.

== Personal life ==
Her parents are the actress and dancer Ana María Castro and the film director Nicolás del Boca. She has two siblings: brother Adrián, working as a doctor in the United States, and sister Anabella who is a costume designer.

In 1982, she began a five-year relationship with Argentine actor and singer Silvestre (José Luis Rodríguez, not to be confused with the Venezuelan singer of the same name) whom she had met while working on the series &quot;Cien días de Ana&quot;. Their relationship sparked controversy as Silvestre was 12 years older than Andrea who was still underage. Moreover, Silvestre was married at that time and his wife was pregnant. From 1988 to 1995 Andrea&#x27;s partner was Argentine filmmaker Raúl de la Torre, and from 1995 to 1997 she was involved with American health care policy expert Jeffrey A. Sachs. In 2000, the actress was briefly dating the businessman Ricardo Biasotti and gave birth to their daughter Anna Chiara Biasotti on 15 November 2000.

She is a supporter of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

<doc id="398189" wikidata="Q2095069" url="?curid=398189" title="Normalizing constant">
<text>In probability theory, a normalizing constant or normalizing factor is used to reduce any probability function to a probability density function with total probability of one.

For example, a Gaussian function can be normalized into a probability density function, which gives the standard normal distribution. In Bayes&#x27; theorem, a normalizing constant is used to ensure that the sum of all possible hypotheses equals 1. Other uses of normalizing constants include making the value of a Legendre polynomial at 1 and in the orthogonality of orthonormal functions.

A similar concept has been used in areas other than probability, such as for polynomials.

==Definition==

In probability theory, a normalizing constant is a constant by which an everywhere non-negative function must be multiplied so the area under its graph is 1, e.g., to make it a probability density function or a probability mass function. 

==Examples==

If we start from the simple Gaussian function
formula_1
we have the corresponding Gaussian integral
formula_2

Now if we use the latter&#x27;s reciprocal value as a normalizing constant for the former, defining a function formula_3 as
formula_4
so that its integral is unit
formula_5
then the function formula_3 is a probability density function. This is the density of the standard normal distribution. (&quot;Standard&quot;, in this case, means the expected value is 0 and the variance is 1.)

And constant formula_7 is the normalizing constant of function formula_8.

Similarly,
formula_9
and consequently
formula_10
is a probability mass function on the set of all nonnegative integers. This is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution with expected value λ.

Note that if the probability density function is a function of various parameters, so too will be its normalizing constant. The parametrised normalizing constant for the Boltzmann distribution plays a central role in statistical mechanics. In that context, the normalizing constant is called the partition function.

==Bayes&#x27; theorem==
Bayes&#x27; theorem says that the posterior probability measure is proportional to the product of the prior probability measure and the likelihood function. &quot;Proportional to&quot; implies that one must multiply or divide by a normalizing constant to assign measure 1 to the whole space, i.e., to get a probability measure. In a simple discrete case we have
formula_11
where P(H0) is the prior probability that the hypothesis is true; P(D|H0) is the conditional probability of the data given that the hypothesis is true, but given that the data are known it is the likelihood of the hypothesis (or its parameters) given the data; P(H0|D) is the posterior probability that the hypothesis is true given the data. P(D) should be the probability of producing the data, but on its own is difficult to calculate, so an alternative way to describe this relationship is as one of proportionality:
formula_12
Since P(H|D) is a probability, the sum over all possible (mutually exclusive) hypotheses should be 1, leading to the conclusion that
formula_13
In this case, the reciprocal of the value
formula_14
is the &quot;normalizing constant&quot;. It can be extended from countably many hypotheses to uncountably many by replacing the sum by an integral.

For concreteness, there are many methods of estimating the normalizing constant for practical purposes. Methods include the bridge sampling technique, the naive Monte Carlo estimator, the generalized harmonic mean estimator, and importance sampling.

==Non-probabilistic uses==

The Legendre polynomials are characterized by orthogonality with respect to the uniform measure on the interval [−1, 1] and the fact that they are normalized so that their value at 1 is 1. The constant by which one multiplies a polynomial so its value at 1 is a normalizing constant.

Orthonormal functions are normalized such that formula_15 with respect to some inner product .

The constant is used to establish the hyperbolic functions cosh and sinh from the lengths of the adjacent and opposite sides of a hyperbolic triangle.
