<text>Bow Brickhill is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is bounded to the north, west and east by the Milton Keynes urban area, approximately east of Fenny Stratford, west of Woburn Sands and south-east of Central Milton Keynes.

The village name is a combination of Brythonic and Old English words for &#x27;hill&#x27; (Brythonic: &quot;breg&quot;, Anglo Saxon &quot;hyll&quot;). The prefix &#x27;Bow&#x27; comes from an Anglo Saxon personal name, &quot;Bolla&quot;. The various names of the village given in historic records were &quot;Brichelle&quot; (11th century); &quot;Brichull&quot; (12th century); &quot;Bolle Brichulle&quot;, &quot;Bellebrikhulle&quot; (13th century), and &quot;Bolbryghyll&quot; (15th century, 1418).

==Church==
The Church of England parish church of All Saints stands apart from the rest of the village, on the side of a steep hill. The church probably dates from the 12th century but heavy remodelling in the 15th century obliterated most of the earlier details. The church was extensively restored by Browne Willis in 1757.

The hymn tune &quot;Bow Brickhill&quot; by Sydney Nicholson was composed in honour of All Saints&#x27; parish church, after Nicholson and his choristers from Westminster Abbey performed there in 1923.

==Transport==
Bow Brickhill railway station, about west of the village, is on the Marston Vale Line between and .

==Listed buildings and structures==
The parish church is listed as Grade II*. There are a further four buildings or structures listed as Grade II.

<doc id="399268" wikidata="Q1855406" url="?curid=399268" title="Bradenham, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Bradenham is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is near Saunderton, off the main A4010 road between Princes Risborough and High Wycombe.

== Village ==

The village name is Anglo-Saxon and means &#x27;broad enclosure&#x27;, referring to the fact that the village sits in a broad valley among the surrounding Chiltern Hills. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the village was recorded as &quot;Bradeham&quot;.

The Parish Church of St Botolph was restored in 1863 by G.E. Street and the south door dates from the early Norman period. The rectory on the main road is from the 18th century. The houses around the village green are mainly brick and flint, but include the distinctive 18th century stuccoed &#x27;White House&#x27; with pointed windows and castellations.

The whole village of Bradenham has been owned by the National Trust since 1956. They market it under the name Bradenham Village. In front of the manor house is a small, slightly sloping cricket pitch which is used by Bradenham Cricket Club. Village news and activities are documented in the monthly &quot;Contact&quot; magazine, which covers Bradenham plus the nearby villages of Bledlow Ridge, West Wycombe, Radnage and Piddington.

===Royal Air Force===
RAF High Wycombe is inside the village, to the north-east. The Strike Command Operations Centre (STCOC) formerly the Primary War Headquarters (PWHQ) bunker was built by RAF Strike Command on the National Trust land to the north east of the village between 1983 and 1985, in spite of opposition including a peace camp.

== Manor house ==

Bradenham is the location of a grand red brick manor house, which in the 13th century was a property belonging to the Earl of Warwick. The house was fit for royalty, as in 1566 Queen Elizabeth I was entertained here by Lord Windsor. The current manor house was substantially built by Sir Edmund Pye, 1st Baronet around 1670 with tall sash windows, steep roofs and slim brick chimneys. In the 19th century it was the home of Isaac D&#x27;Israeli who died there in 1848 and is buried in the churchyard. His son Benjamin Disraeli, who became the prime minister, lived there for part of his early life. In the later Victorian era, the house was turned into a boarding school for local young gentlemen. In recent years, Bradenham Manor was leased by the National Trust to Grant Thornton UK LLP as the firm&#x27;s National Training Centre. However, the manor has now been returned to the National Trust. It is well known for its gardens.

It featured as the &#x27;Wargames Headquarters&#x27; in the 1967 film, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.

==Notable people==
*Joseph Brooksbank, Anglican clergyman, was the incumbent vicar at Bradenham, 1650 –

<doc id="399274" wikidata="Q1664111" url="?curid=399274" title="Innocence Project">
<text>Innocence Project, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit legal organization that works to exonerate the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and other forms of post-conviction relief, as well as advocates for criminal justice reform to prevent future injustice. The group cites various studies estimating that in the United States between 1% and 10% of all prisoners are innocent. The Innocence Project was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, who gained national attention in the mid-1990s as part of the &quot;Dream Team&quot; of lawyers who formed part of the defense in the O. J. Simpson murder case.

, the Innocence Project has successfully overturn more than 300 convictions through DNA-based exonerations. In 2021, the Innocence Project received the biennial Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty by Cato Institute, awarded in recognition and gratitude for its work to ensure liberty and justice for all. In March 2022, The Innocence Project won two Webby Awards for its &quot;Happiest Moments&quot; video, winning the Best Humanitarian &amp; Services campaign in both the brand and non-profit categories. &quot;Happiest Moments&quot; was the organization&#x27;s first public service announcement, premiering in June 2021 and produced by Hayden5.

==Founding==
The Innocence Project was established in the wake of a study by the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Senate, in conjunction with Yeshiva University&#x27;s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, which claimed that incorrect identification by eyewitnesses was a factor in over 70% of wrongful convictions. The Innocence Project was founded in 1992 by Scheck and Neufeld as part of a law clinic at Cardozo. It became an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization on January 28, 2003, but it maintains institutional connections with Cardozo. Madeline deLone was the executive director from 2004 until 2020, succeeded by Christina Swarns on September 8, 2020.

The Innocence Project is the headquarters of the Innocence Network, a group of nearly 70 independent innocence organizations worldwide. One such example exists in the Republic of Ireland where in 2009 a project was set up at Griffith College Dublin.

==Mission==
The Innocence Project&#x27;s mission is &quot;to free the staggering number of innocent people who remain incarcerated, and to bring reform to the system responsible for their unjust imprisonment.&quot;

The Innocence Project focuses exclusively on post-conviction appeals in which DNA evidence is available to be tested or retested. DNA testing is possible in 5–10% of criminal cases. Other members of the Innocence Network also help to exonerate those in whose cases DNA testing is not possible.

In addition to working on behalf of those who may have been wrongfully convicted of crimes throughout the United States, those working for the Innocence Project perform research and advocacy related to the causes of wrongful convictions.

Some of the Innocence Project&#x27;s successes have resulted in releasing people from death row. The successes of the project have fueled American opposition to the death penalty and have likely been a factor in the decision by some American states to institute moratoria on criminal executions.

In &quot;District Attorney&#x27;s Office v. Osborne&quot; (2009), U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts wrote that post-conviction challenge &quot;poses questions to our criminal justice systems and our traditional notions of finality better left to elected officials than federal judges.&quot; In the opinion, another justice wrote that forensic science has &quot;serious deficiencies.&quot; Roberts also said that post-conviction DNA testing risks &quot;unnecessarily overthrowing the established system of criminal justice.&quot; Law professor Kevin Jon Heller wrote: &quot;It might lead to a reasonably accurate one.&quot;

As of June 2018, the Innocence Project&#x27;s funding sources include 55% from individual contributions, 16% from foundations, 16% from events, 8% from investments, and 5% from corporations, Yeshiva University, and other sources.

==Work==
The Innocence Project originated in New York City but accepts cases from other parts of the country. The majority of clients helped are of low socio-economic status and have used all possible legal options for justice. Many clients hope that DNA evidence will prove their innocence, as the emergence of DNA testing allows those who have been wrongly convicted of crimes to challenge their cases. The Innocence Project also works with the local, state and federal levels of law enforcement, legislators, and other programs to prevent further wrongful convictions.

All potential clients go through an extensive screening process to determine whether or not they are likely to be innocent. If they pass the process, the Innocence Project takes up their case, resources permitting. About 2,400 prisoners write to the Innocence Project annually, and at any given time the Innocence Project is evaluating 6,000 to 8,000 potential cases. In addition to their co-directors and a managing attorney, the Innocence Project has six full-time staff attorneys and nearly 300 active cases.

In almost half of the cases that the Innocence Project takes on, the clients&#x27; guilt is reconfirmed by DNA testing. Of all the cases taken on by the Innocence Project so far, about 43% of clients were proven innocent, 42% were confirmed guilty, and evidence was inconclusive and not probative in 15% of cases. In about 40% of all DNA exoneration cases, law enforcement officials identified the actual perpetrator based on the same DNA test results that led to an exoneration. 
Overall, the Innocence Project&#x27;s DNA exonerations identified several contributors of wrongful convictions, including mistaken eyewitness identifications, invalid forensic science, false confessions, informants who lied, and government misconduct.

==Overturned convictions==

, 375 people previously convicted of serious crimes in the United States had been exonerated by DNA testing since 1989, 21 of whom had been sentenced to death. Almost all (99%) of the wrongful convictions involved male defendants with minority groups making up approximately 70% (61% African American and 8% Latino). The National Registry of Exonerations lists 2,939 convicted defendants who were exonerated through DNA and non-DNA evidence from January, 1989 through January, 2022 with more than 25,600 years imprisoned.

According to a study published in 2014, at least 4.1% of persons overall sentenced to death from 1973 to 2004 are probably innocent. The following are some examples of exonerations they helped bring about:

* Steven Avery was exonerated in 2003 after serving 18 years in prison for sexual assault Following his release, he was convicted of murder.
* Cornelius Dupree was convicted of sexual assault and robbery in 1980 and was exonerated in 2011 by the Innocence Project through DNA evidence.

* Michael Morton was convicted of murder in 1987, spent over 24 years in prison, and exonerated through DNA and withholding of evidence in 2011 with help from the Innocence Project. In 2013 his prosecutor was convicted of withholding evidence, agreed to disbarment, and spent 4 days in jail.
* Anthony Porter was convicted of murder in 1983, and exonerated in 1999 by the Medill Innocence Project.
* James Calvin Tillman was exonerated in 2007 after an investigation begun by the Innocence Project, and after serving years in prison for a rape he did not commit. His sentence was 45 years.
* Archie Williams was convicted in 1983 of sexual assault and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, but was exonerated in 2019 due to DNA evidence after over three decades in prison.
* Ken Wyniemko was convicted in 1994 of sexual assault, and exonerated in 2003 through DNA evidence by the Innocence Project.
* Michael Sutton and Kenny Phillips went out for Phillips&#x27; birthday in May 2006, they were wrongfully arrested and incarcerated for 15 years. In 2023, their attempted murder convictions were overturned and the University of Akron granted them full scholarships to earn their college degrees.
* Leonard Mack was exonerated of rape and gun charges after 47 years due to DNA evidence. Mack&#x27;s wrongful conviction was the longest to be vacated to due advanced DNA testing.
* Perry Lott served 30 years in prison for rape and burglary charges before being cleared after DNA testing.

==Innocence Network==
The Innocence Project is a founding member of the Innocence Network, a coalition of independent organizations and advocates, including law schools, journalism schools, and public defense offices that collaborate to help convicted felons prove their innocence. , there were 68 organizations in the network, operating in all 50 US states and 12 other countries, and had helped exonerate 625 people.

In South Africa, the Wits Justice Project investigates South African incarcerations. In partnership with the Wits Law Clinic, the Julia Mashele Trust, the Legal Resources Centre (LRC), the Open Democracy Advice Centre (ODAC), the US Innocence Project, and the Justice Project investigate individual cases of prisoners wrongly convicted or awaiting trial.

<doc id="399276" wikidata="Q4955146" url="?curid=399276" title="Bradwell, Milton Keynes">
<text>Bradwell is an ancient village and modern district in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, situated approximately north-west of Central Milton Keynes. It has also given its name to a modern civil parish that is part of the City of Milton Keynes. The village was adjacent to Bradwell Abbey, a Benedictine priory, founded in 1155 and dissolved in about 1540, but the abbey and its immediate environs were always a separate ecclesiastical parish.

The village name is an Old English language word and means &quot;broad spring&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Bradewelle&quot;.

There was an YHA youth hostel in the village (near the church and Bradwell Bury), at : the YHA closed it during the COVID-19 pandemic and terminated its lease in 2021.

==Civil parish==
The parish of Bradwell consists of the Bradwell village grid square, along with Bradwell Abbey, Heelands, Rooksley, and Bradwell Common. The parish had a population of 9,657 according to the 2011 census. The parish is bounded by the railway line or the A5 to the west, Monks Way to the north, Portway to the east, and Dansteed Way to the south.

St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church is a Grade II*-listed building, dating from the 13th century, and receiving its first vicar in 1223. It is believed to contain the oldest change ringing bells still in use, two of which were cast in 1297 by Michael de Wymbish of London.

Adjoining the sports field is the Bradwell Conservation Area, which is centered on St Lawrence&#x27;s Field and is administered by the parish council as a nature conservation area.

On Vicarage Road is the Bradwell Memorial Hall, built as the village&#x27;s war memorial after World War I.

On Primrose Road is King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V with a children&#x27;s play area.

==History and heritage==
=== Bradwell Village ===
Bradwell Bury beside the parish church is a moated site and the remains of an associated manor house which once formed part of a more extensive monument: it is Scheduled Monument. The nearby Bradwell Castle mound is also a Scheduled Monument. Bradwell House and the Church of St James are Grade II* listed; there are a further 25 buildings and structures listed as Grade II.

===Bradwell Abbey===

Bradwell Abbey is a Scheduled Monument, urban studies site (and a modern district). The site was once the location of a Benedictine priory, founded in 1155. The only remaining ecclesiastic building, the Chapel of St Mary, is a Grade I listed building. There are a further five Grade II listed buildings or structures on the Abbey grounds.

===Bradwell railway station===
Bradwell railway station, which was on the Wolverton–Newport Pagnell branch line, served Bradwell from 1867 to 1964. In the present day, the former railway line (now a rail trail that is part of the redway network) forms the boundary between Bradville (in Stantonbury CP) and New Bradwell CP; the station platform is on the New Bradwell side.

==Sport and Leisure==

Bradwell has a Non-League football team Old Bradwell United F.C. who play at Abbey Road, where there is a large sports field with a cricket pitch and several football pitches. The Old Bradwell Tennis Club is also affiliated to the Bradwell Sports and Social Club which has the use of these facilities.

Bradwell Bowls Club enters competitive teams in the local league.

Rooksley, at the western edge of the parish, has an important Karting track (not in Bradwell parish).

<doc id="399278" wikidata="Q2293896" url="?curid=399278" title="Broughton, Milton Keynes">
<text>Broughton (, ) is a historic village, modern district and civil parish in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, approximately east of Central Milton Keynes. It is governed by Broughton and Milton Keynes Joint Parish Council, shared with the neighbouring Milton Keynes parish. Broughton district was developed during the 2000s and 2010s largely to the south and east of the historic village.

==History and location==
The name is Old English and meant &#x27;brook farm&#x27;. In the Domesday Book, it is listed as owned by a Walter Giffard and the tenant was a Hugh de Bolbec. In the 6th century, its name was spelt &quot;Brotone&quot;. 

The Northampton to London turnpike came through the village and joined Watling Street, now the A5 road, at Hockcliffe. The A50, London Road, the original route through the centre of the old village was bypassed in the early 1970s. The new road, comprising Fen Street and part of Newport Road was numbered A5130, but is now declassified. The bypass was the former eastern boundary of the built up area.

Over a 14 month period in 1958–9, 200,000 tons of gravel were dug from a field at Manor Farm, Broughton for the construction of the M1 motorway, by a Newport Pagnell business under contract to John Laing and Sons. The field was then made good for agriculture. 

The Milton Keynes grid road, Child&#x27;s Way (H6), forms the district&#x27;s northern boundary, Chaffron Way (H7) the southern, Tongwell Street (V11) its western, and the M1 motorway its eastern (accessible from Junction 14, roughly to the north, via the A509). 

The district can be split into at least three areas. The original Broughton village forms part of a conservation area at the northern end, bounded by the brook and Newport Road. Atterbury is an area of new build housing, predominantly between the western side of the brook and Tongwell Street (V11). Broughton Gate and Brooklands, are part of the &#x27;Milton Keynes Eastern Expansion area&#x27; east of the brook. A small cable-stayed bridge is one of two main road crossings across Broughton Brook, the third and newest is the extension of H7 Chaffron Way (as &#x27;Countess Way&#x27;) between Brooklands and Kingston.

==Education==
Broughton Fields Primary School and Brooklands Farm Primary School serve the area, whilst secondary education is provided by Oakgrove School in nearby Middleton and the Walton High School campus in Brooklands. Broughton Manor Preparatory School, a private prep school, is also situated near the old village.

==Facilities==

The facilities in the area include a &#x27;Hungry Horse&#x27; chain public house, and a range of small shops, hair dressers and convenience stores.

Milton Keynes Coachway and the Kingston Shopping Centre which includes one of the UK&#x27;s larger Tesco stores, a variety of retail outlets, a branch library and a community centre are nearby.

Broughton Pavilion is a community recreational and sports facility owned and managed by the parish council, which is based there. The building features a living roof.

The Broughton Brook linear park and Brooklands Meadow park provide green space for recreation. The northern tip of Broughton is open space and a conservation area. 

==Civil parish==
Broughton civil parish formerly totalled and included land east of what is now the M1 motorway. The Victoria County History of Buckingham, cites a Board of Agriculture figure from 1905 stating 75 per cent of the parish was grassland.

The current area of the parish is . 

Broughton and Milton Keynes Parish Council is a joint parish council covering the parishes of Broughton and Milton Keynes (village). Broughton includes the village of Broughton as well as the modern districts of Broughton Gate and Brooklands, which are part of the &#x27;Eastern Expansion Area&#x27; and consequently have &#x27;city streets&#x27; rather than grid roads.

Brooklands is primarily a housing area: a building of note is the Brooklands Campus of Walton High School, whose main campus is in Walnut Tree.

Pineham is a small district enclosed by the M1, Portway (H5/A509) and Tongwell Street (V11). Most of its area is taken up by Anglian Water&#x27;s sewage treatment plant and a BMX track.

The name &#x27;Pineham&#x27; was used for an electoral ward for Milton Keynes Council elections from 1976 (to 2002). It consisted of the parishes of Woolstone-cum-Willen, Moulsoe, Broughton, Milton Keynes and Walton.

==St Lawrence&#x27;s Church==

St Lawrence&#x27;s Church in Broughton is a 14th-century church with a 15th-century tower. A series of wall paintings covering large parts of the north and south walls, discovered during an 1849 restoration, is the chief interest of the church. The paintings include a 14th-century Pietà, a Doom, St Helena and St Eligius, and St George slaying the Dragon.
The rectors of St Lawrence are recorded from the end of 1261 to date, and many may be within the grounds of St Lawrence.

<text>The 1972 Canadian federal election was held on October 30, 1972, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 29th Parliament of Canada. It resulted in a slim victory for the governing Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, which won 109 seats, compared to 107 seats for the opposition Progressive Conservatives led by Robert Stanfield. Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals experienced a decline in support as a result of rising unemployment.

A further 48 seats were won by other parties and independents. On election night, the results appeared to give 109 seats to the Tories, but once the counting had finished the next day, the final results gave the Liberals a minority government and left the New Democratic Party led by David Lewis holding the balance of power.

This was the first national election held in Canada after the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1970.

==Overview==
The election was the second fought between Liberal leader, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield. The Liberals entered the election campaign with a 10-point lead over the Progressive Conservatives, but the spirit of Trudeaumania had worn off, and a slumping economy and rising unemployment hurt his party. Stanfield&#x27;s Tories tried to capitalize on the public&#x27;s perception that the Liberals were mismanaging the economy with the slogan, &quot;A Progressive Conservative government &quot;will&quot; do better.&quot;

The Liberals campaigned on the slogan, &quot;The Land is Strong&quot;, and television ads illustrating Canada&#x27;s scenery. The slogan quickly became much derided, and the party had developed few real issues to campaign on. As a result, their entire campaign was viewed as being one of the worst managed in recent decades.

===Party platforms===

Liberal Party:
* increase bilingualism in the Canadian civil service;
* re-introduce a bill controlling foreign take-overs of Canadian businesses;
* specialized programs to reduce unemployment;
* a program to expand and create new parks across Canada, including Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Harbourfront&quot; and Mont-Sainte-Anne near Quebec City;
* make-work programs to create jobs;
* reduce abuse of Unemployment Insurance; and
* incentives to reduce pollution.

Progressive Conservative Party:
* increase the discipline in government spending, and increase the power of the Auditor General of Canada to fight waste and inefficiency in government;
* ban strikes in essential services;
* introduce price and wage controls if necessary to control inflation;
* require foreign-owned companies operating in Canada to have a majority of Canadians on their boards of directors;
* introduce an incentive to encourage Canadians to invest in small businesses;
* develop a national economic strategy in co-operation with the provincial governments;
* expand re-training opportunities for unemployed workers;
* adjust tariffs to encourage secondary processing in Canada of Canada&#x27;s natural resources;
* eliminate the 11% sales tax on building materials;
* eliminate 3% increase in personal income tax rates scheduled for January 1, 1973, and reduce rates by 4% on July 1, 1973;
* adjust old age security payments regularly to reflect changes in the cost of living;
* index tax brackets to inflation so that taxes do not rise as the cost of living rises;
* provide assistance to set up residential land banks to reduce the cost of housing.

New Democratic Party:
* eliminate 3% increase in personal income tax rates scheduled for January 1, 1973, and reduce rates by 8% for ordinary Canadians;
* introduce controls on prices and rents, but not on wages;
* create a $430 million program to fund public works during winter months to reduce unemployment;
* increase old age security payments, but eliminate them for wealthy senior citizens;
* legislate greater autonomy for Canadian trade unions that are branches of international unions;
* tough tax laws for corporations;
* eliminate &quot;corporate welfare&quot;, i.e., grants and subsidies for corporations, and use this money to build housing and transportation infrastructure, and fund municipal services to create jobs.

Social Credit Party:
* reform the monetary system in line with social credit theories;
* increase old age security payments to $200 per month beginning at age 60, and to $150 per month for spouses of seniors regardless of age.

==National results==
The voter turn-out was 76.7%.

One independent candidate was elected: Roch La Salle was re-elected in the Quebec riding of Joliette. La Salle had left the PC caucus to protest the party&#x27;s failure to recognize what he considered Quebec&#x27;s right to self-determination, and was the only candidate to win the support of the separatist &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;. He returned to the PC caucus in 1974.

One candidate with no affiliation was elected: Lucien Lamoureux, in the Ontario riding of Stormont—Dundas. Lamoureux, originally elected as a Liberal, had been serving as Speaker of the House of Commons. He ran without affiliation in order to preserve his impartiality as Speaker. He retired after this Parliament, and did not run again in 1974.

The Liberals won a minority government, with the New Democratic Party, led by David Lewis, holding the balance of power. Requiring NDP support to continue, the Trudeau government would move left politically, including the creation of Petro-Canada.

This was the first of two elections in which Réal Caouette led the national Social Credit Party of Canada. Caouette, who had contested the previous two elections as leader of the breakaway Quebec-based Ralliement créditiste, had successfully taken over the leadership of the original western-based party and overseen the reintegration of the two factions. He successfully held on to the seats he had previously won under the RC banner, but these were the only ridings Social Credit managed to win as it continued to lose support outside Quebec.

Notes:

&quot;% change&quot; refers to change from previous election

1 Indicates increase from total Social Credit + &quot;Ralliement creditiste&quot; seats/vote in 1968.

2 Roch LaSalle, who was elected in 1968 as a Progressive Conservative, won re-election as an independent.

3 Lucien Lamoureux who was elected as a Liberal but served as Speaker of the House, won re-election with no party affiliation.

4 The Rhinoceros Party ran a total of 12 candidates, but because it was not recognized by Elections Canada as a registered party, its candidates were listed as independents.

<text>Eric Anthony Roberts (born April 18, 1956) is an American actor. Roberts has amassed more than 700 credits and is one of the most prolific English-speaking screen actors.

Roberts&#x27; career began with a leading role in &quot;King of the Gypsies&quot; (1978) for which he received his first Golden Globe Award nomination. He also received a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Paul Snider in Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983). Roberts&#x27; performance in &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985), as prison escapee Buck McGeehy, earned him a third Golden Globe nod and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

Notable films Roberts has appeared in include &quot;Raggedy Man&quot; (1981), &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot; (1984), &quot;By the Sword&quot; (1991), &quot;Final Analysis&quot; (1992), &quot;The Specialist&quot; (1994), &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; (1996), &quot;Cecil B.

On television, his performances in the drama miniseries &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1997) and the sitcom &quot;Less than Perfect&quot; (2002–2005) have earned him Satellite Award nominations, winning Best Supporting Actor for the latter. His other varied television work includes being the only non-UK actor to play the Master in the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television film, as well as recurring roles on the NBC drama &quot;Heroes&quot; (2007–2010), the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (2010–2011), the legal drama &quot;Suits&quot; (2014–2019), and the HBO series &quot;The Righteous Gemstones&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Eric Anthony Roberts was born in Biloxi, Mississippi, on April 18, 1956, to Betty Lou Bredemus and Walter Grady Roberts, one-time actors and playwrights, who met while touring with a production of &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; for the armed forces. In 1963, they co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children&#x27;s acting school in Decatur, Georgia. Roberts&#x27; mother became a church secretary and real estate agent, and his father was a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roberts&#x27; younger siblings, Julia Roberts (from whom he was estranged until 2004) and Lisa Roberts Gillan, are also actors.

In 1971, Roberts&#x27; parents filed for divorce, which was finalized in early 1972. He stayed with his father, who died of cancer in March 1977, in Atlanta. After the divorce, his sisters moved with their mother to Smyrna, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1972, their mother married Michael Motes. In 1976, they had a daughter, Nancy Motes, who died February 9, 2014, at age 37, of an apparent drug overdose. Michael Motes was abusive and often unemployed. In 1983, she divorced Motes, citing &quot;cruelty&quot;; she later said that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.

==Career==

He made his acting debut in 1974, appearing on the soap opera &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot;. He also appeared on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; originating the role of Ted Bancroft from February 14 to June 17, 1977.

In 1996, he appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television film in the role of the Master. The onscreen wife of Roberts&#x27; human character, who is killed by her newly possessed husband taken over by the Master, is played by his real-life wife. He also co-starred in the 1996 television miniseries version of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, in the role of Perry Smith; he was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. He starred in &quot;C-16&quot; for its entire 1997 to 1998 run. He starred opposite John Ritter in the movie &quot;Tripfall&quot; in 1998.

Roberts co-starred on the ABC situation comedy &quot;Less than Perfect&quot;. He appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot; as Ken Kramer, a murderer on death row convicted of killing a young couple. Another notable TV appearance was the episode &quot;Victims&quot; of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; where he played Sam Winfield, a former cop turned vigilante. In the same year, he was also guest-starred on &quot;The L Word&quot; as Gabriel McCutcheon, the father of Shane McCutcheon.

==Personal life==

=== Ancestry ===
On a 2023 episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; featuring his sister Julia, it was revealed that their biological paternal great-great-grandfather&#x27;s surname was actually Mitchell, not Roberts. Eric Roberts is a distant cousin of fellow actor Edward Norton.

===Relationships and family===
A 1989 profile of actress Sandy Dennis in &quot;People&quot; says she had a live-in relationship with Roberts for five years in a seven-bedroom house she rented in Connecticut. The relationship began several years after her 1974 parting from boyfriend Gerry Mulligan, a jazz musician who had lived with Dennis in the same house (whose Connecticut location was identified as Westport or Wilton in different &quot;People&quot; magazine articles).

In 1981, some months after Roberts began living with Dennis, he was in a debilitating car accident near their home. His ordeal was described by &quot;People&quot; magazine years later as &quot;a month-long hospital stay after a bad car accident in 1981.&quot; Leaving the Wilton house he lived in with Dennis, Roberts went for a Jeep ride with his girlfriend&#x27;s German Shepherd. When the dog seemed to lean out too far, Roberts tried to get hold of him. He let go of the steering wheel, and the car ended up hitting a tree. He was in a coma for three days. Dennis, an animal lover who cared for many dogs and cats, was relieved to learn her German Shepherd was not injured in the accident. Roberts recovered and his live-in relationship with Dennis lasted a few more years. Author James Spada claimed that it came to an end because of his affair with actress Ellen Barkin, while Roberts cited Dennis&#x27; refusal to start an animal shelter for some 100 stray cats living in the couple&#x27;s shared home as the reason for their split.

Roberts broke off engagements with Dennis and actress Dana Wheeler-Nicholson. He has a daughter, Emma, from a live-in relationship with Kelly Cunningham; Emma was born on February 10, 1991. She eventually became an actress as well, making her major-film debut at age 10 in the 2001 drama &quot;Blow&quot;. After Roberts&#x27; relationship with Cunningham, he married Eliza Garrett (daughter of screenwriters David Rayfiel and Lila Garrett) in 1992. His stepson, Keaton Simons, is a singer-songwriter, and his stepdaughter, Morgan Simons, is a chef. Roberts became a grandfather for the first time in December 2020 when Emma gave birth to her first child, a son named Rhodes, with actor Garrett Hedlund.

On January 12, 2001, Roberts visited &quot;The Howard Stern Radio Show&quot; with Garrett, during a segment called &quot;The Gossip Game&quot; with Mike Walker of the &quot;National Enquirer.&quot; He confirmed that he and his sister, Julia, had been estranged for several years. The source of the estrangement had been his past drug abuse and her siding with his ex-girlfriend over the custody of his daughter. In 2004, he told &quot;People&quot; magazine that he and his sister reconciled when he visited her in the hospital after she gave birth to twins.

===Legal issues===
In December 1987, Roberts was arrested after police found him banging on a woman&#x27;s apartment door in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. He was charged with criminal trespass, possession of cocaine and marijuana, and second-degree assault after he punched a police officer. In February 1988, he pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to six months on probation. His possession and assault charges were dropped.

In February 1995, Roberts was arrested in Los Angeles for shoving his wife Eliza into a wall.

<text>Buckland is a village and civil parish in Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is near the boundary with Hertfordshire, close to Aston Clinton. The hamlet of Buckland Wharf is in the parish. It takes its name from its wharf on the Wendover Branch of the Grand Union Canal that passes through the parish.

==History==
The village toponym is a common one in England. It is Old English in origin, and refers to a place which has received a Royal charter of some description. It is not known the type of charter to which it refers in this case.

Before the Norman conquest of England, the manor of Buckland was held by the Diocese of Dorchester-on-Thames in Oxfordshire under the control of Godric. After 1066 William I granted it to the Bishop of Lincoln. It remained so until the 16th century when the then tenant, the Earl of Warwick forfeited it to the Crown. By 1584 it had been passed to Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Robert was killed fighting on the Royalist side during the English Civil War at the first Battle of Newbury. His lands, including Buckland, were confiscated by the Parliamentarians but were recovered in 1653 by the Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon and held until death in 1709. Through marriage it passed to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield and remained in the family until George Hassall of Cholesbury acquired it around 1815. Subsequent Lords of the Manor included John Atkinson and Peter Parott.

The Church of England parish church of All Saints, Buckland was built in 1284. A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1831, although not recognised as a religious location by the authorities until 1837. The Church remains a place of worship, however the Chapel has since been converted into a house.

During the 16th century land at the southern end of the parish of Buckland which had been progressively cleared of scrub was transformed from an area of temporary summer pasture to one of permanent settlement subsequently to become known as Buckland Common. It remained a remote outpost of Buckland parish until becoming part of the newly created parish of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards in 1934.

==Economy==
The enormous dairy Arla Aylesbury is situated in the village. It produces 1.75 billion pints of milk per year, around 10% of the milk in the UK.

<doc id="399290" wikidata="Q718335" url="?curid=399290" title="Paul Cellucci">
<text>Argeo Paul Cellucci (; April 24, 1948 – June 8, 2013) was an American politician and diplomat from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A Republican, he served as the 69th governor of Massachusetts from 1997 to 2001, and as the United States Ambassador to Canada from 2001 to 2005. He also served as the Commonwealth&#x27;s 68th lieutenant governor from 1991 to 1999, as well as in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate from 1977 to 1991.

When Bill Weld resigned in 1997 after being nominated for United States Ambassador to Mexico, Cellucci became acting governor. He then was elected governor in 1998, and served until 2001, when he resigned to become the U.S. Ambassador to Canada under President George W. Bush, a post he held until 2005.

==Early life and career==
Cellucci was born in Hudson, Massachusetts, into a political family, the son of Priscilla M. (née Rose) and Argeo R. Cellucci Jr. His father was of Italian descent from the small Lazio village of San Donato Val di Comino, and his mother was of Irish ancestry.

He graduated from Hudson Catholic High School, Boston College (BA, 1970), and Boston College Law School (JD, 1973). He and his wife Jan were married in 1972. They had two daughters, Kate and Anne (who is married to Brunei-born Canadian hockey player Craig Adams). He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1970 to 1978, reaching the rank of Captain.

He was a Republican, and held the distinction of never losing an election over his three decades in elected office in overwhelmingly Democratic Massachusetts. Cellucci was first elected to public office as a member of the Hudson Charter Commission in 1970. Subsequently, he was elected to the Hudson Board of Selectmen, on which he served from 1971 to 1977. In 1976, he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served until 1985. He then became a member of the Massachusetts Senate, serving from 1985 to 1991. From 1991 to 1999 he was Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.

==Governor of Massachusetts==
Cellucci became the Governor of Massachusetts in 1997 upon the resignation of Bill Weld. On November 3, 1998, Paul Cellucci was elected as governor, narrowly defeating Democratic attorney general Scott Harshbarger. He had successfully fought off a challenge from State Treasurer Joe Malone in the September primary. He was sworn in as the 69th Governor of Massachusetts on January 7, 1999.

Cellucci was a fiscally conservative, anti-tax governor who had the ability to work in a bipartisan fashion with an overwhelmingly Democratic State Legislature. In 2001, the libertarian Cato Institute, in its fifth biennial fiscal policy report card, gave Cellucci an &quot;A&quot; grade and said he &quot;earned the distinction of having the best record of reducing taxes and restraining spending growth&quot; among the nation&#x27;s 50 governors. Governor Cellucci spearheaded the statewide initiative to reduce the state income tax from 5.95% to 5%, which was approved 59% to 41% by the voters of Massachusetts in November 2000.

Cellucci was also successful in maintaining the state&#x27;s high education standards for most students. Those standards, which required students to pass exams in basic Math and English to receive a high school diploma, were a major piece of the Education Reform Act of 1993 and were phased in over time. The teachers unions wanted to weaken the standards just as they were about to take effect, but Cellucci worked with Speaker of the House Thomas Finneran and Senate President Thomas Birmingham, both Democrats, to hold the line on this issue.

The standards have remained in effect and in its June 4, 2007 report card on &quot;No Child Left Behind,&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine found that Massachusetts students score the best on the federal tests. However, in 2000, Cellucci signed a budget bill that lowered the state&#x27;s longstanding &quot;maximum feasible development&quot; standard for special education to the federal mandate of a &quot;free and appropriate public education,&quot; which set a much lower standard for the provision of special education to students with disabilities. The latter standard remains in effect.

The biggest controversy during Cellucci&#x27;s tenure was the huge cost overruns on the &quot;Big Dig&quot; – an enormous project to replace the elevated central artery highway in Boston with a tunnel. Cellucci removed the project manager, James Kerasiotes, and put his Secretary of Administration and Finance, Andrew Natsios, in charge of the project.

Cellucci, in 1998, signed into law one of the toughest gun control measures in the United States. He was also known to take a conservative approach to crime. He supported &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and abortion rights. For this reason, Cardinal Bernard Law disinvited Cellucci from speaking at a commencement ceremony of Hudson Catholic High School, Cellucci&#x27;s alma mater.

In 2000, Cellucci proposed an amendment to the Massachusetts constitution to strip felons of the right to vote. The amendment was approved in a referendum.

Cellucci appointed many women to high ranking positions, including Margaret H. Marshall as the first female Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Her appointment marked the first time a woman headed a branch of government in Massachusetts history.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
On April 10, 2001, Cellucci resigned, after George W. Bush nominated, and the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment as U.S. Ambassador to Canada. He was succeeded by Jane Swift, who became the first woman in Massachusetts history to occupy the governor&#x27;s office.

===Cabinet and administration===
==U.S. Ambassador to Canada==
On April 17, 2001, at the Citadel in Quebec City, Cellucci presented his credentials as the 27th United States Ambassador to Canada to Governor General Adrienne Clarkson.

His four-year tenure would be a historical and controversial period in the United States – Canadian relations. On September 14, 2001, three days after the terrorist attacks on United States soil, Ambassador Cellucci thanked Canada for its overwhelming support and sympathy, including their role in Operation Yellow Ribbon, at a memorial in front of 100,000 people on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. He would mention the operation and the memorial service quite often during the days and months that followed the September 11 attacks in the United States. The months and years that followed the attacks would see extraordinary cooperation between the United States and Canada on the Smart Border Agreement, on their law enforcement and intelligence agencies to stop terrorist attacks in North America, and in Afghanistan in the war against the Taliban.

On March 25, 2003, at a speech to the Economic Club of Toronto, Cellucci faced controversy when he criticized Canadian opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. He argued that America was waging war for its own security, and that the United States would &quot;never hesitate&quot; to support Canada if it faced a security threat. This wording was considered especially unfortunate by some since the United States did in fact delay years before joining the British Empire in both World Wars I and II in Europe. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported Cellucci&#x27;s remarks under the front-page headline &quot;U.S. rebukes Canada&quot; and Canadian nationalist Mel Hurtig called him &quot;ill-mannered, obnoxious, [and] arrogant&quot;.

He also expressed support for Canada joining the U.S. missile defense program, and for urging Canada to increase defense spending. These statements, frequently perceived as implied trade threats, caused Cellucci to be sarcastically christened &quot;the U.S. ambassador-turned-proconsul&quot; by former Liberal cabinet minister and Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy in an opinion piece titled &quot;Say no to missile defence&quot; published on April 29, 2003 in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Canada has since declined to participate in the U.S. missile defense program.

While the frosty relations were due to the Canadian government&#x27;s opposition to President Bush&#x27;s policies, there has also been criticism of the former Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien for tolerating anti-American outbursts from his aide, while Chrétien&#x27;s successor Paul Martin attempted to paint his opponent, Conservative leader Stephen Harper, as pro-American during the 2004 Canadian federal election.

Cellucci officially resigned his ambassadorship on March 17, 2005. A humorous indication of Canadian opinion of Cellucci&#x27;s tenure was provided by CBC Television satirist Rick Mercer, who promoted on his program, &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;, a fictitious &quot;Paul Cellucci Farewell Special&quot; entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Door Hit You on the Ass&quot;.

==Later career==
On March 18, 2005, the day after Cellucci had resigned from his ambassadorship, Magna International Corporation announced they had hired Cellucci. Magna chairman Frank Stronach said Cellucci&#x27;s role would be to help reform U.S. horse racing regulations. In September 2005, Cellucci published a book called &quot;Unquiet Diplomacy&quot;, a memoir of his time as ambassador. In the book, he praised Canada as &quot;a truly great nation&quot;, but also had some criticism for the governments of former Prime Ministers Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin.

The same month, shortly after an interview where U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins stirred controversy over comments he made on the case of Maher Arar, Cellucci gave an interview in which explained his position on the Arar case. While he was Ambassador, Cellucci had declined to participate into the inquiry into the Americans&#x27; &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; of Arar to Syria and the possible role of Canadian officials in the rendition, being consistent with the Bush administration&#x27;s position that nothing improper had been done. Cellucci&#x27;s comments in the 2005 interview were seen as a rebuke to Wilkins.

Cellucci acknowledged, &quot;Part of the unfairness was that we took a Canadian citizen, shipped him to a third country without consulting with Canada,&quot; apparently exonerating Canadian officials. Cellucci did point out that as a result of the Canadian Government&#x27;s protest about Arar, the United States and Canada exchanged letters, in which each undertook to notify the other country if either government was going to remove, involuntarily, a National of the other country to a third country. While each country retains all rights to do what is in its security interests, Cellucci believed that as a practical matter, this makes it highly unlikely that anything like the Arar situation will happen again.

The same interview revealed that Cellucci, as a private citizen, also had second thoughts about the stance he had taken as ambassador on the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the lead-up to the invasion, Cellucci had put pressure on Canada to join in the invasion, based on the American and UK assertions that Saddam&#x27;s administration possessed a dangerous arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. But in 2005 Cellucci acknowledged: &quot;We&#x27;re not always right, and on that particular one it looks like we weren&#x27;t right, although we know at some point in the past he did have these weapons.&quot;

Cellucci left Magna International in the fall of 2006 and joined the Boston office of the law firm of McCarter &amp; English, LLP, where he held the title of Special Counsel. In 2008, Cellucci said that, after thirty-five years in public service, he had no intention of seeking further office, and that, while he had no interest in serving as vice president, he did not exclusively rule it out. He supported John McCain&#x27;s candidacy for president in 2008.

In 2013, Cellucci was a signatory to an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

Also in 2013, Cellucci helped free a U.S. citizen (the younger brother of sports broadcaster Tripp Tracy) who was imprisoned by the Venezuelan government.

==Illness and death==
In January 2011, Cellucci announced he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, and that it was progressing relatively slowly.

Cellucci responded to his diagnosis by leading an effort to raise $10 million for research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cellucci joined UMMS Chancellor Michael F. Collins and UMMS neurologist Dr. Robert H. Brown Jr., who was leading Cellucci&#x27;s treatment, before a Boston Red Sox game on May 19, 2011 at Fenway Park to announce the fundraising campaign. &quot;I&#x27;m going to be talking to people from my old political network and I hope I can get some support there,&quot; Cellucci said. &quot;We have a lot of people through the social network and we can really reach out across this country.&quot;

On March 15, 2012, Biogen Idec announced it was donating $500,000 to the UMass ALS Champion Fund, a substantial part of the $1.3 million that the fund raised in its first year.

Cellucci died of complications from his disease on June 8, 2013. He was 65. Governor Deval Patrick released a statement saying that &quot;Massachusetts lost a favored son and devoted public servant today. A lawyer, legislator, governor and diplomat, Paul Cellucci was also a kind man and a friend.&quot; Former governor Bill Weld said &quot;Paul Cellucci was simply one of the finest human beings I have ever met. I happened to know him in the realm of politics and government, but anyone who knew him in any other arena would have found the same man: a person of rock-hard integrity, keen intelligence, considerable humor, abundant compassion, and deep devotion to family and country. We are all immensely impoverished by his loss.&quot; Former governor Mitt Romney wrote a message on Twitter saying &quot;Ann and I are saddened by the loss of our friend Gov. Paul Cellucci. Our hearts and prayers are with Jan and the Cellucci family.&quot; &quot;I had the chance to work with Ambassador Cellucci when I was a minister in the province of Ontario. I can attest to the fact he was a great friend to Canada, and we are grateful for his contributions to the bilateral relationship, both as ambassador and as governor of Massachusetts,&quot; said Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird.

A memorial was dedicated to Cellucci on September 20, 2015 in his hometown of Hudson, Massachusetts by the Hudson Rotary Club.

<text>Butlers Cross is a hamlet within the parish of Ellesborough (where the 2011 Census population was included), in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the south of the parish, at the crossroads between the road from Ellesborough to Little Kimble, and the road from Terrick to the Chequers country house.

The hamlet&#x27;s name refers to this junction of the two roads, and the fact that this was the place where the Chequers staff and servants normally lived.

On the corner of the junction is a pub called &#x27;The Russell&#x27; (formerly the &#x27;Russell Arms&#x27;), referring to the family that once owned Chequers. Opposite the pub is a village hall, the Ellesborough Parish Hall, which holds local community events and regular activities such as children&#x27;s groups, band rehearsals, self-defence and martial arts classes.</text><links>

<text>56 (fifty-six) is the natural number following 55 and preceding 57.

== Mathematics ==

56 is:

* The sum of the first six triangular numbers (making it a tetrahedral number).
* The number of ways to choose 3 out of 8 objects or 5 out of 8 objects, if order does not matter.
* The sum of six consecutive primes (3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17)
* a tetranacci number and as a multiple of 7 and 8, a pronic number. Interestingly it is one of a few pronic numbers whose digits in decimal also are successive (5 and 6).
* a refactorable number, since 8 is one of its 8 divisors.
* The sum of the sums of the divisors of the first 8 positive integers.
* A semiperfect number, since 56 is twice a perfect number.
* A partition number – the number of distinct ways 11 can be represented as the sum of natural numbers.
* An Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 56 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.
* The only known number n such that , where φ(&quot;m&quot;) is Euler&#x27;s totient function and σ(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of the divisor function, see .
* The maximum determinant in an 8 by 8 matrix of zeroes and ones.
* The number of polygons formed by connecting all the 8 points on the perimeter of a two-times-two-square by straight lines.

Plutarch states that the Pythagoreans associated a polygon of 56 sides with Typhon and that they associated certain polygons of smaller numbers of sides with other figures in Greek mythology. While it is impossible to construct a perfect regular 56-sided polygon using a compass and straightedge, a close approximation has recently been discovered which it is claimed might have been used at Stonehenge, and it is constructible if the use of an angle trisector is allowed since 56 = 23 × 7.

<text>Cayman Airways is the flag carrier airline of the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands. With its head office in Grand Cayman, it operates mainly as an international and domestic scheduled passenger carrier, with cargo services available on most routes. Its operations are based at Owen Roberts International Airport in George Town, Grand Cayman. The company slogan is &quot;Those who fly us love us.&quot;

== History ==
===Early history: 1968 – 1975===

The airline was established and started operations on 7 August 1968. It was formed following the Cayman Islands Government&#x27;s purchase of 51% of Cayman Brac Airways which had been founded in 1955, from LACSA, the Costa Rican flag carrier, and became wholly government-owned in December 1977. LACSA had been serving Grand Cayman since the mid-1950s as an intermediate stop on its route between San José, Costa Rica, and Miami with some flights also making a stop in Havana, Cuba, as well between Grand Cayman and Miami. In 1965, Cayman Brac Airways (which was also known as CBA Airways Ltd.) was operating regional services from Owen Roberts International Airport in George Town, Grand Cayman, to Gerrard Smith International Airport (since renamed Charles Kirkconnell International Airport) on Cayman Brac as well as to Little Cayman via a flag stop and also to Montego Bay, Jamaica. A weekly service with a twin-engine Beechcraft Model 18 aircraft was being operated on a routing of Grand Cayman – Little Cayman (flag stop only) – Cayman Brac – Montego Bay with an additional weekly service being flown between Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac with an intermediate stop on occasion at Little Cayman as a flag stop. Connecting services for Grand Cayman were available to LACSA flights for services to Miami and also for Pan Am flights at Montego Bay for connecting service to Miami and New York City.

Early on, Cayman Airways first aircraft was a single Douglas DC-3. A few months after it was formed, the airline flew its first international route to Kingston, Jamaica, operating five times a week using a BAC One-Eleven twin jet wet-leased from LACSA. International services to Miami were operated eight times a week using a single leased Douglas DC-6 propliner. By the winter of 1973, Cayman Airways was operating stretched BAC One-Eleven series 500 aircraft on both of its jet routes with seventeen flights a week between Grand Cayman and Miami as well as five flights a week between Grand Cayman and Kingston. The airline was also offering direct connecting jet service between Miami and Kingston via Grand Cayman at this time.

===Expansion: 1976 – 1989===
In 1976, the airline had increased competition on the Grand Cayman - Miami route as Southern Airways and LACSA were both operating nonstop jet service on the route. By the late 1970s, Cayman Airways had commenced its second nonstop route to the United States with service between Grand Cayman and Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport operated with a BAC One-Eleven series 500.

In 1979, an additional BAC One-Eleven jet, as well as a Hawker Siddeley 748 turboprop and a Britten-Norman Trislander prop aircraft were purchased and added to the fleet.

In 1982, the airline replaced its two BAC One-Eleven jets with Boeing 727-200 aircraft strengthening the airline&#x27;s regional and international capability and also allowed for the introduction of first-class service. Cayman Airways also operated a single Douglas DC-8-52 and a leased Boeing 727-100 during the 1980s. These aircraft were eventually replaced with Boeing 737-200 jets which in turn were then subsequently replaced with Boeing 737-300 aircraft. Boeing 737-400 jetliners were previously operated as well. During the 1980s, Cayman Airways offered scheduled or charter service to Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis, Newark, New York City, Philadelphia and St. Louis as well as Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica. In addition, Panama City, Panama was served at one point. The airline also flew between Miami and Grand Turk Island as well as Providenciales in the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. These were the only routes flown by the carrier that did not directly serve the Cayman Islands. Cayman Airways has also operated jet service into Cayman Brac with 727-200, 737-200 and 737-400 aircraft, including nonstop flights between Cayman Brac and Miami.

===Struggles: 1990s===
Throughout the early 1990s, the airline struggled. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in 1991 three other air carriers including American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Pan Am were competing with Cayman Airways on the Grand Cayman - Miami route with a combined total of 41 nonstop jet flights a week being operated by the four airlines. Financial assistance from the Cayman Islands Government as well as financial re-structuring plus newer, more modern aircraft and the addition of new destinations such as Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth and Havana were beneficial for the airline at the time.

===Recent history: 2000s===

In 2005, Cayman Airways was the only airline operating nonstop service from Grand Cayman to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport (ORD) with a weekly 737 flight.

In 2016, it was announced that four new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft would be introduced between late 2018 and 2020 thus allowing for the eventual retirement of the 737-300 aircraft currently operated by the airline. The airline has also added one 737-800 as an interim measure as a &quot;bridge&quot; aircraft between the 737-300 and the new 737 MAX 8. Cayman Airways Express also introduced Saab 340 regional turboprop aircraft between 2015 and 2016 in tandem with the eventual planned phased retirement of the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 aircraft as a part of the overall Cayman Airways fleet modernization plan.

On Wednesday 8 November 2017, the retirement process of the 737-300 began with the first aircraft being phased out.

On Monday 27 August 2018, Cayman Airways announced in a press conference that the airline was adding Denver, Colorado (DEN) to its list of gateways. Cayman Airways also stated that this flight will be the longest scheduled commercial flight the airline has ever operated. Cayman Airways was planning to operate these seasonal five-hour nonstop flights from Grand Cayman to Denver twice weekly starting 2 March 2019, until August and then resume service in December 2019. The airline stated it would be operating its new 737 MAX 8 on this service.

During the press conference on 27 August 2018, it was also mentioned that other destinations are also being considered. Destinations such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Vancouver, B.C. may be served in the future with the new 737 MAX 8 with other possible destinations under consideration including London, England (via a stop in Bermuda) and Brazil. 
However, these new services would require the runway at Owen Roberts International Airport to be lengthened. This runway lengthening project is expected to occur within the next several years.

In October 2018 the first of the airlines 737 MAX 8 aircraft was on the final assembly line at the Boeing Renton Factory in Renton, Washington. The second 737 MAX 8 aircraft for the airline was on the assembly line at Boeing Renton Factory late January early February.

On 8 November 2018 the first of the airline&#x27;s new 737 MAX 8 aircraft accomplished its first major test flight.

Shortly after the first test flight of the airline&#x27;s first 737 MAX 8, Cayman Airways issued a statement about the safety of the new aircraft and its acceptance into the airline after concerns loomed due to a crash of an aircraft of the same model operated by Lion Air in Asia (Lion Air Flight 610). In the airline statement, Cayman Airways CEO and president Fabian Whorms stated &quot;I can give a full assurance that our new aircraft will not be delivered or accepted unless it has thoroughly passed all required post-production flight and ground tests successfully. Cayman Airways operates within the strict parameters of a comprehensive and robust Safety Management System and our new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft will enter passenger service only after both the aircraft and the Airline are in full compliance with all safety-related requirements. Once the new aircraft enters service, it will be operated and maintained to the highest standards, with our usual and unwavering commitment to safety.&quot;

In mid-November, the airline&#x27;s first 737 MAX 8 was painted in the company&#x27;s colors. Further test flights took place after the aircraft had its paint job. By the end of November, the aircraft had completed all of the required post-production tests and ready for delivery. The first aircraft was handed over to the airline on 29 November 2018 and delivered to Cayman Airways at Owen Roberts International Airport in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands on 30 November 2018. The second 737 MAX 8 aircraft, completed all it required test flights and had its paint job at the beginning of March, and its handover to airline and delivery flight to Cayman Airways at Owen Roberts International Airport on 6 and 7 March. The third 737 MAX 8 aircraft is expected to be produced and delivered by September 2019. The last of the four 737 MAX 8 that was ordered by the airline is expected to be delivered in September 2020.

On 2 March 2019 started with its inaugural Service to Denver, Colorado. This new service (flight number KX 442) was operated with the airline&#x27;s new 737 MAX 8.

On 10 March 2019, Cayman Airways issued a statement about the temporary suspension of the new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft after further concerns increased due to a second crash of the aircraft type operated by Ethiopian Airlines in Africa. In the airline statement Cayman Airways CEO Fabian Whorms stated: &quot;We have taken the decision to suspend operations of both our new Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, effective from Monday 11 March 2019, until more information is received.&quot; Mr. Whorms also stated, &quot;Cayman Airways is currently working in coordination with both the Boeing Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Cayman Islands (CAACI) to monitor the investigation into Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.&quot;

===Modern history: 2020s===

In Late January 2021, The Civil Aviation Authority of the Cayman Islands (CAACI) rescinded its airspace restriction for the 737 MAX 8 aircraft. This action was done following clearance by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the end of 2020 and approval in January 2021 by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Officials explained that the decision follows the approval of extensive modifications to the design of the aircraft, to how it is flown, and to pilot training. This includes modifications to the aircraft&#x27;s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), as well as other key safety changes aimed at preventing further accidents.

On 10 February 2021, a press conference with Cayman Airways CEO and other key personnel announced the ungrounding of its own 737 MAX 8 aircraft and a “Return To Service (RTS)” plan to reestablish the aircraft back into service. The press conference gave a solid assurance that the aircraft is ready to safely return to the skies from the fact that all of the world&#x27;s major aviation regulators and certifying authorities have given the aircraft a level of scrutiny that is unprecedented in aviation history. Cayman Airways has already completed all the aircraft modifications and improvements necessary to assure safe operation of the aircraft and we are now in the process of implementing several final measures, many of which are above and beyond the prescribed requirements. The 737 MAX 8 aircraft for the airline is expected to be fully operational beginning in Mid February.

In Early February 2021, the Cayman Islands Pilots Association (CAPA) issued a statement regarding the reentry of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft. CAPA stating &quot;The B737-8 is one of the safest planes to fly on&quot;.

During the week of the 10 February Cayman Airways Press Conference, Cayman Airways announce public viewing and walkthrough of the newly upgraded 737 MAX 8 aircraft and watch some of the operational test flights at Owen Roberts International Airport and Charles Kirkconnell International Airport over the weekend.

Between 1st half 2020 to 2nd half of 2021 Cayman Airways like many airlines around the world had taken a hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, from Mid 2020 through 3rd Quarter of 2021 Cayman Airways operated Repatriation flights through the Government&#x27;s Travel Cayman Program. Cayman Airways returned to a reduced commercial flight schedule during the 4th Quarter of 2021.

On 21 October 2021, Cayman Airways cancelled its service to La Ceiba, Honduras due to an issuance of a NOTAM that Goloson International Airport is downgrading to a Category 6 Airport. Cayman Airways had operated the 737 MAX 8 for that route. ICAO requires airports to be Category 7 or higher for the 737 MAX 8 to operate.

In March 2023, during an interview on Cayman Compass talk show &#x27;The Resh Hour&#x27;, Cayman Airways CEO Fabian Whorms noted that they have begun the process of looking for a 3rd Twin Otter for its Express Fleet. He also noted that in the near future they may look at replacing its Saab 340B+ fleet, he also stated “Ideally, we’d like that whatever we replace it with be something that can also fulfil the mission that the Twin Otters currently fulfil for us. But that’s dependent as to what happens with the Little Cayman aerodrome.”

On 24 July 2023, a joint press briefing with Government Ministers from Barbados and Cayman Islands as well as Cayman Airways was held. During the briefing they introduced a twice weekly Direct service to Barbados, this introducing the airline to Eastern Caribbean markets and by way of Barbados extending out to more European Markets. In addition to Barbados announcement, they announced expanding an additional two Los Angeles flights. This came nearly a Month after Cayman Airways restarted to flights to Panama.

On 17 November 2024, Cayman Airways obtains it 3rd Twin Otter for its Express Fleet.

===Historical fleet===

The former Cayman Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of October 2021):
===Logo===
The company&#x27;s mascot is an embellishment of the original Sir Turtle designed by Suzy Soto. As first designed, Sir Turtle did not have the red flying scarf. That original design was used on baggage stickers by Cayman Islands Customs and also became the logo of the Department of Tourism which was then headed by Eric Bergstrom. The red flying scarf was later added to Sir Turtle in 1978 by Capt. Wilbur Thompson, the Chief Pilot of Cayman Airways at the time, and the modified Sir Turtle became the airline&#x27;s new logo.

==Head office==
Cayman Airways corporate office is located in George Town and is located at 91 Owen Roberts Drive almost opposite the Cayman Airways aircraft maintenance facility located at 54 Owen Roberts Drive. Owen Roberts Drive is the main road leading to the Owen Roberts International Airport in Grand Cayman.

The Cayman Airways corporate office was housed in the former Sammy&#x27;s Airport Inn. Another previous Cayman Airways offices were damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The Cayman Islands government purchased Sammy&#x27;s Airport Inn for $2.85 million United States dollars. The fit-out, including the furniture, was completed for $3 million U.S. with the valuation of the property estimated at 6.76 million U.S. as of June 2007. Parking for the head office is located in the adjacent Cayman Islands Airport Authority property with there being more parking per square foot at the current Cayman Airways head office than in most buildings in George Town.

<text>Sagres Point (&quot;&quot;, , from the Latin &quot;Promontorium Sacrum&quot; ‘Holy Promontory’) is a windswept shelf-like promontory located in the southwest Algarve region of southern Portugal. Only 4 km to the west and 3 km to the north lies Cape St. Vincent (), which is usually taken as the southwesternmost tip of Europe. The vicinity of Sagres Point and Cape St. Vincent has been used for religious purposes since Neolithic times, to which standing menhirs near Vila do Bispo, a few miles from both points, attest.

== History ==
The promontory of Sagres has always been important for sailors because it offers a shelter for ships before attempting the dangerous voyage around Cape St. Vincent (could be Belixe Bay, between Sagres Point and the Cape, or Sagres Bay, to the east). Given the dangers of being blown onto the coastal rocks, captains preferred to wait in the lee of the point until favourable winds allowed them to continue.

===Strabo===
There is some question whether Sagres Point, whose name derives from &quot;Sacrum Promontorium&quot;, or neighboring Cape St. Vincent, was the ancient sacred promontory. Strabo believed the promontory was the most westerly point of the &quot;whole inhabited world.&quot; In fact Cape St. Vincent is more westerly, but because it is further north, and Strabo&#x27;s map of the Iberian Peninsula is rotated clockwise, bringing the Pyrenees into a north–south line, it could have been taken as further east. The most westerly point of the Iberian Peninsula and of the European continent is Cabo da Roca, near Sintra; the southernmost, Punta de Tarifa, in Andalusia. The rocks at the base of the Cape St. Vincent lighthouse are called &quot;fim do mundo&quot;, or &quot;end of the world&quot;.

Strabo reports (Book 3.1.4) as follows: 

No part of Cape St. Vincent fits this description, but on the eastern side of Sagres Point is a harbor, Baleeira, port of the modern town of Sagres, protected by four small islands in a line (the tiny Martinhal Islets) visible in satellite imagery. At the far eastern end of the beach of Martinhal, erosion of the cliffs has exposed a series of Roman pottery kilns for fabricating transport amphoras and roof tiles.

===Henry the Navigator===

When Henry the Navigator commenced his explorations, which would initiate the Portuguese Age of Discoveries, at his &quot;Vila do Infante&quot;, Sagres peninsula lacked the necessary requirements for such large undertakings. Fresh water was scarce, agriculture was minimal, there was a shortage of wood for shipbuilding, no deep-water landing site, and the population was small. Henry re-populated a village called Terçanabal, which had been deserted due to continuous pirate attacks on the coast. The village was situated in a strategic position for his maritime enterprises and was later called &quot;Vila do Infante&quot;.

Henry the Navigator employed cartographers, such as Jehuda Cresques, to help him chart the coast of Mauretania in the wake of voyages he had caused to be made to there. He also engaged an expert map and instrument-maker, Jayme of Majorca, so that his captains might have the best nautical information. This probably led to the legend of the Nautical School of Sagres (although a &quot;school&quot; also means a group of followers). There was no centre of navigational science or any supposed observatory, if compared to the modern definition of &quot;observatory&quot; or &quot;navigational centre&quot;. The centre of his expeditions was actually at Lagos, further to the east along the Algarve coast. Later Portuguese voyages left from Belém, just west of Lisbon.

This was a time of many important discoveries: cartography was being refined with the use of newly devised instruments, such as an improved astrolabe and improved sundial, maps were regularly being updated and extended, and a revolutionary type of vessel known as the caravel was designed.

Prince Henry built a chapel next to his house in 1459, as he began to spend more time in the Sagres area in his later years. He died at Sagres on 13 November 1460.

The exact location of Henry&#x27;s School of Navigation is not known (it is popularly believed to have been destroyed by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake).

== Fortress history ==
The 16th century bulwark-like fortress was severely damaged during the Great Earthquake of 1755. It was restored in the mid 20th century, but there is still a 16th-century turret present. After passing through the thick tunnel entrance, one sees a giant pebble compass rose (&quot;rosa dos ventos&quot;) of 43 m diameter. Normally compass roses are divided into 32 segments, but strangely this one has 40 segments (probably an error of the 20th-century restorers). It is unlikely to date back to the time of Henry the Navigator.

The much-restored church &quot;Nossa Senhora da Graça&quot; dates from 1579. It replaced the original church of Henry the Navigator of 1459. It was also damaged by the earthquake of 1755. Some alterations to the church were made, such as the building of a new bell tower over the old charnel house of the cemetery. There are still a set of tombstones present. Inside this unpretentious church, the 17th century Baroque retable above the altar originates from the &quot;Capela de Santa Catarina do Forte de Belixe&quot; (St. Catherine&#x27;s Chapel in Belixe Fortress), while the polychrome statues of St. Vincent and St. Francis were once part of the Franciscan convent on the Cape St. Vincent.

Next to the church stands a replica stone standard (&quot;padrão&quot;), used by the explorers to claim a newly discovered territory.

<doc id="399296" wikidata="Q434374" url="?curid=399296" title="Odd Nerdrum">
<text>Odd Nerdrum (born 8 April 1944) is a Norwegian figurative painter. A controversial figure in Norway, he is known for his anti-modernist stance. Themes and style in Nerdrum&#x27;s work reference anecdote and narrative. Primary influences by the painters Rembrandt and Caravaggio help place his work in direct conflict with abstraction and conceptual art. They include still life paintings of small, everyday objects, portraits and self-portraits, and large paintings allegorical and apocalyptic in nature. The figures in Nerdrum&#x27;s paintings are often dressed as if from another time and place. His work has largely been met with negative criticism from Norwegian art critics. Art critic Stig Andersen described Nerdrum as the leader of an &quot;authoritarian personality cult&quot; and his audience as an &quot;uneducated, narrow-minded bourgeoisie,&quot; representing &quot;the triumph of popular culture over art.&quot;

Nerdrum was educated at Oslo Waldorf School and later at the Art Academy of Oslo. Disillusioned with the art form taught at the academy and with modern art in general Nerdrum began to teach himself to paint in a post-modern style with Rembrandt and Caravaggio as influences. In 1965, he began a several-months study with the German artist Joseph Beuys. In &quot;Fenomenet Nerdrum&quot; [The Nerdrum Phenomenon], Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen traces Nerdrum&#x27;s sense of belonging in older cultural traditions, his skepticism toward a rationality that rejects the spiritual in nature and humanity, and his aversion to modern technology and ways of life, back to the influence of anthroposophy.

Nerdrum says that his art should be understood as kitsch rather than art as such. &quot;On Kitsch&quot;, a manifesto composed by Nerdrum, describes the distinction he makes between kitsch and art.
Nerdrum&#x27;s philosophy spawned the Kitsch movement among his students and followers, who call themselves kitsch painters rather than artists.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nerdrum was born in Sweden. His Norwegian parents were resistance fighters who had fled German-occupied Norway to Helsingborg, Sweden during World War II where Nerdrum, subsequently, was born. At the end of the war Nerdrum returned to Norway with his parents. By 1950 Nerdrum&#x27;s parents had divorced leaving the mother to raise Odd and his younger brother. In 1993, Nerdrum discovered that his father was not his biological father; his mother had had a relationship with the architect David Sandved. Nerdrum was born from this liaison. 

Odd Nerdrum grew up as the son of lawyer and airline director Johan Nerdrum and shipowner&#x27;s daughter Edith Marie (Lillemor) Nerdrum. He was born in Helsingborg, Sweden in 1944. His parents, then Resistance fighters, had been sent to Sweden from German-occupied Norway to direct guerrilla activities from outside the country. A year later, at the end of the war, Odd and his parents moved back to Norway. Lillemor, his mother, soon after, went to New York to study at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Nerdrum felt unwanted and abandoned; this feeling would stay with him until he was in his late forties. In 1950, Nerdrum&#x27;s parents divorced, leaving Nerdrum&#x27;s mother, Lillemor, to raise two small children, Odd, and his younger brother.

Nerdrum&#x27;s father, Johan Nerdrum, later remarried. Although he was supportive of Odd, he kept an emotional distance between himself and his son. At his death, Odd was asked not to attend the funeral. He found out three years later that Johan was not his biological father. Odd, was in fact, the result of a liaison between David Sandved and Lillemor. Lillemor and Sandved had had a relationship prior to Lillemor&#x27;s marriage, and this was resumed during the war in a period when Johan was absent. Richard Vine, art critic, describes this episode in Nerdrum&#x27;s life as one which created &quot;a conflicted preoccupation with origins and personal identity&quot;, that &quot;came natural to Nerdrum&quot; and was represented in his pictures. He would go on to make paintings about these experiences.

===Early education===
Nerdrum began his formal education in 1951 in Oslo, in the private Oslo Waldorf School (&quot;Rudolf Steinerskolen i Oslo&quot;). In Norway, anthroposophy in general and the Waldorf schools in particular have been strongly associated with the cultural and intellectual elite of the country since the early 20th century, and the school attracted a combination of children of artists, academics and financial elites. This education would set Odd apart from his contemporaries. The system was based on anthroposophy that saw mankind as once living in harmony with the universe but now existing in a lesser state of rationality. Through spiritual or esoteric practice, Steiner believed mankind could find its way back to a connection with higher realities and to renewed harmony with the universe. Learning for students was often kinesthetic, for example, through dramatic enactments of history and fantasy, and through musical exercises that were reminiscent of the patterns found on ancient Greek vases, depicting figures moving in parallel patterns. These parallel patterns could be found in later Nerdrum work, as can a sensibility for iconographic images and costume.

Jens Bjørneboe, Norwegian author and mentor, said Nerdrum even at a young age exhibited tendencies of innate talent and industry, but also impatience with those with less ability than himself.

==Personal life==
Odd Nerdrum has been married to fellow painter Turid Spildo since 1995. Spildo is artistic director of the Nerdrum Studio. They have two sons, Öde and Bork; and twin daughters, Aftur and Myndin. Their adult children are engaged in creative endeavors, which includes art, documentary, plays and acting. 

==Artistic study==
Nerdrum began study at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts, but became dissatisfied with the direction of modern art, notably Rauschenberg&#x27;s work, and began to teach himself how to paint in a Neo-Baroque style, with the guidance of Rembrandt&#x27;s technique and work as a primary influence. Nerdrum had seen Rembrandt&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis&quot; in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm. Nerdrum says seeing the painting was &quot;a shock... Pervasive. Like finding home. I can say I found a home in this picture... The wonderful thing with Rembrandt is the confidence he inspires - like when you warm your hands on a stove. Without Rembrandt I would have been so poor&quot;. By abandoning the accepted path of modern art, Nerdrum had placed himself in direct opposition to most aspects of the school, including his primary painting instructor, his fellow students, and a curriculum designed to present Norway as a country with an up-to-date artistic culture. He, in his own words, was chased from the academy after a two-year period like a &quot;scroungy mutt&quot;. Years later Nerdrum said:

&quot;I saw that I was in the process of making a choice that would end in defeat. By choosing those qualities that were so alien to my own time, I had to give up at the same time the art on which the art of our time rests. I had to paint in defiance of my own era without the protection of the era&#x27;s superstructure. Briefly put I would paint myself into isolation.&quot;

Nerdrum later studied with Joseph Beuys, at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. However, he continued to feel isolated from the other students, who nicknamed him &quot;Zorn&quot; from the notorious Swedish &quot;flesh-painter.&quot;

==Influences==
Rembrandt and Caravaggio are primary influences on Nerdrum&#x27;s work, while secondary influences include Masaccio, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, and the less obvious influences, according to Vine and either mentioned by Nerdrum himself or other critics, that include Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Goya, Chardin, Millet, as well as the even less apparent Henry Fuseli, Caspar David Friedrich, Ferdinand Hodler, Edvard Munch, Käthe Kollwitz, Salvador Dalí, Chaïm Soutine and Lars Hertervig.

==Direction==
===Early work (1964–1982)===
Nerdrum&#x27;s work from the first twenty years of his artistic life consisted of large canvasses, generally polemic in nature, that served to refute accepted social or economic viewpoints. The work from this period was highly representational and detailed in nature with often careful attention to contemporary references, such as in clothing, or in the model of a bicycle as in the painting &quot;The Arrest&quot;. Vine notes that, Nerdrum&#x27;s influence was not, as might be expected, given the themes of the work, the ideological Ashcan school movement, although similar in subject matter. In 1968, Nerdrum had viewed for the first time the works of Caravaggio whose psychologically intense work, use of cross lighting, strongly suggested shadow that implied three dimensionality, and use of the faces of real, everyday people impacted him intensely, and provided one of the major influences for his work of this time period. He would revisit Italy and Caravaggio&#x27;s work for on-going inspiration for many years.

As well, Nerdrum was a reader of visionary literature that included works by Rudolf Steiner, the prophetic William Blake, the dark Dostoyevsky, and the mystical Swedenborg. This would influence him towards a more vertical sensibility rather than the linear Marxist view based on revolution that influenced most artists with socially reformist sensibilities.

As a young student, Nerdrum had encountered the works of the master painters in the National Museum. In particular, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot; The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis&quot; (1661) acted as a powerful antidote to his sensibilities. His disillusionment with modern art, such as Robert Rauschenberg&#x27;s Monogram, a stuffed goat with a tire around its middle section standing on a flat, littered surface, which Nerdrum had encountered in the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, filled the young artist with disgust.

These influences both positive and negative would impact all of Nerdrum&#x27;s work. A turning point in Nerdrum&#x27;s work - the end of Nerdrum&#x27;s more contemporary scene-like work, and the movement towards more Rembrandt-like painting elements- revolved around the enormous (11x16¾ foot) &quot;Refugees At Sea&quot; (1979–1980). Nerdrum, according to Vine, later considered the work to be naive in the sense that Rousseau defines the word, in which mankind is seen as innocent and innately good. In the painting Nerdrum endows the refugees, 27 Vietnamese boat people, with heroic stature, but in a highly sentimentalized manner that Nerdrum later described as &quot;cloying&quot;.

===Change in direction===
In 1981 Nerdrum created a seminal work that would serve to indicate a change in direction from the sentimentalized view of &quot;Refugees at Sea&quot; to a starker, unadorned view of reality. &quot;Twilight&quot;, a rear view of a young woman alone in a wooded landscape defecating, offers nothing sentimental or ideal in its betrayal, but instead offers a stripped away view of life and reality.

Paintings were no longer as multi-figured as they had been with &quot;Refugees at Sea&quot;, and still lifes were of individual objects such as a brick or loaf of bread. The individuals who now populated Nerdrum&#x27;s paintings were imbued with great quiet and stillness, but as Vine says, additionally were vitally alive, evoking a cosmic oneness that transcended individuality.

These figures — types rather than endowed with features or apparent stories that might distinguish them as individual — were costumed in garments that seemed timeless such as furs, skins, or leather caps, rather than in clothing that would link the viewer to a specific time and place.

Archetypal-like, these beings, inhabited pre-social, apocalyptic-like circumstances that included stark, severe landscapes, a reference to some place beyond our own time and space.

==Painting technique==
Nerdrum&#x27;s approach to painting is based on traditional methods that included mixing and grinding his own pigments, working on canvas he had stretched or is stretched by assistants rather than on pre-stretched canvas, and working from live models, often himself, and in many cases members of his own family. In 2011, Nerdrum stated that the technique he used in the 1980s was faulty, &quot;a special mixture of oils and wax in an effort to recreate the style of the old masters&quot; which subsequently melted and disintegrated.

===Process===
Of his process Nerdrum says: &quot;When I paint as if I struggle in the water. I will try with all means not to drown. Sandpaper, rags, my fingers, the knife--in short everything. The brush is rarely used.&quot;

==Drawings and prints==
Odd Nerdrum prints are based on his paintings. For example, an etching entitled &quot;Baby&quot; is based on a painting of the same title from 1982. Nerdrum refers to his highly finished, charcoal drawings as &quot;paintings&quot; Often his drawings are large in scale and are works in their own right, as well as being studies for future paintings.

==On kitsch==

Odd Nerdrum has declared himself to be a kitsch-painter identifying himself with kitsch rather than with the contemporary art world. Initially, Nerdrum&#x27;s declaration was thought to be a joke, but later, and with the publication of articles and books on the subject, Nerdrum&#x27;s position can be seen as an implied criticism of contemporary art.

==Court cases==
In 2011, Nerdrum was convicted in Norway of tax evasion and sentenced to two years in prison. An appeal was filed. His defense claimed that a very large amount of money stored in a safe deposit box in Austria was &quot;a safety measure against future claims&quot; for some 36 paintings that Nerdrum had created in the 1980’s using an experimental medium which began to melt when exposed to heat.&quot; The sentence was criticised as excessive while art professor Øivind Storm Bjerke called the sentence &quot;strict&quot; Supporters stated that there were flaws in the proceedings of the trial, such as faulty evidence. Nerdrum claimed the case was an attempt at political persecution.

In January 2012, the Norwegian court of appeal granted Nerdrum a new trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nerdrum/NRK&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on 11 June. After three trial days, Nerdrum was once again convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to two years and ten months in prison. In 2013, the verdict was set aside by the Supreme Court of Norway; in 2014 court of appeals found him guilty of tax evasion and he was sentenced to 20 months in prison; 8 months were suspended. Under Norwegian law, Nerdrum would be forbidden from any painting activity in prison, as prisoners in Norway are not allowed to pursue business activities while incarcerated.

In October 2012, Nerdrum lost a suit filed against the regional tax authority. The Oslo court ruled that the funds that Nerdrum had set aside in Austria did not constitute a &#x27;loan, security, depot or committed funds&#x27; and should have been disclosed as income.

In September 2017 Nerdrum was pardoned by King Harald V of Norway.

==Nerdrum&#x27;s work as inspiration==
A 2000 horror film, &quot;The Cell&quot;, contains a scene that was heavily influenced by Nerdrum&#x27;s 1989 painting &quot;Dawn&quot;. The scene features three identical figures sitting down, looking upwards with pained, trance-like expressions on their faces. Director Tarsem Singh in the film&#x27;s audio commentary says that the painting was the inspiration for the scene&#x27;s imagery. Singh had seen the painting while visiting the owner of the painting, David Bowie.

Australian choreographer, Meryl Tankard&#x27;s 2009 dance piece, &quot;The Oracle&quot;, was inspired by the work of Nerdrum. The work, featuring the dancer Paul White, was about the human being in constant struggle with forces outside of itself.

The Norwegian classical composer Martin Romberg wrote a collection of piano pieces inspired by three of Nerdrum&#x27;s works in 2014, named &quot;Tableaux Kitsch&quot;. The pieces are inspired by the paintings &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, &quot;Stranded&quot;, and &quot;Drifting&quot;, and were premiered at Nerdrum&#x27;s exhibitions in Paris 2013 and Barcelona 2016.

==Art market==
Nerdum&#x27;s highest selling painting, &quot;Dawn&quot;, was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s London, for £341,000 ($428,637), on 11 November 2016. This was a new record for the artist, surpassing the previous one held by &quot;The Cloud&quot; from 2008.

==Collections==
Odd Nerdrum&#x27;s work is held in public collections worldwide including the National Gallery, in Oslo, the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, in Oslo, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington, D.C., the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, the New Orleans Museum of Art, in New Orleans, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, in San Diego, and the Walker Art Center, in Minneapolis.

<doc id="399299" wikidata="Q16200922" url="?curid=399299" title="William Hetherington case">
<text>The William Hetherington case is a 1985 rape case in the U.S. state of Michigan in which William Hetherington was controversially convicted of the sexual assault of his wife during a contentious divorce case and custody dispute. Hetherington served over 24 years in custody, which he claims is due partly to exceptional hindrances in appealing the claimed injustices in the sentence. On October 27, 2009, Hetherington was finally granted a parole.

A 1994 article in Insight Magazine drew attention to claims that he was either incorrectly found guilty, or grossly over-sentenced, and denied due process of law applicable to his defense.

==Background==
William and Linda Hetherington married in 1971; the marriage was an unhappy one and between 1978 and 1985 William sought divorce, then the couple reconciled, and finally divorce was sought again. During this period, Linda brought, then withdrew, charges of spousal rape more than once, with one such incident described by an article in Insight Magazine as &quot;the first of several times that Linda would accuse her husband of raping her, at times when bringing charges was to her advantage&quot;.

In May 1985 following Linda&#x27;s travelling without notice to another state, divorce was filed. It was expected that Hetherington would win custody due to Linda&#x27;s history of abandonment of the children and family, for a period of more than two months. In August, Linda claimed he had raped her a month earlier and he was imprisoned briefly. Although released shortly afterwards, the timing caused custody to be given to Linda, with the judge commenting that custody would have gone to William had he not been incarcerated at the time of the hearing, but that he could apply later for custody instead.

A month later, after William was released, he applied for custody. A hearing was set for October 7, but before this could take place, Linda again accused him of rape, claiming he had taped and tied her up, threatened that she was about to &quot;meet her maker&quot;, abducted her by car, cut her clothing off, and raped her. According to William she invited sexual intercourse at her mother&#x27;s home where she was staying, then began demanding money she believed he had. After some confusion, according to &quot;several witnesses&quot;, Linda&#x27;s mother insisted charges were pressed.

==Initial conviction==
County prosecutor Robert Weiss was responsible for prosecuting the case. He also reinstated the August case that had been dropped, and a bail bond was set at $500,000. With his assets frozen during the divorce, and his income being disability payments, William was unable to obtain bail, and unable to finance a legal defence. The court considered him to have assets, and no lawyer was provided for him as a result. Linda visited the prosecutor; stories vary at this point as to whether or not she sought charges to be dropped, and whether she was relieved or reluctant they were not.

Eventually William persuaded an attorney, David Wright, to represent him, for a $10,000 fee to be paid from his disability checks.

As trial approached in May 1986, the prosecutor offered a plea bargain, that if he pleaded guilty to a single charge of first degree rape, and a court-appointed psychologist concluded that he was not a danger to his ex-wife, he would receive a delayed sentence of 11 months, or probation with credit for time served. Williams claims the offer was made coercively.

The article in Insight Magazine is sharply critical of the evidence. A pelvic examination of Linda three hours after the incident showed no evidence of forcible injury, described as &quot;very unusual&quot; in a rape case by the doctor. Although police officers stated that possible adhesive tape traces were visible on her face, doctors examining her found that no traces of that kind existed, and the scissors alleged to be used to cut the tape showed no adhesive traces either. Other evidence - the tape, gloves and underwear - was said by Linda to have been flushed down the toilet by her assailant. A neighbor, Reinhardt, added further evidence that contradicted the story - that William&#x27;s car had been at the location Linda alleged she was abducted and therefore she had known he was there (she claimed she had not known), and that during the time of the rape she had left the house to get something from the car, then returned to the house to talk further. Sperm was found in Linda&#x27;s clothing; however William had previously had a vasectomy, a form of sterilization which makes a man incapable of emitting sperm.

The court-appointed psychiatrist was supportive of William&#x27;s case. Lacking prior record, sentencing guidelines at the time were 6 to 10 years (average time served by a convicted rapist in Michigan is 5 years), and this was reinforced by a &quot;highly favourable&quot; report that concluded William&#x27;s personality seemed to &quot;substantiate his explanation of what has occurred&quot;, and that &quot;this is not a man who would force himself sexually or hostilely on another individual ... He does not appear to be an individual who is dangerous for society.&quot;

There was also suspicion that the prosecution was motivated by other factors. Conservative commentator Phyllis Schlafly claimed that Weiss, who was running for the Michigan Supreme Court at the time, was &quot;grandstanding for the feminist vote.&quot; Insight Magazine wrote:

In the midst of running for the Michigan Supreme Court, Weiss made a dramatic statement in which he asserted that &#x27;murder may have been less harmful&#x27; than William&#x27;s acts. He also painted a picture of a grislier crime than the one in question: &#x27;He raped her four times at a minimum, on a single day ... every opening of her body, every cavity, had been invaded violently.&#x27; (The charges involved one act of forced oral sex and one act of vaginal penetration, with no allegations of anal intercourse.) Urging the court to &#x27;Let the women of this world know this is not tolerated,&#x27; he asked for a sentence of 30 to 60 years.&quot;

Likewise the judge, Thomas Yeotis, discredited the psychiatrists view on the grounds that &quot;you make a nice appearance, and yet, there&#x27;s something about you that disturbs me.&quot; The psychiatrist was one whose opinion the judge is said to have &quot;relied on&quot; for 20 years before, and continued to do so after.

<text>57 (fifty-seven) is the natural number following 56 and preceding 58. It is a composite number.

== In mathematics ==
57 is semiprime a Blum integer, and a Leyland number. 

The split Lie algebra E has a 57-dimensional Heisenberg algebra as its nilradical, and the smallest possible homogeneous space for E8 is also 57-dimensional.

Although fifty-seven is not prime, it is jokingly known as the &quot;Grothendieck prime&quot; after a legend according to which the mathematician Alexander Grothendieck supposedly gave it as an example of a particular prime number. 
The joke is that he is famous for working abstractly, without concrete examples.
However, while the veracity of this legend about &quot;Grothendieck&quot; is unclear, it &quot;is&quot; known that this very error was committed by another famous mathematician Hermann Weyl in a published article.

<doc id="399302" wikidata="Q1670936" url="?curid=399302" title="Pelican Bay State Prison">
<text>Pelican Bay State Prison (PBSP) is a supermax prison in Crescent City, California. The prison takes its name from a shallow bay on the Pacific coast, about to the west.

==Facilities==

The prison is located in a detached section of Crescent City, several miles north of the main urban area and just south of the Oregon border.

Pelican Bay State Prison opened in 1989. It covers , and grounds and operations are physically divided.

An X-shaped cluster of buildings comprise a quarter of the prison&#x27;s facilities, and are known as the Security Housing Unit, or SHU. This facility contains 1,056 solitary confinement cells, organized into 132 eight-cell pods. Each cell is and contains a concrete ledge with a foam pad to be used as a bed, a steel combination sink and toilet, and two concrete cubes that serve as a desk and chair. Armed guards monitor six pods of 48 cells at once from central control booths, through perforated steel doors that make it easy for guards to see in but difficult for prisoners to see out. Cell doors are controlled remotely, and prisoners can be allowed out to shower or to exercise in each pod&#x27;s solitary exercise yard.

Half of the prison holds Level IV (maximum security) inmates in a general population environment with two-man cells. The remaining prison houses Level II inmates in an open-cell, dormitory-style facility for 500 individuals, and Level I (minimum security) prisoners in a facility for 400 individuals located outside of the main perimeter of the prison.

, 1,852 people were incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison. 1,112 (60%) of those inmates were Level IV (maximum security) prisoners, 290 of whom were located in the Security Housing Unit.

== History ==

=== Early brutality ===
After Pelican Bay State Prison opened in 1989, guards eager to assert their dominance over the inmates established a culture of violence. Inmates in the Security Housing Unit were beaten, tied and left naked, or subjected to staged &quot;gladiator fights&quot; by guards who would intentionally release two prisoners from enemy gangs and then shoot at the prisoners after they began fighting. Vaughn Dortch, who was serving a ten-year sentence for grand theft and whose mental illness had worsened since being moved to the SHU, was taken in April 1992 to be bathed by guards after smearing himself with feces. Five or six guards subjected Dortch to a bath in scalding water while he was handcuffed, leaving him with second- and third-degree burns. Prisoners were also regularly housed two to a cell in the SHU due to overcrowding, with 364 prisoners double-bunked in 1990 and approximately 1,000 double-bunked by 1995, leading to serious injuries from cell fights.

Media attention, including a September 1993 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report about the brutality against Dortch, and lawsuits ultimately led to changes at Pelican Bay State Prison. Federal District Court Judge Thelton Henderson ruled in the 1995 &quot;Madrid v. Gomez&quot; decision that the facility was not being ruled in a constitutional way, and ordered oversight by prisoner&#x27;s rights lawyers and other experts. Henderson&#x27;s ruling specifically demanded changes to the use of excessive force by guards, inadequate medical and mental healthcare, and the practice of housing mentally ill prisoners in the SHU.

===Hunger strikes===

Prisoners at PBSP, particularly those in isolation for several years, have organized or joined in hunger strikes in protest of conditions at the prison and the practice of subjecting prisoners to long periods of isolation.

In 2002, a reported 60 SHU inmates began a hunger strike.The prisoners called attention to the effects of isolation in the secure housing unit.

On July 1, 2011, several thousand prisoners at Pelican Bay State Prison joined a total of more than 6,000 prisoners elsewhere in California prisons to stage a hunger strike in protest against overly restrictive conditions and extended periods of isolation. They demanded warm clothes and a handball for use during their one-hour a day in the outdoor exercise yard, the ability to make one phone call per week, adequate food, and the possibility of reconsideration of their long periods of isolation after several years. The original strike lasted for over two weeks, and was repeated again in October of the same year.

Inmates resumed the July 2011 hunger strike two years later, on July 8, 2013, alleging a failure to uphold promises on the part of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), with upwards of 29,000 prisoners across California joining in the hunger strike. Strikers demanded reform of &quot;cruel&quot; policies used to identify and subsequently isolate or punish alleged gang members, including lengthy solitary confinement and the quality of living improvements. The strike lasted for two months, and dozens of prisoners were hospitalized. The strike brought the first widespread media attention to the Security Housing Units in California, the scale at which prisoners were being kept in such conditions, and the fact that there were prisoners who had been kept in solitary confinement at Pelican Bay for twenty years. On the seventh week of the strike, Judge Thelton Henderson signed an order to permit the &quot;re-feeding&quot; of prisoners who were participating, though it was not clear precisely what was permitted by the order. However, this was made unnecessary shortly after when Senator Loni Hancock and Assembly member Tom Ammiano promised to investigate the state&#x27;s policies around solitary confinement and consider legislation. Following this promise, the prisoners agreed to end the strike.

===Lawsuit and termination of unlimited isolation policy===
In May 2012, California&#x27;s prison system faced a lawsuit from the Center for Constitutional Rights, Legal Services for inmates with Children, and other California attorneys on behalf of ten men incarcerated in the SHU. The plaintiffs were all housed in the SHU for 11 to 22 years, some having been transferred directly from other SHUs. The suit claims that the inmates &quot;have been incarcerated California’s Pelican Bay State Prison&#x27;s Security Housing Unit (&quot;SHU&quot;) for an unconscionably long period of time without meaningful review of their placement&quot;, that &quot;California&#x27;s uniquely harsh regime of prolonged solitary confinement at Pelican Bay is inhumane and debilitating&quot;, and that &quot;[t]he solitary confinement regime at Pelican Bay violates the United States Constitution&#x27;s requirement of due process and prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment&quot;.

In August 2015, as a result of the aforementioned class-action lawsuit, California agreed to end its unlimited isolation policy. Inmates are no longer isolated as a preventive measure; only those who commit new crimes while incarcerated are eligible for up to five years of isolation.

<text>HM Prison Holloway was a closed category prison for adult women and young offenders in Holloway, London, England, operated by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service. It was the largest women&#x27;s prison in western Europe, until its closure in 2016.

== History ==

Holloway prison was opened in 1852 as a mixed-sex prison, but due to growing demand for space for female prisoners, particularly due to the closure of Newgate, it became female-only in 1903.

Before the First World War, Holloway was used to imprison those suffragettes who broke the law. These included Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison, Constance Markievicz (also imprisoned for her part in the Irish Rebellion), Charlotte Despard, Mary Richardson, Dora Montefiore, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, and Ethel Smyth.

In 1959, Joanna Kelley became Governor of Holloway. Kelley ensured that long-term prisoners received the best accommodation and they were allowed to have their own crockery, pictures and curtains. The prison created &quot;family&quot; groups of prisoners, group therapy and psychiatrists to support some prisoners where required.

In 1965, there was a change in responsibilities and the Probation Service was tasked with looking after prisoners once they had served their sentence. Kelley was not keen on the idea. With Kelley&#x27;s encouragement, the Holloway Discharged Prisoners&#x27; Aide Society reformed into the &quot;Griffins Society&quot;, the name coming from the statues of two griffins that had been either side of the entrance gates to Holloway. The Griffins Society provided more services than its previous iteration, including accommodations for discharged prisoners, a meeting ground for imprisoned mothers and their children, a psychotherapy group, and a coffee bar. By 1994, the Society offered five hostels for discharged women, holding up to 65 women, and enabling a great deal of independence to former prisoners seeking to re-establish life after release. 

Until 1991, the Prison was staffed by Home Office appointed, female Prison Officers. Male hospital officers from Pentonville were on weekly secondments until 1976. Their mission was to provide support for the agency nurses who worked in Holloway. The first &#x27;Male, basic grade&#x27; Prison Officer to be posted to HMP Holloway in its (Female inmates only) history, was Prison Officer (Trg) Thomas Ainsworth, who joined the establishment direct from HMP College Wakefield in May 1991.

After the death from suicide in January 2016 of inmate Sarah Reed, a paranoid schizophrenic being held on remand, the subsequent inquest in July 2017 identified failings in the care system. Shortly after Reed died, a report concluded she was unfit to plead at a trial.

=== Rebuilding ===
Holloway&#x27;s Governor Joanna Kelley was promoted to assistant director of prisons (women) in 1966. In 1967, they began to rebuild Holloway Prison. The previous design had been a &quot;star&quot; design where a single warder could oversee many potentially troublesome prisoners and then act promptly to summon assistance. Kelley felt this was wrong as at the time most women prisoners were not violent. It was her ideas that inspired the redesigned prison based on her experience as governor. The rebuilding was completed in 1977. During that time she had become an OBE in 1973. The new design allowed for &quot;family&quot; groups of sixteen prisoners. Her ideas were in the design of the buildings but her ideas were never enacted.
The redevelopment resulted in the loss of the &quot;grand turreted&quot; gateway to the prison, which had been built in 1851; architectural critic Gavin Stamp later regretted the loss and said that the climate of opinion at the time was such that the Victorian Society felt unable to object.

=== Use ===
Holloway Prison held female adults and young offenders remanded or sentenced by the local courts. Accommodation at the prison was mostly single cells; however, there was also some dormitory accommodation.

Holloway Prison offered both full-time and part-time education to inmates, with courses including skills training workshops, British Industrial Cleaning Science (BICS), gardening, and painting.

There was a family-friendly visitors&#x27; centre, run by the Prison Advice and Care Trust (pact), an independent charity.

=== Closure ===
The then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced in his Autumn Statement on 25 November 2015 that the prison would be closed and demolished and the land sold for housing. It closed in July 2016, with the remaining prisoners being moved to HMP Downview and HMP Bronzefield, both in Surrey.

As of September 2017, the prison buildings still stand, with draft proposals for the site including housing, a public open green space, playground, women&#x27;s centre and a small amount of commercial space.

== Notable inmates ==

===Suffragettes===
For decades, British campaigners had argued for votes for women. It was only when a number of suffragists, despairing of change through peaceful means, decided to turn to militant protest that the &quot;suffragette&quot; was born. These women broke the law in pursuit of their aims, and many were imprisoned at Holloway for their criminal activity. They were not treated as political prisoners, the authorities arguing they were imprisoned for their vandalism, not their opinions. In protest, some went on hunger strike and were force fed so Holloway has a large symbolic role in the history of women&#x27;s rights in the UK for those in sympathy with the movement. Suffragettes imprisoned there include Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison, Violet Mary Doudney, Katie Edith Gliddon, Isabella Potbury, Evaline Hilda Burkitt, Georgina Fanny Cheffins, Constance Bryer, Florence Tunks, Janie Terrero, Doreen Allen, Bertha Ryland, Katharine Gatty, Charlotte Despard, Janet Boyd, Genie Sheppard, Mary Ann Aldham, Mary Richardson, Muriel and Arabella Scott, Alice Maud Shipley, Katherine Douglas Smith, Dora Montefiore, Christabel Pankhurst, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Emily Townsend, Leonora Tyson, Miriam Pratt, Ethel Smyth and the American Alice Paul. Detainees later received the Holloway brooch. In 1912 the anthem of the suffragettes – &quot;The March of the Women&quot;, composed by Ethel Smyth with lyrics by Cicely Hamilton – was performed there.

===Irish Republicans===
Holloway held women closely associated with the Irish Easter Rebellion of 1916 and the women&#x27;s paramilitary organisation Cumann na mBan: Maud Gonne, Kathleen Clarke, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Constance Markievicz.

===Fascists===
Holloway held Diana Mitford under Defence Regulation 18B during World War II, and after a personal intervention from Prime Minister Winston Churchill, her husband Sir Oswald Mosley was moved there. The couple lived together in a cottage in the prison grounds. They were released in 1943.

Norah Elam had the distinction of being detained during both World Wars, three times during 1914 as a suffragette prisoner under the name Dacre Fox, then as a detainee under Regulation 18B in 1940, when she was part of the social circle that gathered around the Mosleys during their early internment period. Later, after her release, Elam had the further distinction of being the only former member of the British Union of Fascists to be granted a visit with Oswald Mosley during his period of detention there. Fridel Meyer was not a fascist, but was nevertheless held at Holloway in 1939 under Defence Regulation 18B for being German. She was released after six months following an intervention by barrister Norman Birkett.

===Executions===
A total of five judicial executions by hanging took place at Holloway Prison between 1903 and 1955:
* Amelia Sach and Annie Walters (3 February 1903)
* Edith Thompson (9 January 1923)
* Styllou Christofi (13 December 1954)
* Ruth Ellis (13 July 1955; last woman to be executed in the United Kingdom)

The bodies of all executed prisoners were buried in unmarked graves within the walls of the prison, as was customary. In 1971 the prison underwent an extensive programme of rebuilding, during which the remains of all the executed women were exhumed. With the exception of Ruth Ellis (who was reburied in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Old Amersham), the remains of the four other women were subsequently reburied in a single grave at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey. In 2018, the remains of Edith Thompson were reburied in her parents&#x27; grave in the City of London Cemetery.

===Other inmates===
Noteworthy inmates that were held at the original 1852-era prison include Oscar Wilde, William Thomas Stead, Isabella Glyn, F. Digby Hardy, Kitty Byron, Lady Ida Sitwell, wife of Sir George Sitwell, and Kate Meyrick the &#x27;Night Club Queen&#x27;. Robber Zoe Progl became the first woman to escape over the wall of the prison in 1960.

More recently it housed, in 1966, Moors murderess Myra Hindley; in 1967, Kim Newell, a Welsh woman who was involved in the Red Mini Murder; also in the late 1960s, National Socialist supporter Françoise Dior, charged with arson against synagogues; in 1977, American Joyce McKinney of the &quot;Manacled Mormon case&quot;; between 1991 and 1993, Michelle and Lisa Taylor, the sisters convicted of the murder of Alison Shaughnessy before being controversially released on appeal a year later; Sheila Bowler, the music teacher wrongly imprisoned for the murder of her elderly aunt, was detained there before being transferred to Bullwood Hall; and in 2002, Maxine Carr, who gave a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley. In 2000, Dena Thompson was also known to have been imprisoned at Holloway for attempted murder, before she was convicted of murdering another victim. Sharon Carr, Britain&#x27;s youngest female murderer who killed aged only 12, also spent time at Holloway.

Other inmates included Linda Calvey, Chantal McCorkle, and Emma Humphreys.

In 2014 disgraced judge and barrister Constance Briscoe began a 16-month sentence at the prison.

== Inspections, inquiries and reports ==
In October 1999, it was announced that healthcare campaigner and agony aunt Claire Rayner had been called in to advise on an improved healthcare provision at Holloway Prison. Rayner&#x27;s appointment was announced after the introduction of emergency measures at the prison&#x27;s healthcare unit after various failures.

In September 2001, an inspection report from His Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons claimed that Holloway Prison was failing many of its inmates, mainly due to financial pressures. However, the report stated that the prison had improved in a number of areas, and praised staff working at the jail.

In March 2002, Managers at Holloway were transferred to other prisons following an inquiry by the Prison Service. The inquiry followed a number of allegations from prison staff concerning sexual harassment, bullying and intimidation from managers. The inquiry supported some of these claims.

An inspection report from in June 2003, stated that conditions had improved at Holloway Prison. However the report criticised levels of hygiene at the jail, as well as the lack of trained staff, and poor safety for inmates. A further inspection report in September 2008 again criticised safety levels for inmates of Holloway, claiming that bullying and theft were rife at the prison. The report also noted high levels of self-harm and poor mental health among the inmates.

A further inspection in 2010 again noted improvements but found that most prisoners said they felt unsafe and that there remained 35 incidents a week of self-harm. The prison&#x27;s operational capacity is 501.

===Sarah Reed case===
On 11 January 2016, Sarah Reed, an inmate at Holloway, was found dead in her cell. Her family were told by prison staff that she had strangled herself while lying on her bed. For &quot;The Observer&quot;, Yvonne Roberts wrote &quot;Sarah&#x27;s final days were harrowing. She was hallucinating, chanting, without the medication she had relied on for years, sleepless, complaining a demon punched her awake at night. She was on a basic regime, punishment for what was classed as bad behaviour. In spite of her mental and physical fragility, she was isolated, the cell hatch closed, without hot water, heating or a properly cleaned cell. &#x27;For safety and security&#x27; a four-strong &#x27;lockdown&#x27; team of prison officers delivered basic care.&quot; Observations of Reed had been cut to only one an hour though she was obviously severely psychotic, had threatened suicide and had self harmed. A prison officer told Reed&#x27;s mother, &quot;We deal with restraint and maintaining the law. We&#x27;re not designed to deal with health issues.&quot;

The jury at her inquest decided that Reed took her own life when the balance of her mind was disturbed, but were unclear whether she had intended to kill herself. They said failure to manage her medication and the failure to complete the fitness to plead assessment in a reasonable time were factors in her death. The jury were also concerned about how Reed was monitored and claimed Reed received inadequate treatment in prison for her distress.

Deborah Coles of Inquest said: &quot;Sarah Reed was a woman in torment, imprisoned for the sake of two medical assessments to confirm what was resoundingly clear, that she needed specialist care not prison. Her death was a result of multi-agency failures to protect a woman in crisis. Instead of providing her with adequate support, the prison treated her ill mental health as a discipline, control and containment issue.&quot;

Elizabeth is spared going to jail as her bail is paid for by Julius Karekin, one of the rich men being targeted. Elizabeth and Karekin bail Rose out of prison.

Caitlin Davies has written &quot;Bad Girls&quot; (published by John Murray), a history of Holloway Prison.

<text>A navigator is the person on board a ship or aircraft responsible for its navigation. The navigator&#x27;s primary responsibility is to be aware of ship or aircraft position at all times. Responsibilities include planning the journey, advising the ship&#x27;s captain or aircraft commander of estimated timing to destinations while en route, and ensuring hazards are avoided. The navigator is in charge of maintaining the aircraft or ship&#x27;s nautical charts, nautical publications, and navigational equipment, and they generally have responsibility for meteorological equipment and communications.
With the advent of satellite navigation, the effort required to accurately determine one&#x27;s position has decreased by orders of magnitude, so the entire field has experienced a revolutionary transition since the 1990s with traditional navigation tasks, like performing celestial navigation, being used less frequently. Using multiple independent position fix methods without solely relying on electronic systems subject to failure helps the navigator detect errors. Professional mariners are still proficient in traditional piloting and celestial navigation.

== In naval occupations ==
Shipborne navigators in the U.S. Navy are normally surface warfare officer qualified with the exception of naval aviators and naval flight officers assigned to ship&#x27;s navigator billets aboard aircraft carriers and large deck amphibious assault ships and who have been qualified at a level equal to surface warfare officers. U.S. Coast Guard officers that are shipboard navigators are normally cutter qualified at a level analogous to the USN officers previously mentioned. Quartermasters are the navigator&#x27;s enlisted assistants and perform most of the technical navigation duties.

Aboard ships in the Merchant Marine and Merchant Navy, the second mate is generally the (senior) navigator.

== In aviation ==

Navigators are sometimes also called &#x27;air navigators&#x27; or &#x27;flight navigators&#x27;. In civil aviation this was a position on older aircraft, typically between the late-1910s and the 1970s, where separate crew members (sometimes two navigation crew members) were often responsible for an aircraft&#x27;s flight navigation, including its dead reckoning and celestial navigation, especially when flown over oceans or other large featureless areas where radio navigation aids were not originally available. As sophisticated electronic air navigation aids and universal space-based GPS navigation systems came online, the dedicated Navigator&#x27;s position was discontinued and its function was assumed by dual-licensed Pilot-Navigators, and still later by the aircraft&#x27;s primary pilots (Captain and FO), resulting in a continued downsizing in the number of aircrew positions on commercial flights. Modern electronic navigation systems made the civil aviation navigators redundant by the early 1980s.

In military aviation, navigators are still actively trained and licensed in some present day air forces, as electronic navigation aids cannot be assumed to be operational during wartime. In the world&#x27;s air forces, modern navigators are frequently tasked with weapons and defensive systems operations, along with co-pilot duties such as flight planning and fuel management, depending on the type, model and series of aircraft. In the U.S. Air Force, the aeronautical rating of navigator has been augmented by addition of the combat systems officer, while in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, those officers formerly called navigators, tactical systems officers, or naval aviation observers have been known as naval flight officers since the mid-1960s. USAF navigators/combat systems officers and USN/USMC naval flight officers must be basic mission qualified in their aircraft, or fly with an instructor navigator or instructor NFO to provide the necessary training for their duties.

== Nautical charts ==
A naval ship&#x27;s navigator is responsible for buying and maintaining its nautical charts. A nautical chart, or simply &quot;chart&quot;, is a graphic representation of a maritime or flight region and adjacent coastal regions. Depending on the scale of the chart, it may show depths of water and heights of land, natural features of the seabed, details of the coastline, navigational hazards, locations of natural and man-made aids to navigation, information on tides and currents, local details of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, restricted flying areas, and man-made structures such as harbors, buildings and bridges. Nautical charts are essential tools for marine navigation; many countries require vessels, especially commercial ships, to carry them. Nautical charting may take the form of charts printed on paper or computerised electronic navigational charts.

The nature of a waterway depicted by a chart changes regularly, and a mariner navigating on an old or uncorrected chart is courting disaster. Every producer of navigational charts also provides a system to inform mariners and aviators of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, chart corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Radio broadcasts give advance notice of urgent corrections.

A convenient way to keep track of corrections is with a &quot;chart and publication correction record card&quot; system. Using this system, the navigator does not immediately update every chart in the portfolio when a new Notice to Mariners arrives, instead creating a card for every chart and noting the correction on this card. When the time comes to use the chart, the navigator pulls the chart and chart&#x27;s card, and makes the indicated corrections on the chart. This system ensures that every chart is properly corrected prior to use. British merchant vessels receive weekly Notices to Mariners issued by the Admiralty. When corrections are received all charts are corrected in the ship&#x27;s folio and recorded in NP133A (Admiralty Chart Correction Log and Folio Index). This system ensures that &quot;all&quot; charts are corrected and up to date. In a deep-sea vessel with a folio of over three thousand charts this can be a laborious and time-consuming task for the navigator.

Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic navigational charts.

== Nautical publications ==

The term &quot;nautical publications&quot; is used in maritime circles to describe a set of publications, generally published by national governments, for use in safe navigation of ships, boats, and similar vessels.

The nature of waterways described by any given nautical publication changes regularly, and a mariner navigating by use of an old or uncorrected publication is courting disaster. Every producer of nautical publications also provides a system to inform mariners of changes that affect the chart. In the United States, corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Radio broadcasts give advance notice of urgent corrections. For ensuring that all publications are fully up-to-date, similar methods are employed as for nautical charts. Various and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic nautical publications.

== Mission and passage planning ==


The navigator focuses on creating the ship&#x27;s passage plans (or &quot;mission plans&quot; for USAF purposes). A mission or passage plan can be summarized as a comprehensive, step by step description of how the voyage is to proceed from berth to berth, including unberthing, departure, the en-route portion of a voyage, approach, and mooring/arrival at the destination.

Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed mental model of how the entire voyage will proceed. In the aviation community, this is known as &quot;chair flying&quot;. This mental model includes charting courses and forecasting weather, tides, and currents. It includes updating and checking aeronautical charts, nautical publications, which could include Sailing Directions and Coast Pilots, and projecting the various future events including landfalls, narrow passages, and course changes that will transpire during the voyage. This mental model becomes the standard by which the navigator will measure progress toward the goal of a safe and efficient voyage, and it is manifested in a written passage plan.

When working in a team environment, the passage/mission plan should be communicated to the navigation team in a pre-voyage conference (USAF term is &quot;mission briefing&quot;) in order to ensure that all members of the team share the same mental model of the entire trip.

Passage planning procedures are specified in International Maritime Organization Resolutions, in the laws of IMO signatory countries (for example, Title 33 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations), and a number of professional books and USN/USAF publications. There are some fifty elements of a comprehensive passage plan depending on the size and type of vessel, each applicable according to the individual situation.

A good passage plan will include a track line laid out upon the largest-scale charts available which cover the vessel&#x27;s track. The navigator will draw and redraw the track line until it is safe, efficient, and in line with all applicable laws and regulations. When the track is finished, it is becoming common practice to also enter it into electronic navigation tools such as an Electronic Chart Display and Information System, a chartplotter, or a GPS unit.

Once the voyage has begun the progress of the vessel along its planned route must be monitored. This requires that the ship&#x27;s position be determined, using standard methods including dead reckoning, radar fixing, celestial navigation, pilotage, and electronic navigation, to include usage of GPS and navigation computer equipment.

Passage planning software, tide and tidal current predictors, celestial navigational calculators, consumables estimators for fuel, oil, water, and stores, and other useful applications.

== Navigational equipment ==
The navigator is responsible for the maintenance of the ship&#x27;s navigational equipment. U.S. Air Force navigators are responsible for troubleshooting problems of the navigation equipment while airborne, but the ground Maintenance personnel are ultimately responsible for the repair and upkeep of that aircraft&#x27;s navigation system.

Boats and ships can use several Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to navigate all of the world&#x27;s lakes, seas and oceans. Maritime GNSS units include functions useful on water, such as &quot;man overboard&quot; (MOB) functions that allow instantly marking the location where a person has fallen overboard, which simplifies rescue efforts. GNSS may be connected to the ships self-steering gear and Chartplotters using the NMEA 0183 interface, and GNSS can also improve the security of shipping traffic by enabling AIS.

== In science fiction ==
Navigators are often part of a starship crew in science fiction, where they are sometimes called astrogators, a merger of the prefix &quot;astro&quot; and &quot;navigator&quot;. According to a science fiction citations site for the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the earliest known use of the word is in David Lasser&#x27;s 1931 book &quot;The Conquest of Space&quot;. According to that site and also &quot;Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction&quot;, it first appeared in science fiction in Stanley G. Weinbaum&#x27;s short story &quot;The Planet of Doubt&quot;, published in the October 1935 issue of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;.

The title character of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Starman Jones&quot; is an astrogator.

<text>58 (fifty-eight) is the natural number following 57 and preceding 59.

== In mathematics ==
58 is a composite number, meaning its factor is 1, 2, 29, and 58. Other than 1 and the number itself, 58 can be formed by multiplying two primes 2 and 29, making it a semiprime. 58 is not divisible by any square number other than 1, making it a square-free integer A semiprime that is not square numbers is called a squarefree semiprime, and 58 is among them.

58 is equal to the sum of the first seven consecutive prime numbers:
:formula_1 
This is a difference of 1 from the seventeenth prime number and seventh super-prime, 59. 58 has an aliquot sum of 32 within an aliquot sequence of two composite numbers (58, 32, 13, 1, 0) in the 13-aliquot tree. There is no solution to the equation formula_2, making fifty-eight the sixth noncototient; however, the totient summatory function over the first thirteen integers is 58.

On the other hand, the Euler totient of 58 is the second perfect number (28), where the sum-of-divisors of 58 is the third unitary perfect number (90).

58 is also the second non-trivial 11-gonal number, after 30.

58 represents twice the sum between the first two discrete biprimes 14 + 15 = 29, with the first two members of the first such triplet 33 and 34 (or twice 17, the fourth super-prime) respectively the twenty-first and twenty-second composite numbers, and 22 itself the thirteenth composite. (Where also, 58 is the sum of all primes between 2 and 17.) The first triplet is the only triplet in the sequence of consecutive discrete biprimes whose members collectively have prime factorizations that nearly span a set of consecutive prime numbers. 

formula_3 is also semiprime (the second such number formula_4 for formula_5 after 2).

The fifth repdigit is the product between the thirteenth and fifty-eighth primes,
:formula_6
58 is also the smallest integer in decimal whose square root has a simple continued fraction with period 7. It is the fourth Smith number whose sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits in its prime factorization (13).

Given 58, the Mertens function returns formula_7, the fourth such number to do so. The sum of the first three numbers to return zero (2, 39, 40) sum to 81 = 92, which is the fifty-eighth composite number.

<text>59 (fifty-nine) is the natural number following 58 and preceding 60.

==In mathematics==
Fifty-nine is the 17th prime number, and 7th super-prime. The next prime number is sixty-one, with which it comprises a twin prime. 

There are 59 stellations of the regular icosahedron.

==In other fields==
Fifty-nine is:
* The number corresponding to the last minute in a given hour, and the last second in a given minute
** The &quot;59-minute rule&quot; is an informal rule in business, whereby (usually near a holiday) employees may be allowed to leave work early, often to beat heavy holiday traffic (the 59 minutes coming from the rule that leaving one full hour early requires the use of leave, whereas leaving 59 minutes early would not)
* The number of beads on a Roman Catholic rosary (Dominican).
* The number on a button commonly worn by feminist activists in the 1970s; this was based on the claim that a woman earned 59 cents to an equally qualified man&#x27;s dollar

<text>The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, formerly and still informally called the Hotel Vancouver, is a historic hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia. Located along West Georgia Street the hotel is situated within the city&#x27;s Financial District, in Downtown Vancouver. The hotel was designed by two architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. The hotel is currently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.

Opened in May 1939, the Châteauesque-styled building is considered one of Canada&#x27;s grand railway hotels. The hotel stands , and contains 17 floors. It was the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972.

==Location==
Hotel Vancouver sits at 900 West Georgia Street, within the Financial District, the central business district of Downtown Vancouver. The hotel property is bounded by Burrard Street to the northwest, West Georgia Street to the northeast, and Hornby Street to the southeast. To the southwest, the hotel property is bounded by two buildings, including 750 Burrard Street.

The hotel is located close to several attractions in downtown Vancouver. The hotel is situated directly northwest of the Vancouver Art Gallery, as well as Robson Square, a public square adjacent to the art museum. North of the hotel also lies Christ Church Cathedral, the oldest church in the city. The hotel is also situated near two SkyTrain rapid transit stations, Burrard station, and Vancouver City Centre station.

==Design==
===Architecture===

Hotel Vancouver is one of Canada&#x27;s grand railway hotels, initially built by Canadian National Railway. The building was designed by Canadian architects, John Smith Archibald, and John Schofield. Although construction for the hotel began in 1929, its completion would not occur until 1939 as a result of funding issues during Great Depression. The completion of the hotel required a joint investment into the property from Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of Canadian Pacific Railway.

The hotel was a part of series of Chateauesque grand railway hotels built throughout Canada in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Like the other grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver incorporates elements from chateaus found in France&#x27;s Loire Valley. Chateauesque features found on Hotel Vancouver includes its prominent copper pitched roof with dormers, and carved stonework encompassing a steel frame. In addition to chateauesque elements found on most grand railway hotels, Hotel Vancouver also incorporates Renaissance architectural detailings, gargoyles, and relief sculptures. In 1939, a number of artists were commissioned to complete the decorative work for the building, including Olea Marion Davis, Charles Marega, Beatrice Lennie, Valentine Shabief, and Lilias Farley.

Hotel Vancouver stands , containing 17 floors made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the building was completed in 1939, it became the tallest building in Vancouver until the completion of TD Tower in 1972.

===Facilities===

The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver includes 557 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel. Suites at Hotel Vancouver include the &quot;Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Suite&quot; and the &quot;Royal Suite&quot;. The &quot;Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Suite&quot; was designed with Art Deco stylings, and features black walnut veneer-panelled walls.

In 2018, the hotel announced the completion of its four-year renovation project, which saw a reworked main lobby, and guest rooms. The project also restored the 14th floor of the hotel to its original decor from 1939. Restored items on the 14th floor include English harewood doors with bronze doorplates, bronze hallway doors, sapele-panelled walls with bronze strips at its elevator lobby.

In addition to lodgings, the hotel also houses several food-based services, as well as a restaurant, &quot;Notch8 Restaurant + Bar&quot;. The restaurant also hosts the hotel&#x27;s afternoon tea service. Other facilities at the hotel include a gym, swimming pool, and spa.

==History==
Plans to develop a railway hotel at the present site of Hotel Vancouver first emerged in the 1920s, from Canadian Northern Railway. In December 1928 work on the present Hotel Vancouver commenced for Canadian National Railway. Canadian National Railway built the hotel as a result of a land deal between the city, and Canadian Northern Railway, a company later acquired by Canadian National Railway. The land deal required the city to prepare tidal flats on False Creek for the construction of railway yards and Pacific Central Station. In return, the company guaranteed the construction of a large downtown hotel, and make the city the western terminus for its rail network.

Shortly after the erection of the building&#x27;s steel frame however, work on the hotel was halted, as a result of the Great Depression. Work resumed on the building in 1937, and in 1938 Canadian National Railway partnered with Canadian Pacific Railway to complete the new hotel. Work on the hotel was rushed to completion in time for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s 1939 royal tour of Canada. The hotel was the third hotel in the city to use the name &quot;Hotel Vancouver&quot;. The first and second Hotel Vancouver were both located southeast of the present hotel on West Georgia Street. In an effort to prevent competition with the new Hotel Vancouver, Canadian Pacific Railway, closed its hotel operations at the second Hotel Vancouver once the new hotel opened. The second Hotel Vancouver building was torn down in 1949, after Canadian Pacific sold the property to Eaton&#x27;s in December 1948.

During the mid-20th century, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio stations were located within Hotel Vancouver. On 1 May 1940, Dal Richards began his career playing in an 11-piece band and a then-unknown 13-year-old Juliette at the hotel&#x27;s &quot;Panorama Roof Ballroom&quot;, an event space at Hotel Vancouver. Richards became a regular performer for &quot;The Roof,&quot; a CBC Radio show broadcast from the hotel.

In 1962, Canadian National Hotels, a division of Canadian National Railway, acquired Canadian Pacific Hotels&#x27; share of the property, gaining full ownership of the hotel. On January 1, 1964, Hilton Hotels International assumed management of the hotel for CN, though it was never branded as a Hilton. CN Hotels resumed management of the hotel on January 1, 1984, after the management contract with Hilton ended. In 1988 Canadian National Hotels sold its remaining nine properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Canadian Pacific Hotels. 

In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels was reorganized as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. The hotel&#x27;s name was changed to the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver as a part of this re-branding effort. In 2007 Fairmont Hotels and Resorts sold 25 hotel properties, including Hotel Vancouver, to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, although Fairmont continues to manage the hotel. In 2015, the property was sold to Larco Enterprise for C$180 million.

In preparation for the building&#x27;s 80th anniversary, the hotel underwent a C$12 million renovation of the hotel lobby, restaurant, and guest rooms. The renovations took place from 2014 to 2018.

<doc id="399324" wikidata="Q7927193" url="?curid=399324" title="Victorian Certificate of Education">
<text>The Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) is the credential available to secondary school students who successfully complete year 11 and 12 in the Australian state of Victoria as well as in some international schools in China, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. 

About 67% of all 19-year-olds in Victoria had completed the VCE in 2020.

Study for the VCE is usually completed over two years, but can be spread over a longer period in some cases. 

The VCE was established as a pilot project in 1987. The earlier Higher School Certificate (HSC) was abolished in 1992.

Delivery of the VCE Vocational Major, an &quot;applied learning&quot; program within the VCE, began in 2023.

==Structure==
The Victorian Certificate of Education is generally taught in years 11 and 12 of secondary education in Victoria; but some students are able to start their VCE studies in year 10 or earlier if the school or institution allows it.

All VCE studies are organised into units. VCE subjects typically consist of four units with each unit covering one semester of study. Each unit comprises a set number of outcomes (usually two or three); an outcome describes the knowledge and skills that a student should demonstrate by the time the student has completed the unit. Subject choice depends on each individual school. Units 3/4 of a subject must be studied in sequential order, whereas units 1/2 can be mixed and matched. Students are not required to complete all the units of a subject as part of the VCE course, meaning they are able to change subject choice between years 11 and 12.

On completing a unit, a student receives either a &#x27;satisfactory&#x27; (S) or &#x27;non-satisfactory&#x27; (N) result. If a student does not intend to receive an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR), a &#x27;satisfactory&#x27; result is all that is required to graduate with the VCE.

To gain an ATAR a student must satisfactorily complete three units of any subject in the English field (at least one English field subject is compulsory) and twelve units in any other subjects.

===Assessment===
VCE studies are assessed both internally (in school) and externally (through the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA). During units 1/2 all assessment is internal, while in units 3/4 assessment is conducted both internally and externally.

VCE Vocational Major units are only assessed internally.

====Internal assessment====
Internal assessment is conducted via &quot;school assessed coursework&quot; (SACs) and &quot;school assessed tasks&quot; (SATs).

&quot;School assessed coursework&quot; (SACs) are the primary avenue of internal assessment, with assessment in every VCE study consisting of at least one SAC. SACs are tasks that are written by the school and must be done primarily in class time; they can include essays, reports, tests, and case studies. Some studies in the visual arts and technology areas are also assessed via &quot;school assessed tasks&quot; (SATs). SATs are generally practical tasks that are examined in school. Both SACs and SATs are scaled by VCAA against external assessment; this is to eliminate any cheating or variances in task difficulty.

====External assessment====
External assessment is conducted in the form of examinations set by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority for units 3/4 studies. As of 2013, only the General Achievement Test (GAT) will be examined in June, with all subjects now only having one external assessment with the exceptions of mathematics subjects, LOTE studies, which consist of both a written and oral external test, performance studies, which consist of both a written external test and a performance, and Extended Investigations, which consist of an oral presentation and a Critical Thinking Test. All examinations except the Critical Thinking Test for Extended Investigation and the GAT are held in late October and most of November.

Subjects in the LOTE field (languages other than English) are also assessed in the form of oral examinations. Subjects in the Dance, Drama/Theatre Studies and Music fields, as well as Extended Investigations, are assessed by a performance for a VCAA panel of examiners as part of their external assessment. All performance-based external assessments (Oral Examinations and Music Performances) are typically held in early October.

====General Achievement Test (GAT)====

The GAT is an essential part of VCE external assessment. It provides the basis for a quality assurance check on the marking of examinations, and for deriving an indicative study score if the student misses the external assessment with a valid reason. All students who are enrolled in a VCE units 3/4 study are required to sit some or all of the GAT, including students completing the VCE Vocational Major.

===Scoring===

====Study scores====

Students will be eligible for a study score of between 0 and 50 if they have completed at least two Graded Assessments, and have satisfactorily completed both units 3/4 of a VCE study. Study scores are calculated by VCAA, and indicate a student&#x27;s performance in relation to all other students who undertook that study.

Study scores are calculated by combining the standardised scores for each Graded Assessment with specific percentages, then ranked against all students in the subject according to a normal distribution, where the mean is 30 and the standard deviation is 7, with most study scores falling between 23 and 37. For studies with many enrolments (1000 or more), a study score of 40 or more places a student in the top 9% of all students in that subject.

If a student is ill or affected by other personal circumstances during an external assessment, and whose result is unlikely to be a fair or accurate demonstration of their learning or achievement, they may apply for a derived examination score (DES). Long-term illness or other ongoing conditions that have been present over the year are not eligible for a DES. Students will need to supply independent evidence to apply for a DES, and will be examined case by case by VCAA. The derived score is calculated statistically from the student&#x27;s other assessments, including school-based assessments, GAT scores, other external assessment scores (if available) and grades provided by the school.

====Scaling====
Scaling is the process that adjusts VCE study scores into ATAR subject scores. The Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) adjusts all VCE study scores to equalise results between studies with stronger cohorts, and those with weaker ones. Contrary to common perception, scaling is not based on the difficulty of the subject, as each study score is in fact a ranking. The score adjustment ensures that in those subjects where it is easier to overtake the cohort, the score is adjusted downward, while in subjects where it is difficult to score highly, it is moved upwards. This makes sure obtaining the average score in one study required the same level of achievement as every other study.

Mathematics subjects and language subjects have additional scaling rules. In mathematics subjects (General Mathematics, Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics), all three studies are scaled against each other in addition to being scaled against all other studies, then the higher of the two scaling scores will then be used. This is due to mathematics having a distinct hierarchy of studies with varying difficulties, so students studying the harder subjects will not be disadvantaged by the level of difficulty. In LOTE (Languages Other Than English) subjects, study scores are adjusted by adding up to five to the initial scaled study score average. This adjustment is different for each subject and score, and decreases as the study score moves away from 30.

====ATAR====

====Unscored VCE====
It is possible for students to complete an unscored VCE. Under this option, students complete the VCE course but do not sit final exams and are not given an ATAR. The number of students completing an unscored VCE has increased every year since 2015, with 8.3% of VCE students completing an unscored VCE in 2020.

===Studies===
VCE studies refer to the various subjects available to students to contribute to their successful completion of the qualification. There are currently 128 VCE studies, ranging from diverse fields such as the humanities, science, technology and mathematics. Studies are also permitted to study one or more VCE VET programs, vocational education-based subjects which contribute to the completion of the VCE, while also resulting in a nationally recognised VET qualification.

Although a student may choose to study any VCE subject in theory, this is dependent on availability of the specified study at the student&#x27;s school. Certain schools do not offer certain studies, and as a result, students may pick alternate ones, or choose to study a particular subject through an external institution such as Virtual School Victoria (formerly Distance Education Centre Victoria).

To be awarded the VCE, a student must successfully complete at least:
* 3 units of an English subject, with two of those being units 3 and 4
* Three additional Unit 3/4 sequences 
* Pass with a satisfactory of at least 16 units out of the normal 20–24 units

This therefore means that a student must study at least four subjects to be awarded the VCE. Selection of studies depends on other factors as well, such as prerequisites for university courses.

The following is a list of all VCE studies available: 


There are also University Extension studies available for high-achieving students. These subjects are carried out through multiple universities, including The University of Melbourne, Swinburne University and Deakin University. Monash University formerly offered extension subjects, but cancelled the program in 2019.

== Controversies ==

=== 2011 English exam ===
The 2011 English exam contained a column about tattoos attributed to &quot;part-time journalist and blogger Helen Day&quot;, who wrote for the fictional &quot;Street Beat&quot; blog. &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper accused VCAA of plagiarism and breach of copyright as the column was very similar to an opinion piece featured in the newspaper&#x27;s 23 September 2010 edition, written by Melbourne writer Helen Razer. The newspaper called the exam&#x27;s column &quot;clumsily edited&quot;.

=== 2012 History: Revolutions exam ===
In 2012, the &quot;History: Revolutions&quot; exam was meant to include a picture of Nikolai Kochergin&#x27;s artwork &quot;Storming the Winter Palace on 25th October 1917&quot;, depicting the events of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. Instead, a doctored picture was used in the exam, in which a large robot had been edited in to the background of the scene. (Said robot was a &quot;Marauder&quot; from BattleTech, a science fiction setting in which a fictional 28th century general named &#x27;Aleksandr Kerensky&#x27; like the nonfictional October Revolution leader played an important role during a pivotal coup and civil war.) A VCAA spokesperson admitted that the image was &quot;sourced and acknowledged by the VCAA as coming from the Internet&quot;, and new internal guidelines were issued for using internet-sourced content in exams. Of the 5,738 students that sat the exam, 2,379 chose the Russia section, of which 130 received an adjusted score.
=== 2016 Early Release of results ===
In 2016, a computer error allowed for 2075 students (approximately 2.5% of VCE candidates) to receive their ATAR score and VCE results five days earlier than they were supposed to be announced. External SMS provider for VCAA and the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC), Salmat Digital, created an error that enabled students to receive their results before the expected release date by texting VCAA. Suzanne Connelly, a spokeswoman for VTAC and VCAA, apologised on behalf of all agencies involved.

This sparked outrage from parents of students who did not receive their scores, considering it as &quot;unfair&quot;. Students who were able to receive their results also questioned its legitimacy and reliability. The VCAA and VTAC acted to contact affected students and their schools to reassure them regarding the accidental early results release. The release of the remaining 97.5% of results took place without further issue at the planned time. Education Minister James Merlino ordered an investigation into the situation, which had compromised results that are normally closely guarded until the official release.

=== 2018 English exam ===
The 2018 English exam included an article in which fictional writer Jonty Jenkins scathingly attacked a café franchise named &quot;Calmer Coffee&quot; opening in his local town, criticising its unfriendly staff and unwelcoming ambience that he described as &quot;an assault on the senses&quot;. After the exam completed, students discovered that a real &quot;Calmer Cafe&quot; existed in Aberfeldie, a suburb just north-west of Melbourne. The café&#x27;s manager, Elise Jenkins, shares the same surname as the exam question&#x27;s fictional writer. Within hours, the café received over 100 negative reviews on Google Maps from Year 12 students, bringing down its rating from nearly 5 stars to as low as 3.3. Google Maps temporarily removed the café from search results, and later reinstated it but kept reviews inaccessible. At the time, the café had 405 reviews.

The next day, Tara Conron, owner of the cafe, told &quot;The Age&quot; she had hired a lawyer and would be pursuing legal action against VCAA for &quot;uncanny&quot; similarities between the exam and the actual cafe. Conron noted the identical surnames of Jenkins, stated that she employs someone with a &quot;man bun&quot;, as does the employer in the exam article, and both the fictional and actual cafe &quot;stand out&quot; in their respective suburbs.

A year later, it was reported that Conron was no longer pursuing legal action against VCAA, telling &quot;The Age&quot; that the café staff had placed the matter behind them, and saying &quot;we’ve just loved to joke about it this year&quot;.

=== 2022 Specialist Mathematics Exam 2===
On 11 November 2022 &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper published an article (&quot;For some, this VCE maths exam didn&#x27;t add up&quot;) alleging errors on the 2022 Specialist Mathematics Exam 2 that included:

Section A Question 4: No correct answer (because the values of a and c can be any real number),

Section A Question 19: No correct answer (because confidence intervals are calculated for unknown population means, not for sample means),

Section B: Question 6 part (f) (the question cannot be answered because the relevant random variables are not stated to be independent).

The Examination Report published by the VCAA for this Exam makes no acknowledgement of these alleged errors. The answers used by the VCAA to mark this exam are not available to the public. It is reasonable to assume they are the same as the answers given in the Examination Report.

The alleged errors in this exam (as well as an alleged error in the marking scheme used for 2022 Specialist Mathematics Exam 1 Question 3 part (b)) form part of a public submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry into the state of education in Victoria (Parliamentary Inquiry submission 32). The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; has reported on this submission (&quot;Herald-Sun&quot; 7 September 2023 front page and page 7 &quot;Maths exams don&#x27;t add up&quot;) (Mistake-riddled VCE exams robbing students) and it received further media coverage on &quot;Sky News Australia&quot; (VCE maths exams riddled with errors for decades, expert claims). A supplement (32.3) to the aforementioned submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry includes a detailed mathematical rebuttal of the VCAA&#x27;s claims that the &quot;questions did not present errors&quot; (&quot;Herald-Sun&quot; 7 September 2023 page 7 &quot;Maths exams don&#x27;t add up&quot;).

An open letter to the Victorian Education Minister signed by nearly 70 University mathematicians states that these questions &quot;are unacceptably flawed. Each question exhibits some fundamental misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the underlying mathematics.&quot;

A report into the VCAA&#x27;s VCE examination setting policies, processes and procedures (commissioned by the Education Minister Ben Carroll) by the former head of the NSW Education Standards Authority, Dr John Bennett, was handed to the Victorian government in March 2024 and made public on 23 March 2024. The Bennett Report substantiated the allegations of significant and serious errors in the 2022 Specialist Mathematics exams. This contradicted previous claims by the VCAA and an earlier review (commissioned by the VCAA) by Deloitte that there were no serious errors in these exams. The Department of Education has not yet released the review by Deloitte, which is currently the subject of several Freedom of Information requests and appeals of a decision to refuse access.

The Bennett Report makes 6 high-level recommendations, each with associated actions. One of the recommendations is that the VCAA work with mathematics and science academics when drafting and proofreading exams, to improve quality control before the tests end up on students&#x27; desks. Education Minister Ben Carroll has stated that all the recommendations of the Bennett Report will be accepted.

On 2 May 2024 the VCAA published amended copies of the Specialist Mathematics Examinations 1 and 2 and examination reports. Four questions containing serious mathematical errors (which the VCAA had previously denied existed on multiple occasions) were redacted. An amended copy of the 2022 Mathematical Methods Exam 2 and Examination Report was also published, with the redaction of a question containing a serious mathematical error.

The VCAA has made no official comment on the &#x27;human cost&#x27; of these exam errors and whether teachers and academics who were ignored when they repeatedly alerted the VCAA of these errors should now receive an apology. The VCAA has not said what it has done to identify and compensate students who may have been disadvantaged (for example, by missing out on scholarships, Premier&#x27;s Awards, or a higher University offer) by these errors and the incorrect grading of these exams as a result of the errors.

==== Allegations of other mathematical errors ====
The public submission (Parliamentary Inquiry) also alleges errors on many other VCE mathematics exams over a twenty year period (reported in the &quot;Herald-Sun&quot; 7 September 2023 front page and page 7 &quot;Maths exams don&#x27;t add up&quot;) (Mistake-riddled VCE exams robbing students)), including:

1. 2016 Mathematical Methods Exam 2 Section B Question 3 part (h) where a function is incorrectly claimed to be a probability density function (pdf). An amended Examination Report (2016 Mathematical Methods Exam 2 Report) acknowledges that the function was not a pdf but does not admit an error and does not explain why, contrary to the instruction in the exam question, &quot;Answers that were correct to the nearest integer were accepted&quot;.

2. Northern Hemisphere Timetable 2021 Mathematical Methods Exam 2 Section A Question 8, for which there is no correct answer. The original Examination Report (no longer publicly available) stated Option D as the correct answer. This answer is deleted in an amended Examination Report (2021 Mathematical Methods Exam 2 Report). No answer is stated and no explanation is given for why no answer is stated. 
Question 4 from an official 2010 VCAA document (Mathematical Methods Sample Questions) contains the same error. It is reasonable to assume that this document is the source of the 2021 exam error. There is no evidence that the VCAA has ever alerted teachers to the error in this document.

Mathematician, educator and author Marty Ross has extensively documented and discussed many alleged VCE Mathematical Methods Exam errors and VCE Specialist Mathematics Exam errors.

=== 2022 Geography exam ===
On 8 September 2023 the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper published an article about colour blind students being given red-green scaled maps in the 2022 Geography Exam (&quot;Herald-Sun&quot; 8 September 2023 page 11 &quot;Students see red ... or not&quot;) (Colour blind students forgotten in VCE Geography exam).

=== 2023 exam errors===
==== 2023 General Mathematics Exam 2 ====
It was reported in The &quot;Western Australian&quot; (31 October 2023 &quot;Investigation ordered after maths exam doesn’t add up&quot;) that the

&quot;VCAA has launched an investigation after typographical errors appeared in Monday&#x27;s second general maths exam. One error was picked up after printing, with students instructed to amend the paper. But the second error in a matrix-related question [(Q9d)] was not spotted until after the exam.&quot;

In an &quot;ABC Radio Melbourne&quot; interview between Rafael Epstein and an exam invigilator, it was claimed by the invigilator that the initial VCAA instruction for fixing the first error was unclear and potentially wrong.

It was reported in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; (31 October 2023 &quot;Investigation into VCE exam errors as students left in tears&quot;) that

&quot;A spokesman for the Department of Education admitted the two errors ...
&quot;The VCAA will conduct further analysis to investigate how this error appeared in the exam, and will ensure that no student’s score is unfairly impacted because of this mistake, and apologises for undue stress this has caused&quot;
... Education minister Ben Carroll [said] it’s “unacceptable” the maths exam contained two mistakes and ordered an investigation into the latest VCE testing bungle.” The Minister unreservedly apologised and said that &quot;he had spoken with the chief of the VCAA and ordered an immediate investigation&quot;.

It was reported in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; (1 November 2023 “VCE maths students awarded bonus mark for exam errors”) that the VCAA decided to &quot;... award all students who attempted the exam a correct score for the [matrix-related] question&quot; (Q9d) that contained the error.

==== 2023 Mathematical Methods Exam 2 ====
It was reported in The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; (3 November 2023 &quot;VCE test can&#x27;t go the distance&quot; and 6 November 2023 &quot;Teachers at sixes and sevens over exam errors&quot;) that the Mathematical Methods Exam 2 contained multiple errors and a question recycled from a previous exam. One of the errors was picked up after printing, with students instructed to amend the paper (replacing the letter &quot;m&quot; with the word &quot;meters&quot; in the phrase &quot;m per second&quot; that proceeded a mathematical formula). But the other errors (including missing words that left questions under-specified) were not spotted until after the exam. These errors (as well as many other errors from other 2023 VCAA mathematics exams) have been listed by teachers.

==== 2023 Specialist Mathematics Exam 2 ====
It was reported in The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; (7 November 2023 &quot;Maths test fails add up - Latest mistake the 7th error in 2023&quot;) that the curves in the diagram for Section B Question 6 part (h) were not correctly labelled. This error was acknowledged by the VCAA which 
decided to &quot;... award all students who attempted the exam a correct score&quot; for that question (&quot;Herald Sun&quot; 8 November 2023 &quot;Maths fail a plus for students&quot;).

This error, as well as errors on the 2022 Specialist Mathematics exams, were discussed in an &quot;ABC Radio Melbourne&quot; interview between Rafael Epstein and Monash University mathematician Professor Burkard Polster (8 November 2023). During this interview Professor Polster disclosed that he had offered to proof read the VCE mathematics exams for free but the VCAA had declined his offer. He also explained why giving every student 1 mark for this question is not actually fair.

==== 2023 Chemistry exam ====
It has been reported that the 2023 Chemistry exam contained an error. The &quot;error was in a question about the composition of coconut oil, which had listed the formula for linolenic acid rather than linoleic acid, as intended.&quot;

==== 2023 Chinese Second Language Advanced (SLA) exam ====
The &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (ABC) reported that two high schools gave Chinese language students the wrong exam paper. Some students who were meant to take the Chinese Second Language Advanced (SLA) exam were given the paper for the Chinese as a Second Language (SL) exam, which is at a significantly easier level and which was due to be held the following Wednesday. The ABC reported that &quot;students affected have been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to not share details of the exam before November 16. However, several insiders with knowledge of the exam have confirmed that at least one of the essay questions and details of some listening exercises have already been leaked online and are being circulated on Reddit and Chinese social media sites.&quot; Several affected students and parents were forced to decline commenting on the error because of the confidentiality agreement.

The VCAA’s response to this mistake has been criticised by VCE Chinese teachers, who told the ABC that &quot;it was the “basic responsibility” of the VCAA staff who were supervising the exam to check everything was correct. There are supposed to be “clear tags” to classify each exam paper. The fact that more than one school gave the wrong exam paper shows it&#x27;s not an individual mistake, [it shows] the VCAA didn&#x27;t provide adequate training for supervisors.&quot;

Sources to the ABC have said that &quot;when one of the students flagged with a supervisor that they received the wrong paper, the supervisor told them it was &quot;impossible&quot; and to &quot;continue with the exam&quot;&quot;.

The education minister, Ben Carroll, subsequently confirmed that six students were incorrectly given the SL exam. He labelled it &quot;a “traumatic” experience for those who were affected.&quot; He said that &quot;the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority [has] been asked to complete a full investigation into the incident.&quot; The Minister also said that academics had approached him about the VCE exams in general and that he has asked &quot;the VCAA to partner with academic institutions in the writing, designing and vetting of exams.&quot;

==== 2023 Chinese as a Second Language (SL) exam ====
It was reported in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; that students sitting the Chinese as a Second Language (SL) exam were instructed by supervisors to cross out a question, remove all subsequent references to it and to write on another topic (&quot;Herald-Sun&quot; 16 November 2023 page 3 &quot;Students rewrite exam after leak&quot;). This paper had been accidentally given to some students in the previous week instead of the Chinese Second Language Advanced (SLA) paper.

The &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (ABC) reported that some students also experienced problems with an audio component of the exam. Students were required to read a text prompt which was to be followed by an audio component. However, the audio component (required to answer several questions) failed to play for some students. This led to some students being unable to complete several questions worth 10 out of the exam&#x27;s 75 marks. Furthermore, the text prompt associated with the missing audio was among the details that had been revealed on social media.

=== 2024 exam leaks ===
On 14 November, it was reported in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; that the contents of a number of exams had been inadvertently leaked by the VCAA. Prior to 10 October, the cover pages made available on the VCAA&#x27;s examination materials webpage contained hidden text that revealed the contents of affected exams. In many cases, the changes made between the leaked and the actual examination were considered trivial, with one teacher who spoke to the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (ABC) &quot;flabbergasted that the CEO of VCAA could say that the questions were different&quot;; at the heart of this controversy is that the VCAA was aware that examinations had been leaked, and yet had failed to properly rewrite examinations such that the leaked contents were sufficiently dissimilar so as not to advantage those who had seen the leaked contents over those who had not. On 17 November, when approached by the &quot;Sunday Herald Sun&quot;, VCAA stated they &quot;sincerely [apologise] for these errors&quot; and &quot;are working to ensure every student is assessed fairly&quot;, although they have yet to issue an official apology.

As of 18 November, 56 exams are known to have been affected.

On 18 November, Kylie White, the then chief executive of the VCAA, resigned from her role, with Marcia Devlin, the chief executive of the Victorian Academy of Teaching and Leadership, taking over in the interim. Additionally, the VCAA released information surrounding how they will manage the 2024 examination leaks, having stated that they will be using an &quot;anomalous grade check process&quot;, which was previously used during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to &quot;ensure student results are fair and equitable&quot;; this will be applied for all VCE examinations, except General Mathematics Examination 1 and the Music Composition and Music Inquiry externally assessed tasks.

== Schools ==
The VCE is offered at all Victorian secondary schools. The VCE Vocational Major is a vocational and applied learning program within the VCE and is also offered at many government and non-government schools Victoria-wide.

Students who cannot complete a VCE course at their regular school for certain reasons (i.e timetable clashes, subject is not being offered in the students&#x27; regular school) are eligible to apply to Virtual School Victoria and complete up to two VCE units online.

Additionally, students interested in a LOTE are able to enrol in the Victorian School of Languages if they meet similar enrolment requirements to VSV.

<doc id="399328" wikidata="Q191222" url="?curid=399328" title="Cassiterite">
<text>Cassiterite is a tin oxide mineral, SnO2. It is generally opaque, but it is translucent in thin crystals. Its luster and multiple crystal faces produce a desirable gem. Cassiterite was the chief tin ore throughout ancient history and remains the most important source of tin today.

==Occurrence==

Most sources of cassiterite today are found in alluvial or placer deposits containing the weathering-resistant grains. The best sources of primary cassiterite are found in the tin mines of Bolivia, where it is found in crystallised hydrothermal veins. Rwanda has a nascent cassiterite mining industry. Fighting over cassiterite deposits (particularly in Walikale) is a major cause of the conflict waged in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This has led to cassiterite being considered a conflict mineral.

Cassiterite is a widespread minor constituent of igneous rocks. The Bolivian veins and the 4500 year old workings of Cornwall and Devon, England, are concentrated in high temperature quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. The veins commonly contain tourmaline, topaz, fluorite, apatite, wolframite, molybdenite, and arsenopyrite. The mineral occurs extensively in Cornwall as surface deposits on Bodmin Moor, for example, where there are extensive traces of a hydraulic mining method known as &quot;streaming&quot;. The current major tin production comes from placer or alluvial deposits in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maakhir region of Somalia, and Russia. Hydraulic mining methods are used to concentrate mined ore, a process which relies on the high specific gravity of the SnO2 ore, of about 7.0.

==Crystallography==
Crystal twinning is common in cassiterite and most aggregate specimens show crystal twins. The typical twin is bent at a near-60-degree angle, forming an &quot;elbow twin&quot;. Botryoidal or reniform cassiterite is called &quot;wood tin&quot;.

Cassiterite is also used as a gemstone and collector specimens when quality crystals are found.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the Greek κασσίτερος (&quot;transliterated as &quot;kassiteros&quot;)&quot; for &quot;tin&quot;. Early references to κασσίτερος can be found in Homer&#x27;s Iliad, such as in the description the Shield of Achillies. For example, the passage in book 18 chapter 610: αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ τεῦξε σάκος μέγα τε στιβαρόν τε,

610τεῦξ᾽ ἄρα οἱ θώρηκα φαεινότερον πυρὸς αὐγῆς,

τεῦξε δέ οἱ κόρυθα βριαρὴν κροτάφοις ἀραρυῖαν

καλὴν δαιδαλέην, ἐπὶ δὲ χρύσεον λόφον ἧκε,

τεῦξε δέ οἱ κνημῖδας ἑανοῦ κασσιτέροιο.Translated as: then wrought he for him a corselet brighter than the blaze of fire, and he wrought for him a heavy helmet, fitted to his temples, a fair helm, richly-dight, and set thereon a crest of gold; and he wrought him greaves of pliant tin. But when the glorious god of the two strong arms had fashioned all the armourLiddell-Scott-Jones suggest the etymology to be originally Elamite; citing the Babylonian kassi-tira, hence the sanskrit kastīram. However the Akkadian word (the lingua franca of the Ancient Near East, including Babylonia) for tin was &quot;anna-ku&quot; (cuneiform: 𒀭𒈾). Roman Ghirshman (1954) suggests, from the region of the Kassites, an ancient people in west and central Iran; a view also taken by J D Muhly. There are relatively few words in Ancient Greek at begin with &quot;κασσ-&quot;; suggesting that it is an ethnonym. Attempts at understanding the etymology of the word were made in antiquity, such as Pliny the Elder in his Historia Naturalis (book 34 chapter 37.1):&quot;White lead (tin) is the most valuable; the Greeks applied to it the name cassheros&quot;.

And Stephanus of Byzantium in his &quot;Ethnica&quot; states: &quot;Κασσίτερα νησοσ εν τω Ωκεανω, τη Ίνδικη προσεχης, ως Διονυσιοσ εν Βασσαρικοισ. Εξ ης ο κασσίτερος.&quot;Which can be translated as: &quot;Kassitera, an island in the ocean, neighbouring India, as Dionysius states in the Bassarika. From there comes tin.&quot;

== Use ==
It may be primarily used as a raw material for tin extraction and smelting.

<text>Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP and Affiliates (typically shortened to Skadden) is an American multinational law firm headquartered in New York City. The firm comprises approximately 1,700 lawyers and is the fifth highest grossing law firm worldwide.

==History==

The firm was founded in 1948 in New York by Marshall Skadden, John Slate, and Les Arps. Joseph Flom was hired the same year as the firm&#x27;s first associate. In 1959, William R. Meagher joined the firm and Elizabeth Head, the firm&#x27;s first female attorney, was hired. In 1960, the firm&#x27;s name became Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. In 1961, Peter Mullen, who later served as Skadden&#x27;s first executive partner, joined the firm.

In 1973, the firm opened its second office in Boston. In 1981, Peggy L. Kerr became Skadden&#x27;s first female partner. In 1985, Skadden was ranked as one of the three largest law firms in the United States.

In 1987, the firm opened its first international office in Tokyo. In 1988, the Skadden Fellowship Foundation was created. In 2008, together with the City College of New York, Skadden launched the Skadden, Arps Honors Program with the goal of increasing diversity in law schools and the legal profession. , Skadden has 21 offices worldwide.

In November 2023, amid a wave of antisemitic incidents at elite U.S. law schools, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom was among a group of major law firms who sent a letter to top law school deans warning them that an escalation in incidents targeting Jewish students would have corporate hiring consequences. The letter said &quot;We look to you to ensure your students who hope to join our firms after graduation are prepared to be an active part of workplace communities that have zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment, much less the kind that has been taking place on some law school campuses.&quot;

==Key people==
Unlike some firms that have introduced two-tier partnerships with equity and non-equity partners, Skadden maintains a one-tier partnership, in which all partners are equity partners and share ownership of the firm. The firm has 334 partners worldwide. Notable partners include:

*Stephen C. Robinson, former federal district court judge sitting in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY; former U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut
*Patrick B. Fitzgerald, former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; as special counsel for the Department of Justice, the federal prosecutor in charge of the investigation of the Valerie Plame Affair
*Fred T. Goldberg, Jr., commissioner of Internal Revenue (1989–92), assistant secretary for tax policy in the Department of the Treasury in 1992
*Mark N. Kaplan, former CEO of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Engelhard
*Michael Leiter, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center

==Rankings==

In 2015 and 2016, Skadden was the fourth largest law firm in the U.S. by revenue. In the 2015 Global 100 survey by &quot;The American Lawyer&quot;, Skadden ranked as the fourth-highest grossing law firm in the world. In 2016, Skadden had approximately 1,700 attorneys in 22 offices; in 2011, the firm had approximately 1,900 attorneys in 23 offices. Measured by the number of attorneys, Skadden is the fifth largest law firm in New York and 12th largest in the United States. In 2016, Skadden was 187th on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of America&#x27;s Largest Private Companies by revenue. Previously, the firm ranked 335th in 1995, 194th in 2003 and 213th in 2010. In 2015, Skadden became the first law firm ever to handle more than $1 trillion in M&amp;A deals in a single year and, for the third time in six years, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;″ &quot;Innovative Lawyers&quot; report named Skadden the most innovative law firm in North America.

==Other work==

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
Skadden has a history of representing clients with ties to the Vladimir Putin regime in Russia, such as Alfa Bank, Roman Abramovich, and Viktor F. Yanukovych&#x27;s pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. In 2020, the firm paid a $4.6 million settlement for misleading U.S. authorities regarding its lobbying on behalf of a Russia-aligned Ukrainian government.

In 2012, Skadden took as a client Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was a pro-Russian president of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. Paul Manafort helped arrange for the hiring of Skadden. One of company&#x27;s actions on Yanukovych&#x27;s behalf was to produce a report justifying Yanukovych&#x27;s imprisonment of former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko (who was pro-European) and denying that the action had been a political prosecution, although many Western countries characterized it as such. Later that year a team of American lawyers commissioned by the government of Ukraine concluded that Tymoshenko&#x27;s trial had not been fair and her rights had been violated. After Yanukovych lost power in Euromaidan and fled to Russia, Skadden&#x27;s work on his behalf led to several federal investigations. One Skadden attorney, Alex van der Zwaan, was convicted of lying to the FBI about his work on Yanukovych&#x27;s behalf and served 30 days in jail. In 2019, Skadden lawyer Gregory B. Craig was indicted on charges of lying to federal prosecutors about the work he did at Skadden on behalf of the Yanukovych, but was acquitted in a jury trial. 

Tymoshenko made plans to sue Skadden, and in May 2020 it was revealed that Skadden had paid at least $11 million to settle the case before a lawsuit could be filed.

Skadden, along with Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group, was investigated by the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for possible lobbying violations regarding former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In 2019, Skadden agreed to pay a $4.6 million settlement to the Department of Justice over the firm&#x27;s failure to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agent Registrations Act.

Skadden has been involved in representing Russian groups in corporate deals worth around $90 billion. Skadden has represented Alfa Bank, a Russian bank closely associated with Russian oligarchs and the Vladimir Putin regime. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and amid heavy sanctions against Alfa Bank, Skadden said it was &quot;in the process of ending our representations of Alfa Bank.&quot; Skadden has a long-standing relationship with Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich – Skadden refused to say whether it still represented him in 2022.

===Political contributions===
As a group, Skadden partners and employees have contributed more to Democratic political candidates than to Republicans. Prominent lawyers at the firm endorsed and financially supported John Kerry in his campaign to become president of the United States in 2004. In the run-up to Super Tuesday 2008, Skadden hosted a phone bank in support of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

According to OpenSecrets, Skadden was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating $1.98 million, 76% to Democrats. From 1990 through 2008, Skadden contributed $11.93 million to federal campaigns; between 2000 and 2008 the firm spent $2.2 million on lobbying.

<doc id="399334" wikidata="Q6565561" url="?curid=399334" title="List of California state prisons">
<text>This is a list of state prisons in California operated by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). CDCR operates 34 adult prisons in California, with a design capacity of 85,083 incarcerated people. CDCR both owns and operates 34 of the state prisons; it additionally operates California City Correctional Facility, a prison leased from CoreCivic.

CDCR operates a variety of other incarceration facilities, including fire camps and California Division of Juvenile Justice facilities. For more information on the totality of jurisdictions and facilities involved in incarceration in California, see Incarceration in California. For more information on the history, conditions, and demographics of California&#x27;s prison system specifically, see Prisons in California.

== Facilities ==
Reception centers house incarcerate people incoming to the state prison system while they complete an evaluation and receive a custody score. After that, they may be transferred to another prison for longer-term confinement.

While all facilities have some level of education, treatment, and pre-release programs, reentry hubs provide specific reentry support to incarcerated people within 4 years of release, including cognitive behavioral therapy, job search skills, and financial literacy.

== Retired facilities ==
=== Prisons in California ===
* Eagle Mountain Community Correctional Facility, Eagle Mountain, California (owned and operated by Management and Training Corporation, closed in 2003)
* Deuel Vocational Institution, San Joaquin County, California, (closed in 2021)
*California Correctional Center, Lassen County, California, (closed March 30, 2023)

===Out of State Facilities===
In an effort to relieve California prison overcrowding that peaked in 2006, CDCR began housing California prisoners in prisons in other states. In 2009, CDCR began to phase out its use of out-of-state facilities, and it stopped incarcerating people in out-of-state facilities in 2019. The facilities were:

* West Tennessee Detention Facility, Tennessee (owned and operated by CoreCivic, exited in March 2009)
* North Lake Correctional Facility, Michigan (owned and operated by Geo Group, operated by the Michigan Department of Corrections, exited October 2011)
* Red Rock Correctional Center, Arizona (owned by CoreCivic, operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections, exited in October 2013)
* North Fork Correctional Facility, Oklahoma (owned by CoreCivic, operated by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, exited in November 2015)
* Florence Correctional Facility, Arizona (owned and operated by CoreCivic, exited in Feb. 2016)
* Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, Mississippi (owned and operated by CoreCivic, exited in July 2018) 
* La Palma Correctional Facility, Arizona (owned and operated by CoreCivic, exited in June 2019)

<text>Richard Allen York (September 4, 1928 – February 20, 1992) was an American actor. He was the first actor to play Darrin Stephens on the ABC fantasy sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;. He played teacher Bertram Cates in the film &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960). 

York&#x27;s career was hampered by a serious back injury he sustained while working on the film &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; in 1959. Although his role in &quot;Bewitched&quot; was a success, he left the series in 1969 after a further decline in his physical health, and rarely acted thereafter.

==Early life==
York was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Bernard York, a salesman, and Betty, a seamstress. He grew up in Chicago, where a Catholic nun first recognized his vocal promise. He began his career at the age of 15 as the star of the CBS radio program &quot;That Brewster Boy&quot;. He also appeared in hundreds of other radio shows and instructional films before heading to New York City, where he acted on Broadway in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. He performed with stars including Paul Muni and Joanne Woodward in live television broadcasts and with Janet Leigh, Jack Lemmon, and Glenn Ford in movies, including &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; and &quot;Cowboy&quot;.

While filming the movie &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; (1959) with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth, he suffered a permanent, disabling back injury. In York&#x27;s own words, &quot;Gary Cooper and I were propelling a handcar carrying several &#x27;wounded&#x27; men down [the] railroad track. I was on the bottom stroke of this sort of teeter-totter mechanism that made the handcar run. I was just lifting the handle up as the director yelled &#x27;cut!&#x27; and one of the &#x27;wounded&#x27; cast members reached up and grabbed the handle. Now, instead of lifting the expected weight, I was suddenly, jarringly, lifting his entire weight off the flatbed180 pounds or so. The muscles along the right side of my back tore. They just snapped and let loose. And that was the start of it all.&quot; This left him in debilitating pain that lead to him being unable to continue working on &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

York&#x27;s injury did not immediately end his career. In 1960, a year after York&#x27;s injury, he played Bertram Cates (modeled on John Thomas Scopes, of &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; fame) in the film version of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;.

York went on to star with Gene Kelly and Leo G. Carroll in the ABC comedy-drama &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1962). York was cast in the series, which lasted one season, as Tom Colwell, who operates a secular youth center.

York appeared in dozens of episodes of now-classic television series, including &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone, The Virginian,&quot; and &quot;Route 66&quot;.

==&quot;Bewitched&quot;==

In 1964, York began playing Darrin Stephens in the sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot; as Samantha&#x27;s (Elizabeth Montgomery) mortal husband. The show was a huge success and York was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1968.

The crew built York a slanted wall on which he could lean between scenes; during the first two seasons, this allowed York to manage his back injury with little difficulty. Halfway through the third season, York&#x27;s back injury was aggravated into a painful degenerative spine condition, frequently causing shooting delays while he required assistance to walk. Because York would sometimes be seized with debilitating pain, the scripts for some of his later &quot;Bewitched&quot; episodes were written and staged such that his character would be in bed or on the couch for the entire episode. York did not appear in several third- and fourth-season episodes, and his eventual departure from the show well into the filming of the fifth season necessitated more episodes focusing on Samantha and other members of her family, with mentions that Darrin was away on business. 

While filming the fifth-season episode &quot;Daddy Does His Thing&quot;, York fell ill: &quot;I was too sick to go on. I had a temperature of 105, full of strong antibiotics, for almost 10 days. I went to work that day, but I was sick. I lay in my dressing room after being in make-up, waiting to be called on the set. They knew I was feeling pretty rotten, and they tried to give me time to rest. I kept having chills. This was the middle of the summer and I was wearing a sheepskin jacket and I was chilling. I was shaking all over. Then, while sitting on a scaffolding with Maurice Evans, being lit for a special-effects scene: They were setting an inkythat&#x27;s a little tiny [spotlight] that was supposed to be just flickering over my eyes. That flickering, flickering, flickering made me feel weird. And I&#x27;m sitting on this platform up in the air ... and I turn to Gibby, a friend of mine on the set who was just down below, and I said, &#x27;Gibby, I think I have to get down.&#x27; He started to help me down and that&#x27;s the last thing I remember until I woke up on the floor. That&#x27;s about all I remember of the incident ... and I&#x27;d managed to bite a very large hole in the side of my tongue before they could pry my teeth apart.&quot;

From York&#x27;s hospital bed, he and director William Asher discussed York&#x27;s future. &quot;Do you want to quit?&quot; Asher asked. &quot;If it&#x27;s all right with you, Billy&quot;, York replied. With that, York left the sitcom to devote himself to recovery, never to return. Dick Sargent replaced York in the role of Darrin Stephens, taking over the role at the start of the series&#x27; sixth season (1969–1970) and continuing in the part until the series ended after its eighth season (1971–1972). Sargent was originally offered the role of Darrin in 1964, but declined in favor of a part in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Broadside&quot;.

Despite the scripted antagonism between characters Darrin and his mother-in-law Endora, in reality Dick York and Agnes Moorehead enjoyed a very close friendship off screen. Moorehead was very upset when it was confirmed that York would be leaving the show and replaced by Dick Sargent.

==Later years==
For the next 18 months, York was largely bed-ridden in a haze of prescription painkillers. In his memoir, &quot;The Seesaw Girl and Me&quot;, published posthumously, he describes the struggle to break his addiction and come to grips with the loss of his career. The book is in large part a love letter to his wife, Joan (née Alt), the seesaw girl of the title, who stuck with him through the hard times.

His chronic pain from his injury to his back was difficult for him to get through but he pushed forward.&quot;I had a band playing in my head, bagpipes night and day,&quot; York recalled. &quot;It just went on and on and on and on and on... The fans whisper to you and the walls whisper to you and you look at television and sometimes it flashes in a certain way that sends you into a fit and you know that your wife has put her hand in your mouth so you won&#x27;t bite off your tongue. You can&#x27;t sleep. You hallucinate. I used to make a tape recording of rain so I could listen to the rain lying in bed at night to drown out those damned bagpipes.&quot;

In the early 1980s York tried to revive his career. His last two credits were on two primetime television series, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. Afterward he stopped receiving calls when his agent failed to register with the Screen Actors Guild on his behalf, and he retired from show business.

==Death==
York was a three-pack-a-day smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of &quot;Bewitched&quot;; he spent his final years battling emphysema. By 1989, he was using an oxygen tank to help him breathe. While bedridden in his Rockford, Michigan, home, he founded Acting for Life, a private charity to help the homeless and others in need. Using his telephone as his pulpit, York motivated politicians, business people, and the general public to contribute supplies and money.

Despite his suffering, York said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been blessed. I have no complaints. I&#x27;ve been surrounded by people in radio, on stage, and in motion pictures and television who love me. The things that have gone wrong have been simply physical things.&quot;

York died of complications from emphysema at Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, Michigan, on February 20, 1992, at age 63. He is buried at Plainfield Cemetery in Rockford, Michigan.

<doc id="399344" wikidata="Q5881814" url="?curid=399344" title="Holloway Road">
<text>Holloway Road is a road in London, in length. It is one of the main shopping streets in North London, and carries the A1 road as it passes through Holloway, in the London Borough of Islington. The road starts in Archway, near Archway Underground station, then heads south-east, past Upper Holloway railway station, Whittington Park, past the North London campus of London Metropolitan University near Nag&#x27;s Head, past Holloway Road Underground station, and the main campus of the university, and then becomes Highbury Corner, near Highbury &amp; Islington station.

==Name==

The origins of the name are disputed; some believe that it derives from &quot;hollow&quot; due to the dip in the road from the cattle that made their way along the route to the cattle markets in London, whilst some believe it derives from &quot;hallow&quot; and refers to the road&#x27;s historic significance as part of the pilgrimage route to Walsingham. No documentary evidence can be found to support either derivation.

==History==
The earliest record giving the name of the road as The Holloway dates from 1307. The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the villages of Tollington and Stroud. The exact time of their founding is not known, but the earliest record of them dates from 1000. The names ceased to be used by the late 17th century, but are still preserved in the local place names &quot;Tollington Park&quot; and &quot;Stroud Green&quot;; since that time, the area has been known as Holloway.

==Description==
Holloway Road is one of north London&#x27;s shopping streets, containing major stores as well as numerous smaller shops. Holloway Road is the site of the main campus of the much-renamed London Metropolitan University (formerly Northern Polytechnic Institute, the Polytechnic of North London and University of North London), and includes the Orion Building, designed by Daniel Libeskind, which can be seen along the central stretch of Holloway Road, and of the headquarters of the National Union of Students and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Most of the shops are clustered in the Nag&#x27;s Head area, near the junction with Seven Sisters Road. North of the Seven Sisters Road is the Nambucca pub and music venue, which burned down in 2008 and reopened two years later.
==Archway==
The northern point of Holloway Road is the complex interchange at Archway, where the A1 leaves the historic route of the Great North Road. The traditional Great North Road heads northwest up Highgate Hill (now the B519) before turning north at North Road, Highgate to cross the current A1 route. The A1 heads north along the relatively recently built Archway Road. The construction of the interchange left a few buildings isolated in the centre of the roundabout, including the Archway Tavern, which appears on the cover of The Kinks&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot;.

==Churches==

Holloway Road contains two significant London churches. St Mary Magdalene is situated in St Mary Magdalene Gardens near the southern end of the road. Built by William Wickings in 1814, it is one of the best preserved early 19th century churches in London. Charles Barry Jr.&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Church is a leading example of Gothic Revival architecture and dominates the northern end of the road.

==Railway stations==
As one of London&#x27;s primary transport routes during the 19th century railway boom, Holloway Road contains a number of railway stations.
Highbury Corner is the site of Highbury &amp; Islington station, one of London&#x27;s most important transport interchanges. The Victoria line, Northern City Line, and the London Overground North London line converge at this location. It is also the northern terminus of the London Overground East London line.

The station building was badly damaged by a V-1 flying bomb in 1944 and never rebuilt. The remainder of the building was demolished in 1966 in preparation for the construction of the Victoria line; the only surface building is a small entrance hall, set back from the main road.
Holloway Road station opened with the Piccadilly line in 1906, next door to an existing Great Northern Railway main line station built in 1852. The main line station closed in 1915. Although Holloway Road is the nearest station to the Emirates Stadium, trains do not stop here on match days due to concerns about overcrowding.

Upper Holloway station was built in 1868 as part of the Tottenham &amp; Hampstead Junction Railway. It is served by trains on the Gospel Oak to Barking line, which now forms part of the London Overground network.

Archway station is not actually situated on Holloway Road, but approximately 10 m off the main road on Junction Road, underneath the architecturally striking Archway Tower. Originally known as &quot;Highgate&quot;, it was the original northern terminus of the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway and until 1940 was the northern terminus of the Northern line.

==In popular culture==
Record producer Joe Meek, responsible amongst other things for &quot;Telstar&quot; by The Tornados, a massive UK and US no. 1 record in 1962, and the highly influential 1959 album &quot;I Hear a New World&quot;, lived and worked at 304 Holloway Road, where, on 3 February 1967, he killed his landlady and them himself with a shotgun. His life is now commemorated by a plaque on the building.

Sex Pistols singer John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) claims to have been born and raised in side-street Benwell Road, although no documentary evidence survives of this.

The road features heavily as the home of a fictionalised Meek in Jake Arnott&#x27;s &quot;The Long Firm&quot; trilogy.

The album Season End by Marillion includes &quot;Holloway Girl&quot;, which refers to the imprisonment of Judith Ward in Holloway Prison.

A row of Victorian houses, numbers 726–732, opposite Upper Holloway station, stands at the described location of the fictional Brickfield Terrace in George and Weedon Grossmith&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Nobody&quot;. The architecture is typical for buildings on this stretch of the road.

<text>Gertrude Chandler Warner (April 16, 1890 – August 30, 1979) was an American author, mainly of children&#x27;s stories. She was most famous for writing the original book of &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; and for the next 18 books in the series.

==Biography==
Warner was born on April 16, 1890, in Connecticut, to Edgar Morris Warner and Jane Elizabeth Carpenter Warner. Her family included an older sister, Frances, and a younger brother, John. Her middle name of Chandler came from her mother&#x27;s ancestors, the Chandlers, who had settled in nearby Woodstock, CT in 1686. Her father Edgar Warner had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1872 and practiced law in Putnam, CT. The Warners&#x27; house on Main Street was located across from the railroad station.

When she was five, Warner dreamed of being an author. Later, she accomplished that dream and started writing &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot;. Albert Whitman &amp; Company Retrieved and began writing in ten-cent blank books as soon as she was able to hold a pencil. Her first book was an imitation of Florence Kate Upton&#x27;s &quot;Golliwog&quot; stories and was titled &quot;Golliwog at the Zoo&quot;; It &quot;consisted of verses illustrated with watercolors of the two Dutch clocks and the Goliwag. Warner presented this book to her grandfather, and every Christmas afterwards, she would give him a hand-made book as a present.

While growing up, Warner loved to read, and her favorite book was &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Being in a musical family, she was predisposed to play an instrument; in her case, she chose the cello, and her father bought her a cello kit at a young age. However, because of her frequent illnesses, Warner never finished high school. After leaving, she studied with a tutor and finished her secondary education. In 1918, while she was teaching Sunday School, Warner was called to teach first grade, mainly because male teachers were being called to serve in World War I. Warner continued teaching as a grade school teacher in Putnam from 1918 to 1950. Also during this time, she returned to school for education courses at Yale University&#x27;s summer school.

Warner was a lover of nature. While growing up, she had butterfly and moth collections, pressed wildflowers, learned of all the birds in her backyard and other places, and kept a garden to see what butterflies were doing. She used these interests in teaching her grade school students, and also used nature themes in her books. For instance, in the second book of &quot;The Boxcar Children Surprise Island,&quot; the Alden children make a nature museum from the flowers, shells and seaweed they have collected and the shapes of birds they have observed. One of her students recalled the wildflower and stone-gathering contests that Warner sponsored when she was a teacher.

As well as her books in &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; series, Warner wrote many other books for children, including &quot;The World in a Barn&quot; (1927), &quot;Windows into Alaska&quot; (1928), &quot;The World on a Farm&quot; (1931) and &quot;Peter Piper, Missionary Parakeet&quot; (1967). With her sister, Frances Lester Warner, she cowrote &quot;Life&#x27;s Minor Collisions,&quot; a series of essays about humorous conflicts of temperament among friends and families. The sisters took the essays in turn, Frances writing the odd-numbered pieces and Gertrude the even.

Warner never married. She lived in her parents&#x27; home for almost 40 years, then moved to her grandmother&#x27;s house. In 1962, she moved to a brown-shingled house, Jill C. Wheeler, &quot;Gertrude Chandler Warner&quot;, Abdo Publishing Co, and lived there with her companion, a retired nurse. In her later life, before she died at age 89, Warner became a volunteer for the American Red Cross, a Cancer Society and other charitable organizations to help kids and adults in need from suffering. She is buried in Grove Street Cemetery, in Putnam.

==&quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; series==
Warner once said that she did much of her writing while convalescing from illnesses or accidents, and that she conceived the idea of The Boxcar Children while sick at home. Of this, she said –

&quot;I had to stay at home from school because of an attack of bronchitis. Having written a series of eight books to order for a religious organization, I decided to write a book just to suit myself. What would I like to do? Well, I would like to live in a freight car, or a caboose. I would hang my wash out on the little back piazza and cook my stew on the little rusty stove found in the caboose.&quot;

This original version of &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; was published by Rand McNally and Company in 1924. It included 4 color illustrations by Dorothy Lake Gregory. In 1942, Warner rewrote the book with a prescribed vocabulary of six hundred words and a text of about 15,000 words, so that it could be used as a children&#x27;s school reader. This edition featured numerous black-and-white silhouette illustrations by L. Kate Deal. Warner continued writing other things, but did not continue with &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; series until her retirement from teaching. The second book in the series, &quot;Surprise Island&quot;, was published in 1949.

Warner once acknowledged that &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; was criticized for depicting children with little parental supervision; her critics thought that this would encourage child rebellion. Her response was, however, that the children liked it for that very reason. In her books, Warner &quot;liked to stress the Aldens&#x27; independence and resourcefulness and their solid New England devotion to using up and making do.&quot;

Today, Albert Whitman &amp; Company publishes the extremely popular series of Warner&#x27;s original 19 stories. Other authors have contributed to the series, adding approximately 150 books to &quot;The Boxcar Children&quot; series.

In 2020, Gertrude Chandler Warner&#x27;s &quot;The Box-Car Children&quot;, the first book in the series went into the public domain.

==Boxcar Children Museum==
On July 3, 2004, the Gertrude Chandler Warner Boxcar Children Museum opened in Putnam, Connecticut. It is located across the street from Warner&#x27;s childhood home and is housed in an authentic 1920s New Haven R.R. boxcar. The museum is dedicated to Warner&#x27;s life and work, and includes original signed books, photos and artifacts from her life and career as a teacher in Putman. Included is the desk at which a 9-year-old Warner wrote her first story titled &quot;Golliwog at the Zoo&quot;. There is also a re-creation of the living space created by the Aldens – the Boxcar Children themselves.

<doc id="399349" wikidata="Q4939789" url="?curid=399349" title="Bolling v. Sharpe">
<text>Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Constitution prohibits segregated public schools in the District of Columbia. Originally argued on December 10–11, 1952, a year before &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, &quot;Bolling&quot; was reargued on December 8–9, 1953, and was unanimously decided on May 17, 1954, the same day as &quot;Brown&quot;. The &quot;Bolling&quot; decision was supplemented in 1955 with the second &quot;Brown&quot; opinion, which ordered desegregation &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;. In &quot;Bolling&quot;, the Court did not address school desegregation in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause, which applies only to the states, but rather held that school segregation was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court observed that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution lacked an Equal Protection Clause, as in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the Court held that the concepts of equal protection and due process are not mutually exclusive, establishing the reverse incorporation doctrine.

==Background==

In &quot;Carr v. Corning&quot; (1950), the District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals (with Judges Bennett Champ Clark, Henry White Edgerton, and E. Barrett Prettyman presiding) affirmed a ruling of the District of Columbia U.S. District Court that upheld school segregation in the District citing seven laws passed by Congress from 1862 through 1874 that had segregated the District of Columbia Public Schools. Under Article I, Section VIII of the U.S. Constitution, &quot;Congress shall have the power ... [t]o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District ... as may, by Cession of particular States... become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for ... needful buildings&quot;. On April 16, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act passed by the 37th United States Congress that ended slavery in the District of Columbia.

On May 20, 1862, Lincoln signed into law the Washington County Public Primary Schools Act which required that a special property tax be levied on all taxable property owned by non-white persons in Washington County &quot;for the purpose of initiating a system of education of colored children in said county&quot;. The next day, Lincoln signed the Georgetown and Washington Cities Colored Children Education Act into law that required the municipal governments of Georgetown and Washington City to deposit 10 percent of the property tax revenue collected from non-white property owners into separate funds to be &quot;appropriated for the purpose of initiating a system of primary schools for the education of colored children residing in said cities&quot; under the control of the boards of trustees of the public schools in Georgetown and Washington City, and that the boards of trustees &quot;shall possess all the powers, exercise the same functions, and have the same supervision over the schools provided for in this act as are now exercised by them over the public schools now existing in said cities&quot;.

However, on July 11, 1862, Lincoln signed the Georgetown and Washington Cities Colored Children Schools Act into law that created a separate board of trustees for non-white schools in Georgetown and Washington City who would &quot;possess all the powers and perform all the duties conferred upon and required of the trustees of public schools in the said cities&quot;. On June 25, 1864, Lincoln signed into law the Washington County Public Schools Act passed by the 38th United States Congress that permitted &quot;any white resident of said county shall be privileged to place his or her child or ward, at any one of the schools provided for the education of white children in said county he or she may think proper to select … and any colored resident shall have the same rights with respect to colored schools&quot;, and repealed the special property tax on non-white property owners in Georgetown and Washington City to fund non-white schools and instead required that the municipal governments of Georgetown and Washington City to appropriate from the general funds of their schools districts funding to non-white schools proportionate to the percentage of the enrollment in the districts non-white students constituted.

On July 23, 1866, President Andrew Johnson signed into law the District of Columbia Public Schools Act passed by the 39th United States Congress that provided that the Washington County Public Schools Act be construed to &quot;require the cities of Washington and Georgetown to pay over to the trustees of colored schools&quot; the funding required under Section 18 of the Washington County Public Schools Act. On July 28, 1866, Johnson signed the Washington City Colored Schools Lots Donation Act into law that required the Public Buildings Commissioner to &quot;grant and convey to the trustees of colored schools for the cities of Washington and Georgetown … for the sole use of schools for colored children&quot; specific land lots in Washington City. On June 22, 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Revised Statutes of the United States Act passed by the 43rd United States Congress that provided for the revision and consolidation of all federal statutes related to the District of Columbia, that retained Section 16 of the Washington County Public Schools Act, retained a separate board of trustees for non-white schools in Georgetown and Washington City, and required the appointment of a separate superintendent for non-white schools.

Beginning in late 1941, a group of parents from the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., calling themselves the Consolidated Parents Group, petitioned the Board of Education of the District of Columbia to open the nearly-completed John Philip Sousa Junior High as an integrated school. The school board denied the petition and the school opened, admitting only whites. On September 11, 1950, Gardner Bishop, Nicholas Stabile and the Consolidated Parents Group attempted to get eleven African-American students (including the case&#x27;s plaintiff, Spottswood Bolling) admitted to the school, but were refused entry by the school&#x27;s principal.

James Nabrit Jr., a professor of law at Howard University School of Law, a historically black university, filed suit in 1951 on behalf of Bolling and the other students in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking assistance in the students&#x27; admission. After the court dismissed the claim, the case was granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court in 1952. Howard law professor George E. C. Hayes worked with Nabrit on the oral argument for the Supreme Court hearing. While Nabrit&#x27;s argument in &quot;Bolling&quot; rested on the unconstitutionality of segregation, the much more famous &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (decided on the same day) argued that the idea of &#x27;separate but equal&#x27; facilities sanctioned by &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) was a fallacy as the facilities for black students were woefully inadequate.

==Decision==
The Court, led by newly confirmed Chief Justice Earl Warren, decided unanimously in favor of the plaintiffs. In his opinion, Justice Warren noted that while the 14th Amendment, whose Equal Protection Clause was cited in &quot;Brown&quot; in order to declare segregation unconstitutional, does not apply in the District of Columbia, the Fifth Amendment did apply. While the Fifth Amendment lacks an equal protection clause, Warren held that &quot;the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive.&quot; While equal protection is a more explicit safeguard against discrimination, the Court stated that &quot;discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.&quot; Referring to the technicalities raised by the case&#x27;s location in the District of Columbia, the Court held that, in light of their decision in &quot;Brown&quot; that segregation in state public schools is prohibited by the Constitution, it would be &quot;unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government&quot;.

The Court concluded: &quot;racial segregation in the public schools of the District of Columbia is a denial of the due process of law guaranteed by the 5th Amendment&quot;. The Court restored both &quot;Bolling&quot; and &quot;Brown&quot; to the docket until they could reconvene to discuss how to effectively implement the decisions.

==Controversy==
Some scholars have argued that the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bolling&quot; should have been reached on other grounds. For example, Judge Michael W. McConnell of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit wrote that Congress never &quot;required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated&quot;. According to that rationale, the segregation of schools in Washington D.C. was unauthorized and therefore illegal.

In a debate, law professors Cass Sunstein and Randy Barnett agreed that while the result was desirable, &quot;Bolling&quot; does not reconcile with the Constitution, with Barnett saying: &quot;You are right to point out that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot; is very difficult to reconcile with the text of the Constitution. For this reason, you know that among constitutional scholars of all stripes &quot;Bolling&quot; is one of the most controversial and difficult cases ever decided by the Court.&quot; Conversely, University of Michigan Law School professor Richard Primus has argued that the conventional wisdom among constitutional scholars is that &quot;Bolling&quot; was not wrongly decided or that the reverse incorporation doctrine is illegitimate, and instead both were &quot;justified by the force of sheer normative necessity.&quot;

<text>Bewitched is an American fantasy sitcom television series that originally aired for eight seasons on ABC from September 17, 1964, to March 25, 1972. It is about a witch who marries an ordinary mortal man and vows to lead the life of a typical suburban housewife. The show was popular, finishing as the second-rated show in America during its debut season, staying in the top ten for its first three seasons, and ranking in eleventh place for both seasons four and five. The show continues to be seen throughout the world in syndication and on recorded media.

&quot;Bewitched&quot; was created by Sol Saks under executive producer Harry Ackerman and starred Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens, Dick York (1964–1969) as Darrin Stephens, and Agnes Moorehead as Endora, Samantha&#x27;s mother. Dick Sargent replaced an ailing York for the final three seasons, 1969–1972.

Hanna-Barbera produced the opening and closing animation credits. In 2002, &quot;Bewitched&quot; was ranked No. 50 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot;. In 1997, the same magazine ranked the season two episode &quot;Divided He Falls&quot; No. 48 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;.

==Plot==

A beautiful witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) meets and marries a mortal named Darrin Stephens (Dick York, later Dick Sargent). While Samantha complies with Darrin&#x27;s wishes to become a normal suburban housewife, her magical family disapproves of the mixed marriage and frequently interferes in the couple&#x27;s lives. Episodes often begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, the effects of which wreak havoc with mortals such as his boss, clients, parents, and neighbors. By the epilogue, however, Darrin and Samantha most often embrace, having overcome the devious elements that failed to separate them. The witches and their male counterparts, warlocks, are very long-lived; while Samantha appears to be a young woman, many episodes suggest she is actually hundreds of years old. To keep their society secret, witches avoid showing their powers in front of mortals other than Darrin. Nevertheless, the effects of their spells—and Samantha&#x27;s attempts to hide their supernatural origin from mortals—drive the plot of most episodes. Witches and warlocks usually use physical gestures along with their incantations. To perform magic, Samantha often twitches her nose to create a spell. Special visual effects are accompanied by music to highlight such an action.
==Setting==
The main setting for most episodes is the Stephenses&#x27; home at 1164 Morning Glory Circle, in an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood, either in Westport, Connecticut, or Patterson, New York, as indicated by conflicting information presented throughout the series. Many scenes also take place at the fictional Madison Avenue advertising agency McMann and Tate, where Darrin works.

During its run, the series had a number of major cast changes, often because of illness or death of the actors.

==Precursors==
Creator Sol Saks&#x27; inspirations for this series were the film &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942), developed from Thorne Smith&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Passionate Witch&quot;, and the John Van Druten Broadway play &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, which was adapted into the 1958 film.

In &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;, Wallace Wooley (Fredric March) is a descendant of people who executed witches at the Salem witch trials. As revenge, a witch (Veronica Lake) prepares a love potion for him. She ends up consuming her own potion and falling for her enemy. Her father is against this union. In the film &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, modern witch Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) uses a love spell on Shep Henderson (James Stewart) to have a simple fling with him but she genuinely falls for the man.

Both films were properties of Columbia Pictures, which also owned Screen Gems, the company that produced &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

==Production and broadcasting==
Sol Saks received credit as the creator of the show; he wrote the pilot of &quot;Bewitched&quot; but was not involved with the show after the pilot. Creator Saks, executive producer Harry Ackerman, and director William Asher started rehearsals for the pilot on November 22, 1963; this coincided with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Asher felt personally affected by the event, as he knew Kennedy; he had produced the 1962 televised birthday party where Marilyn Monroe sang &quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&quot;. The pilot concerned &quot;the occult destabilization of the conformist life of an upwardly mobile advertising man&quot;. For that first episode, &quot;I Darrin, Take This Witch, Samantha&quot;, Academy Award-winning actor José Ferrer served as the narrator. First season producer and head writer Danny Arnold set the initial style and tone of the series, and he also helped to develop supporting characters such as Larry Tate and the Kravitzes. Arnold, who wrote for &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; and other shows, thought of &quot;Bewitched&quot; essentially as a romantic comedy about a mixed marriage; his episodes kept the magic element to a minimum. One or two magical acts drove the plot, but Samantha often solved problems without magic. Many of the first season&#x27;s episodes were allegorical, using supernatural situations as metaphors for the problems any young couple would face. Arnold stated that the two main themes of the series were the conflict between a powerful woman and a husband who cannot deal with that power, and the anger of a bride&#x27;s mother at seeing her daughter marry beneath her. Though the show was a hit right from the beginning, finishing its first year as the number 2 show in the United States, ABC wanted more magic and more farcical plots, which caused battles between Arnold and the network.

In its first season, &quot;Bewitched&quot; was the American Broadcasting Company&#x27;s number one show and the best-rated sitcom among all three networks, coming second in ratings only to &quot;Bonanza&quot;. &quot;Bewitched&quot; aired at 9 pm Thursday evenings. It was preceded on the air by another sitcom, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, and followed by the soap opera &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. &quot;My Three Sons&quot; finished 13th in the ratings and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; ninth. The block formed by the three shows was the strongest ratings grabber in ABC&#x27;s schedule. Arnold left the show after the first season, leaving producing duties to his friend Jerry Davis, who had already produced some of the first season&#x27;s episodes (though Arnold was still supervising the writing). The second season was produced by Davis, and, with Bernard Slade as head writer, misunderstandings and farce became more prevalent elements, though this season still included a number of more low-key episodes in which the magical element was not strongly emphasized. With the third season and the switch to color, Davis left the show and was replaced as producer by William Froug. Slade also left after the second season. According to William Froug&#x27;s autobiography, William Asher (who had directed many episodes) wanted to take over as producer when Jerry Davis left, but the production company was not yet ready to approve the idea. Froug, a former producer of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and the last season of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, was brought in as a compromise. By his own admission, Froug was not very familiar with &quot;Bewitched&quot; and found himself in the uncomfortable position of being the official producer even though Asher was making most of the creative decisions. After a year, Froug left the show, and Asher took over as full-time producer of the series for the rest of its run. The first two seasons had aired Thursdays at 9:00, and the time was moved to 8:30 shortly after the third year (1966–1967) had begun. Nevertheless, the ratings for &quot;Bewitched&quot; remained high and it placed among the top fifteen shows through the 1968–69 season. It was the seventh highest-rated show in the U.S. for 1965–66 and 1966–67. Similarly, it was number 11 the following two years.
At the time, the show had won three Emmy Awards. William Asher won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series in 1966. Alice Pearce posthumously won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of Gladys Kravitz, and Marion Lorne won the same award posthumously in 1968 for her portrayal of Aunt Clara. Producers were faced with how to deal with the deaths of both these actresses. When Pearce died in early 1966, Mary Grace Canfield was hired to play Gladys&#x27;s sister-in-law Harriet Kravitz in four episodes. Comedienne Alice Ghostley was approached to take over the role of Gladys the next season, but turned it down. She and Pearce were good friends so Ghostley decided to decline the role out of respect for Pearce. In the fall of 1966, Sandra Gould was hired as Gladys Kravitz. Gould would remain with the show until the spring of 1971. After Marion Lorne&#x27;s death in the spring of 1968, she was not replaced, and the character of Aunt Clara was not seen after the fourth season. Beginning in the show&#x27;s sixth year, Alice Ghostley was finally used to play the character of Esmeralda, a kind but shy and inept witch who served as a nanny and nursemaid to Darrin and Samantha&#x27;s children, Tabitha and Adam. (Ghostley had appeared in a similar role as Naomi, an incompetent domestic, hired by Darrin to do housecleaning for a pregnant Samantha in the second-season episode &quot;Maid To Order&quot;.) In another notable casting change, Louise Tate, played by Irene Vernon during the first two seasons, was played by Kasey Rogers thereafter.

The fifth season of &quot;Bewitched&quot; (1968-1969) proved to be a turning point for the series, most notably with the mid-season departure of Dick York and the record eight episodes which were filmed without him afterwards (although aired out of order with previously filmed episodes). York was suffering from recurring back problems, the result of an accident during the filming of &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; (1959). As a result, many episodes in seasons three and four had York&#x27;s character of Darrin out of town on business. Towards the end of the season five, York&#x27;s increased disability, which had caused numerous shooting delays and script rewrites, resulted in his collapsing on the set in January 1969 while filming the episode &quot;Daddy Does His Thing.&quot; He was immediately rushed to the hospital and after a long talk with producer-director William Asher, York decided to leave the series. At about the same time, Montgomery and Asher announced that they were expecting another baby and it was decided that Samantha and Darrin would also have another child in the fall of that year. On screen, Samantha tells Darrin over the phone the news of her second pregnancy in the fifth-season episode &quot;Samantha&#x27;s Good News&quot;. That same month, Dick Sargent was cast to play Darrin beginning in the sixth season. It was also during this season that Serena (Samantha&#x27;s identical cousin, also played by Montgomery, but credited to Pandora Spocks in some episodes) was used more frequently. Filming of scenes involving both Samantha and Serena was accomplished by using Melody McCord, Montgomery&#x27;s stand-in.
Beginning with the sixth season&#x27;s (1969–1970) opening credits, in addition to York being replaced with Sargent, Elizabeth Montgomery was billed above the title, and David White now received billing as well, after Agnes Moorehead&#x27;s. During this year, the show saw a significant decline in ratings, falling from eleventh to 24th place. In mid-1970, the set of the Stephenses&#x27; home was being rebuilt due to a fire. In June, the cast and crew traveled to Salem, Magnolia, and Gloucester, Massachusetts to film an eight-part story arc in which Samantha, Darrin, and Endora travel to Salem for the centennial Witches Convocation. These location shoots marked the only times the show would film away from its Hollywood studio sets and backlot. Season seven premiered with eight so-called &#x27;Salem Saga&#x27; episodes. These on-location episodes helped the show&#x27;s sagging ratings. However, during that year, scripts from old episodes were recycled frequently. By the end of the 1970–1971 season, the ratings for &quot;Bewitched&quot; had noticeably dropped and the show did not even rank in the list of the top thirty programs. ABC moved &quot;Bewitched&quot;″s airtime from Thursdays at 8:30 pm to Wednesdays at 8:00 pm at the beginning of the eighth season. The schedule change did not help ratings as the show was now pitted against CBS&#x27;s popular &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. Fewer recurring characters were used this season; the Kravitzes, Darrin&#x27;s parents and Uncle Arthur did not appear at all, and Louise Tate only featured in three episodes. Filming ended in December 1971, and in January 1972 the show was finally moved to Saturday night at 8:00 pm, opposite television&#x27;s number one show, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, where it fared even worse, with &quot;Bewitched&quot; finishing in 72nd place for the year.

During its first five seasons, &quot;Bewitched&quot; was sponsored by both General Motors’ Chevrolet division and the Quaker Oats Company. As a result, Chevrolet vehicles were often prominently featured on the series, even as a part of the storyline (an example of product placement), and there were many scenes of the Stephenses having breakfast in the kitchen. Sponsors in later seasons included Bristol-Myers, Eastman Kodak and Oscar Mayer.

===Sets and locations===
The 1959 Columbia Pictures film &quot;Gidget&quot; was filmed on location at a real house in Santa Monica (at 267 18th Street). The blueprint design of this house was later reversed and replicated as a house facade attached to an existing garage on the backlot of Columbia&#x27;s Ranch. This was the house seen on &quot;Bewitched&quot;. The patio and living room sets seen in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Gidget Goes to Rome&quot; (1963) were soon adapted for the permanent &quot;Bewitched&quot; set for 1964. The interior of the Stephenses&#x27; house can be seen, substantially unaltered, in the Jerry Lewis film &quot;Hook, Line &amp; Sinker&quot; (1969). The set was also used several times in the television series &quot;Gidget&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, as well as the television film &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971). It was also used, as a setting for an opening tag sequence, for the final episode of the first season of another Screen Gems property, &quot;The Monkees,&quot; and in an episode of &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot;. The house served as Doctor Bellows&#x27; house on &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and was seen in an episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot; when Tim Taylor took &quot;Tool Time&quot; on location to the house of Vinnie&#x27;s mother to repair a gas leak in the basement furnace (with a second gas leak at the kitchen stove, unbeknownst to Tim). The Stephens house was also featured in a Fruit of the Loom Christmas commercial and it was used as Clark Griswold&#x27;s boyhood home in his old home movies in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;. On Marvel Studios&#x27; 2021 limited series &quot;WandaVision&quot;, which pays homage to &quot;Bewitched&quot; in a number of episodes, the house&#x27;s exterior serves throughout the series as the home of neighbor Agatha Harkness, while the interior set briefly appears in one episode as the ever-evolving home of the titular characters, Wanda and Vision.

On the Columbia studio backlot, the Kravitzes&#x27; house was actually down the street from the Stephenses&#x27; house exterior. Both houses&#x27; exterior doors opened to an unfinished entry, as the interiors were shot on studio sound stages elsewhere. A &quot;front porch&quot; set, replicating the porch of the backlot house was created as well. From 1964 through 1966, the Kravitzes&#x27; house was the same as used for &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. Beginning with season 3 color episodes in 1966, the Kravitz house sets were the same as what would (years later) be featured as &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; house.

Production and filming for &quot;Bewitched&quot; was based in Los Angeles and, although the setting is assumed to be suburban New York, several episodes feature wide-angle exterior views of the Stephenses&#x27; neighborhood showing a California landscape with mountains in the distance. Another example of questionable continuity regarding the location can be seen in Season 6, Episode 6: Darrin&#x27;s parents drive home after visiting the new baby, passing several large palm trees lining the street.

==Cancellation and aftermath ==

Despite the low ratings, &quot;Bewitched&quot; still had a contract for two more seasons on ABC. The network was willing to honor that contract by renewing the sitcom for a ninth season. Montgomery had grown tired of the series and wanted other roles. She and her husband William Asher had separated and divorced in 1974. Asher pitched an idea to ABC for a sitcom starring Paul Lynde. The concept was based on the play &quot;Howie&quot;, about a lawyer, Paul Simms (played by Paul Lynde), whose daughter marries a slacker named Howard, or &quot;Howie.&quot; Paul&#x27;s character despises him, as he is not interested in earning money or traditional pursuits. In creating a series for Paul Lynde, Asher decided to resurrect the &quot;Howie&quot; concept for ABC and Screen Gems as a replacement for &quot;Bewitched&quot; the following year. Asher designed &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot; to be ABC&#x27;s counterpart to CBS&#x27;s &quot;All in the Family&quot; but the show lacked the controversial and topical issues brought up by that series, due to ABC&#x27;s restriction on social realism. This was despite Lynde&#x27;s rewrite of the show&#x27;s dialog to make the series more lively and comedic. When &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot; debuted on ABC in the fall of 1972, it inherited &quot;Bewitched&quot;’s time slot during its last season on Wednesday nights opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; on CBS and the Top 20 hit &quot;Adam-12&quot; on NBC. While the first episode of &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot; did well in the ratings, strong negative reactions not only to Lynde&#x27;s character but also the premise of the series led to bad word of mouth and a collapse in viewership.

The show bore some similarities to &quot;Bewitched&quot;. Some of the sets used for the Simms&#x27; house and backyard were used from Samantha and Darrin Stephens&#x27;s home. The name of Paul&#x27;s law firm McNish &amp; Simms was very similar to the name of Darrin Stephens&#x27;s advertising agency McMann &amp; Tate. Many actors regularly seen on &quot;Bewitched&quot; were also used on Lynde&#x27;s series including Mabel Albertson, Herb Voland, Jack Collins, Richard X. Slattery, and Dick Wilson.

At the same time, to help fulfill the network&#x27;s contract with &quot;Bewitched&quot;, Asher and Harry Ackerman created another ABC sitcom for the 1972–1973 season called &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;. The series starred James Whitmore and Cleavon Little. In its first year, the sitcom was not only struggling with its format but with ratings. In mid-season, Asher was replaced as producer by Bruce Johnson and Duke Vincent. Despite its challenges, the series ended its first year with a respectable 29 share and was renewed for the 1973–1974 season. To improve ratings and help Paul Lynde fulfill his contract with the network, ABC wanted to make some changes. When &quot;The New Temperatures Rising Show&quot; debuted in September 1973, Whitmore was replaced by Lynde and the emphasis on black comedy in the show became more prominent. Ratings for the series fell well below those of the previous season.

When Screen Gems head John Mitchell and ABC chief programmer Barry Diller noticed that &quot;The New Temperatures Rising Show&quot; was failing, they contacted William Asher and asked him to come back and salvage the series. The show was resurrected on July 18, 1974, after a six-month hiatus with its original title &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;. Joining Lynde and Little in the cast was &quot;Bewitched&quot; alum Alice Ghostley. Despite the changes in cast and format, the attempt to resuscitate the series failed and ABC finally cancelled it. The final episode of &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot; aired on August 29, 1974, which ended William Asher&#x27;s original contract with &quot;Bewitched&quot; and ABC.

==Cultural context==
In February 1964, feminist Betty Friedan&#x27;s two-part essay &quot;Television and the Feminine Mystique&quot; for &quot;TV Guide&quot; criticized the portrayal of women in television shows as simplistic, manipulative, and insecure household drudges whose time was spent dreaming of love and plotting revenge on their husbands. Samantha&#x27;s character differed from this stereotype and Endora used Friedan-like language to criticize the boring drudgery of household life. Others have looked how the series &#x27;play[ed] into and subvert[ed] a rich load of cultural stereotypes and allusions&#x27; regarding witches, gender roles, advertising and consumerism. In the episode &quot;Eat at Mario&#x27;s&quot; (May 27, 1965), Samantha and Endora use their powers to defend and promote a quality Italian restaurant. They take delight in an active, aggressive role in the public space, breaking new ground in the depiction of women in television.

Airing during the civil rights era, &quot;Bewitched&quot; broached taboos about interracial marriage.

In a 1992 interview, Elizabeth Montgomery was asked if the show was an allegory about closeted homosexuality. She answered, &quot;Don&#x27;t think that didn&#x27;t enter our minds at the time. We talked about it on the set—certainly not in production meetings—that this was about people not being allowed to be what they really are. If you think about it, &quot;Bewitched&quot; is about repression in general and all the frustration and trouble it can cause.&quot;

==Reception==
Walter Metz attributes the success of the series to its snappy writing, the charm of Elizabeth Montgomery, and the talents of its large supporting cast. The show also made use of respected film techniques for its special effects. The soundtrack was unique, notably where it concerned the synthesized sound of nose twitching.

The first episodes featured a voice-over narrator &quot;performing comic sociological analyses&quot; of the role of a witch in middle class suburbia. The style was reminiscent of Hollywood films such as &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; (1957).
In a 1991 audio interview with film historian Ronald Haver, Elizabeth Montgomery revealed that her father Robert Montgomery was originally approached and asked to narrate these episodes but he turned it down. Instead, the narration was done by Academy Award-winning actor José Ferrer, who did not receive credit.

The series inspired the rival show &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1965–1970) on NBC, which was produced by the same studio as &quot;Bewitched&quot; (Screen Gems).

On June 15, 2005, TV Land unveiled a Samantha statue in Salem to mark the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary. On hand were three surviving actors from the show, Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay), Erin Murphy (Tabitha), and Kasey Rogers (Louise Tate), as well as producer/director William Asher.

==Spin-offs, crossovers, and remakes==
===&quot;The Flintstones&quot;===
The 1965 episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; titled &quot;Samantha&quot; (1965) featured Dick York and Elizabeth Montgomery as Darrin and Samantha Stephens, who have just moved into the neighborhood. This crossover was facilitated by both series being broadcast on ABC.

===&quot;Tabitha and Adam and the Clown Family&quot;===
An animated TV special made in 1972 by Hanna-Barbera Productions for &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;, this featured teenage versions of Tabitha and Adam visiting their aunt and her family who travel with a circus. The show aired on December 2, 1972.

===&quot;Tabitha&quot;===

In 1977, a short-lived spin-off titled &quot;Tabitha&quot; aired on ABC. Lisa Hartman played Tabitha, now an adult working with her brother Adam at television station KXLA. There were several continuity differences with the original series. Adam and Tabitha had both aged far more than the intervening five years between the two series would have allowed. Adam also had become Tabitha&#x27;s older mortal brother, rather than her younger warlock brother, as he was in &quot;Bewitched&quot;. Supporting character Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow) says she has been close to Tabitha since childhood, though she had never been mentioned once in the original series. Tabitha&#x27;s parents are mentioned but never appear. However Bernard Fox, Sandra Gould, George Tobias and Dick Wilson reprised their roles as Dr. Bombay, Gladys Kravitz, Abner Kravitz, and &quot;various drunks.&quot;

===&quot;Passions&quot;===

The 1999-2008 NBC soap opera &quot;Passions&quot; featured several appearances by Bernard Fox, playing Dr. Bombay. In another echo of &quot;Bewitched&quot;, the resident witch on &quot;Passions&quot;, Tabitha Lenox (Juliet Mills), named her daughter &quot;Endora.&quot;

===Theatrical film===

&quot;Bewitched&quot; inspired a 2005 film starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. This film was distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film, departing from the show&#x27;s family-oriented tone, is not a remake but takes a metafictional approach, with the action focused on arrogant, failing Hollywood actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell) who is offered a career comeback playing Darrin in a remake of &quot;Bewitched&quot;. The role is contingent upon him finding the perfect woman to play Samantha. He chooses an unknown named Isabel Bigelow (Kidman), who is an actual witch. The film was written, directed, and produced by Nora Ephron, and was poorly received by most critics and was a financial failure. It earned $22 million less than the production cost domestically. However it earned an additional $68 million internationally. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;an unmitigated disaster.&quot; It was announced that Sony development a reboot of the movie with Terry Matalas and Travis Fickett will write the script and John Davis and John Fox are producing through Davis Entertainment.

===Comic adaptations===
Dell Comics adapted the series into a comic book series in 1964. The artwork was done by Henry Scarpelli.

In 1966, the series was adapted as a strip in &quot;Lady Penelope&quot;, beginning from issue 12 and lasting until the comic&#x27;s demise in 1969. It ran for 14 issues.

=== Novel ===

A novel by Al Hine was published in 1965 by Dell. It was translated into Japanese and Dutch.

=== Games ===

A board game was published by Game Gems in 1964. &quot;Stymie&quot;, a card game based on Bewitched, was published in 1964 by Milton Bradley. A print and play card game was published in 2007 by MM Board Games. A match 3 puzzle video was published in 2005.

===Television remakes===
* Argentina: A remake called , produced by Telefé, aired in early 2007. It starred Florencia Peña as Samantha, Gustavo Garzón as her husband, Eduardo, and Georgina Barbarrosa as Endora. This show adapted original scripts to an Argentinian context, with local humor and a contemporary setting. The show was cancelled due to low ratings after a few weeks.
* Japan: TBS, a flagship station of Japan News Network, produced a remake called (, meaning &#x27;(My) Wife is a Witch&#x27;), also known as &quot;Bewitched in Tokyo&quot;. Eleven episodes were broadcast on JNN stations Fridays at 10 pm, from January 16 to March 26, 2004, and a special on December 21, 2004. The main character, Arisa Matsui, was portrayed by Ryoko Yonekura. &quot;&quot; is also the Japanese title for the original American series.
* India: In 2002, Sony Entertainment Television began airing &quot;Meri Biwi Wonderful&quot;, a local adaptation of &quot;Bewitched&quot;.
* Russia: In 2009, TV3 broadcast a remake titled Моя любимая ведьма (&#x27;My Favorite Witch&#x27;), starring Anna Zdor as Nadia (Samantha), Ivan Grishanov as Ivan (Darrin), and Marina Esepenko as Nadia&#x27;s mother. The series is very similar to the original, with most episodes based on those from the original series. American comedy writer/producer Norm Gunzenhauser oversaw the writing and directing of the series.
* United Kingdom: In 2008, the BBC made a pilot episode of a British version, with Sheridan Smith as Samantha, Tom Price as Darrin, and veteran actress Frances de la Tour as Endora.

===Proposed reboots===
In August 2011, it was reported that CBS ordered a script to be written by Marc Lawrence for a rebooted series of &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

On October 22, 2014, Sony Pictures Television announced that it sold a pilot of &quot;Bewitched&quot; to NBC as a possible entry for the 2015—2016 US television season. This show would have concerned Tabitha&#x27;s daughter Daphne, a single woman who despite having the same magical powers as her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, is determined not to use her special abilities to find a soul mate. The new version of the proposed series, written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, had been on the radar of several major networks, including ABC, after Sony began shopping the project to interested parties.

On August 23, 2018, ABC announced that it had bought a pilot for a single camera &quot;Bewitched&quot; remake from &quot;Black-ish&quot; creator Kenya Barris. This was Barris&#x27;s last new project for the network before his exclusive contract with Netflix went into effect. Around the same time, an animated reboot series was optioned by 9 Story Entertainment and GO-N Productions but never got off the ground.

On June 8, 2023, it was announced Sony will be producing an animated &quot;Bewitched&quot; series that will center on Samantha and Darrin&#x27;s daughter Tabitha as a teenager. The series was previewed at MIPJunior on October 3, 2023.

On February 14, 2024, it was announced that Judalina Neira will produce the reboot series.

=== &quot;WandaVision&quot; ===
The second episode of drama-mystery television miniseries &quot;WandaVision&quot;, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch That Dial&quot;, alludes to the series through an animated title sequence and the premise of Wanda Maximoff and Vision living an idyllic suburban life trying to conceal their true natures. Exteriors of the neighborhood were filmed at the now Warner Ranch Backlot with Wanda&#x27;s nosy neighbor Agatha Harkness living in the Stephens house.

====Syndication history====
After completing its original run, ABC Daytime and ABC Saturday Morning continued to air the series until 1973. Since then, &quot;Bewitched&quot; has been syndicated on many local US broadcast stations, first from 1973 to 1982 and then since 1993, including Columbia TriStar Television as part of the &quot;Screen Gems Network&quot; syndication package from 1999 to 2001, which featured bonus wraparound content during episode airings in 1999.

From 1973 to 1982, the entire series was syndicated by Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures. By the late 1970s, numerous local stations either omitted black-and-white episodes or exclusively aired them during the summer, as there was a prevailing belief that such episodes were generally less appealing than those filmed in color. From 1981 to about 1991, only the color episodes were syndicated in barter syndication by DFS Program Exchange. The first two seasons, which were in black and white, were not included because Columbia retained the rights to them. Beginning in 1989, Nick at Nite only aired the black-and-white episodes, which were originally unedited. The edited versions of the episodes continued in barter syndication until 1992. Columbia syndicated the entire series beginning in 1991. The remaining six color seasons were added to Nick at Nite&#x27;s lineup in March 1998 in a week-long Dueling Darrins Marathon. Later, seasons 1–2 were colorized and made available for syndication. Eventually, they were made available for DVD sales. The cable television channel WTBS carried seasons 3–8 throughout the 1980s and 1990s from DFS on a barter basis like most local stations that carried the show.

The show aired on the Hallmark Channel from August 6, 2001 to May 24, 2003. &quot;Bewitched&quot; then aired on TV Land from May 31, 2003 to November 10, 2006, and it returned to TV Land on March 3, 2008, but left the schedule on September 30, 2011.

In September 2008, the show began to air on WGN America, and in October 2012, it began to air on Logo up until January 1, 2024.

Antenna TV has aired the show in conjunction with &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; since the network&#x27;s launch in 2011. The cable and satellite network FETV also airs the show together with &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. The show also aired on GAC Family for a brief time in 2021.

<doc id="399361" wikidata="Q4672257" url="?curid=399361" title="Accasta">
<text>Accasta is a stacking abstract strategy board game on a hexagonal board for two players. The game was designed by Dieter Stein and published solely over the web and in the German game design magazine &quot;&quot;.

==History==
Accasta was influenced by Dr. Emanuel Lasker&#x27;s Lasca and Wladyslaw Gliński&#x27;s hexagonal chess. Dieter Stein tried to achieve a clean and original game differing from the hexagonal chess but to have minor similarities.

After a long time of development, in the spring of 1998, the game became published on the Web and in a German game inventor&#x27;s magazine. That same year it was published, Accosta took part in some game design competitions and was one of the finalists of the Premio Archimede in Italy in 1998. Just three years later, in 2001, the first version of the game available for online play was developed and implemented.

==Gameplay==
Accasta is played similarly as a combination of chess and backgammon. Like chess, Accasta has a fixed initial setup and various different pieces. Like backgammon, Accasta has pieces that move toward a target area, blocking enemy pieces, but it has no dice. The main idea of the game is the use of stacked pieces. Players can move multiple times and have the possibility to liberate previously captures pieces.

==Trilogy==
Stein creating a stacking game trilogy of three games which included:
*Accasta (1998)
*Abande (2005)
*Attangle (2006)

<doc id="399366" wikidata="Q175376" url="?curid=399366" title="Logical effort">
<text>The method of logical effort, a term coined by Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull in 1991, is a straightforward technique used to estimate delay in a CMOS circuit. Used properly, it can aid in selection of gates for a given function (including the number of stages necessary) and sizing gates to achieve the minimum delay possible for a circuit.

==Derivation of delay in a logic gate==
Delay is expressed in terms of a basic delay unit, &quot;τ&quot; = &quot;3RC&quot;, the delay of an inverter driving an identical inverter without any additional capacitance added by interconnects or other loads; the unitless number associated with this is known as the normalized delay.
(Some authors prefer define the basic delay unit as the fanout of 4 delay—the delay of one inverter driving 4 identical inverters).
The absolute delay is then simply defined as the product of the normalized delay of the gate, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;τ&quot;:

:formula_1

In a typical 600-nm process &quot;τ&quot; is about 50 ps. For a 250-nm process, &quot;τ&quot; is about 20 ps. In modern 45 nm processes the delay is approximately 4 to 5 ps.

The normalized delay in a logic gate can be expressed as a summation of two primary terms: normalized parasitic delay, &quot;p&quot; (which is an intrinsic delay of the gate and can be found by considering the gate driving no load), and stage effort, &quot;f&quot; (which is dependent on the load as described below). Consequently,

:formula_2

The stage effort is divided into two components: a logical effort, &quot;g&quot;, which is the ratio of the input capacitance of a given gate to that of an inverter capable of delivering the same output current (and hence is a constant for a particular class of gate and can be described as capturing the intrinsic properties of the gate), and an electrical effort, &quot;h&quot;, which is the ratio of the input capacitance of the load to that of the gate. Note that &quot;logical effort&quot; does not take the load into account and hence we have the term &quot;electrical effort&quot; which takes the load into account. The stage effort is then simply:

:formula_3

Combining these equations yields a basic equation that models the normalized delay through a single logic gate:

:formula_4

==Procedure for calculating the logical effort of a single stage==
CMOS inverters along the critical path are typically designed with a gamma equal to 2.
In other words, the pFET of the inverter is designed with twice the width (and therefore twice the capacitance) as the nFET of the inverter,
in order to get roughly the same pFET resistance as nFET resistance, in order to get roughly equal pull-up current and pull-down current.

Choose sizes for all transistors such that the output drive of the gate is equal to the output drive of an inverter built from a size-2 PMOS and a size-1 NMOS.

The output drive of a gate is equal to the minimum – over all possible combinations of inputs – of the output drive of the gate for that input.

The output drive of a gate for a given input is equal to the drive at its output node.

The drive at a node is equal to the sum of the drives of all transistors which are enabled and whose source or drain is in contact with the node in question. A PMOS transistor is enabled when its gate voltage is 0. An NMOS transistor is enabled when its gate voltage is 1.

Once sizes have been chosen, the logical effort of the output of the gate is the sum of the widths of all transistors whose source or drain is in contact with the output node. The logical effort of each input to the gate is the sum of the widths of all transistors whose gate is in contact with that input node.

The logical effort of the entire gate is the ratio of its output logical effort to the sum of its input logical efforts.

==Multistage logic networks==
A major advantage of the method of logical effort is that it can quickly be extended to circuits composed of multiple stages. The total normalized path delay &quot;D&quot; can be expressed in terms of an overall path effort, &quot;F&quot;, and the path parasitic delay &quot;P&quot; (which is the sum of the individual parasitic delays):

:formula_5

The path effort is expressed in terms of the path logical effort &quot;G&quot; (the product of the individual logical efforts of the gates), and the path electrical effort &quot;H&quot; (the ratio of the load of the path to its input capacitance).

For paths where each gate drives only one additional gate (i.e. the next gate in the path),
:formula_6

However, for circuits that branch, an additional branching effort, &quot;b&quot;, needs to be taken into account; it is the ratio of total capacitance being driven by the gate to the capacitance on the path of interest:
:formula_7

This yields a path branching effort &quot;B&quot; which is the product of the individual stage branching efforts; the total path effort is then
:formula_8

It can be seen that &quot;b&quot; = 1 for gates driving only one additional gate, fixing &quot;B&quot; = 1 and causing the formula to reduce to the earlier non-branching version.

===Minimum delay===
It can be shown that in multistage logic networks, the minimum possible delay along a particular path can be achieved by designing the circuit such that the stage efforts are equal. For a given combination of gates and a known load, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;H&quot; are all fixed causing &quot;F&quot; to be fixed; hence the individual gates should be sized such that the individual stage efforts are
:formula_9
where &quot;N&quot; is the number of stages in the circuit.

==Examples==

===Delay in an inverter===

By definition, the logical effort &quot;g&quot; of an inverter is 1. If the inverter drives an equivalent inverter, the electrical effort &quot;h&quot; is also 1.

The parasitic delay &quot;p&quot; of an inverter is also 1 (this can be found by considering the Elmore delay model of the inverter).

Therefore, the total normalised delay of an inverter driving an equivalent inverter is

:formula_10

===Delay in NAND and NOR gates===

The logical effort of a two-input NAND gate is calculated to be &quot;g&quot; = 4/3 because a NAND gate with input capacitance 4 can drive the same current as the inverter can, with input capacitance 3. Similarly, the logical effort of a two-input NOR gate can be found to be &quot;g&quot; = 5/3. Due to the lower logical effort, NAND gates are typically preferred to NOR gates.

For larger gates, the logical effort is as follows:
The normalised parasitic delay of NAND and NOR gates is equal to the number of inputs.

Therefore, the normalised delay of a two-input NAND gate driving an identical copy of itself (such that the electrical effort is 1) is

:formula_11

and for a two-input NOR gate, the delay is

:formula_12

<text>Electric Sheep is a volunteer computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames, which are in turn distributed to the networked computers, which display them as a screensaver.

==Process==
The process is transparent to the casual user, who can simply install the software as a screensaver. Alternatively, the user may become more involved with the project, manually creating a fractal flame file for upload to the server where it is rendered into a video file of the animated fractal flame. As the screensaver entertains the user, their computer is also used for rendering commercial projects, sales of which keep the servers and developers running.

There are about 500,000 active users (monthly uniques).

According to Mitchell Whitelaw in his &quot;Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life&quot;, &quot;On the screen they are luminous, twisting, elastic shapes, abstract tangles and loops of glowing filaments.&quot;

The name &quot;Electric Sheep&quot; is taken from the title of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. The title mirrors the nature of the project: computers (androids) who have started running the screensaver begin rendering (dreaming) the fractal movies (sheep).

The sheep motif is carried over into other aspects of the project: the 100 or so sheep stored on the server at any time is referred to as &#x27;the flock&#x27;; creating a new fractal by interpolating or combining the sheep&#x27;s fractal code with that of another sheep is called mating/breeding; changes to the code are called mutations, etc.

The parameters that generate these movies (sheep) can be created in a few ways: they can be created and submitted by members of the electricsheep mailing list, members of the mailing list can download the parameters of existing sheep and tweak them, or sheep can be mated together automatically by the server or manually by server admins (nicknamed shepherds).

Users may vote on sheep that they like or dislike, and this voting is used for the genetic algorithm which generates new sheep. Each movie is a fractal flame with several of its parameters animated. The individual frames of which these movies consist are rendered using &#x27;spare&#x27; processing cycles from idle computers on the distributed network of those running the screensaver application, and finished sheep (in the form of .avi files) are distributed to the network.

The computer-generated sheep parameters and movies are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial (CC-BY-NC) license; user-generated sheep parameters are under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. Both are automatically downloaded by the screen saver. The underlying copyright issues raised by generative, distributed digital art projects involve novel legal issues that the current copyright system can not understand or handle.

The screensaver was created and released as free software by Scott Draves in 1999 and continues to be developed by him and a team of about five engineers.

The 2.7.x series differs from the old versions. It has a new logo, higher quality sheep and other features. It has switched to a freemium model in which the server software is not available and much of the computed data is not available under a free license, which led to its removal from Debian.

<doc id="399370" wikidata="Q333411" url="?curid=399370" title="Ilia Chavchavadze">
<text>Prince Ilia Chavchavadze (; 27 October 1837 – 12 September 1907) was a Georgian public figure, journalist, publisher, writer and poet who spearheaded the revival of Georgian nationalism during the second half of the 19th century and ensured the survival of the Georgian language, literature, and culture during the last decades of Tsarist rule. He is Georgia&#x27;s &quot;most universally revered hero&quot; and is regarded as the &quot;Father of the Nation.&quot; His most important literary works were: &quot;The Hermit&quot;, &quot;The Ghost&quot;, &quot;Otaraant Widow&quot;, &quot;Kako The Robber&quot;, &quot;Happy Nation&quot;, &quot;Letters of a Traveler&quot; and &quot;Is a man a human?!&quot;.

He was a leader of contemporary youth intellectual movement named &quot;Tergdaleulebi&quot;. They spread modern and European liberal ideals in Georgia. Ilia Chavchavadze founded two modern newspapers: &quot;Sakartvelos Moambe&quot; and &quot;Iveria&quot;. He played an important role in the creation of the first financial structure in Georgia – Land Bank of Tbilisi, with the aim of protecting Georgian land from being bought by Armenian bourgeoisie. During 30 years he was a chairman of this Bank, through which he financed and promoted most of the cultural, educational, economical and charity events which took place in Georgia.

Continuing the educational work started in Constantinople by Fr. Peter Kharischirashvili and the Servites of the Immaculate Conception, Ilia Chavchavadze also participated in the foundation of &quot;Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians&quot; – an organization that established schools that taught in the Georgian language. This was instrumental in halting the Russification policy of Russian Empire in Georgia.

Inspired by the contemporary liberal and nationalist movements throughout Europe, Chavchavadze directed much of his efforts toward awakening national and liberal ideals among Georgians. Chavchavadze was the author of numerous articles that were published in his newspaper &quot;Iveria&quot;, as well as in other periodicals that were published in Georgia. In his articles, Chavchavadze discussed literature, education, theater, politics, economics, current affairs. His views on self-government, judicial system, social issues, human rights, women&#x27;s rights, and civic activism were ahead of their time and contributed to Georgia&#x27;s sense of national identity. He was a devoted protector of the Georgian language and culture from Russification. He coined the phrase &quot;Ena, Mamuli, Sartsmunoeba&quot; (&quot;Language, Homeland, Faith&quot;), which is a widely acknowledged slogan of Georgian nationalism.

During the 1905 Russian Revolution Chavchavadze was elected as a representative of the Georgian nobility to the imperial State Council. However, he stated that he would represent the whole nation, not just one particular social class. He advocated against capital punishment and lobbied for Georgian autonomy.

Chavchavadze was killed in Tsitsamuri, near Mtskheta, by a gang of assassins. Details of his murder are still matter of debate. His legacy earned him the broad admiration of the Georgian people. In 1987 he was canonized as Saint Ilia the Righteous (, &quot;tsminda ilia martali&quot;) by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Today, Georgians revere Chavchavadze as The Uncrowned King (, &quot;ugvirgvino mepe&quot;) and the &quot;Father of the Nation.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Ancestry and early life ===

Ilia Chavchavadze was born in Qvareli, a village in Kvareli, located in the Alazani Valley, in the Kakheti province of Georgia, which was part of the Russian Empire at that time. Ilia was a &quot;tavadi&quot;, the Georgian title of prince. It is thought that the noble Chavchavadze family came from the Pshav-Khevsureti region of Georgia, and, in 1726, King Constantine II granted the Chavchavadze family the rank of Prince in recognition of their knighthood and valor to the nation. This resulted in the family moving and settling in the Alazani Gorge in Kakheti.

Ilia was the third son of Grigol Chavchavadze and Mariam Beburishvili. Grigol, like his father and his famous ancestors, had a military background. He, along with the local militiamen protected the village from numerous Dagestani invasions. This can be seen in the architecture of the Ilia Chavchavadze museum house in Kvareli, incorporating a Medieval castle style in the two-storey castle in the yard, which was designed to protect the house during invasions.

Chavchavadze was educated at the elementary level by the deacon of the village before he moved to Tbilisi where he attended the prestigious Academy for Nobility in 1848. However, from an early age, Ilia was influenced by his parents who were highly educated in classical literature, Georgian history and poetry. From his parents, Ilia learned the inspiring stories of Georgian heroism in classical historical novels. In his autobiography, Ilia refers to his mother, Princess Mariam Chavchavadze, who knew most Georgian novels and poems by heart and encouraged her children to study them. Ilia also described the influence of the deacon&#x27;s storytelling, which gave him an artistic inspiration, later applied in his novel writing.

Ilia&#x27;s mother, Mariam, died on 4 May 1848, when Ilia was ten years old, and his father asked his sister, Makrine, to help bring up the children. &quot;Aunt Makrine&quot; had a significant impact on Ilia&#x27;s life, because, after 1852, when Ilia&#x27;s father Grigol died, she was the only remaining caretaker of the family.

In 1848, after the death of Princess Chavchavadze, Ilia was sent to Tbilisi by his father to begin his secondary education. Ilia attended a private school for three years before he entered the 1st Academy of Tbilisi in 1851. Soon after, Ilia&#x27;s father died and Aunt Makrine looked after the family. His secondary school years were very stressful, due to his father&#x27;s death. However, the Chavchavadze family suffered another devastating blow when Ilia&#x27;s brother, Constantine, was killed during the Dagestani raid on Kakheti. Ilia expressed his anguish and grief in one of his first short-poems called &quot;Sorrow of a Poor Man&quot;. In addition to his personal problems, the political situation in Georgia worsened under the harsh authority of the Russian Empire, which played a destructive role to the nation and its culture.

=== Student years ===

After graduating from the academy, Ilia decided to continue his education at the University of St. Petersburg, Russia. Before leaving for St. Petersburg, Ilia composed one of his most remarkable poems, &quot;To the Mountains of Kvareli&quot; in the village of Kardanakhi on 15 April 1857, in which he expressed his lifelong admiration for the Greater Caucasus Mountains and his sorrow at leaving his homeland.

That same year, Ilia was admitted to the University of St. Petersburg. During his student years, numerous revolutions sprang up in Europe which Ilia observed with great interest. Ilia&#x27;s attention focused on the events in Italy and the struggle of Giuseppe Garibaldi, whom he admired for many years. While in St.Petersburg, Ilia met Princess Catherine Chavchavadze, from whom he learned about the poetry and lyrics of the Georgian romantic Prince Nik&#x27;oloz Baratashvili. Due to the harsh climate in St Petersburg, Ilia became very ill and returned to Georgia for several months in 1859.

Ilia finally returned to Georgia after the completion of his studies in 1861. During his journey back, Ilia wrote one of his greatest masterpieces, &quot;The Traveler&#x27;s Diaries&quot;, in which he outlines the importance of nation-building and provides an allegorical comparison of Mt. Kazbegi and the Tergi River in the Khevi region of Georgia.

=== Political life ===
Ilia&#x27;s main political and social goals were based on Georgian nationalism. He urged nationwide resistance to the House of Romanov&#x27;s policy of forced Russification, the revival of the Georgian language, and the cultivation of Georgian literature. Even more subversive from the State&#x27;s perspective, Chavchavadze also pushed for reviving the independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church from the control of the Russian Tsar and the Holy Synod.

In the 1860s, &quot;Tergdaleulebi&quot;, the new generation of Georgian intellectuals, educated at Russian universities and exposed to European ideas, promoted national culture against assimilation by the Imperial center. Led by Ilia Chavchavadze, their program attained more nationalist colors as the nobility declined and capitalism progressed, further stimulated by the rule of the Russian bureaucracy and economic and demographic dominance of the Armenian bourgeoisie in the capital city of Tbilisi. Chavchavadze prominently founded &quot;The Bank of the Nobility&quot; of Tbilisi, with the aim of protecting Georgian land from being sold off by poor Georgian nobles to rich Armenian bourgeoisie. In his work &quot;Outcrying Stones&quot;, Chavchavadze denounced Armenians for falsifying Georgian history, buying up Georgian land and appropriating Georgian churches, as well as indebting poor Georgian peasant families. Chavchavadze attacked Armenians for their mercantilism and condemned them in his newspaper &quot;Iveria&quot; for &quot;eating the bread baked by someone else or drinking that which is created by another&#x27;s sweat&quot;, as well as being &quot;sly moneylenders and unscrupulous traders&quot;. He also created slogan &quot;Language, Homeland, Religion&quot;, which served as a motto of Georgian nationalism. Chavchavadze and his associates called for the unity of all Georgians and put national interests above class and provincial divisions. Their vision did not envisage an outright revolt for independence, but demanded autonomy within the reformed Russian Empire, with greater cultural freedom, promotion of the Georgian language, and support for Georgian educational institutions and the national church, whose independence had been suppressed by the Russian government.

As the number of supporters for Chavchavadze&#x27;s ideas grew, so did opposition to Chavchavadze from both the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and particularly from Noe Zhordania. The SD&#x27;s main aims were focused on toppling the Tsarist autocracy and upon an Atheist and Marxist transformation of a still unified Russian Empire. This did not include the revival of the Georgian Church, State, language, or of a distinctly Georgian identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to realize the importance of the revolutionary and Atheist future.

In addition to his works described above, Chavchavadze was also the founder and chairman of many public, cultural and educational organizations (Society for the Spreading of Literacy Among Georgians, &quot;The Dramatic Society&quot;, &quot;The Historical-Ethnographical Society of Georgia&quot;, etc.). He was also a translator of British literature. His main literary works were translated and published in French, English, German, Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian and other languages. Between 1906 and 1907, he was a member of the State Council (Gosudarstvennaya Duma) in Russia. His eclectic interests also led him to be a member of, among others, the Caucasian Committee of the Geographical Society of Russia, the Society of Ethnography and Anthropology of Moscow University, the Society of Orientalists of Russia and the Anglo-Russian Literary Society (London).

Prince Chavchavadze briefly acted as a literary mentor to a young Joseph Stalin, who was then an Orthodox seminarian in Tbilisi. According to historian Simon Sebag Montefiore: &quot;The Prince was sufficiently impressed to show the teenager&#x27;s work to his editors. He admired Stalin&#x27;s verse, choosing five poems to publish – quite an achievement. Prince Chavchavadze called Stalin the &#x27;young man with the burning eyes.&#x27;&quot;

== Death ==
After serving as a member of the Upper House in the first Russian Duma, Ilia decided to return to Georgia in 1907. On 28 August 1907, while travelling with his wife Olga from Tbilisi to Saguramo, Prince Ilia Chavchavadze was ambushed and murdered by a crew of six assassins in the small village of Tsitsamuri, near Mtskheta.

The Prince&#x27;s murder was seen as a national tragedy and was mourned by all classes of Georgian society. Prince Akaki Tsereteli, who was suffering from serious health problems at the time, spoke at the funeral and dedicated an outstanding oration to Ilia: &quot;Ilia&#x27;s inestimable contribution to the revival of the Georgian nation is an example for future generations&quot;. Famous Georgian poet Vazha-Pshavela said: &quot;Ilia&#x27;s murderers would have killed Georgia if they could&quot;.

Following the unfortunate passing of Ilia, the news coverage pertaining to his assassination was primarily limited to a single newspaper called Isari (ისარი). Notably, Isari, despite being a relatively small publication, provided extensive coverage of the incident. Surprisingly, larger mainstream newspapers did not report on the intricate details surrounding Ilia&#x27;s assassination.

===Investigation===

In 1907, the Tsarist authorities launched investigation into Chavchavadze&#x27;s death and arrested four suspects: Giorgi Khizanishvili, Ivane Inashvili, Gigola Modzghvrishvili and Tedo Labauri. One suspect (Gigla Berbichashvili, the head of the crew) went into hiding in Iran, while another one (Pavle Aptsiauri) died during clashes with the police. According to investigation, during the incident Chavchavadze appealed to the crew: &quot;Do not shoot, I am Ilia&quot;, while Gigla replied: &quot;That&#x27;s why we have to shoot you&quot;. In 1909, according to the decision of the Stolypin tribunal, the entire gang was sentenced to capital punishment. Following the October Revolution, Gigla Berbichashvili returned to Georgia in 1921 and worked in the various positions within the Soviet Georgian government. In 1936, the investigation was launched against him for participating the murder of Ilia Chavchavadze. In December 1941, he was tried in the court, which sentenced him to capital punishment in January 1942. However, this was later changed to 10 years imprisonment.

===Theories===
The assassination of Ilia Chavchavadze remains controversial today. The Tsarist investigation concluded that the murderers were part of Bolshevik &quot;Red Squad&quot;, while the Soviet investigation blamed the Tsarist secret police and administration for being involved in the assassination. The unofficial versions mostly blame Bolsheviks as well as Mensheviks for orchestrating the murder. Chavchavadze had publicly and very successfully undermined the growth of both Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the Social Democratic Labour Party. Furthermore, Prince Chavchavadze&#x27;s Orthodox Christian and socially conservative vision for Georgian nationalism and his enormous popularity and influence upon the Georgian people may have been additional causes. Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore suspects, while Prince Chavchavadze&#x27;s assassination may have been a rare instance of cooperation between the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions of the SDLP, that Joseph Stalin may have been at least tangentially involved in the murder of his former publisher and literary mentor.

According to Montefiore: &quot;The Bolshevik position in Georgia was undermined by the assassination of the hugely popular Prince Ilya Chavchavadze, in August 1907. The Bolsheviks had attacked his patriarchal vision of Georgian culture and, it was widely believed, had decided to kill him. There is some evidence that Stalin&#x27;s friends Sergo Ordzhonikidze and Filipp Makharadze organized or took part in the assassination. It may be that the SDs took no part in the murder at all. Stalin always praised Chavchavadze&#x27;s poetry in his old age and there is no evidence that he ordered the hit, but he was very close to Sergo and he was certainly more than capable of separating literary merit from cruel necessity: politics always came first.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Ilia Chavchavadze is considered to be &quot;the founding father of modern Georgian nation&quot;. Ilia&#x27;s legacy of national awakening earned him the everlasting admiration of the Georgian people and the title of &quot;Uncrowned King of the Nation.&quot; His work was acknowledged in his lifetime, as well as Soviet period. His legacy is cherished in modern-day Georgia too. In 1937, the Soviet authorities celebrated the hundredth anniversary of Ilia Chavchavadze. During Soviet times, Chavchavadze&#x27;s rejection and criticism of serfdom was particularly emphasized.

After the Soviet invasion of Georgia and the nation&#x27;s annexation into the Soviet Union in 1921, Chavchavadze became for Georgian nationalists the symbol of Georgian freedom and national liberation. In 1987, Chavchavadze was formally canonized by the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church, as &quot;Saint Ilia the Righteous.&quot; In October 1987 the Ilia Chavchavadze Society, an organisation that promoted Georgian national revival and political independence, was established by Soviet dissident intellectuals. In 1989, during the anti-Soviet protests in Tbilisi, the poems, novels and political beliefs of Prince Ilia Chavchavadze became a driving force behind the Georgian struggle for independence.

In 1998, Stephen Kinzer wrote about the widespread admiration of Chavchavadze across the political spectrum: &quot;Today leftists in Georgia embrace Chavchavadze for his hatred of injustice, centrists love him for his nonviolent humanism, and right-wing nationalists have adopted his slogan &quot;Motherland, Language, Faith.&quot;&quot; Faith, in this context, exclusively means Georgian Orthodoxy.

In 2006, Ilia State University was named after Ilia Chavchavadze. Various streets and avenues are also named after him, including Tbilisi&#x27;s central avenue, Ilia Chavchavadze Avenue. Chavchavadze&#x27;s main works, including his &quot;Is a man a human?!&quot;, are taught in Georgian schools within &quot;Georgian Language and Literature&quot; classes.

<doc id="399372" wikidata="Q1934708" url="?curid=399372" title="Public holidays in the United States">
<text>In the United States, public holidays are set by federal, state, and local governments and are often observed by closing government offices or giving government employees paid time off. The federal government does not require private businesses to close or offer paid time off, as is the case for most state and local governments, so employers determine which holidays to observe.

Several federal holidays are widely observed by private businesses with paid time off. These include New Year&#x27;s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Businesses often close or grant paid time off for New Year&#x27;s Eve, Christmas Eve, and the Day after Thanksgiving, but none of these are federal holidays. Other federal holidays are less widely observed by businesses. Most federal holidays are celebrated on a Monday or Friday to create a three-day weekend. 

Christmas is the only religious holiday that is a federal holiday. Some businesses allow religious employees to take paid time off for religious observances.

Other holidays, such as Halloween and Valentine&#x27;s Day, are widely celebrated in the United States but rarely include paid time off.

== Overview ==

There are no national holidays on which the law requires all businesses to close. Federal holidays are only established for certain federally chartered and regulated businesses, government contractors, and the city of Washington, DC. All other public holidays are created by the States. Most states allow local jurisdictions, cities, villages, etc., to establish local holidays. As a result, holidays have not historically been governed at the federal level, and federal law does not govern business openings.

Many states have additional holidays that the federal government does not observe. Most prominent among these are holidays to celebrate statehood. Since 2000, some city and state-level celebrations of Malcolm X Day and Rosa Parks Day have been created, in addition to the federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to honor and recognize African American contributions to the United States. Missouri honors Rosa Parks on her birthday. 

Colorado became the first state to establish a paid state holiday honoring a woman in 2020 with the designation of the first Monday in October as Frances Xavier Cabrini Day.
Many businesses observe certain holidays, which are also not mandated by any government agency. Many workplaces celebrate religious observance as well as ethnic holidays, such as Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, Kwanzaa, Diwali, Mardi Gras, and Cinco de Mayo, as a matter of best practice.

While the popularity of each public holiday cannot easily be measured, the holiday with the highest greeting card sales is Christmas. Major retail establishments, such as shopping malls and centers, close only on Thanksgiving and Christmas, but remain open on all other holidays, with early closings on Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve, and sometimes on other major holidays. In the face of a rapidly tightening retail market in the 2010s, retailers have increasingly been opening on Thanksgiving evening and night to extend Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, however, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly limited this practice. 

Virtually all large companies observe and close on the major holidays (New Year&#x27;s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). Some non-retail businesses close the day after Thanksgiving, while others, such as federal banks and post offices, are not allowed to close that day. Some smaller businesses normally open on Sundays will close on Easter Sunday if they expect to have very few customers that day.

=== Holiday business restrictions ===
Some states restrict certain business activities on some holidays. Business closures are mandated on a few holidays in some states for certain kinds of businesses by blue laws. For example, businesses that operate on more than cannot open on Thanksgiving in some New England states. The most notable businesses to close on such occasions are car dealerships and liquor stores. Some holidays are observed with community service, depending on the meaning of the holiday. Service is not mandated by any government agencies, whether they be federal, state, or local.

== Federal holidays ==
The following federal holidays are observed by the majority of private businesses with paid time off:
* New Year&#x27;s Day (January 1)
* Memorial Day (May 25–31, floating Monday)
* Independence Day (July 4)
* Labor Day (September 1–7, floating Monday)
* Thanksgiving (November 22–28, floating Thursday)
* Christmas (December 25)

Other federal holidays are less widely observed by businesses. These include:
* Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 15–21, floating Monday)
* Washington&#x27;s Birthday (February 15–21, floating Monday)
* Juneteenth (June 19)
* Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day/Columbus Day (October 8–14, floating Monday)
* Veterans Day (November 11)

Established in 2021, Juneteenth is the newest federal holiday. In its second year of federal observance, 30% of private employers offered paid time off.

== Holidays with religious significance ==

Religious and cultural holidays in the United States are characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. However, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...&quot; and Article VI specifies that &quot;no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.&quot; As a result, various religious faiths have flourished, as well as perished, in the United States. In 2002, a majority of Americans reported that religion plays a &quot;very important&quot; role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed nations.

In 2012, the majority of Americans (73–80%) identified themselves as Christians and about 15–20% had no religious affiliation. In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), 76% of American adults population identified themselves as Christians, with 51% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant or unaffiliated, and 25% professing Catholic beliefs. The same survey said that other religions (including, for example, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism) collectively made up about 4% of the adult population, another 15% of the adult population claimed no religious affiliation, and 5.2% said they did not know, or they refused to reply. In a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36 percent of Americans stated that they attended services nearly every week or more.

=== Christian holidays ===

With 65% of adults in the U.S. identifying as Christian in 2019, many holidays from the liturgical calendar are observed by this segment of the population. Many businesses, as well as federal, state, and local governments, are closed on Christmas. A reference in the film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; shows a Chinese restaurant being the only establishment open on Christmas.

Some private businesses and certain other institutions are closed on Good Friday (, , , ). The financial market and stock market is closed on Good Friday. Most retail stores remain open, although some might close early. Public schools and most universities are closed on Good Friday, either as a holiday of its own, or part of spring break. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.

Many companies, including banks, malls, shopping centers, and most private retail stores that normally open on Sundays are closed on Easter (, , , ).

=== Hindu holidays ===
The Hindu holidays of Diwali and Holi are celebrated in some parts of the United States, mostly by Indian Americans or peoples of Indian descent. Holi, the &quot;festival of colors&quot; has inspired a Broadway musical based on this festival. While not officially recognized in most of the United States, the New York City Council officially recognized these as official school holidays in New York City. CNN reported that the Diwali holiday is shown in American pop culture through an episode of &quot;The Office&quot;.

=== Jewish holidays ===
The three most commonly celebrated Jewish holidays are Passover (), Rosh Hashanah (), and Yom Kippur (). Passover, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, and Hanukkah () are recognized as an optional state level holiday in Texas. All Jewish holidays start the night before, as that is when the Jewish day begins.

=== Islamic holidays ===

The major Islamic holidays of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha have been recognized in the United States. Awareness of these holidays can be found in calendars published by major calendar manufacturers. According to Al-Jazeera, schools in New York and Michigan (mainly Dearborn) may begin to close in observance of all Muslim holidays.

== Holidays with other cultural or historical significance ==

=== Drinking holidays ===
According to the National Institutes of Health, about 86% of the population over 18 drinks alcohol recreationally or socially. In the United States, the holidays that are considered the most &quot;festive&quot; are generally regarded as some of the &quot;most drunken holidays&quot;. Celebrations usually revolve around barbecues and beer. Although many of these holidays lack any official status, they are generally observed by the drinking culture for the fact that these holidays revolve around drinking. 

One measurement of the popularity of these holidays is the amount of alcohol purchased for the occasion. One survey names New Year&#x27;s Eve as the holiday on which the most alcohol is consumed based on sales. While many holidays are listed, some are generally notable for their drinking requirement while others are known for abstinence.

=== African American holidays ===
Some holidays in the United States celebrate or recognize the struggle of African-Americans for emancipation from slavery and civil rights. Two holidays are celebrated as Federal holidays: 
* Martin Luther King Jr. Day, observed on the Monday falling on or between January 15–21, commemorates the birthday of Dr. King, a significant leader of the Civil Rights Movement. The holiday was established federally in 1983 and first officially celebrated in 1986; efforts to create the holiday faced strong opposition and some southern states paired the new holiday with a holiday honoring the Confederacy
* Juneteenth, observed on June 19, commemorates the announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas in June 1865, and more generally the emancipation of enslaved African-Americans. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;June&quot; and &quot;nineteenth&quot; and has been a federal holiday since 2021.

Some states and cities have additional holidays honoring African-Americans:
* Emancipation Day, observed in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands on various days based on when enslaved people were emancipated in those jurisdictions
* Harriet Tubman Day, observed in New York and in some parts of Maryland on March 10
* Malcolm X Day, observed in Illinois and Berkeley, California, on May 19; also celebrated in cities such as Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. as an unofficial holiday
* Rosa Parks Day, observed in Missouri on February 4, in California and Michigan on the following Monday, and in Ohio on December 1

A significant African-American cultural celebration is Kwanzaa, observed from December 26 to January 1. Created by Maulana Karenga in 1966, the holiday honors African heritage in African-American culture.

=== Confederate holidays ===
Some states celebrate holidays honoring the Confederate States of America that seceded from the United States. Many of these state holidays were created in the early twentieth century, fifty years after the end of the Civil War, as part of the myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.
* Confederate Memorial (or Heroes) Day is observed in Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana and Texas on various days.
* Robert E. Lee Day (on or around Lee&#x27;s Jan 19 birthday) is still observed in Alabama and Mississippi combined with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the only remaining states to do so. It is officially recognized in Florida, but is not widely observed there. Arkansas combined the observance of Robert E. Lee Day with Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1985. In 2017, the state passed a law removing Lee&#x27;s name from the January holiday and instead establishing a state memorial day on the second Saturday of October in honor of Lee.
* Confederate History Month has been declared at least once in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia as well as by various cities, usually in April to augment Confederate Memorial Day.

=== Other traditional and informal holidays ===

In addition to the federal/national holidays, many religious, ethnic, and other traditional holidays populate the calendar, as well as lighter celebrations. These are rarely observed by businesses as holidays; indeed, many are viewed as opportunities for commercial promotion. Because of this commercialization, some critics apply the deprecatory term &quot;Hallmark holiday&quot; to such days, after the Hallmark greeting card company.

<doc id="399385" wikidata="Q662801" url="?curid=399385" title="Iowa Writers' Workshop">
<text>The Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, at the University of Iowa, is a graduate-level creative writing program. At 89 years, it is the oldest writing program offering a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in the United States. Its acceptance rate is between 2.7% and 3.7%. On the university&#x27;s behalf, the workshop administers the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism and the Iowa Short Fiction Award.

The workshop&#x27;s current director is the writer Lan Samantha Chang, under whom its endowment has grown from $2.6 million to $12.5 million.

== History ==
In 1897, theater producer George Cram Cook began teaching a class called &quot;Verse-Making&quot;, effectively the University of Iowa&#x27;s first creative writing class. In 1922, Dean Carl Seashore of the University of Iowa Graduate College allowed creative writing to be accepted as theses for advanced degrees. Later, the School of Letters began selecting students for writing courses in which they were tutored by resident and visiting writers. The Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop began as an official program in 1936, with Wilbur Schramm as its first director.

Under Paul Engle, its second director from 1941 to 1965, the program became a national landmark and was divided into fiction and poetry. He partnered with &quot;Esquire&quot; for a 1959 symposium titled &quot;The Writer in Mass Culture&quot; that included as guests Norman Mailer, Ralph Ellison, and Mark Harris, and was covered in &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In 1962, Engle and his wife, Hualing Nieh Engle, started the country&#x27;s first translation workshop, which led to the creation of the university&#x27;s MFA program in literary translation. In 1967, the couple founded the International Writing Program, and in 1976, they were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their work facilitating creative and cultural exchange through the International Writing Program. A reported over 300 writers supported them for the honor, which the Nobel Committee eventually did not give that year.

Engle secured donations for the workshop from the business community for about 20 years, including locals such as Maytag and Quaker Oats, as well as U.S. Steel and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Between 1953 and 1956, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $40,000. Henry Luce, the publisher of &quot;TIME&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines, and Gardner Cowles Jr., who published &quot;Look&quot; magazine, provided publicity for the workshop&#x27;s events.

Subsequent directors were George Starbuck (1965–69), John Leggett (1969–86), and Frank Conroy (1987–2005), whose 19 years at the helm made him the longest-serving director.

Lan Samantha Chang was appointed the Workshop&#x27;s sixth director in 2006. She is the program&#x27;s first female, first Asian American, and first nonwhite director, and has held the role for 17 years.

=== Locations ===
The Writers&#x27; Workshop originated in temporary military barracks-style buildings near the Iowa River, the present location of the Iowa Memorial Union, but in 1966 moved to the English-Philosophy Building. In 1997, it moved to its current location, Dey House. The Glenn Schaeffer Library and Archives, an extension including a library and reading room, classrooms, and faculty offices, was added to Dey House in 2006.

== Organization ==

=== Methodology ===
The Workshop was formed by Norman Foerster&#x27;s passionate support for creative writing and Wilbur Schramm&#x27;s conviction that writing should be as technical and rigorous a pursuit as any traditional literature degree. The workshop model for higher education creative writing was created in that pursuit of technical intensity. The model constantly exposed students to outside opinions on their fiction and created a pressurized atmosphere that forced students to rein in their emotional reactions and consider their work analytically. The Workshop operated without the characteristic assumption of the time that artists needed to be unleashed, instead opting to focus and refine them. While intended to serve fiction writers, the Workshop began to change in the 1970s when its first nonfiction thesis was accepted. Ever since, the Workshop has produced many literary journalists and shaped public perception of creative nonfiction.

=== Curriculum and courses ===
The program&#x27;s curriculum requires students to take a small number of classes each semester, including the Graduate Fiction Workshop or Graduate Poetry Workshop and one or two additional literature seminars. These requirements are meant to prepare students for the realities of professional writing, where self-discipline is paramount. The graduate workshop courses meet weekly. Before each three-hour class, a small number of students submit material for critical reading by their peers. The class consists of a round-table discussion during which the students and the instructor discuss each piece. How classes are conducted varies by teacher and between poetry and fiction. The ideal result is not only that writers come away with insights into their work&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, but that the class as a whole derives insight, whether general or specific, about the process of writing.

When the Workshop received the National Humanities Medal in 2002, then director Conroy explained its ethos: &quot;It is a focused program, like Juilliard. We read constantly, rereading the classics. They can write anything they want. We teach them what we&#x27;ve learned as writers.&quot;

In a 2022 interview, Chang said: We don&#x27;t have a quota about where people are from or what kind of writing they do. What we look for is work that is filled with energy, work that interests us. I&#x27;m sure, every year, there are many, many very good writers who go elsewhere because we don&#x27;t admit them. But we try to be very open. I would say that we look for work that excites us. Frank Conroy used to describe it as feeling someone reaching off the page at you when you&#x27;re reading, feeling tension in the language.

=== Faculty and alumni ===
Former faculty have included Kurt Vonnegut, Richard Yates, Philip Roth, John Cheever, and Marilynne Robinson.

As of January 2023, the workshop&#x27;s faculty are Jamel Brinkley, Charles D&#x27;Ambrosio, Margot Livesey, and Ladee Hubbard in fiction; Ethan Canin in English and creative writing; James Galvin, Mark Levine, Tracie Morris, Elizabeth Willis in poetry; and Program Director Lan Samantha Chang. Visiting faculty are Alexia Arthurs, Tom Drury and Amy Parker.

== Reputation and influence ==
In 1986, during the 50th anniversary of the Workshop, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;At 50, the Iowa workshop is something of a dowager, standing unshakably in the mainstream of our literary life.&quot;

In 2019, five graduates won Guggenheim Fellowships. In April 2021, the American Academy of Arts and Letters recognized seven graduates and former faculty: five graduates and a former visiting faculty member received awards, and an alumna was elected to membership. In response to the news, Chang said: The graduates being distinguished by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2021 came to the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop over a period of more than four decades. This reflects the strength and longevity of the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop and creative writing at Iowa.

Graduates have gone on to become directors of other notable creative writing MFA programs, including Wallace Stegner at Stanford University, Eileen Pollack at the University of Michigan, Vance Bourjaily at Louisiana State University, Bret Anthony Johnston at the University of Texas, Austin&#x27;s Michener Center, and Adam Haslett at The City University of New York&#x27;s Hunter College. They have also become top editors at major publishers. These include Haki R. Madhubuti, founder of Third World Press; Jill Bialosky, executive editor and vice president at W. W. Norton &amp; Company; and Thomas Gebremedhin, vice president and executive editor of Doubleday. Among them have also been editors of major publications, including D. Herbert Lipson of &quot;Ebony&quot;, and curators, such as Christine Kuan, former CEO and director of Sotheby&#x27;s Institute of Art New York.

On the HBO show &quot;Girls&quot;, the character Hannah Horvath enrolls in the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop.

<text>Margaret Widdemer (September 30, 1884 – July 14, 1978) was an American poet and novelist. She won the Pulitzer Prize (known then as the Columbia University Prize) in 1919 for her collection &quot;The Old Road to Paradise&quot;, shared with Carl Sandburg for &quot;Cornhuskers&quot;.
==Biography==
Margaret Widdemer was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Asbury Park, New Jersey, where her father, Howard T. Widdemer, was a minister of the First Congregational Church. She graduated from the Drexel Institute Library School in 1909. She first came to public attention with her poem &quot;The Factories&quot;, which treated the subject of child labor. In 1919, she married Robert Haven Schauffler (1879–1964), a widower five years her senior. Schauffler was an author and cellist who published widely on poetry, travel, culture, and music. His papers are held at the University of Texas at Austin.

Widdemer&#x27;s memoir &quot;Golden Years I Had&quot; recounts her friendships with eminent authors such as Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T. S. Eliot, Thornton Wilder, and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

Widdemer died in Gloversville, Fulton County, NY on July 14, 1978.

<text>Frederick Jay Rubin (, ; born March 10, 1963) is an American record producer. He is a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, founder of American Recordings, and former co-president of Columbia Records.

Rubin helped popularize hip hop by producing records for acts such as the Beastie Boys, Geto Boys, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, LL Cool J. He has also produced hit records for acts from a variety of other genres, such as pop (Kesha, Adele, Lady Gaga), heavy metal (Danzig, Metallica, Slayer), alternative rock (The Cult, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beabadoobee, Rage Against the Machine, the Strokes, Weezer), hard rock (Audioslave, AC/DC, Aerosmith), nu metal (Linkin Park, System of a Down, Slipknot), and country (Johnny Cash, The Avett Brothers, the Chicks).

In 2021 he co-starred in the six-part documentary miniseries &quot;McCartney 3,2,1&quot; which explores the career of Paul McCartney.

In 2007, Rubin was called &quot;the most important producer of the last 20 years&quot; by MTV and was named on &quot;Time&quot; list of the &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot;.

==Early life==
Frederick Jay Rubin was born into a Jewish family in Long Beach, New York, on March 10, 1963, the son of housewife Linda and shoe wholesaler Michael Rubin. He grew up in Lido Beach. While a student at Long Beach High School, Rubin befriended the school&#x27;s audiovisual department director, who gave him a few lessons in guitar playing and songwriting. He then played in a band with three friends, performing at garage gigs and school shows until a teacher helped him create a punk band called the Pricks. Their biggest claim to fame was being thrown off the stage at CBGB after performing two songs due to brawling with hecklers, which had actually been instigated by friends of the band who had been instructed to do so to get the show shut down and create a buzz. Although he had no authority in New York City, his father traveled to Manhattan wearing his Long Beach auxiliary police uniform as he attempted to &quot;shut down&quot; the show.

== Career ==
=== Def Jam ===
Rubin founded Def Jam Recordings while in college at New York University. He moved on to form the band Hose, influenced by San Francisco&#x27;s Flipper, where he played guitar. In 1982, a Hose track became Def Jam&#x27;s first release, a 45 rpm 7&quot; vinyl single in a brown paper bag, and no label. The band played in and around the NYC punk scene, toured the Midwest and California, and played with seminal hardcore bands like Meat Puppets, Hüsker Dü, Circle Jerks, Butthole Surfers, and Minor Threat, becoming friends with Fugazi frontman and Dischord Records owner Ian MacKaye. The band broke up in 1984 as Rubin&#x27;s passion moved toward the NYC hip hop scene.

Having befriended Zulu Nation&#x27;s DJ Jazzy Jay, Rubin began to learn about hip hop production. By 1983, the two had produced &quot;It&#x27;s Yours&quot; for Bronx rapper T La Rock, and released it on Def Jam. Producer Arthur Baker helped to distribute the record worldwide on Baker&#x27;s Streetwise Records in 1984. Jazzy Jay introduced Rubin to concert promoter/artist manager Russell Simmons in the Negril club, and Rubin explained he needed help getting Def Jam off the ground. Simmons and Rubin edged out Jazzy Jay and the official Def Jam record label was founded while Rubin was attending New York University in 1984. Its first release was LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;I Need a Beat&quot;. Rubin went on to find more hip-hop acts outside the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Harlem, including rappers from Queens, Staten Island, and Long Island, which eventually led to Def Jam&#x27;s signing of Public Enemy. Rubin was instrumental in pointing the members of the Beastie Boys away from their punk roots and into rap, resulting in Kate Schellenbach&#x27;s departure from the group. The Beastie Boys&#x27; 1985 &quot;Rock Hard&quot;/&quot;Party&#x27;s Gettin&#x27; Rough&quot;/&quot;Beastie Groove&quot; EP came out on the success of Rubin&#x27;s production work with breakthrough act Run-DMC, of which previous recordings were produced by Simmons and Orange Krush&#x27;s musician Larry Smith. His productions were characterized by occasionally fusing rap with heavy rock. Rubin tapped Adam Dubin and Ric Menello to co-direct the videos for the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot; and &quot;No Sleep till Brooklyn&quot;, effectively launching the band&#x27;s mainstream hip hop career.

It was the idea of Rubin&#x27;s friend Sue Cummings, an editor at &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, to have Run-DMC and Aerosmith collaborate on a cover of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. This 1986 production is often credited with both introducing rap hard rock to mainstream ears and revitalizing Aerosmith&#x27;s career. In 1986, he worked with Aerosmith again on demos for their forthcoming album, but their collaboration ended early and resulted in only rough studio jams. In the same year, Rubin began his long musical partnership with Slayer, producing &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, considered a classic of the heavy metal genre. This was his first work with a metal band.

In 1987, the Cult released its pivotal third album, &quot;Electric&quot;. Produced by Rubin, the album remains one of the Cult&#x27;s trademark and classic works. Rubin worked with the Cult again on the 1992 single &quot;The Witch&quot;. He is credited as music supervisor for the film &quot;Less than Zero&quot; and as the producer of its soundtrack. Rubin portrayed a character based on himself in the 1985 hip-hop motion picture &quot;Krush Groove&quot;, which was inspired by the early days of Simmons&#x27;s career as an artist manager and music producer. He then directed and co-wrote (with Ric Menello) a second Run–DMC film, &quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot; in 1988.

In 1988, Rubin and Simmons went their separate ways after Rubin had a falling out with then Def Jam president Lyor Cohen. Rubin left for Los Angeles to start Def American Records, while Simmons remained at Def Jam in New York. In Los Angeles, Rubin signed a number of rock and heavy metal acts, including Danzig, Masters of Reality, the Four Horsemen, and Wolfsbane, as well as alternative rock group the Jesus and Mary Chain and stand-up comedian Andrew Dice Clay. Though Rubin&#x27;s work at this time focused mainly on rock and metal, he still retained a close association with rap, signing the Geto Boys and continuing to work with Public Enemy, LL Cool J, and Run-DMC.

=== American Recordings ===
Rubin had originally given his new label the name &quot;Def American Recordings&quot;. In 1993, he found that the word &quot;&quot; had been accepted into the standardized dictionary and held an actual funeral for the word, complete with a casket, grave, celebrity mourners, and a eulogy by Al Sharpton. Def American became American Recordings. Rubin has said: &quot;When advertisers and the fashion world co-opted the image of hippies, a group of the original hippies in San Francisco literally buried the image of the hippie. When &#x27;def&#x27; went from street lingo to mainstream, it defeated its purpose.&quot;

The first major project on the renamed label was Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;American Recordings&quot; (1994), a record including six cover songs and new material written by others for Cash at Rubin&#x27;s request. The album was a critical and commercial success, and helped revive Cash&#x27;s career after a fallow period. The formula was repeated for five more Cash albums: &quot;Unchained&quot; (on which Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers served as the backing band), &quot;Solitary Man&quot;, &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; (the last album released before Cash&#x27;s death), &quot;A Hundred Highways&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Grave&quot;. &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; earned a 2003 Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance (&quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot;) and a nomination for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; with Fiona Apple). Rubin introduced Cash to Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Hurt&quot;, and the resulting cover version of it on &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; became a defining song of Cash&#x27;s later years. Rubin also produced two of Joe Strummer&#x27;s final songs, &quot;Long Shadow&quot;, a song Strummer wrote for Cash to record although he never did, and a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot;. Both were released on Strummer&#x27;s final album, &quot;Streetcore&quot;, which was released after his death. Rubin also produced a version of &quot;Redemption Song&quot; with Strummer and Cash together, which was featured in Cash&#x27;s posthumous box set, &quot;Unearthed&quot;.

Rubin has also produced a number of records with other artists, which were released on labels other than American. Arguably his biggest success as a producer came from working with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, with whom Rubin produced six studio albums from 1991 to 2011, starting with the band&#x27;s fifth release, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, which launched the band to mainstream success thanks to the hit singles &quot;Give It Away&quot; and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;. Other albums include One Hot Minute, Californication, By the Way, Stadium Arcadium and I&#x27;m With You. The six albums with the Chili Peppers also spawned 12 number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, a record the band as of 2015 still holds, and various awards, including 16 Grammy nominations (with six wins), and a Producer of the Year Grammy award for 2006&#x27;s &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;, which was also nominated for Album of the Year. The band has sold over 80 million albums worldwide, most of which are the Rubin-produced albums. Various members of the Chili Peppers have also been used on other projects by Rubin, John Frusciante featured on Johnny Cash and Chad Smith featured on the Chicks. After 24 years of working with Rubin, the band announced in late 2014 that it would be working with Danger Mouse on its 11th studio album. Rubin returned to the role of producer for the band&#x27;s two albums released in 2022, seven months apart from one another: &quot;Unlimited Love&quot; and &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot;. Again these two albums both featured no.1 singles on the Alternative Songs chart.

Rubin also produced Mick Jagger&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Wandering Spirit&quot; album, Lords of Acid&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Voodoo-U&quot; album, Tom Petty&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, AC/DC&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;, Donovan&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Sutras&quot;, System of a Down&#x27;s 1998 &quot;System of a Down&quot;, and Metallica&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;. In 2005, Rubin executive-produced Shakira&#x27;s two-album project &quot;Fijación Oral Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Oral Fixation, Vol. 2&quot;. He was to appear on the Talib Kweli&#x27;s album &quot;Eardrum&quot;, Clipse&#x27;s album &quot;Til the Casket Drops&quot; and Lil Jon&#x27;s album &quot;Crunk Rock&quot;. Rubin also produced the Jay-Z track &quot;99 Problems&quot;, and was featured in the song&#x27;s video. He also worked with Eminem on the song and music video &quot;Berzerk&quot;.

Rubin produced Black Sabbath&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;13&quot; and Billy Corgan&#x27;s comeback solo album &quot;Ogilala&quot;.

=== Universal Records ===

In 2003 Rubin produced The Mars Volta debut album &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;.

=== Columbia ===
In May 2007, Rubin was named co-head of Columbia Records. He co-produced Linkin Park&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot; with Mike Shinoda. Rubin and Shinoda have since co-produced the band&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot; and its 2012 release &quot;Living Things&quot;.

In 2007, Rubin won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for his work with the Chicks, Michael Kranz, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, Green Day, and Johnny Cash released in 2006. Rubin won the award again in 2009, for production work for Metallica, Neil Diamond, Ours, Jakob Dylan, and Weezer in 2008.

In 2007 and 2012, Rubin won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The former was for his work on the Chicks album &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot; and the latter came for his contribution to Adele&#x27;s album &quot;21&quot;.

=== Post-Columbia ===
Rubin left Columbia in 2012, and revived the American Recordings imprint through a deal with Republic Records. The first albums released under this new deal were ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;La Futura&quot; and the Avett Brothers&#x27; &quot;The Carpenter&quot;.

Rubin attempted to record a cover album with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash in 2012, but the brief sessions were unsuccessful. Graham Nash called the sessions &quot;irritable&quot; and &quot;not a great experience&quot;.

In July 2021, Rubin signed with Endeavor Content to further develop his home studio, Shangri-La Recording Studios.

== Other work ==
Rubin has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27;s book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;, and often gives advice on creativity via his Instagram page.

Rubin&#x27;s debut book, published on January 17, 2023, by Penguin Press, is &quot;The Creative Act: A Way of Being&quot;. It is a nonfiction work about creativity. He said, &quot;I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be.&quot;

In 2023, he started hosting a podcast titled &quot;Tetragrammaton&quot; on Apple Podcasts, which mainly featured interviews.

== Production style ==
===Praise===
Rubin&#x27;s biggest trademark as a producer has been a &quot;stripped-down&quot; sound, which involves eliminating production elements such as string sections, backup vocals, and reverb, and instead having naked vocals and bare instrumentation. But by the 2000s, Rubin&#x27;s style included such elements, as noted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;As the track reaches a crescendo and [Neil] Diamond&#x27;s portentous baritone soars over a swelling string arrangement, Rubin leans back, as though floored by the emotional power of the song.&quot;

Of Rubin&#x27;s production methods, Dan Charnas, a music journalist who worked as vice president of A&amp;R (Artists &amp; Repertoire) and marketing at American Recordings in the 1990s, said, &quot;He&#x27;s fantastic with sound and arrangements, and he&#x27;s tremendous with artists. They love him. He shows them how to make it better, and he gets more honest and exciting performances out of people than anyone.&quot; Natalie Maines of the Chicks has praised his production methods, saying, &quot;He has the ability and the patience to let music be discovered, not manufactured. Come to think of it, maybe he is a guru.&quot; Producer Dr. Dre has said that Rubin is &quot;hands down, the dopest producer ever that anyone would ever want to be, ever&quot;.

Despite having never worked with Rubin, British band Muse praised him for his &quot;hands off&quot; approach to production and credited him as an influence on its first self-produced album, &quot;The Resistance&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Uprising&quot;, was named UK Single of the Year at the 2010 Music Producers Guild Awards, and Muse frontman Matt Bellamy while accepting the award said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank John Leckie for teaching us how to produce and Rick Rubin for teaching us how not to produce.&quot; The statement was initially interpreted as a criticism of Rubin, but Bellamy later clarified it was meant as a self-deprecating comment on the band&#x27;s similarly &quot;hands-off&quot; attitude to production.

===Criticism===
In 2014, Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor said that he met Rubin only four times during the entire recording process of &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;: &quot;We were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you&#x27;re going to produce something, you&#x27;re fucking there. I don&#x27;t care who you are! [...] The Rick Rubin of today is a shadow of the Rick Rubin that he was. He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again.&quot; Taylor expressed regret for those comments in 2016, and said he wanted to make amends with Rubin, attributing the friction to being &quot;freshly sober [...] unsure of [himself]&quot; and to never having previously worked with anyone whose methods were like Rubin&#x27;s.

In 2019, when comparing Rubin to Greg Fidelman (who had recently produced Slipknot&#x27;s album &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot;), Taylor again criticized Rubin for his absences from the studio due to other work commitments. He said that Rubin was &quot;a nice guy, absolutely nice guy&quot; but claimed that &quot;he just wasn&#x27;t fucking there&quot; and that the band did not see him more than once a week until they finished recording the vocals at his house.

In 2022, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler said of Rubin&#x27;s production of the band&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;13&quot;: &quot;Some of it I liked, some of it I didn&#x27;t like particularly. It was a weird experience, especially with being told to forget that you&#x27;re a heavy metal band. That was the first thing [Rubin] said to us. He played us our very first album, and he said, &#x27;Cast your mind back to then when there was no such thing as heavy metal or anything like that, and pretend it&#x27;s the follow-up album to that,&#x27; which is a ridiculous thing to think.&quot; Butler also stated that vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and guitarist Tony Iommi had frustrations with Rubin&#x27;s suggestions, and said: &quot;I still don&#x27;t know what [Rubin] did. It&#x27;s, like, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s good.&#x27; &#x27;No, don&#x27;t do that.&#x27; And you go, &#x27;Why?&#x27; [And he&#x27;d say], &#x27;Just don&#x27;t do it.

====Loudness war====
Since at least 1999, listeners have criticized Rubin for contributing to a phenomenon in music known as the loudness war, in which the dynamic range of recorded music is compressed and sometimes clipped in order to increase the general loudness. Albums Rubin produced that have been criticized for such treatment include:

* &quot;Californication&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (1999) – Tim Anderson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized its &quot;excessive compression and distortion&quot;, and &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said it suffered from so much digital clipping that &quot;even non-audiophile consumers complained about it&quot;.
* &quot;Death Magnetic&quot; by Metallica (2008) – a remixed/remastered version of the entire album was released as downloadable content for the video game &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;. Songs that are used in rhythm games such as &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; are always remixed/remastered by the game studios, despite that this edition of the album was released for gameplay instead of casual listening, fans have said that the mix of &quot;Death Magnetic&quot; found on the game is preferred because it consequently is not subject to the same level of compression as the official commercially released record.
* &quot;13&quot; by Black Sabbath (2013) – Ben Ratliff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;The new Black Sabbath album was produced by Rick Rubin, who some believe to be a prime offender in the recent history of highly compressed and loudly mastered music – a major cause of ear fatigue ... &quot;13&quot; is mastered loudly, too ... Your ears aren&#x27;t given room to breathe.&quot; Jon Hadusek of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;Rubin ... deserves disparagement for the way he mixed the audio levels, which are crushed by distortion and compression. Otherwise well-recorded songs are blemished, an affliction all too pervasive in the modern music industry&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Rubin has practiced meditation since he was 14 years old.

Rubin began dating former actress and model Mourielle Hurtado Herrera in 2010, and they were married at an unknown date. They have a son born in 2017 and reside in Malibu, California.

Rubin was a vegan for over 20 years, but later began eating meat again. He is a fan of professional wrestling and held season tickets to WWE events at Madison Square Garden throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He has cited wrestlers Roddy Piper and Ric Flair as influences on his work, and has said that villainous wrestlers were hugely influential in the development of the Beastie Boys&#x27; public image. He financially backed wrestling promoter Jim Cornette&#x27;s company Smoky Mountain Wrestling from 1991 to 1995.

<text>Avram Iancu Cluj International Airport is an airport serving the city of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Initially known as &quot;Someșeni Airport&quot;, it is located east of the city centre, in the Someșeni area, which is now within the Cluj-Napoca city limits. The airport is named in honour of Romanian revolutionary Avram Iancu.

In terms of passenger traffic, Cluj Airport is the second busiest airport in Romania, after Bucharest Henri Coandă, handling 3.24 million passengers in 2023. Its size and location (on the European route E576 and close to the A3 Transylvania Motorway) make it the most important airport in the historical region of Transylvania.

==History==
===Early years===

The Cluj Airport was founded on 1 April 1932 by the Romanian Ministry of Industry and Trade. Until the civil airport was built, the area was used as a military airfield. On 15 December 1917, the County Council of Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca) gave land in the settlement of Szamosfalva (today the Someșeni district of Cluj-Napoca) in order to develop a military airport. After the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Someșeni Military Aerodrome was used for the first civil operations by the National Service of Air Navigation (). The SNNA was set up in 1928 by the Romanian Ministry of War for opening an air transportation line between Cluj and Bucharest. The first passenger plane landed on 2 August 1928. The first aircraft used was the Farman-Goliath aircraft, a twin-engine plane with space for ten passengers built by the Farman Aviation Works. Later, the Bucharest-Cluj service was operated by LARES (&quot;Liniile Aeriene Române Exploatate de Stat&quot;, Romanian Airlines Operated by the State) with Junkers F 13 planes.

In 1933, Cluj Airport was declared an International Airport by the Romanian Government. The first international flight, a CSA Czech Airlines Prague-Cluj-Bucharest flight, took place on 11 September 1933. The aircraft used on this route were eight-seat Avia-Fokker aircraft. In the following years, several new routes were opened, such as the Aeroflot Moscow-Cluj-Prague flight, opened on 15 November 1935, which was operated with 14-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-2 twin-engine aircraft, registered as USSR-M25 and USSR-M26. Domestic flights were also operated in this period, such as Cluj-Satu-Mare and Cernăuți-Cluj-Arad using Lockheed Model 10 Electra ten-passenger aircraft and de Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft. In the late 1930s, the airport recorded steady growth and the employees&#x27; number rose from 6 in 1934 to 16 in 1939. The passenger terminal was also built in this period, being inaugurated in 1939.

During World War II, the airport became again a military airport, as it was considered to be the most important in Transylvania. In 1940, as a result of the Second Vienna Award, Northern Transylvania (including Cluj) was ceded to Hungary and thus the airport was used by the Hungarian Air Force and German Luftwaffe. Malert airline also operated flights to Budapest during these years. In October 1944, the Hungarian forces in the city were defeated by the Romanian and Soviet armies. By the time of the reconquest of the airport by the Romanian No. 4 Fighting Squadron &quot;Focșani&quot;, in late September 1944, the airport was completely destroyed.

After the war, the airport&#x27;s operations were resumed with TAROM domestic flights connecting Cluj to other major Romanian cities. The aircraft used were the Lisunov Li-2 / Douglas DC-3 and Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft. In the 1960s, an extensive modernization of the airport began. In 1969, a new passenger terminal was opened. By 1970, the airport was fully equipped with all of the safety facilities.

===Development since the 1990s===
The airport remained a domestic airport until September 1996, when it was once again opened to both international passenger and cargo traffic. The extension of the terminal building was also started in 1996 and since August 1997, it is run by the Cluj County Council. By 2001, the extension of the airport building was finished, the runway lighting system was modernized, and an Instrument Landing System (ILS) CAT I was iinstalled.

In 2007 and 2008, the airport posted year-over-year growth of 60% and 93% respectively, reaching over 750,000 passengers in 2008.

The construction of a new terminal, capable of handling 2 million passengers annually, started on 26 June 2007. The arrivals hall was inaugurated on 22 May 2008, followed by the new departures hall, with a total area of , inaugurated on 15 May 2009. The connecting building between the two terminals was inaugurated in November 2009. The total project cost was an estimated €40 million. In February 2009, the ILS equipment was upgraded to CAT II.

Cluj Airport exceeded the 1,000,000 passenger mark in 2010. On 8 September 2011, the construction works for building a new runway of began. The works represented the first phase of the investment that aims at a take-off/landing runway of . The new runway 07/25 officially went into operation on 26 October 2013. The old runway 08/26 became a taxiway, after the new runway opened.

In 2014, ROMATSA held a competition for the creation of a new control tower for Cluj-Napoca Airport. Of the 22 projects that were submitted in the competition, as winner the project of Outline Architecture Office was chosen, an architectural design office based in Bucharest. The tower resembles a tulnic and will have a height of 42 m. The costs for the construction of the new control tower will be borne by ROMATSA.

In June 2023, the airport began works to expand the departure hall and the apron. Expected to open on 31 May 2024, the extension will add three more gates to the current nine.

On 24 November 2023 the Avram Iancu Cluj International Airport celebrated the first time in his history the passenger with the number 3,000,000 registered during one year and becomes the first regional airport in Romania to exceed this significant passenger threshold.

For the future, the airport development project foresees the construction of the second terminal with an area of .

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 5 September 1986 at about 19:45, a fully loaded Antonov An-24RV aircraft departed Bucharest Otopeni Airport, bound for Cluj-Napoca. When the landing procedure began, one of the flight attendants, Aurelia Grigore, realized that the aircraft was landing at higher than normal speed. When the main landing gear touched the ground, it bounced repeatedly until the aircraft stopped. The front of the aircraft was on fire. Grigore realized they had an emergency situation. With her flight attendant colleague, she decided to start deplaning passengers. She opened the emergency exit and she let the stairs down, but the stairs weren&#x27;t touching the ground because the front gear was broken. She was helped by Emil Hossu, a famous actor. &quot;He was one of the few people that didn&#x27;t panic and helped us evacuate the aircraft in safety&quot;, said Grigore. After evacuating the passengers they returned to help the pilots who were trapped in the cockpit. &quot;The cockpit was on fire and we lost any faith that we could save them&quot;. The next moments were horrible for all passengers and flight crew. The aircraft was destroyed by flames and with the pilots still on board. After 10 minutes, they saw one of the copilots trying to escape through a window. &quot;He told us his foot was stuck and that he couldn&#x27;t get it out. We tried to help him, but we couldn&#x27;t. Finally, he managed to get out of the aircraft on fire. He was completely burned, you couldn&#x27;t even look at him. It was terrible. The other 2 pilots burned alive as we watched them, helpless&quot;. The copilot died also. He was transported to the ER but died the next day because of the burns. The authorities said that the accident was due to an equipment malfunction. The 3 pilots were the only casualties.
* On 7 January 2016, a Blue Air Boeing 737-400, reg. YR-BAS, skidded off the runway after landing. No injuries were reported amongst the 116 passengers and crew. The accident&#x27;s cause was the performance of an extended flare flight, followed by the runway touchdown at a distance of about 2300 ft. (approx. 700 m) measured from runway threshold 25. The wet snow layer present on the runway may have contributed to the accident.

<doc id="399402" wikidata="Q191753" url="?curid=399402" title="Cinderella (1950 film)">
<text>Cinderella is a 1950 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on Charles Perrault&#x27;s 1697 fairy tale, it features supervision by Ben Sharpsteen. The film was directed by Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, and Clyde Geronimi. The film features the voices of Ilene Woods, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Rhoda Williams, James MacDonald, and Luis van Rooten.

During the early 1940s, Walt Disney Productions had suffered financially after losing connections to the European film markets due to the outbreak of World War II. Because of this, the studio endured commercial failures such as &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; (both 1940) and &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), all of which would later become more successful with several re-releases in theaters and on home video. By 1947, the studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Walt Disney and his animators returned to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of package films with the idea of adapting Charles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Cendrillon&quot; into an animated film.

&quot;Cinderella&quot; was released to theatres on February 15, 1950. It received critical acclaim and was a box office success, making it Disney&#x27;s biggest hit since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) and helping reverse the studio&#x27;s fortunes. It also received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Scoring of a Musical Picture, Best Sound Recording, and Best Original Song for &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot;.

The film was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;Cinderella II: Dreams Come True&quot; (2002) and &quot;Cinderella III: A Twist in Time&quot; (2007), and a live-action remake in 2015. In 2018, &quot;Cinderella&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

When Cinderella was a young girl, her widowed father marries Lady Tremaine, a widow with two daughters of her own, but dies shortly after. Jealous of her stepdaughter&#x27;s beauty and determined to forward her own daughters&#x27; interests, Lady Tremaine orders Cinderella to become a scullion in her own château, overburdening her with chores. Cinderella&#x27;s stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella, also take advantage of her meekness, mocking her and adding to her workload. Despite this, Cinderella remains kind of heart, obediently doing her chores whilst taking care of the mice and birds that live in the château, making friends of them, mainly of two mice named Jaq and Gus. She also protects them from being eaten by her stepmother&#x27;s cat Lucifer, who makes her duties even harder in retaliation.

One day, the local King becomes impatient for his son, the prince, to provide him with grandchildren and invites all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to a royal ball, so that the prince will choose one as his wife. Wanting to attend, Cinderella finds a dress of her late birth mother&#x27;s to fix up. Fearing she will upstage them at the ball, Lady Tremaine and the stepsisters deliberately keep her busy with no time to spare. Jaq, Gus, and the other animals decide to fix up the dress for Cinderella, using beads and a sash discarded by the stepsisters. However, when Cinderella attempts to go to the ball with her family, the stepsisters recognize their belongings and angrily tear the dress apart, before leaving Cinderella behind. A distraught Cinderella runs out to the garden in tears, where she is met by her fairy godmother, who has come to help. She transforms a pumpkin into a carriage; Jaq, Gus, and two other mice into horses; Cinderella&#x27;s old horse Major into a coachman; and her bloodhound Bruno into a footman. The fairy godmother also bestows Cinderella a shimmering ball gown and glass slippers, but she warns her that all the magic will end on the stroke of midnight.

Cinderella arrives at the ball, and is not recognized by the stepsisters, although Lady Tremaine believes something is familiar about her. The prince is instantly smitten, so the King orders the Grand Duke to make sure the romance goes without a hitch. The duke prevents anyone from interfering as Cinderella and the Prince dance a waltz and wander out to the palace grounds, falling deeper in love. However, when Cinderella hears the clock tolling midnight, she runs away before she and the Prince can exchange names. Despite the efforts of the Grand Duke, Cinderella flees the palace, losing one of her slippers on the staircase. The palace guards pursue, but when the magic ends on the stroke of 12, Cinderella and the animals revert to their former appearances and hide in the woods. Cinderella discovers the other glass slipper is still on her foot, and takes it home with her.

The Prince promises he will marry none but the girl who fits the glass slipper. The King orders the Grand Duke to try the shoe on every girl in the kingdom until he finds a match. When the news reaches the château, Cinderella is shocked to realize it was the Prince she met. Hearing Cinderella humming the waltz from the ball, Lady Tremaine realizes the truth and locks Cinderella in her attic bedroom. While the stepsisters unsuccessfully try on the slipper, Jaq and Gus steal the key back from Lady Tremaine. As they take the key to Cinderella, Lucifer attempts to stop them, but the birds summon Bruno who scares Lucifer out of the house. A freed Cinderella hurries to meet the Grand Duke. In a last effort to prevent Cinderella from overshadowing her daughters, Lady Tremaine deliberately causes a page to trip and break the glass slipper. Cinderella reveals she has the other slipper, which the Grand Duke places on her foot, much to Lady Tremaine&#x27;s shock. Cinderella and the Prince are married, and share a kiss as they set off in a carriage for their honeymoon.

==Production==
===Story development===
Walt Disney first adapted Charles Perrault&#x27;s 1697 fairy tale &quot;Cinderella&quot; as part of his cartoon shorts series for the Laugh-O-Gram Studio in 1922. He was interested in producing a second version in December 1933 as a &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short; Burt Gillett was attached as the director while Frank Churchill was assigned as the composer. A story outline included &quot;white mice and birds&quot; as Cinderella&#x27;s playmates. To expand the story, storyboard artists suggested visual gags, some of which ended up in the final film. However, by early 1938, the story proved to be too complicated to be condensed into a short so it was suggested as a potential animated feature film, starting with a fourteen-page outline written by Al Perkins. Two years later, a second treatment was written by Dana Cofy and Bianca Majolie, in which Cinderella&#x27;s stepmother was named Florimel de la Pochel; her stepsisters as Wanda and Javotte; her pet mouse Dusty and pet turtle Clarissa; the stepsisters&#x27; cat Bon Bob; the Prince&#x27;s aide Spink, and the stepsisters&#x27; dancing instructor Monsieur Carnewal. This version stuck closely to the original fairy tale until Cinderella arrives home late from the second ball. Her stepfamily then imprisons Cinderella in a dungeon cellar. When Spink and his troops arrive at the la Pochel residence, Dusty takes the slipper and leads them to free Cinderella.

By September 1943, Disney had assigned Dick Huemer and Joe Grant to begin work on &quot;Cinderella&quot; as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million. However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf quarreled, and Rapf was reassigned to work on &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Rapf explained, &quot;My thinking was you can&#x27;t have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can&#x27;t be delivered on a platter. You&#x27;ve got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, &#x27;It&#x27;s okay till midnight but from then on it&#x27;s up to you.&#x27; I made her earn it, and what she had to do to achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they&#x27;re ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don&#x27;t think anyone took (my idea) very seriously.&quot;

In spring 1946, Disney held three story meetings, and subsequently received treatment from Ted Sears, Homer Brightman, and Harry Reeves dated March 24, 1947. In the treatment, the Prince was introduced earlier in the story reminiscent of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), and there was a hint of the cat-and-mouse conflict. By May 1947, the first rough phase of storyboarding was in the process, and an inventory report that same month suggested a different approach with the story &quot;largely through the animals in the barnyard and their observations of Cinderella&#x27;s day-to-day activities&quot;.

Following the theatrical release of &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947), Walt Disney Productions&#x27; bank debt declined from $4.2 million to $3 million. Around this time, Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies but emphasized to the loaners that slashing production would be suicidal. To restore the studio to full financial health, he expressed his desire to return to producing full-length animated films. However, Walt&#x27;s brother Roy O. Disney was reluctant to greenlight another film and asked Walt to consider selling the studio and retiring with the money they had. After arguing for weeks, Roy eventually conceded and allowed a new feature length animated film to be made. By then, three animated projects—&quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953)—were in development. Disney felt the characters in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot; were too cold, while &quot;Cinderella&quot; contained elements similar to &quot;Snow White&quot;, and greenlit the project. Selecting his top-tier animation talent, Ben Sharpsteen was assigned as supervising producer while Hamilton Luske, Wilfred Jackson, and Clyde Geronimi became the sequence directors. Nevertheless, production on &quot;Alice&quot; resumed so that both animation crews would effectively compete against each other to see which film would finish first.

By early 1948, &quot;Cinderella&quot; had progressed further than &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and was fast-tracked to become the first full-length animated film since &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942). During a story meeting on January 15, 1948, the cat-and-mouse sequences began to grow into an important element in the film so much that Disney placed veteran story artist Bill Peet in charge of the cat-and-mouse segments.

By the late 1940s, Disney&#x27;s involvement during production had shrunken noticeably. As he was occupied with trains and the filming of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), the directors were left to exercise their own judgment more on details. Although Disney no longer held daily story meetings, the three directors still communicated with him by mailing him memoranda, scripts, Photostats of storyboards, and acetates of soundtrack recordings while he was in England for two and a half months during the summer of 1949. When Disney did not respond, work resumed and then had to be undone when he did. In one instance, when Disney returned to the studio on August 29, he reviewed Luske&#x27;s animation sequences and ordered numerous minor changes, as well as a significant reworking of the film&#x27;s climax. Production was finished by October 13, 1949.

===Casting===

Nearly 380 applicants were auditioned for the role of Cinderella. In March 1948, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that singer Jeannie McKeon had been signed to voice the character, but eventually the deal did not work out. That same month, Ilene Woods announced on national radio that she had been cast as Cinderella. She got involved with the project when she did a favor to its songwriters Mack David and Jerry Livingston, who had known Woods from working with her on her eponymous ABC radio program. They asked Woods to sing on demo recordings of several songs they had written for the film, which were then presented to Walt Disney. Two days later, Woods received a telephone call from Disney, with whom she immediately scheduled an interview. Woods recalled in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;We met and talked for a while, and he said, &#x27;How would you like to be Cinderella?&#x27;,&quot; to which she agreed.

For the role of Lucifer, a studio representative asked June Foray if she could provide the voice of a cat. &quot;Well, I could do anything,&quot; recalled Foray, &quot;So he hired me as Lucifer the cat in &quot;Cinderella&quot;&quot;.

===Animation===
====Live-action reference====

Starting in spring 1948, actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a playback of the dialogue soundtrack. Disney had previously used live-action reference on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), and &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), but as part of an effort to keep the production cost down, the footage was used to check the plot, timing, and movement of the characters before animating it. The footage was then edited frame-by-frame onto large Photostat sheets to duplicate, in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money. Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles. Frank Thomas explained, &quot;Anytime you&#x27;d think of another way of staging the scene, they&#x27;d say: &#x27;We can&#x27;t get the camera up there&#x27;! Well, you could get the animation camera up there! So you had to go with what worked well in live-action.&quot;

Walt Disney hired actress Helene Stanley to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella, allowing artists to draw animated frames based on the movements of the actress. She later did the same kind of work for the characters of Princess Aurora in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959) and Anita Radcliffe in &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961). Animators modeled Prince Charming on actor Jeffrey Stone, who also provided some additional voices for the film. Claire Du Brey served as the live-action reference for the Fairy Godmother, although the design for the character was based on Mary Alice O&#x27;Connor (the wife of layout artist Ken O&#x27;Connor).

====Character animation====
By 1950, the animation board, which had been established as early as 1940 to help with the management of the animation department, had settled down to nine supervising animators, including Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Les Clark, Wolfgang Reitherman, Eric Larson, Ward Kimball, Milt Kahl, John Lounsbery, and Marc Davis. Although they were still in their thirties, they were jokingly referred by Disney as the &quot;Nine Old Men&quot; after President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s denigration of the Supreme Court.

Eric Larson and Marc Davis were both tasked with designing and animating Cinderella. Larson was the first to animate the character whom he envisioned as a &quot;sixteen-year-old with braids and a pug nose&quot;. However, Disney grew displeased with this approach and assigned Davis as the second supervising animator, whose designs suggested a &quot;more the exotic dame&quot; with a long swan-like neck. To minimize the differences and set the final design, Disney assigned animator Ken O&#x27;Brien who, as Larson said, made &quot;his gals and Marc&#x27;s gals look like the same gal.&quot; Due to the extensive use of the live-action reference for the film, Helene Stanley&#x27;s physical features also influenced the character&#x27;s final appearance.

Frank Thomas was assigned as the supervising animator of Lady Tremaine, which he was &quot;astounded&quot; with, since he had previously mainly specialized in more &quot;charming&quot; characters, like Pinocchio or Bambi.

Milt Kahl was the directing animator of the Fairy Godmother, the King, and the Grand Duke. Originally, Disney intended for the Fairy Godmother to be a tall, regal character as he viewed fairies as tall, motherly figures (as seen in the Blue Fairy in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940)), but Kahl disagreed with this characterization. Following the casting of Verna Felton, Kahl managed to convince Disney of his undignified concept of the Fairy Godmother.

Unlike the human characters, the animal characters were animated without live-action reference. During production, none of Kimball&#x27;s designs for Lucifer had pleased Disney. After visiting Kimball&#x27;s steam train at his home, Disney saw his calico cat and remarked, &quot;Hey—there&#x27;s your model for Lucifer&quot;. Reitherman animated the sequence in which Jaq and Gus laboriously drag the key up the flight of stairs to Cinderella.

==Music==

In 1946, story artist and part-time lyricist Larry Morey joined studio music director Charles Walcott to compose the songs. Cinderella would sing three songs: &quot;Sing a Little, Dream a Little&quot; while overloaded with work, &quot;The Mouse Song&quot; as she dressed the mice, and &quot;The Dress My Mother Wore&quot; as she fantasizes about her mother&#x27;s old wedding dress. To recycle an unused fantasy sequence from &quot;Snow White&quot;, the song, &quot;Dancing on a Cloud&quot; was used as Cinderella and the Prince waltz during the ball. After the ball, she would sing &quot;I Lost My Heart at the Ball&quot; and the Prince would sing &quot;The Face That I See in the Night.&quot; However, none of their songs were used.

Two years later, Disney turned to Tin Pan Alley songwriters Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman to compose the songs. They were the first professional composers to be hired outside the production company. The trio had previously written the song &quot;Chi-Baba, Chi-Baba&quot; that Disney heard on the radio and decided would work well with the Fairy Godmother sequence. They finished the songs in March 1949. In total six songs were performed in the film: &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot;, &quot;Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale&quot;, &quot;The Work Song&quot;, &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot;, and &quot;So This Is Love&quot;.

Oliver Wallace and Paul Smith composed the score, but only after the animation was ready for inking, which was incidentally similar to scoring a live-action film. This was a drastic change from the earlier Disney animated features in which the music and action were carefully synchronized in a process known as Mickey Mousing.

The film also marked the launching of the Walt Disney Music Company. The soundtrack was also a first in using multi-tracks for vocals – with the song &quot;Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale&quot;, Ilene Woods recorded a second and third vocal track to enable her to sing harmony with herself.

On February 4, 1950, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that RCA Records and Disney would release a children&#x27;s album in conjunction with the theatrical release. The RCA Victor album release sold about 750,000 copies during its first release, and hit number-one on the Billboard pop charts.

On September 12, 1995, a special edition of the soundtrack entitled &quot;Walt Disney Records Presents The Music of Cinderella&quot; was released to coincide with the film&#x27;s re-release on home video. The album opened with cover versions of the songs from the film including Linda Ronstadt singing &quot;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot; in English and Spanish, Take 6 singing &quot;The Work Song&quot;, James Ingram singing &quot;So This Is Love&quot;, David Benoit and David Sanborn performing a jazz medley from the film, and Bobby McFerrin&#x27;s take on &quot;Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo&quot;.

The soundtrack for &quot;Cinderella&quot; was released by Walt Disney Records on CD and audio cassette on February 4, 1997, and included a bonus demo. On October 4, 2005, Disney released a special edition of the soundtrack album of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, for the &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; DVD release, which includes several demo songs cut from the final film, a new song, and a cover version of &quot;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot;. The soundtrack was released again on October 2, 2012, and consisted of several lost chords and new recordings of them. A Walmart exclusive limited edition &quot;Music Box Set&quot; consisting of the soundtrack without the lost chords or bonus demos, the &quot;Song and Story: Cinderella&quot; CD and a bonus DVD of &quot;Tangled Ever After&quot; was released on the same day.

In conjunction with the film&#x27;s 65th anniversary, the soundtrack for &quot;Cinderella&quot; was re-released in 2015 as part of the Legacy Collection.

Original songs performed in the film include:

==Release==
The film was originally released in theaters on February 15, 1950, in Boston, Massachusetts. It also screened at the inaugural edition of the Berlin International Film Festival in June 1951, where it won the Golden Bear for Best Music Film. &quot;Cinderella&quot; was re-released in 1957, 1965, 1973, 1981 and 1987. &quot;Cinderella&quot; also played a limited engagement in select Cinemark Theatres from February 16–18, 2013. To celebrate Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the film was re-released in cinemas across the UK from August 25 to 31, 2023, and Latin American theaters from October 12 to 18, 2023, alongside &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995).

===Box office===
The film was Disney&#x27;s greatest box office success since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, earning nearly $4.28 million in distributor rentals (the distributor&#x27;s share of the box office gross) from the United States and Canada. It was the fifth highest-grossing film released in North America in 1950. It was the fifth most popular movie at the British box office in 1951. The film is France&#x27;s sixteenth biggest film of all time in terms of admissions with 13.2 million tickets sold.

The success of &quot;Cinderella&quot; allowed Disney to carry on producing films throughout the 1950s by which the profits from the film&#x27;s release, with the additional profits from record sales, music publishing, publications, and other merchandise gave Disney the cash flow to finance a slate of productions (animated and live-action), establish his own distribution company, enter television production, and begin building Disneyland during the decade, as well as developing the Florida Project, later known as Walt Disney World.

&quot;Cinderella&quot; has had a lifetime domestic gross of $93 million, and a lifetime worldwide gross of $182 million across its original release and several reissues. Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film has had a lifetime gross of $565 million.

===Critical response===
Upon release, &quot;Cinderella&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its animation, visuals, music, and lyrics. The film garnered the best reception for a Disney animated film since &quot;Dumbo&quot;; some critics declared it Disney&#x27;s first artistic triumph since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, to which the film was heavily compared in reviews. In a personal letter to Walt Disney, director Michael Curtiz hailed the film as the &quot;masterpiece of all pictures you have done.&quot; Producer Hal Wallis declared, &quot;If this is not your best, it is very close to the top.&quot; A review in &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; remarked: &quot;The film not only is handsome, with imaginative art and glowing colors to bedeck the old fairy tale, but it also is told gently, without the lurid villains which sometimes give little tots nightmares. It is enhanced by the sudden, piquant touches of humor and the music which appeal to old and young.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;&quot;Cinderella&quot; is beguiling proof that Walt Disney knows his way around fairyland. Harking back to the style of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), a small army of Disney craftsmen have given the centuries-old Cinderella story a dewy radiance of comic verve that should make children feel like elves and adults feel like children.&quot;

However, the characterization of Cinderella received a mixed reception. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The beautiful Cinderella has a voluptuous face and form—not to mention an eager disposition—to compare with Al Capp&#x27;s Daisy Mae.&quot; However, criticizing her role and personality, Crowther opined, &quot;As a consequence, the situation in which they are mutually involved have the constraint and immobility of panel-expressed episodes. When Mr. Disney tries to make them behave like human beings, they&#x27;re banal.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Variety&quot; claimed the film found &quot;more success in projecting the lower animals than in its central character, Cinderella, who is on the colorless, doll-faced side, as is the Prince Charming.&quot;

Contemporary reviews have remained positive. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three out of four stars during its 1987 re-release. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote the film &quot;shows Disney at the tail end of his best period, when his backgrounds were still luminous with depth and detail and his incidental characters still had range and bite.&quot; The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported the film received an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The rich colors, sweet songs, adorable mice and endearing (if suffering) heroine make &quot;Cinderella&quot; a nostalgically lovely charmer.&quot;

===Accolades===
In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;10 Top 10&quot;— the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Cinderella&quot; was acknowledged as the 9th greatest film in the animation genre.

===Home media===
&quot;Cinderella&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 4, 1988, as part of the Walt Disney Classics collection. The release had a promotion with a free lithograph reproduction for those who pre-ordered the video before its release date. Disney had initially shipped 4.3 million VHS copies to retailers, but due to strong consumer demand, more than seven million copies were shipped. At the time of its initial home video release, it was the best-selling VHS title until it was overtaken by &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). The VHS release was placed into moratorium (i.e., into the Disney Vault) on April 30, 1989, with copies sold and having grossed in sales revenue.

On October 4, 1995, a digitally remastered edition of film was released on VHS and LaserDisc as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection&quot;, and later in the UK on November 24, 1997. Both editions were accompanied by &quot;The Making of Cinderella&quot; featurette. A Deluxe LaserDisc included the featurette, an illustrated, hardcover book retelling the story with pencil tests and conceptual art from the film, and a reprint of the film&#x27;s artwork. Disney shipped more than 15 million VHS copies, of which 8 million were sold in the first month.

On October 4, 2005, Disney released the film on DVD with a digitally remastered transfer. This release was the sixth installment of the Walt Disney Platinum Editions series. According to &quot;Home Media Magazine&quot;, Disney sold 3.2 million copies in its first week, which earned over $64 million in sales. The Platinum Edition was also released on VHS, but the only special feature was the &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot; music video by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars. The Platinum Edition DVD, along with the sequels to the film, went into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2008. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a &quot;Royal Edition&quot; of &quot;Cinderella&quot; was released on DVD on April 4, 2011, to commemorate the UK Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. This release had a unique limited edition number on every slipcase and an exclusive art card.

On October 2, 2012, a 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Diamond Edition was released. The Diamond Edition release also included a 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo and a 6-disc &quot;Jewelry Box Set&quot; that included the first film alongside both its sequels. A 1-disc DVD edition was released on November 20, 2012. The Diamond Edition release went back into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2017.

&quot;Cinderella&quot; was re-released on HD digital download on June 18, 2019, with a physical media re-release on Blu-ray on June 25, 2019, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection commemorating the film&#x27;s 70th anniversary.

On March 18, 2023, &quot;Cinderella&quot; was re-released on 4K Ultra HD as a Disney Movie Club exclusive, with a SteelBook packaging release on August 1 as well as a standard release on October 17 as part of the Disney100 promotion. It utilized the 4K remastered print from the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival screening, marking it as the first animated film made during the studio&#x27;s &quot;golden era&quot; to receive this treatment. The 4K version, dubbed as the &quot;Ultimate Restoration,&quot; began streaming on Disney+ on August 25.

===2023 4K restoration===
A 4K remastered version of the film premiered at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 19, 2023, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Walt Disney Company. The restoration was described as a &quot;multi-year effort&quot; involving Disney&#x27;s Restoration and Preservation team and key members of Walt Disney Animation Studios, including Eric Goldberg, Michael Giaimo, Dorothy McKim, and Bob Bagley. It involved obtaining the original 35mm Technicolor negative from the Library of Congress and re-scanning it in 4K resolution, with dirt digitally removed frame by frame to bring the film back &quot;to its original grandeur, authentic to the artistic ambitions of the Studio&#x27;s creative team, and which looks and sounds better than ever.&quot; The 4K version began streaming on Disney+ on August 25.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
According to animation historian Charles Solomon, &quot;Cinderella&quot; &quot;remains one of the most popular animated features in the Disney canon&quot;. In 2023, Ben Mankiewicz, host of Turner Classic Movies, told &quot;Parade&quot; magazine, &quot;Disney was on the ropes. &quot;Cinderella&quot; saved Disney.&quot; He also said, &quot;It has everything you want in a princess story, and it&#x27;s done in this authentic, beautiful way.&quot;

&quot;Cinderella&quot; is referred by many as one of the most recognizable tales in history. &quot;Parade&quot; magazine listed the film among the greatest animated films of all time. In 2008, American Film Institute ranked &quot;Cinderella&quot; as the ninth best animated film of all time, writing: &quot;one of the most recognizable fairytale stories ever, &quot;Cinderella&quot; has stood the test of time.&quot;

<doc id="399404" wikidata="Q509163" url="?curid=399404" title="Christie Hefner">
<text>Christie Ann Hefner (born November 8, 1952) is an American businesswoman. She was chairman and CEO of Playboy Enterprises from 1988 to 2009, and is the daughter of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine founder Hugh Hefner.

==Early life==
Hefner was born in Chicago, Illinois. She is the daughter of Mildred Williams and Hugh Hefner. Her parents had separated by the time she was five. When her mother remarried, she moved to Wilmette, Illinois. There she graduated from New Trier High School. She attended the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan, during the summers from 1964 to 1969.

She graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Brandeis University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and American literature in 1974. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year.

==Career==
After college, Hefner freelanced for the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; for a year, writing movie reviews. Thereafter, she moved back to Chicago and started working at &quot;Playboy&quot;.

In 1982, she became president of Playboy Enterprises, and was made chairman of the board and CEO in 1988. She was the longest-serving female CEO of a publicly traded company. She extended its magazine franchise overseas, to 25 localized foreign editions and also developed the company&#x27;s profitable pay television business — the first time a magazine successfully leveraged its brand into a television network. The company also acquired adult-oriented businesses such as Spice Network and ClubJenna.

Continuing the company&#x27;s electronic expansion, in 1994, Hefner led the company onto the Internet with the launch of Playboy.com, the first national magazine to launch a website, and built an international, profitable, multi-revenue stream business, including premium content, e-commerce, advertising and gaming, both online and mobile. She also built a highly profitable direct marketing, catalog and e-commerce business in film and music through both acquisition and organic growth. Hefner greatly expanded the leveraging of the Playboy brand via licensing. In her last year as CEO, Playboy generated close to $1 billion in global retail sales, 80% of the sales to women. When she left, over 40% of her executives were women. For three years, she was named to &quot;Fortune&quot; list of &quot;Most Powerful Women&quot;.

In 2008, she released a memo to employees about her efforts to streamline the company&#x27;s operations, including eliminating its DVD division and laying off staff.

On December 8, 2008, she announced her plans to step down as CEO of Playboy. Hefner said that the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president had inspired her to give more time to charitable work, and that the decision to step down was her own. &quot;Just as this country is embracing change in the form of new leadership, I have decided that now is the time to make changes in my own life as well&quot;, she said. She stepped down from as Playboy CEO on January 30, 2009.

In May 2011, Hefner was named executive chairman of Canyon Ranch Enterprises, a resort company that operates six premier spa destinations and an online website providing health and wellness advice.

As of 2015, Hefner was chairman of the board of Hatchbeauty Brands. Hefner also serves on the advisory boards of the R.D. Offutt company and Edge Beauty.

==Philanthropy==
Hefner created the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in honor of her father, and has helped to raise $30 million to build the CORE Center in Chicago, the first outpatient facility in the Midwest for people with AIDS.

Her non-profit work includes Rush University Center (Trustee/Member), Springboard Enterprises (Advisory Board Member), Center for American Progress Action (Director/Member Audit Committee), Better Government Association (Civic Advisory Committee), and Press Forward (Steering Committee).

==Personal life==
Hefner married former Illinois state senator William A. Marovitz, a real estate developer and attorney, in 1995. They divorced in 2013 and have no children. Marovitz was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly using inside information to trade illegally in shares of Playboy. In 2011, he settled out of court for $168,352.

She lives in Chicago and has one brother, David, a computer systems analyst. She also has two half-brothers, Cooper and Marston, from her father&#x27;s marriage to Kimberley Conrad.

<doc id="399409" wikidata="Q2701304" url="?curid=399409" title="Mario's Time Machine">
<text>Mario&#x27;s Time Machine is an educational video game originally released for MS-DOS and then for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES consoles. The Software Toolworks both developed and published the MS-DOS and Super NES versions in 1993, while the NES version was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by The Software Toolworks in 1994. The Microsoft Windows version was re-released as &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine Deluxe&quot; in 1996.

&quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; is one of several educational &quot;Mario&quot; video games that were released during the early 1990s; the game focuses on teaching human history. While the gameplay and engine vary between the three different versions, the story is roughly the same: the player assumes the role of Mario, who uses a time machine to return various artifacts, which had been stolen by Bowser, to their correct points in time.

&quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; received mixed reviews. Its use as an educational title has been mixed, and the game has been compared to another educational history game, &quot;Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; is set in the year 1993. Bowser, who has built a time machine called the &quot;Timulator&quot;, travels back in time and steals essential artifacts from various points in human history to place on display in a museum inside his castle. Because these actions will eventually change history permanently, the player character Mario takes control of the Timulator to return the artifacts to their proper areas in time. In the NES version, Bowser also kidnaps Yoshi, who is freed upon completing the game. The gameplay focuses on teaching the player the historical significance of each artifact (and of the associated historical person); to progress through the game, the player must correctly answer questions relating to the learned information. &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; uses a side-scrolling perspective, with a game engine that varies across all three versions. The player controls Mario using a point-and-click interface in the MS-DOS version, while the console versions use a platforming-based control scheme adapted from &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, in which Mario can move left or right and jump. Like &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot;, the console versions use a password system to order to resume play from a particular game state.

The player begins &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; in Bowser&#x27;s museum. The museum is the main hub, where the player obtains the artifacts and directly accesses all the game&#x27;s levels (which consist of locations on Earth in different time periods) using the Timulator. In the Super NES and MS-DOS versions, for each artifact, the player is given the year and place it originated from. For example, the player learns that the &quot;Apple&quot; artifact originated from 1687 Cambridge. The player can then time travel using this information; time traveling itself is a minigame in which Mario surfs through a wide ocean, collecting mushrooms. Collecting enough mushrooms will transport Mario to the time period and location programmed into the Timulator. The player is given a short document describing the life and notability of the historical person associated (e.g. Isaac Newton), but the document itself has some of its terms missing. The player thus is required to converse with the non-player characters depicting the local denizens of the time period in order to learn various facts and be able to fill in the blanks. The player chooses the words from a list of pre-determined words; if the player incorrectly fills a blank more than twice, he is sent back to 1993 and is required to try again. When the player fills all the blanks correctly, he can then successfully return the artifact to its original owner. In the game&#x27;s ending cutscene, Mario manages to confront Bowser, who then steals back the Timulator to make his escape. At this point there are three possible outcomes based on the player&#x27;s overall performance: in the worst outcome, in which the player fails to return the artifacts quickly enough, Bowser successfully escapes to an area known as Paradise; in the other two outcomes, the Timulator experiences mechanical overload, sending and trapping Bowser in the Jurassic era.

The NES version of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; has a heavier emphasis on platforming than the other two versions. Despite the presence of enemies, Mario cannot lose lives or even take damage, so obtaining a game over is impossible. To obtain an artifact in Bowser&#x27;s museum, the player plays a &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;-inspired minigame in which he fights Koopa Troopas. The player can then use the Timulator and travel to one of the fourteen selectable time periods. Unlike the other versions, the player is not explicitly told which time period the artifact originated from. The player is instead encouraged to explore the time periods and obtain hints, either from local denizens or from message blocks. Once the player figures out the artifact that belongs in that time period, he can then place the artifact in its original spot. After all the artifacts have been returned, the player is tasked to answer three random multiple choice questions pertaining to the historical periods visited. Answering the questions correctly will lead the player to the final boss fight with Bowser. The player wins the game upon Bowser&#x27;s defeat.

==Development==
To capitalize on educational games, which gained popularity at the time, Nintendo partnered with The Software Toolworks to develop educational Mario games. Nintendo licensed the characters, but neither the company nor Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto were involved in the game’s development. The MS-DOS and Super NES versions were developed by The Software Toolworks and published by Mindscape, while the NES version was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Mindscape. &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; was originally released for computers in 1993, with a deluxe re-release titled &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine Deluxe&quot; in 1996. It was later released for the Super NES in December 1993, and for the NES in June 1994.

==Reception==

Since its release, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; has received mixed reviews. &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the game&#x27;s dialogues with historical figures, commenting that &quot;the scenarios make flesh-and-blood human beings out of people who are usually just static pictures in textbooks&quot;. They criticized the Timulator controls as too confusing, especially for the game&#x27;s targeted age group, but nonetheless summarized the game as both enjoyable and educational. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave it a 2.65 out of five, while &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a 6.75 out of 10.

&quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Brian Altano and Brian Miggels named its ending as one of the worst ever, criticizing it for showing Bowser crying. Fellow &quot;GameSpy&quot; editor Mike Drucker called it &quot;half-assed&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; commented that those who like this game may like &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot;, which they gave a negative review to. They later suggested that it was an unpopular game, commenting that &quot;five, maybe six people played the NES version of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot;&quot;. &quot;Good Game&quot; called it &quot;awful&quot;, and was &quot;way too complicated for any school-aged youngster to understand&quot;. Nintendo of Canada included a sealed copy of the NES version as part of a charity auction along with several other sealed NES games. In the book &quot;Video Games: A Guide for Savvy Parents&quot;, author David Sheff found the educational elements good, but criticized the gameplay.

Authors David Wesley and Gloria Barczak associated &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; with the recent &quot;flood of ill-conceived &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs&quot;, arguing that these games nearly destroyed the &quot;Mario&quot; license. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Janet Swift discussed &quot;Mario&#x27;s Time Machine&quot; in her article on the latest generation of educational titles in 1994. She compared it to &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; in its execution, which she found &quot;special&quot;, praising it for its educational value for children. &quot;Allgame&quot;″s Brett Alan Weiss called the action scenes &quot;dreadfully dull&quot; and the presentation &quot;merely average&quot;. He added that while he does not dislike educational games, they must be both entertaining and enlightening. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Levi Buchanan included it in their assessment of the &quot;other &quot;Mario&quot; games&quot;, implying that the premise was boring and criticizing the game for lacking any real platform gameplay. He commented that it had &quot;honorable intentions&quot;, but that it was &quot;decidedly shallow&quot;. He also criticized the act of putting Mario in realistic time periods, commenting that he &quot;occupies the imagination, a place with Star Festivals and giant piranha plants&quot;.

<text>Operation Avalanche was the codename for the Allied landings near the port of Salerno, executed on 9 September 1943, part of the Allied invasion of Italy during World War II. The Italians withdrew from the war the day before the invasion, but the Allies landed in an area defended by German troops. Planned under the name &quot;Top Hat&quot;, it was supported by the deception plan Operation &quot;Boardman&quot;.

The landings were carried out by the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. It comprised the U.S. VI Corps, the British X Corps, and the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, a total of about nine divisions. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping the Axis troops further south.

In order to draw troops away from the landing ground, Operation Baytown was mounted. This was a landing by the British Eighth Army, under General Sir Bernard Montgomery, in Calabria in the &#x27;toe&#x27; of Italy, on 3 September. Simultaneous sea landings were made by the British 1st Airborne Division at the port of Taranto (Operation Slapstick).
The Salerno landings were carried out without previous naval or aerial bombardment in order to achieve surprise. Surprise was not achieved.

The Germans had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were captured. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the 16th Panzer Division. It caused heavy casualties but was beaten off. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied of coastline to a depth of .

Over 12–14 September the Germans organized a concerted counterattack by six divisions of motorized troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British Eighth Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of naval and aerial support, although the German attacks reached almost to the beaches in places.

==Background==

Following the defeat of the Italian Forces and Afrika Korps in North Africa, there was disagreement between the Allies as to what the next step should be. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, in particular wanted to invade Italy, which he called the &quot;underbelly of Europe&quot; (commonly misquoted as &quot;soft underbelly&quot;). Popular support in Italy for the war was declining, and he believed an invasion would remove Italy, and thus the influence of the Italian Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) in the Mediterranean Sea, opening it to Allied traffic. This would make it much easier to supply Allied forces in the Middle East and Far East, and increase British and American supplies to the Soviet Union. In addition, it would tie down German forces, keeping them away from the planned Allied invasion of Normandy – codenamed Operation Overlord.

However, General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and much of the American staff wanted to undertake no operations that might delay the Normandy invasion. When it became clear that Operation Overlord could not be undertaken in 1943, it was agreed forces in North Africa should be used to invade Sicily, with no commitment made to any follow-up operations.

Joint Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) were operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre and it was they who planned and commanded the invasion of Sicily and the Italian mainland.

The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, codenamed Operation Husky, was highly successful, although many of the Axis forces there were allowed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. More importantly a coup deposed Benito Mussolini as head of the Italian government, which then began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten an Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops that would now be trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian (and more so German) resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the fall of Berlin. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden that would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German Commander-in-Chief Albrecht von Kesselring.

=== The plan ===

A diversion operation was designed to support the landings at Salerno, named Operation Boardman. The operation began on June 30, 1943, and ended on August 31, 1943. The plan for the operation was for the Abwehr to intercept radio transmissions which contained false plans for invasions of Sardinia, Corsica, Apulia, Southern France or Northwestern Italy, and finally Greece in that order. Essentially, the plan sought to weaken German and Italian forces in Southern and Central Italy by shifting Axis focus away from those regions. Also part of this operation was the use of dummies previously used in Operation Waterfall. The dummies were refurbished and set up in Cyrenaica in a way that would suggest an invasion of the Peloponnese.

The main landings were scheduled after the success at Sicily for September 9. The main force would land around Salerno on the western coast in Operation Avalanche. It would consist of the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, comprising the U.S. VI Corps under Major General Ernest J. Dawley, the X British Corps under Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery, and the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in reserve, a total of about nine divisions. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping Axis troops further south. The inclusion of the 82nd Airborne Division as a reserve force was possible only with the cancellation of Operation Giant II. The 1st British Airborne Division would be landed by sea near Taranto, on the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy in Operation Slapstick, as a diversion for Salerno. Their task was to capture the port and several nearby airfields and link with the Eighth Army before pressing north to join the Fifth Army near Foggia.

The plan was deeply flawed. The Fifth Army would be landing on a very broad 35-mile front, using only three assault divisions, and the two corps were widely separated both in distance and by a river. Furthermore, the terrain was highly favorable to the defender. A U.S. Army Ranger force under Colonel William Orlando Darby consisting of three Ranger battalions and two British Commando units was tasked with holding the mountain passes leading to Naples, but no plan existed for linking the Ranger force with X Corps&#x27; follow-up units. Finally, Clark ordered that no naval preparatory bombardment take place, concerned that surprise would be lost and reinforcements summoned if a bombardment was made.

Approximately eight German divisions were positioned to cover possible landing sites, including the Hermann Goering Division, 26th and 16th &quot;Panzer&quot;, the 15th and 29th &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot;, and the 1st and 2nd &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;.

== Landings ==

At Salerno the decision had been taken to assault without previous naval or aerial bombardment, in order to secure surprise. Tactical surprise was not achieved, as the naval commanders had predicted. As the first wave approached the shore at Paestum a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English, &quot;Come on in and give up. We have you covered.&quot; The troops attacked nonetheless.

The Germans had established artillery and machine-gun posts and scattered tanks through the landing zones which made progress difficult, but the beach areas were successfully taken. Around 07:00 a concerted counterattack was made by the 16th Panzer division. It caused heavy casualties, but was beaten off with naval gunfire support. Both the British and the Americans made slow progress, and still had a 10-mile gap between them at the end of day one. They linked up by the end of day two and occupied 35–45 miles of coast line to a depth of six or seven miles.

General Montgomery had predicted &quot;Baytown&quot; would be a waste of effort because it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria; if they failed to do so, the diversion would not work. He was proved correct. After Baytown, the Eighth Army marched north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineer obstacles.

During September 12–14 the Germans organized a concerted counterattack with six divisions of motorised troops, hoping to throw the Salerno beachhead into the sea before it could link with the British 8th Army. Heavy casualties were inflicted, as the Allied troops were too thinly spread to be able to resist concentrated attacks. The outermost troops were therefore withdrawn in order to reduce the perimeter. The new perimeter was held with the assistance of 4,000 paratroopers from the 82nd and 509th PIB who air dropped near the hot spots, from strong naval gunfire support, and from well-served Fifth Army artillery. The German attacks reached almost to the beaches but ultimately failed. The heavy gunfire of Allied battleships practically immobilised counterattacking German units with their sheer firepower, forcing the Germans to halt their counteroffensive and regroup.

General Clark was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest US award for valor in combat, for his front-line leadership during this crisis. He was frequently seen in the most forward positions encouraging the troops. However, in the estimate of historian Carlo D&#x27;Este, Clark&#x27;s poor planning of the operation caused the crisis in the first place.
The Salerno battle was also the site of a mutiny by about 600 men of the British 10th Corps, who on September 16 refused assignment to new units as replacements. They had previously understood that they would be returning to their own units from which they had been separated during the fighting in the North African Campaign, mainly because they had been wounded. Eventually the Corps commander, McCreery, persuaded most of the men to follow their orders. The NCOs who led the mutiny were sentenced to death, but were eventually allowed to rejoin units and the sentence was not carried out.

=== German strategy changes ===

The German 10th Army had come very close to overwhelming the Salerno beachhead. The Allies had been fortunate that at this time Adolf Hitler had sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not a strategic priority. As a result, the Army Group Commander in southern Italy, Field Marshall Albert Kesselring had been forbidden to call upon reserves from the northern Army Group. The subsequent success of the German 10th Army&#x27;s defensive campaign in inflicting very heavy casualties on both U.S. 5th and British 8th Armies and Kesselring&#x27;s strategic arguments that the Allies should be kept as far away from Germany as possible led Hitler to change his mind in October at which point he withdrew Rommel to oversee the build-up of defenses in northern France and gave Kesselring command of the whole of Italy with a remit to keep Rome in German hands for the longest time possible.

==Aftermath ==
=== Casualties ===
General Clark in his book &quot;Calculated Risk&quot; reports that the X Corps suffered 531 killed in action, 1,915 wounded and 1,561 missing, while the VI Corps had 225 killed, 853 wounded and 589 missing. Clark also stated that most of the missing from both corps subsequently returned to the front lines. After a week long battle, the combined Allied losses were heavy, with 2,349 killed, 7,366 wounded and 4,100 missing.

German losses numbered 840 killed, 2,002 wounded and 603 missing.Most of these losses were inflicted by Allied naval support fire and field guns.

=== Further Allied advances ===

With the Salerno beachhead secure, the 5th Army could begin to attack northwest towards Naples. The 8th Army had been making quick progress from the &quot;toe&quot; in the face of German engineer delaying actions and linked with the 1st Airborne Division on the Adriatic coast. It united the left of its front with the 5th Army&#x27;s right on 16 September, and advancing up the Adriatic coast captured the airfields near Foggia on 27 September. Foggia was a major Allied objective because the large airfield complex there would give the Allied air forces the ability to strike new targets in France, Germany and the Balkans. The 5th Army captured Naples on 1 October, and reached the line of the Volturno River on October 6. This provided a natural barrier, securing Naples, the Campanian Plain and the vital airfields on it from counterattack. Meanwhile, on the Adriatic coast, the British 8th Army had advanced to a line from Campobasso to Larino and Termoli on the Biferno river.

Thus, by early October, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands, and the Allied armies now stood facing the Volturno Line, the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the Winter Line, their strongest defensive line south of Rome. The next stage of the Italian Campaign became for the Allied armies a grinding and attritional slog against skillful, determined and well prepared defenses in terrain and weather conditions which favoured defense and hampered the Allied advantages in mechanised equipment and air superiority. It took until mid-January 1944 to fight through the Volturno, Barbara and Bernhardt lines to reach the Gustav Line, the backbone of the Winter Line defenses, setting the scene for the four Battles of Monte Cassino which took place between January and May 1944.

<text>The Bear Flag is the official flag of the U.S. state of California. The precursor of the flag was first flown during the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt and was also known as the Bear Flag. A predecessor, called the Lone Star Flag, was used in an 1836 independence movement; the red star element from that flag appears in the Bear Flag of today.

==Current Flag==
===Law and protocol===
The 1911 statute stated:
In 1953, the design and specifications for the state flag were standardized in a bill signed by Governor Earl Warren and illustrated by Donald Graeme Kelley of Marin County, California. The Californian state flag is often called the &quot;Bear Flag&quot; and in fact, the present statute adopting the flag, California Government Code § 420, states: &quot;The Bear Flag is the State Flag of California.&quot;

Pursuant to Section 439 of the California Government Code, the regulations and protocols for the proper display of the flag of California is controlled by the California Adjutant General:
When the flag is displayed vertically, it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise such that the bear and star face upward and red stripe is on the left.

The flag is also used as the state ensign.

===Design===

The first official version of the Bear Flag was adopted by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Hiram Johnson in 1911 as the official state flag.

The contemporary state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is ⅔ the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1. The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836. The hoist of the flag is two-thirds the fly.

The bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity. The bear, named &quot;Monarch&quot;, was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allan Kelly, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst. The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear&#x27;s death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.

While the bear flag was adopted in 1911, until 1953 the image of the bear varied depending on the flag manufacturer. In 1953 the bear image was standardized by Donald Greame Kelley, he based it off the 1855 watercolor by Charles Christian Nahl. The 1953 law includes an official black and white rendering of the bear as well as the plot of grass and brown tufts. This drawing and other specifications that define the flag&#x27;s colors and dimensions are identified as &quot;54-J-03&quot;.

The Californian flag is one of two U.S. state flags to depict a bear, along with Missouri.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th out of 50 U.S. states, and the best flag that contains words, specifically the state&#x27;s name.

===Colors===

The 1953 legislation defined the exact shades of the California flag with a total of five colors (including the white field) relative to the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card of America (now called the Standard Color Reference of America). It is one of only four US state flags not to include the color blue, along with Alabama, Maryland, and New Mexico.

* Seal is used for the dark shading of the bear, the 12 darker tufts in the plot of grass, the border of the plot and the lettering &quot;CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC&quot;.
* Maple Sugar is the base color for the bear.
* Old Glory Red is used for the star, the bear&#x27;s tongue and the red stripe at the bottom of the flag.
* Irish Green is used for the grass plot.
* The bear&#x27;s claws are also accented with white. The left front and rear paws have four white claws while the right rear claw displays three. The front right paw does not contain highlighting.

==History==
===Lone Star of California===

In 1836, a coup led by Juan Alvarado declared Alta California&#x27;s independence from Mexico. Declaring himself governor, Alvarado recruited U.S. frontiersmen, led by Isaac Graham, to support him. The rebels easily captured the capital Monterey, but were unable to convince southern leaders such as Juan Bandini and Carlos Antonio Carrillo to join the rebellion. Faced with a civil war, Alvarado and the other &quot;Californios&quot; negotiated a compromise with the central government wherein California&#x27;s leaders accepted its status as a &quot;department&quot; under the &quot;Siete Leyes&quot; Mexican constitution of 1836, in return for more local control. Alvarado was appointed governor the next year.

The Lone Star Flag of California, associated with Alvarado&#x27;s rebellion, contained a single red star on a white background. One last original flag is archived at the Autry National Center.

===Original Bear Flag===
The original grizzly bear flag was created by Peter Storm. A version of this bear flag, designed by William L. Todd, was raised in Sonoma, California, in June 1846 on a date between the 14th and the 17th, by the men who became known as the &quot;Bear Flaggers&quot;, including William B. Ide. The exact creation date is at least somewhat unclear. However, U.S. Naval Lieutenant John Missroon reported the flag&#x27;s existence as of June 17, 1846.

William L. Todd was a cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln. According to the book &quot;Flags Over California&quot;, published by the California Military Department, the star on the flag recalled the 1836 California Lone Star Flag. Todd, in an 1878 letter to the &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot;, states that the star was drawn using blackberry juice and in recognition of the California Lone Star Flag. The bear was designed to be a symbol of strength and unyielding resistance.

According to the Sonoma State Historic Park, the construction of the flag was described as such:

The original Bear Flag and the republic it symbolized had a brief career, from about June 14 until July 9. On July 7, 1846, Commodore John Drake Sloat of the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron first raised the 28-star American flag at Monterey, the capital of Alta California, and claimed the territory for the United States.

Two days later, on July 9, 1846, Navy Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere arrived in Sonoma and hauled down the Bear Flag, running up in its place the Stars and Stripes. The Bear Flag was given to young John E. Montgomery (son of Commander John B. Montgomery of ), who would later write in a letter to his mother &quot;Cuffy came down growling&quot;—&quot;Cuffy&quot; being his nickname for the bear on the flag.

The Bear Flag given to young Montgomery returned with USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot; to the east coast of the U.S. in 1848, but in 1855 was returned to California. The flag was given to California&#x27;s two senators, John B. Weller and William M. Gwin. This flag was donated to the Society of California Pioneers on September 8, 1855, and was preserved at the Society&#x27;s Pioneer Halls in San Francisco until it was destroyed on April 18, 1906, in the fires that followed the great San Francisco earthquake. Today, a replica hangs on display in the Sonoma Barracks, or El Presidio de Sonoma. There is also a statue in the plaza at Sonoma, California, commemorating the raising of the flag, the Bear Flag Monument.

=== Other Bear Flags ===
There are many accounts of other bear flags being made during the revolt. Each flag has a different design, most with a bear as the central figure either in brown or black. Some having a standing bear while others had it on all fours. Most of the accounts were made years afters the revolt.

A year after the revolt American settlers in Sacramento Valley wanted to celebrate the 4th of July by raising a national flag. The party did not have one, so they started gathering material to make an improvised American flag. It was described as: &quot;...small square of heavy cloth, light blue in color, upon which is pasted a white paper star of eight points, while a piece of paper is pasted along the top bar with the following motto written upon it: &quot; California is ours as long as the stars remain.&quot;

=== 1850s ===
On September 9, 1850, San Franciscans celebrated California&#x27;s admission to the union with a parade. From the flagpole in Portsmouth Square they flew an American flag with one large star that represented the state. Another flag flown to celebrated California&#x27;s statehood was the first state flag. The flag contained the state seal in the center of its field, with it being painted by William Henry Powell. The whole thing Measuring at 8 feet wide and 12 feet long.

From 1850-1858 people across the country started flying the American flags with their 31 stars arranged in the &quot;Grand Luminary&quot; pattern. This is when the stars in the canton are arranged to make one big star.

During the 1856 presidential election supporters of Republican nominee Fremont raised a Bear Flag in San Francisco, also one raised in Marysville but with the names: &quot;Fremont and Dayton,&quot; on it.

=== The Civil War period ===

During the secession crisis and the early part of the American Civil War in 1861, California was divided between supporters of the union and supporters of southern secession. In the months leading up to the war, some opposed to the government in Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County showed support for secession by flying variants of the Bear Flag instead of the Stars and Stripes. One version of the Bear Flag that was flown on May 29 in Los Angeles was described as &quot;...a deep red flag with a black bear painted on it.&quot; Duncan Beaumont raised a Pacific Republic flag from his boat in the Stockton to show his loyalty to secession. A party of men raised a banner containing a small American flag in the top corner and in the center a huge eagle with a grizzly bear below it. It was cut down by a different group of loyal unionists later in the day. The group thought it was a sign of disunion, but the day after they raised it in a different part of town to show their support for the Union. Soon secessionist across the state started raising other flags to express their sympathy for the Confederacy. These include: Palmetto flags, 7 stars flags, Stars and Bars, rattlesnake flags, and 15-24 star US flags. Not to be outdone, Unionists raised several flags to show support for the United States. The flags were the Stars and stripes (Sometimes with patriotic mottos), Union club flags, Militia flags, German flags, and Irish flags.

During the war, Union soldiers routinely took action against secessionists who ran up Confederate flags in many places, including above the California statehouse in Sacramento, then disappeared before they could be caught. On July 4, 1861, during U.S. Independence Day celebrations in Sacramento, Democrat and veteran Maj. J. P. Gillis celebrated the independence of the United States from Great Britain and the secession of the Confederacy by unfurling a flag based on the first Confederate flag, the Stars and Bars, but containing seventeen stars rather than the Confederate banner&#x27;s seven, and marching down the street to the cheers of pro-slavery individuals. Unionist Jack Biderman denounced Gillis, tore the flag from his hands, and taunted secessionists to try to take the flag back. No one tried. Because Gillis&#x27; flag was seized by Jack Biderman, it is referred to either as the &quot;Biderman Flag&quot; or the &quot;Gillis Flag.&quot; The flag is preserved in the state capitol.

In June 1861, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors ordered three flags to be made by Norcross. One of them was based on the first state flag, with the &quot;California Coat of arms&quot; added to its field. It cost $50 ($1,791 adjusted for inflation) to make and was hung in the chamber of the board of supervisors with the other two flags. A year later a banner of similar design was hung in the city, but the seal was encircled by small American flags.

On July 14, 1864, a party under Gen. McDowell took a ship around the Bay Area to inspect the fortifications. The ship, called &quot;The Goliah&quot;, flew the flag of the United States and a state flag described as &quot;...a body of red with a large circle in the centre, representing the great seal of the State.&quot;

=== 1870s-1910s ===
In February 1870, a man name Joseph Neuman produced 2 unique American flags with golden stars. One was for the State Capitol and the other for the National Capitol. The one for Washington was never given after the bill in the state house failed to raise money for the trip. They were describe as:

The Bear Flag flown through out the 1870s was usually a brown bear on a plain white field with no star or stripe. The flag was used by the Native Sons of the Golden West and other pioneer organizations. Sometimes it was given as a trophy for boat races or used as a commodore flag. In 1885 the Bear Flag was first officially used to represent state during the Southern Exposition and later in 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. California&#x27;s National Guard carried regimental flags with the state seal on them, from the 1880s until 1907.

In 1890 the Admission Day Celebration was being held in San Francisco, with 3 unique flags flown to represent the state. The designs were: &quot;...Two vaqueros lassoing a grizzly bear, the peaks of Mount Shasta showing in the distance...Great seal of California...The north star, with grizzly bear In foreground...&quot; Two years later a Bear Flag was hung in Los Angeles that was similar to the modern state flag. On June 14, 1896 Sonoma was celebrating 50th Anniversary of the Bear Flag Revolt. The town decided to raised a duplicate of the original Bear Flag, which is still in the Sonoma Barracks.
When Spanish-American War started California troops carried two regimental flags, one that contain the state seal and the name of the regiment below. The other was an American flag with name of the regiment in the stripes.

In 1909 the USS California was given two flags, one was a Bear Flag and other had the state seal on it. In 1912 the last state flag to contain the state seal was carried in a women suffrage parade in New York City.

==Flag of the governor==
The flag of the governor of California consists of the seal of California centered on a field of azure. Like many other U.S. governors&#x27; flags, there are four five-point stars at the corners of the field.
==In popular culture==
The flag of California serves as a basis for the flag of the fictional New California Republic in the popular post-apocalyptic &quot;Fallout&quot; franchise.

<text>Old Persian is one of two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan) and is the ancestor of Middle Persian (the language of the Sasanian Empire). Like other Old Iranian languages, it was known to its native speakers as (Iranian). Old Persian is close to both Avestan and the language of the Rig Veda, the oldest form of the Sanskrit language. All three languages are highly inflected.

Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets and seals of the Achaemenid era ( to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, with the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 522 BCE).

In 2007, research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago unearthed Old Persian tablets, which suggest Old Persian was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display.

==Origin and overview==
As a written language, Old Persian is attested in royal Achaemenid inscriptions. It is an Iranian language and as such a member of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the Behistun Inscriptions. Old Persian is one of the oldest Indo-European languages which are attested in original texts.

The oldest date of use of Old Persian as a spoken language is not precisely known. According to certain historical assumptions about the early history and origin of ancient Persians in Southwestern Iran (where Achaemenids hailed from), Old Persian was originally spoken by a tribe called , who arrived in the Iranian Plateau early in the 1st millennium BCE and finally migrated down into the area of present-day Fārs province. Their language, Old Persian, became the official language of the Achaemenid kings. Assyrian records, which in fact appear to provide the earliest evidence for ancient Iranian (Persian and Median) presence on the Iranian Plateau, give a good chronology but only an approximate geographical indication of what seem to be ancient Persians. In these records of the 9th century BCE, (along with , presumably Medians) are first mentioned in the area of Lake Urmia in the records of Shalmaneser III. The exact identity of the Parsuwash is not known for certain, but from a linguistic viewpoint the word matches Old Persian itself coming directly from the older word . Also, as Old Persian contains many words from another extinct Iranian language, Median, according to P. O. Skjærvø it is probable that Old Persian had already been spoken before the formation of the Achaemenid Empire and was spoken during most of the first half of the first millennium BCE.

==Classification==

Old Persian belongs to the Iranian language family, a branch of the Indo-Iranian language family, itself within the large family of Indo-European languages. The common ancestors of Indo-Iranians came from Central Asia sometime in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The extinct and unattested Median language is another Old Iranian language related to Old Persian; both are classified as Western Iranian languages, and many Median names appear in Old Persian texts. The group of Old Iranian languages was presumably large; however, knowledge of it is restricted mainly to Old Persian, Avestan, and Median. The first two are the only languages in that group to have left written original texts, while Median is known mostly from loanwords in Old Persian.

==Language evolution==
By the 4th century BCE, the late Achaemenid period, the inscriptions of Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III differ enough from the language of Darius&#x27; inscriptions to be called a &quot;pre-Middle Persian,&quot; or &quot;post-Old Persian&quot;. Old Persian subsequently evolved into Middle Persian, which is in turn the ancestor of New Persian.

Professor Gilbert Lazard, a famous Iranologist and the author of the book &quot;Persian Grammar&quot;, states:
The language known as New Persian, which usually is called at this period (early Islamic times) by the name of Parsi-Dari, can be classified linguistically as a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of Sassanian Iran, itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids. Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as Avestan, Parthian, Soghdian, Kurdish, Pashto, etc., Old, Middle and New Persian represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in Fars and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran.

Middle Persian, also sometimes called Pahlavi, is a direct continuation of Old Persian and was used as the written official language of the country. Comparison of the evolution at each stage of the language shows great simplification in grammar and syntax. However, New Persian is a direct descendant of Middle and Old Persian.

==Substrates==
Old Persian &quot;presumably&quot; has a Median language substrate. The Median element is readily identifiable because it did not share in the developments that were peculiar to Old Persian. Median forms &quot;are found only in personal or geographical names [...] and some are typically from religious vocabulary and so could in principle also be influenced by Avestan.&quot; &quot;Sometimes, both Median and Old Persian forms are found, which gave Old Persian a somewhat confusing and inconsistent look: &#x27;horse,&#x27; for instance, is [attested in Old Persian as] both (OPers.) and (Med.).&quot;

==Script==

Old Persian texts were written from left to right in the syllabic Old Persian cuneiform script and had 36 phonetic characters and 8 logograms. The usage of logograms is not obligatory. The script was surprisingly not a result of evolution of the script used in the nearby civilisation of Mesopotamia. Despite the fact that Old Persian was written in cuneiform script, the script was not a direct continuation of Mesopotamian tradition and in fact, according to Schmitt, was a &quot;deliberate creation of the sixth century BCE&quot;.

The origin of the Old Persian cuneiform script and the identification of the date and process of introduction are a matter of debate among Iranian scholars with no general agreement having been reached. The factors making the consensus difficult are, among others, the difficult passage DB (IV lines 88–92) from Darius the Great who speaks of a new &quot;form of writing&quot; being made by himself which is said to be &quot;in Aryan&quot;:

Also, the analysis of certain Old Persian inscriptions are &quot;supposed or claimed&quot; to predate Darius the Great. Although it is true that the oldest attested Old Persian inscriptions are found on the Behistun monument from Darius, the creation of this &quot;new type of writing&quot; seems, according to Schmitt, &quot;to have begun already under Cyrus the Great&quot;.

The script shows a few changes in the shape of characters during the period it was used. This can be seen as a standardization of the heights of wedges, which in the beginning (i.e. in DB) took only half the height of a line.

==Phonology==
The following phonemes are expressed in the Old Persian script:


Most phonemes are conventionally transcribed with the corresponding IPA symbols shown on this table, including for . The exceptions are , as the first three letters are used for , and is used for the remaining phoneme ( in the native script, of uncertain pronunciation but perhaps an affricate or sibilant of some kind).

Lycian ~ for (genuine) Old Persian (besides the Median form ) = Tissaphernes suggests as the pronunciation of (compare and Kloekhorst 2008, p. 125 in for this example, who, however, mistakenly writes , which contradicts the etymology PIIr. ] and the Middle Persian form [ gives Middle Persian ]).

The phoneme does not occur in native Iranian vocabulary, only in borrowings from Akkadian (a new develops in Middle Persian from Old Persian and the change of to ). The phoneme can also form a syllable peak; both the way Persian names with syllabic (such as Brdiya) are rendered in Elamite and its further development in Middle Persian suggest that before the syllabic , an epenthetic vowel had developed already in the Old Persian period, which later became after labials. For example, Old Persian is rendered in Elamite as , rendering transcriptions such as , or even questionable and making or much more realistic (and equally for &quot;wolf&quot;, and other Old Persian words and names with syllabic ).

While usually became in Middle Persian, it became word-initially in New Persian, except before (including the epenthetic vowel mentioned above), where it became . This suggests that it was really pronounced as .

==Grammar==
===Grammatical numbers===
Old Persian has 3 types of grammatical number: singular, dual and plural.

===Grammatical genders===
Old Persian has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. In contrast, Modern Persian (as well as Middle Persian) is a genderless language.

===Nouns===
Old Persian stems:
* a-stems ()
* i-stems ()
* u- (and au-) stems ()
* consonantal stems ()

Adjectives are declined in a similar way.

===Verbs===
Voices
Active, Middle (them. pres. , ), Passive ().

Mostly the forms of first and third persons are attested. The only preserved Dual form is &#x27;both lived&#x27;.

<doc id="399426" wikidata="Q1326874" url="?curid=399426" title="Lincoln Díaz-Balart">
<text>Lincoln Rafael Díaz-Balart (born Lincoln Rafael Díaz-Balart y Caballero; August 13, 1954) is a Cuban-American attorney and politician. He was the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate. He retired from Congress in 2011 and his younger brother, Mario Díaz-Balart, who had previously represented , succeeded him. He is currently chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute. After leaving Congress, he started a law practice and a consulting firm, both based in Miami, Florida.

==Early life and education==
Díaz-Balart was born in Havana, Cuba, to the late Cuban politician Rafael Díaz-Balart and Hilda Caballero Brunet. His aunt, Mirta Díaz-Balart, was the first wife of the late Fidel Castro. Her son, and his cousin was the late Dr. Fidel Ángel &quot;Fidelito&quot; Castro Díaz-Balart. His uncle is the Cuban-Spanish painter, Waldo Díaz-Balart.

He was educated at the American School of Madrid in Spain; New College of Florida; and Case Western Reserve University, from which he earned a Juris Doctor degree. He was involved in a Miami private practice for several years before holding elective office.

==Political career==
In 1982, he ran for a Florida House of Representatives seat for District 113 as a Democrat and lost to the Republican, Humberto Cortina.

Díaz-Balart, as well as his immediate family, were all members of the Democratic Party. Díaz-Balart was the former president of the Dade County Young Democrats and the Florida Young Democrats, as well as a member of the executive committee of the Dade County Democratic Party.
On April 24, 1985, Diaz-Balart, his wife, and brother Mario switched their registrations to Republican.

Díaz-Balart served as a Republican in the Florida House of Representatives from 1986 to 1989 and in the Florida Senate from 1989 to 1992.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Congressional committees===
* Committee on Rules (Vice Chairman 2005–2007)
** Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process (Chairman 2005–2007, Ranking Member 2007–2011)
* Committee on Homeland Security
** Subcommittee on Rules (Chairman 2003–2005)

===Party leadership===
* House Republican Policy Committee

==Political positions==
In general, Diaz-Balart&#x27;s voting record has been moderate by Republican standards. His lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union is 73.

In 1994, he was one of only three Republican incumbents not to sign the Republican Contract with America. He objected to provisions in its welfare reform section that would deny federal programs to legal immigrants.

In 2006, he voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment and in 2009 voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded the federal hate crime law to include a person&#x27;s perceived gender, sexual orientation, identity or disability. In December 2010, Diaz-Balart was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; ban on openly gay service members.

He was a sponsor of the Homeland Security Act. He was a sponsor of the DREAM Act which seeks to facilitate access for illegal immigrant students to post-secondary education by allowing states to have power to determine requirements for in-state tuition.

He achieved passage into law of historic pieces of legislation – such as the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), and the codification of the U.S. embargo on Cuba (requiring that all political prisoners be freed and multi-party elections scheduled in Cuba before U.S. sanctions can be lifted). Diaz-Balart took the rule to the floor of the House for passage of the legislation that created the Department of Homeland Security and the extension (for 25 years) of the Voting Rights Act.

===Cuba===
Diaz-Balart played a prominent role in the Cuban-American lobby, and was active in the attempt by relatives of Elian Gonzalez to gain custody of the six-year-old from his Cuban father. Diaz-Balart was a member of the Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus.

===Healthcare===
In March 2010, Diaz-Balart publicly called the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act &quot;a decisive step in the weakening of the United States.&quot;

===2008 financial crisis===
On September 29, 2008, Diaz-Balart voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 &quot;American taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for the irresponsible behavior of Wall Street executives. The average citizen is forced to play by the rules, yet many who did not now get a massive bailout from taxpayers in this plan. This is fundamentally unfair. By bailing out reckless behavior we encourage future reckless behavior.&quot;

==Political campaigns==

===1992 to 1998===
In 1992, Diaz-Balart defeated fellow State Senator Javier Souto in the Republican primary for the newly created 21st District. No other party put up a candidate, assuring Diaz-Balart&#x27;s election. He was unopposed for reelection in 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2002 and defeated Democrat Patrick Cusack with 75 percent in 1998.

===2004 and 2006===
In both 2004 and 2006, Lincoln Diaz-Balart was unsuccessfully challenged by Frank J. Gonzalez , a Libertarian Party candidate in 2004 and Democrat in 2006. In 2004, Diaz-Balart won with 73% of the vote. In 2006, Diaz-Balart won with 59% of the vote.

In 2004, Gonzalez ran for U.S. House as the Libertarian Party candidate and spent around $12,000 and earned 54,736 votes or 27% of the total.

In 2006, Gonzalez managed to earn 45,522 votes or 41% according to the Florida Department of State&#x27;s Division of Elections website.

===2008===

Diaz-Balart&#x27;s Democratic opponent in 2008 was former Hialeah Mayor Raul L. Martinez. It was initially thought that Diaz-Balart would face his toughest race to date. Although the 21st District is considered the most Republican district in the Miami area, Martinez was thought to be very popular in the area. Nevertheless, Diaz-Balart won re-election with 58% of the vote.

===2010===

In February 2010, Diaz-Balart announced his intention not to seek re-election. His brother, Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart, ran to succeed him and won.

==Personal life==
Díaz-Balart is married to Cristina Fernandez and had two children: Lincoln Jr. and Daniel. Lincoln Jr. died on May 19, 2013, at the age of 29. His family said he had battled depression for many years.

Díaz-Balart&#x27;s brother, Mario Díaz-Balart, previously represented the 25th district of Florida, moved to the 21st district, but moved back to the 25th district after redistricting. He has two other brothers: José Díaz-Balart, a journalist and anchorman of the Saturday edition of the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and Rafael Díaz-Balart, an investment consultant.

<doc id="399431" wikidata="Q4909051" url="?curid=399431" title="Bill Freehan">
<text>William Ashley Freehan (November 29, 1941 – August 19, 2021) was an American catcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire 15-year career with the Detroit Tigers. The premier catcher in the American League for several years from the 1960s into the early 1970s, he was named an All-Star in 11 seasons, the most All-Star seasons for a player to not be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was the MVP runner-up for Tigers&#x27; 1968 World Series winning team, handling a pitching staff which included World Series MVP Mickey Lolich and regular season MVP Denny McLain, who that year became the first 30-game winner in the majors since 1934.

A five-time Gold Glove Award winner, Freehan held the major league record for highest career fielding percentage (.9933) until 2002, and also the records for career putouts (9,941) and total chances (10,734) from 1975 until the late 1980s; he ranked ninth in major league history in games caught (1,581) at the end of his career. His career totals of 200 home runs and 2,502 total bases placed him behind only Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey among AL catchers when he retired.

==Early life==
Freehan was born in Detroit on November 29, 1941. His father, Ashley, worked as a sales representative for a seat insulation company; his mother was Helen (Morris). He was raised in Royal Oak, Michigan, until he was 14 years old, when his family relocated to St. Petersburg, Florida. He attended Bishop Barry High School, graduating in 1959. He initially intended to study at the University of Notre Dame, but did not want to choose between playing football or baseball. He consequently enrolled at the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship, where he played as catcher on its baseball team and linebacker and end on its football team. He set an all-time Big Ten Conference batting mark of .585 in 1961.

==Major league career==
Freehan signed with his hometown Tigers in 1961 for a $100,000 bonus, which his father withheld until he graduated from college in 1966. He broke in briefly with four games at the end of the 1961 season before returning to the minors in 1962. In 1963 he arrived in the majors to stay, working with former catcher Rick Ferrell on his defense and splitting catching duties with Gus Triandos, who was traded following the season. The 1964 campaign gave indications of what was to come; becoming the Tigers&#x27; full-time catcher with 141 games behind the plate, Freehan batted .300 to finish sixth in the American League (AL), and added 18 home runs and 80 runs batted in. He also led the AL by throwing out 53% of potential base stealers, earned the first of his ten consecutive All-Star selections, and placed seventh in the Most Valuable Player Award balloting. In 1965, he led AL catchers in putouts for the first of six times, and received the first of his five consecutive Gold Gloves. In 1966 he again led the league in putouts, and also led in fielding percentage for the first of four times.

1967 was his best season yet, as he batted .282 – ninth in the AL as averages hit an all-time low – with 20 home runs, and broke Elston Howard&#x27;s 1964 AL single-season records with 950 putouts and 1,021 total chances. Freehan led the league in both intentional walks (15 of his 73 total walks) and times hit by pitch (20), leading to a career-high .389 on-base percentage. He finished third in the MVP voting after Detroit finished one game behind the Boston Red Sox for the AL pennant.
Freehan had an even better year in 1968 as he was considered the quiet leader of the 1968 World Series championship squad. In a year marked by dominant pitching, he posted career highs with 25 home runs and 84 RBI, fifth and sixth in the AL respectively. Freehan broke his own records with 971 putouts and 1,050 total chances, marks which remained league records until Dan Wilson topped them with the 1997 Seattle Mariners. He was also hit by 24 pitches, the most in the AL since Kid Elberfeld in 1911. Despite playing in hitter-friendly Tiger Stadium, Freehan guided the Tigers&#x27; pitching staff to an earned run average of 2.71, third best in the league. McLain won 31 games and Lolich won 17 as the Tigers ran away with the pennant. Because of his offensive and defensive contributions, he finished second to McLain in the MVP voting. Freehan and Carl Yastrzemski were the only players to finish in the top ten of the voting in both 1967 and 1968, and only Yastrzemski reached base more often in 1968. Freehan capped his season by recording the final out of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, retiring Tim McCarver on a popup. He also made a pivotal play in Game 5, with the Cardinals leading the Series 3-1 and the game 3-2. In the fifth inning, Lou Brock – whom Freehan had thrown out on an attempted steal in the third inning – doubled with one out and attempted to score on Julián Javier&#x27;s single, however Freehan successfully blocked the plate with his foot, and held on to the ball even though Brock came in standing up in an attempt to knock the ball loose. Detroit won by scoring three runs in the seventh inning, and went on to take the last two games.

Although Freehan&#x27;s later seasons rarely approached the brilliance of those two campaigns, he continued to turn out All-Star years for the Tigers. His offensive numbers dipped in 1970, but he threw out 47% of potential base stealers (his highest mark since 1964) and had a .997 fielding percentage. In 1971, he rebounded at the plate with a .277 batting average and 21 home runs, three of those coming in one game against the Boston Red Sox in August. He hit .262 for the 1972 Eastern Division champions. He missed the first two games (both losses) of the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics while recovering from a hairline fracture of his thumb, then doubled and homered in a 3-0 Game 3 win, in which Joe Coleman set a League Championship Series record with 14 strikeouts. Freehan drove in the first of three runs in the tenth inning of Game 4 in a memorable 4-3 come-from-behind victory which tied the series; he also drove in Detroit&#x27;s only run in the 2-1 Game 5 loss. In 1974, splitting time between first base (65 games) and catcher (63 games), he hit .297 and finished fifth in the American League in slugging percentage with a .479 mark. He moved back behind the plate the following year to earn his 11th All-Star berth. Freehan ended his career in 1976, batting .270.

==Career statistics==
In his 15-year career, Freehan played in 1,774 games with 1,591 hits in 6,073 at bats for a .262 batting average along with 241 doubles, 200 home runs, 758 RBI, and a .340 on-base percentage. In addition to his home runs and total bases, his .412 slugging percentage and totals of 1,591 hits, 706 runs and 476 extra base hits all put him among the top five AL catchers to that time. His batting totals are particularly remarkable in light of the fact offense was at a low throughout the sport during his career, with a decided advantage toward pitchers. Freehan led all AL catchers in fielding percentage four times (1965, 1966, 1970, 1973). He also ranked sixth in American League history with 114 times being hit by a pitch. Freehan caught more games than any other player in Tigers&#x27; team history. In his book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, baseball historian Bill James ranked Freehan 12th all-time among major league catchers.

Freehan held the major league record for highest career fielding percentage (.9933) until 2002, when Dan Wilson broke his record. In 1973 and 1974 he surpassed Yogi Berra to become the AL&#x27;s all-time leader in putouts and total chances; he broke Johnny Roseboro&#x27;s major league marks in 1975. Bob Boone broke Freehan&#x27;s major league mark of 10,734 career total chances in 1987, and Gary Carter surpassed his putouts total of 9,941 in 1988; Carlton Fisk broke his AL records in 1989 (total chances) and 1990 (putouts). Freehan caught 114 shutouts during his career, ranking him 18th all-time among major league catchers.

During the 1969 season, Freehan penned &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, a diary-type recording of his thoughts and experiences as seen from the catcher&#x27;s perspective that saw publication in 1970. He and pitcher Mickey Lolich started 324 games as a battery, at the time more than any other duo since 1900, and a record that stood until Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals broke it in 2022.

==Post-playing career==
After retiring as a player, Freehan coached Tigers catcher Lance Parrish on the fine points of playing his position. In 1978, Freehan was one of seven members of the inaugural class of inductees to the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He served as a color commentator for Seattle Mariners broadcasts from 1979 to 1980, and for Tigers broadcasts on PASS Sports television from 1984 to 1985. He subsequently returned to the University of Michigan as head coach of the baseball team from 1989 to 1995. He went back to the Tigers as a catching instructor in 2002, serving in that capacity for three seasons before retiring.

==Personal life==
Freehan married Patricia O’Brien on February 23, 1963. She was the sister of Dan O&#x27;Brien and they met while in high school. Together, they had three children: Corey Sue, Kelley, and Cathy. He and his wife relocated to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, during their later years.

Freehan was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in his later years. In October 2018, it was revealed Freehan was in hospice care at his home in Northern Michigan. He died on August 19, 2021, from the disease at the age of 79.

<doc id="399433" wikidata="Q218894" url="?curid=399433" title="Pocahontas (1995 film)">
<text>Pocahontas is a 1995 American animated musical historical drama film loosely based on the life of Powhatan woman Pocahontas and the arrival of English settlers from the Virginia Company. The film romanticizes Pocahontas&#x27;s encounter with John Smith and her legendary saving of his life. It was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

The film was directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg and produced by Jim Pentecost, from a screenplay written by Carl Binder, Susannah Grant, and Philip LaZebnik. It stars the voices of Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson as Pocahontas and Smith, respectively, with David Ogden Stiers, Russell Means, Christian Bale, Michelle St. John, James Apaumut Fall, Billy Connolly, Joe Baker, Gordon Tootoosis, and Linda Hunt in supporting roles. The score was composed by Alan Menken, who also wrote the film&#x27;s songs with lyricist Stephen Schwartz.

After making his directorial debut with &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), Gabriel conceived the film during a Thanksgiving weekend. Goldberg, who had just finished up work as the supervising animator of the Genie in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), joined Gabriel as co-director. The project went into development concurrently with &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), and attracted most of Disney&#x27;s top animators. Meanwhile, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the film should be an emotional romantic epic in the vein of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), in hope that like &quot;Beauty&quot;, it would also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Screenwriters Binder, Grant, and LaZebnik took creative liberties with history in an attempt to make the film palatable to audiences.

&quot;Pocahontas&quot; premiered at Central Park on June 10, 1995, and was released in the United States on June 16, to mixed reactions from critics and audiences, who praised its animation, voice performances, and music, but criticized its story with its lack of focus on tone. The film&#x27;s historical inaccuracies and artistic license received polarized responses. &quot;Pocahontas&quot; earned over $346 million at the box office. The film received two Academy Awards for Best Musical or Comedy Score for Menken and Best Original Song for &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;. According to critics, the depiction of Pocahontas as an empowered heroine influenced subsequent Disney films like &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) and &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013). The film was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;, in 1998.

==Plot==

In 1607, the &quot;Susan Constant&quot; travels from London to the New World, carrying English settlers from the Virginia Company. The settlers, including Captain John Smith, talk of adventure, finding gold, fighting &quot;Injuns&quot; and potentially settling in the new land. They encounter a hurricane shortly after setting sail, during which a soldier by the name of Thomas washes overboard. John Smith manages to save him by rappelling off the ship but they narrowly escape when the rope breaks.

In the Powhatan tribe in Virginia, Pocahontas, the daughter of Chief Powhatan, fears being possibly wed to Kocoum, a warrior whom she sees as too serious for her own free-spirited personality. After having a dream about a spinning arrow, Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow, a talking willow tree that alerts her to the arriving English.

The voyage&#x27;s leader Governor Ratcliffe, who seeks only wealth and status, has Jamestown built in a wooded clearing and immediately has the crewmen dig for gold, which he secretly plans to use to dethrone King James. John departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. At first, she speaks to him in Powhatan, but soon, he gains her trust. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other&#x27;s worlds, and end up falling in love. After a fight between settlers and natives, Powhatan orders the natives to stay away from the Englishmen. Pocahontas, however, disobeys him and keeps meeting with John. Unfortunately, Pocahontas&#x27;s best friend, Nakoma, discovers the secret relationship and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of John&#x27;s encounters and angrily warns him against sparing any Natives.

Later, John and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. While both parties spy on the couple, John and Pocahontas share a kiss. Furious, Kocoum attacks and attempts to kill John, but a young settler, Thomas, whose life John previously had saved and who had been ordered by Ratcliffe to follow John, intervenes and kills Kocoum. John orders Thomas to leave before the tribesmen arrive. They capture John and retrieve Kocoum&#x27;s body. Enraged at Kocoum&#x27;s death, Powhatan angrily scolds Pocahontas for leaving the village, and declares war on the English, beginning with John&#x27;s execution at dawn.

Reaching Jamestown, Thomas warns the settlers of John&#x27;s capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle, using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their nonexistent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow and realizes the arrow from John&#x27;s compass is the same spinning arrow from her dream, which leads to her destiny. Morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff for his execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to fight Powhatan&#x27;s warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to execute John and start the war, Pocahontas intervenes and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups and spare John&#x27;s life. Both sides stand down, and John is released. Unmoved, Ratcliffe fires his musket at Powhatan, but John takes the shot to save him. Livid, and despite Ratcliffe accusing John of taking the shot, the settlers turn on him and arrest him for hurting their comrade.

John is nursed back to health by the tribe but must return to England for his wounds to fully heal. Ratcliffe is also sent back to face punishment for his crimes against the settlement. John asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe to help keep the peace. John leaves without Pocahontas, but with Powhatan&#x27;s blessing to return anytime in the future. At the end, Pocahontas stands atop a cliff, watching the ship carrying John depart.

Three actors in the film have been involved in other Pocahontas-related projects. Gordon Tootoosis acted as Chief Powhatan in &quot;&quot; (1995). Christian Bale and Irene Bedard would portray John Rolfe and Pocahontas&#x27; mother, respectively, in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The New World&quot; (2005).

==Production==
===Development===
Following the release of &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), director Mike Gabriel was eager to collaborate with veteran Disney story artist Joe Grant on a follow-up project that was vastly different from the animated adventure film. In April and May 1991, they first partnered on an adaptation of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; with both of them writing story outlines and creating conceptual artwork. Gabriel and Grant then submitted their outline for approval, but it was negatively received by the studio&#x27;s live-action script readers. Earlier, during Thanksgiving weekend, 1990, Gabriel had wanted to direct an animated musical set in the American West. At a relative&#x27;s Thanksgiving dinner, while glancing through numerous titles in their bookcase, Gabriel struck on the idea of adapting the life of Pocahontas after finding a book about her. Following the cancellation of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, Gabriel returned to the idea.

Shortly after, Gabriel pitched his idea at the &quot;Gong Show&quot; meeting held by Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Peter Schneider, and Roy E. Disney. He had written the title &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Pocahontas&quot; on an image of Tiger Lily from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953) to the back of which he taped a brief pitch that read &quot;an Indian princess who is torn between her father&#x27;s wishes to destroy the English settlers and her wishes to help them – a girl caught between her father and her people, and her love for the enemy.&quot; Coincidentally, Feature Animation president Peter Schneider had been developing an animated version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and observed several similarities between his idea and Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot; pitch; Schneider recalled: &quot;We were particularly interested in exploring the theme of &#x27;If we don&#x27;t learn to live with one another, we will destroy ourselves. Gabriel&#x27;s pitch was quickly accepted, becoming the quickest story turnaround in Disney studio history.
After &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991) was unprecedentedly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture at the 64th Academy Awards, then-studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg opted to produce another animated romance film in the hopes of achieving a similar feat. While &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) were considered to be too far into development, Katzenberg deemed &quot;Pocahontas&quot; a promising candidate, and thus pushed for the heroine to be older, the romance between her and Smith to be more mature, and the animals to be mute. Head of story Tom Sito went on the record stating he wanted to include &quot;broader&quot; jokes, but the &quot;higher-ups wanted it more winsome, more gentle. Some of the folks were so concerned about political correctness, they didn&#x27;t want to be cuckoo-wacky about it.&quot;

Eric Goldberg—following his contributions to &quot;Aladdin&quot; as the supervising animator of the Genie and with all animation units for &quot;The Lion King&quot; already occupied—was asked to co-direct &quot;Pocahontas&quot; alongside Gabriel, to which he agreed. Likewise, he had originally expected the film to be more comedic and cartoonish like &quot;Aladdin&quot;, but Schneider informed him that the film would be produced in a vein more similar to that of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;; the then-ongoing 1992 Los Angeles riots further convinced Goldberg to commit to the film due to its racial themes. However, executive interference would grow so much that Goldberg himself decided to work for Chuck Jones Productions under the pseudonym &quot;Claude Raynes&quot; during production. It eventually reached a peak when Joe Grant drew Percy wearing a Native American feather, by which the animators took the concept one step further by placing a Spanish ruff on Meeko. One executive exclaimed, &quot;Animals don&#x27;t have the intelligence to switch their clothes! They don&#x27;t even have opposing thumbs.&quot; The animators would retain their concept for the film.

Under Katzenberg, Frank Wells, and Michael Eisner, the Disney studios had begun a correlation of hiring Broadway personnel to manage the Disney animation staff on their feature films that brought such producers as Amy Pell to &quot;Aladdin&quot; and Sarah McArthur and Thomas Schumacher to &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Before making his producing debut on &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, James Pentecost had earlier worked as a production stage manager on several Broadway productions including &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; and &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;.

In June 1992, the filmmakers embarked on a research trip to the Jamestown Settlement where Pentecost first met Shirley &quot;Little Dove&quot; Custalow-McGowan and Debbie &quot;White Dove&quot; Custalow, both descendants of the Powhatan Native Americans. The trip also included a visit to the Pamunkey Indian Reservation, and conducted interviews with historians at Old Dominion University. Following the research trip, Custalow-McGowan served as a consultant traveling to the Disney studios three times, and while Custalow-McGowan offered her services for free, Disney paid her a $500 daily consulting fee plus expenses. Ultimately, when it came to light that historical accuracy was not being pursued to the extent she had hoped, McGowan voiced her feelings of shame she felt in conjunction with her work on the film, saying &quot;[she] wish[ed her] name wasn&#x27;t on it&quot;. Additional Native American consultants were brought in to authenticate the clothing and war dance choreography. That same month, Katzenberg held a meeting with the Feature Animation staff in which he predicted that &quot;Pocahontas&quot; would be a commercial hit, while deeming &quot;The Lion King&quot; experimental and less likely to succeed. As a result, most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on &quot;Pocahontas&quot; instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.

===Writing===
In January 1993, Carl Binder joined the project, having previous expertise as a television writer on shows such as &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;, and &quot;Top Cops&quot;. Four months later, Susannah Grant and Philip LaZebnik joined the writing team. Susannah Grant was selected by Disney as a screenwriter on &quot;Pocahontas&quot; after winning the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the year before while still attending film school. On board as a screenwriter, she was only one of the many who was contributing the specific vision the upper management at Disney had in mind, and collaborated with Native American consultants. While working on the film, Susannah Grant wrote to a specific story outline, and no scene was rewritten fewer than thirty-five times until she felt it was perfect.

Story supervisor Tom Sito, who became the project&#x27;s unofficial historical consultant, did extensive research into the early colonial era and the story of John Smith and Pocahontas, but was confronted over the historical inaccuracies by historians. Already knowing that in reality, Pocahontas married John Rolfe, Gabriel explained it was felt that &quot;the story of Pocahontas and Rolfe was too complicated and violent for a youthful audience&quot; so instead, they would focus on Pocahontas&#x27;s meeting with John Smith. The filmmakers discovered that Pocahontas was around twelve years old and Smith was &quot;not a very likeable character&quot;, in which producer James Pentecost confessed that dramatic license was needed to be taken. Likewise, when searching for an appropriate age for Pocahontas to begin her relationship with Smith, Glen Keane explained, &quot;We had the choice of being historically accurate or socially responsible, so we chose the socially responsible side&quot; by increasing Pocahontas&#x27;s age from a girl into a young woman.
One of Gabriel&#x27;s early ideas was for Pocahontas&#x27;s mother to be embodied in a certain star in the sky that would help Pocahontas find her path to Smith. &quot;The Lion King&quot; however had concurrently carried a similar idea of the ancestors giving wisdom and guidance to the protagonist so the idea was discarded. Michael Eisner pushed for Pocahontas to have a mother, lamenting that &quot;We&#x27;re always getting fried for having no mothers.&quot; The writers countered that Powhatan was polygamous and formed dynastic alliances among other neighboring tribes by impregnating a local woman and giving away the child, so it was believed that Pocahontas herself probably did not see her mother that much. &quot;Well&quot;, Eisner conceded, &quot;I guess that means we&#x27;re toasted.&quot; Ultimately, her mother&#x27;s spirit would become the swirling wind that occurs throughout the film.

For the villain, they chose John Ratcliffe, whose portrayal was based on actual English captains, including John Martin, Christopher Newport, and Edward Maria Wingfield. In reality, it was Wingfield who despised John Smith, but the filmmakers preferred the sinister sound of &quot;Ratcliffe&quot;. The writers tried to adapt actual events from Pocahontas&#x27;s life into the film such as her warning Smith that the Native Americans were after him so he could escape in the middle of the night, Powhatan ordering the captured Smith to make bead necklaces to humiliate him, and Pocahontas being captured by Ratcliffe (instead of Samuel Argall), though none of them worked with the story.

Sito mentioned that Joe Grant contributed heavily towards the film, as he was the creator of Redfeather, Meeko, and Flit. Redfeather was a wise-cracking turkey who was intended to be voiced by John Candy, and Percy, who was to be voiced by Richard E. Grant, was revised to become mute. Following the death of John Candy in March 1994, co-screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co-wrote for &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime instead of talking. Joe Grant stated Redfeather &quot;had comic potential–he thought he was handsome, a lady&#x27;s man. When we decided he couldn&#x27;t talk, and, having no hands, he couldn&#x27;t mime ...&quot;.

Joe Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair-braiding raccoon, which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors &quot;loved the idea and got rid of the turkey character.&quot; Similarly, according to Sito, Meeko was created because raccoons were &quot;naturally enigmatic, because they have little hands and a little mask over their face like a thief.&quot; Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird from having &quot;hummingbirds all over my backyard, [and] I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s a great animal to animate.&#x27;&quot; According to the directors, Governor Ratcliffe&#x27;s pampered pet, Percy, was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went.

For the spiritual ancestor, a male character named Old Man River was originally envisioned, and Gregory Peck was cast in the role. Peck later realized that the character ought to be a maternal figure and reluctantly turned down the role. Conceived as a tree of life whose seasonal changes would frame the story, Grandmother Willow grew out of a concept sketch of a sawed-off tree with a branch pointing to its rings drawn by Joe Grant, which would serve as a narrator that would &quot;remember back to Pocahontas 300 years earlier&quot;. Joe Grant would continue to protest to have the tree be more a character within the story, and her character flowered into the idea of a grandmotherly spiritual adviser to Pocahontas. Because of Katzenberg&#x27;s opposition to having Grandmother Willow in the story, Joe Grant assisted fellow veteran story artist Burny Mattinson with coming up with tree puns such as &quot;My bark is worse than my bite&quot;, &quot;The roots of all problems&quot;, and &quot;They&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree.&quot; Mattinson reluctantly added them to his pitch for the next morning, and during the story meeting, he exclaimed, &quot;Everybody loved it! All of a sudden: &#x27;Oh, I want her in!&#x27; &#x27;Let&#x27;s build her part bigger!

===Casting===

In September 1992, Disney began casting actors for &quot;Pocahontas&quot; telling talent agents that they were particularly interested in Native American actors for the project. For the role of Pocahontas, Broadway actress-singer Judy Kuhn was hired to provide the singing voice for the eponymous character before Irene Bedard was cast. Kuhn explained &quot;They said, &#x27;You are going to do the dialogue unless we find a Native American actress whose singing voice matched yours.&#x27; I was cast before Irene, so it actually went backwards.&quot; Bedard herself was filming &quot;Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee&quot; (1994) where she was informed by the casting director that they were looking for someone to voice the title role. According to Bedard, she took a train to Buffalo, New York, where she walked in wearing a sundress and a straw hat, and read for the part. Back on the set of &quot;Lakota Woman&quot;, she learned that she was cast in the role. Michelle St. John had also auditioned for the role of Pocahontas, and was given the role of Nakoma after Bedard was cast.

Mel Gibson was cast as English settler John Smith following a desire to make &quot;something for my kids.&quot; In a notable contrast to previous voice actors for Disney animated features, Gibson provided the singing voice for his character, which the actor has described as the most difficult part of his role.

Christian Bale auditioned for the role of Thomas. As he explained in an interview with &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;, &quot;the directors played with Thomas being Irish and Scottish and younger than I am, so I had to raise my voice and do different accents. But the more we did it, the more he became like me–older and English.&quot; Richard White, the voice of Gaston in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, was supposed to voice Ratcliffe, but the crew was worried he might sound too much like Gaston, so he was replaced by his co-star David Ogden Stiers, who also voices Ratcliffe&#x27;s dimwitted assistant Wiggins. Robbie Coltrane and Chris Barrie were brought in to read for Ratcliffe, while Goldberg wanted Hugh Laurie to play Wiggins.

Russell Means was cast as Chief Powhatan, though he initially expressed displeasure with the script in that Native Americans addressed each other using proper names rather than the traditional &quot;my father&quot; or &quot;my friend&quot;. Indigenous Canadian actor Gordon Tootoosis was also cast as the tribal medicine man Kekata. Throughout most of the production, the cast members performed their dialogue in separate recording sessions.

===Design and animation===
Renowned for his animation of Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), supervising animator Glen Keane was immediately tapped to draw the titular Native American princess. Following the demands of Jeffrey Katzenberg to make the title character &quot;the most idealized and finest woman ever made&quot;, Keane first sought his inspirations for his depictions of Pocahontas from Shirley &#x27;Little Dove&#x27; Custalow-McGowan and Devi White Dove, women he had met during the research trip to Virginia. Keane recalled meeting the women:So I turned around and there&#x27;s this beautiful Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said &#x27;Are you Glen Keane? The animator that&#x27;s going to do Pocahontas?&#x27; I said &#x27;Well, yeah.&#x27; And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, &#x27;Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, and this is my sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.&#x27; And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas&#x27; face in my mind – I could see her.

Other inspirations were Natalie Belcon, Naomi Campbell, Jamie Pillow, supermodel Kate Moss, Charmaine Craig, Christy Turlington, Dyna Taylor, and her own voice actress Irene Bedard. For almost three years, Taylor herself sat for four three-hour modeling sessions in which she was videotaped so the animators could draw poses of her from different angles. Keane also looked to a 1620 depiction of Pocahontas from a history book, though he would state the depiction was &quot;not exactly a candidate for &quot;People&quot;″s &#x27;Most Beautiful&#x27; issue [so] I made a few adjustments to add an Asian feeling to her face.&quot; Due to the complexity of the color schemes, shapes, and expressions in the animation, a total of 55 animators worked on the animation of Pocahontas&#x27; character alone, including Mark Henn and Pres Romanillos.

After working at Sullivan-Bluth Studios for over fourteen years, John Pomeroy, who notoriously resigned alongside Don Bluth during work on &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; (1981) in 1979, returned to Disney and worked on the film. Pomeroy noted that initially John Smith was portrayed as well-groomed before the animators tried designs where the character was &quot;sloppier&quot;, bearded, and carried daggers and knives. Pomeroy grew more satisfied with the character&#x27;s design the more simple it became. Additionally, Pomeroy cited inspiration for John Smith from Errol Flynn and the facial features of Gibson.

Initially assigned as a supervising animator on &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Nik Ranieri did character designs and test animation for Timon, but moved over to &quot;Pocahontas&quot; growing frustrated with an indecisive vision from the directors. There, he was assigned to animate Redfeather until Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that the animals be mute. Finding feathers difficult for Redfeather to gesture with, he was again assigned to animate Meeko using a Little Golden Books animal book illustrated by Alice and Martin Provensen as reference. Duncan Marjoribanks utilized geometric shapes to create Ratcliffe. In early drafts of the character, he had a body similar to a pear, but to make him appear more arrogant, the animator increased the force of gravity on his chest so that he seemed more pompous and physically threatening. Chris Buck served as the supervising animator for Percy, Wiggins, and Grandmother Willow. For Grandmother Willow, the face was traditionally animated by Buck, while the cowl and the trunk of the tree were digitally animated under the supervision of Steve Goldberg. Assisted by the effect animators, a 3D software program was employed for the bark to be individually manipulated and for the face to match with the computer-generated texture. The following supervising animators also included Anthony DeRosa for Nakoma, Michael Cedeno for Kocoum, Ken Duncan for Thomas, T. Daniel Hofstedt for the settlers Lon and Ben, and Dave Pruiksma for Flit. While &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998) was within its pre-production stages, 18 minutes were animated by 170 animators and artists at the Disney-MGM Studios.

Initially, Gabriel asked Michael Giaimo to create conceptual paintings for the film as they both shared in a style of shape-based and secondary art details. Giaimo, himself a former assistant animator and then a CalArts teacher, accepted, working several months on a freelance basis. After Goldberg became the film&#x27;s co-director, the two directors asked Giaimo to officially join the staff, in which he was promoted to being the film&#x27;s art director. For Giaimo, he relied on color-saturated, elegant designs in a less-than-realistic format inspired by &quot;prehistory Caribbean themes and creatures derived from Mexican and African folk art.&quot; Giaimo also sought out inspiration for the visual design from the works produced by earlier Disney art designers such as Richard Kelsey (who had done story sketches for his unproduced film &quot;Hiawatha&quot;), Eyvind Earle, who worked on &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959), and Mary Blair.

===Music===

Howard Ashman and Alan Menken were planning to write songs for &quot;Pocahontas&quot; once they were finished working on &quot;Aladdin&quot;, but Ashman died in 1991. Following the death of his longtime collaborator, Menken wrote the remaining songs for &quot;Aladdin&quot; with Tim Rice at his home in London, which the New York-based composer found to be difficult. When &quot;Aladdin&quot; was finished, Menken was expected to write songs for &quot;Pocahontas&quot; with Rice. Kevin Bannerman, the studio&#x27;s director of development, stated Rice &quot;was always gallivanting around the world and it was difficult to get him and Alan together ... And so here was Stephen [Schwartz], who had written scores that we all loved and we were huge fans of, and he lived in the New York area.&quot; Disney immediately contacted Stephen Schwartz, who, after working on &quot;Working&quot;, &quot;Rags&quot;, and &quot;Children of Eden&quot;, had quit theater and was taking psychology courses at New York University; he was hired to write the lyrics. This would mark the first time Menken had collaborated without Ashman for a Disney animated film. Menken commented that their work included moments of tension because Schwartz was also capable of writing music and Menken had experience with lyrics.

Due to corporate interest in the film surrounding its theme of promoting understanding between different groups, and its inclusion of violence and threats of greater conflict, Schwartz became heavily involved in the storytelling. Bannerman estimated that he spent a week with one of the screenwriters and helped work out the overall themes of tolerance and cooperation. In June 1992, Schwartz researched Jamestown, Virginia where he absorbed the atmosphere and bought tapes of Native American music and English sea shanties, as well as other music from the early 17th century that helped inspire numbers in the film. Schwartz modeled his lyrical writing for people of other ethnicities on that of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick. &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; was the first song to be written for the film. Gabriel, Goldberg, and Pentecost stated the song had defined the film&#x27;s &quot;heart and soul&quot;. Schwartz began &quot;Colors&quot; with a few draft ideas for lyrics taking inspiration from Chief Seattle&#x27;s letter to the United States Congress. Then, Menken wrote the melody with Schwartz listening at the piano and making suggestions. Schwartz would add lyrics before a session together where they were refined.

&quot;Just Around the Riverbend&quot;, also composed by Menken and Schwartz, was devised by Schwartz&#x27;s wife Carole, with the idea that Pocahontas would have a recurring dream that suggested something coming her way, paving the way for her &quot;I Want&quot; song. The song almost did not make it into the completed film when Disney executives doubted whether her song would have the kind of impact they wanted at that point. Schwartz however stated he and Menken &quot;believed in it very strongly. Indeed, at one point we wrote a different song for that spot, but Alan and I were never as happy with the second song and ultimately everybody at Disney came to feel that way, too.&quot;

The filmmakers had planned for a song for when Pocahontas and Smith met in the glade, just before Kocoum attacks Smith. There were an estimated three to four songs at this point, including &quot;Different Drummer&quot;, &quot;In the Middle of the River&quot;, &quot;First to Dance&quot;, which was deemed too silly as it took place before Kocoum&#x27;s death, and &quot;Powerful Magic&quot;, which was another attempt at a cheerful song. A love song, titled &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot;, had been finished by the animators, but following a test screening where child and teen audiences were not interested in the song as it played, Menken suggested that the song be removed. It was, although its melody remained in the orchestral underscoring. The soundtrack was successful, reaching number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts during the week of July 22, 1995. It received a triple platinum certification.

==Release==

===Marketing===

To replicate the promotional buzz of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, the four-minute musical number, &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;, was released in November 1994, accompanying a theatrical re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. On February 3, 1995, Disney began its promotional marketing campaign starting in San Diego, California, launching a nationwide 18-week tour of fashion malls located within twenty-five cities where a mall exhibit named Pocahontas Animation Discovery Adventure was created to help promote the release. There, a Disney animator would guide shoppers on a presentation tour, which featured a walk-through maze with interactive lily pads, flying birds, and huge video wall, a studio workshop where visitors can become the voice of their favorite animated character, and an area where visitors can electronically manipulate images. Additionally, they would demonstrate animation techniques and discuss the design and creation of Pocahontas&#x27; character. Further promotional tie-ins included Burger King distributing 55 million toy replicas of the characters with kids&#x27; meals, Payless Shoes selling a line of moccasins, and Mattel peddling a Barbie-like Pocahontas doll.

A behind-the-scenes documentary television special titled &quot;The Making of Pocahontas: A Legend Comes to Life&quot; aired on the Disney Channel on June 20, 1995, where the animators, voice cast, crew, and studio heads were interviewed on the production of the film. The special was hosted by actress Irene Bedard.

The film had the largest premiere in history, on June 10, 1995, in New York&#x27;s Central Park, followed by a live performance by Vanessa Williams. Disney officials estimated the crowd at 100,000. The premiere&#x27;s attendees included then-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Caroline Kennedy, Mariah Carey and Michael Eisner.

===Home media===
At first announced to be released on March 6, 1996, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States on February 28, 1996, under the &quot;Masterpiece Collection&quot; lineup. A deluxe VHS edition included supplemental features such as a making-of documentary, alongside a special edition of &quot;The Art of Pocahontas&quot; book and Disney-certified lithograph prints. On November 13, 1996, the CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition contained the film, a historical documentary on Pocahontas, and &quot;The Making of Pocahontas&quot;, along with added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, publicity and promotional trailers, the deleted &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot; musical sequence, and an audio commentary on a total of four double sided discs. The release was also accompanied with a Special Edition of the &quot;Art of Pocahontas&quot; book. Disney initially shipped 17 million VHS copies to retail stores, with nine million copies sold within its first weekend. By mid-1998, the operating income of the VHS release had accumulated to in worldwide sales.

In January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection, with &quot;Pocahontas&quot; re-issued on VHS and DVD on June 6, 2000. The DVD contained the film in its 1.66:1 aspect ratio enhanced with 5.1 surround sound, and was accompanied with special features including two music videos, a trivia game, the theatrical trailer, and a &quot;Fun with Nature&quot; activity booklet. Five years later, the film was remastered for a THX-certified 10th Anniversary 2-disc Special Edition DVD, which was released on May 3, 2005. This release features two versions of the film, which are a new extended cut with two performances of &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot; and the original theatrical version.

On August 21, 2012, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, alongside its sequel &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;, on Blu-ray Disc as a 2-Movie Collection. &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was re-released yet again on March 15, 2016, as a Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD combo pack, available exclusively through the Disney Movie Club. It featured brand-new cover art, and, for the first time, a digital copy download of the film alongside the physical release. On February 28, 2017, the film was again released in a 2-Movie Collection with its sequel but in a Blu-ray / Digital HD combo pack and 30th Anniversary in fall 2025.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Timed with Pocahontas&#x27; 400th birthday, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; had a limited release in North America on June 16, 1995, playing in only six selected theaters in Chicago, Boston, Atlanta, Detroit, St. Louis and Los Angeles. The film grossed $2.7 million during its first weekend, standing at the eighth place in the box office ranking. It beat the record set by &quot;The Lion King&quot; the previous year for the highest-grossing opening weekend on fewer than 50 screens, a record that has not been beaten. The wide release followed on June 23, 1995, in 2,596 screens. Studio estimates initially anticipated &quot;Pocahontas&quot; earning $30.5 million, ranking first and beating out the previous box office champion &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995). The figure was later revised to $28.8 million with &quot;Pocahontas&quot; falling second behind &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. The final estimates placed &quot;Pocahontas&quot; narrowly ranking first grossing $29.5 million in its first weekend with &quot;Batman Forever&quot; falling into second place taking $29.2 million.

By January 1996, the film grossed $141.5 million in the United States, being the fourth-highest-grossing film in North America of 1995, behind &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. Overseas, the film was projected to gross $225 million, though foreign box office grosses eventually amounted to $204.5 million. Cumulatively, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; grossed $346.1 million worldwide. Although at the time it was seen as a commercial box office disappointment in comparison to &quot;The Lion King&quot;, in January 1996, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner contested in an annual shareholders&#x27; meeting that &quot;&quot;Pocahontas&quot; is well on its way to being one of our most successful films of all time. It has equalled &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;″s box office numbers domestically, and now it has taken Europe by storm and is playing well in every country in which it is being shown. Sales of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; merchandise have been phenomenal.&quot;

===Critical response===
&quot;Pocahontas&quot; received mixed reviews from film critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 58% of critics gave the film a positive review based on reviews, with an average score of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states &quot;&quot;Pocahontas&quot; means well, and has moments of startling beauty, but it&#x27;s largely a bland, uninspired effort, with uneven plotting and an unfortunate lack of fun.&quot; It was the only film from the Disney Renaissance to be classified as &quot;rotten&quot; on the site. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 58 based on 23 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was &quot;the best-looking of the modern Disney animated features, and one of the more thoughtful&quot; though he was more critical of the story and portrayal of the villain, ultimately summarizing that &quot;on a list including &quot;Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Beauty&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Lion King&quot;, I&#x27;d rank it fifth. It has a lot of good intentions, but a severe scoundrel shortage.&quot; On the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, Ebert repeated the same sentiment, while his partner Gene Siskel was more praising of the film. Both critics gave the film a &quot;Thumbs Up&quot;. In his print review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Siskel awarded the film 3 stars out of 4, stating it is a &quot;surprisingly serious, thoughtful and beautifully drawn Disney animated feature about the American birthright of exploitation and racism&quot;. He praised it for &quot;sending powerful images to children about threats to the natural order&quot;, restoring &quot;a certain majesty to the Indian culture&quot;, and for having &quot;the courage that leads to the life-goes-on ending.&quot;

The film&#x27;s writing and lack of humor received mixed reviews. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated: &quot;With dismay, I realize that virtually everything in the movie – every character, every story twist, every song – is as generic as the two hygienic lovers. As a fairy-tale confection, a kind of &quot;West Side Story&quot; in Jamestown, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; is pleasant to look at, and it will probably satisfy very small kiddies, but it&#x27;s the first of the new-era Disney cartoons that feels less than animated.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; bemoaned that there were &quot;no funny, fast-talking animals – Meeko the raccoon and Flit the hummingbird remain silent pals to Pocahontas and make you miss the verbal fun that Nathan Lane&#x27;s wisecracking meerkat brought to &quot;The Lion King&quot;.&quot; Desson Howe, reviewing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, likewise criticized the writing as recycling &quot;elements from &quot;Snow White&quot; to &quot;The Lion King&quot;, with a father-child clash, a heroine&#x27;s saintly pureness that transforms an entire people, a forbidden love, consultations with an oracle/shaman (in this case a tree spirit, voiced by Linda Hunt) and the usual sideshow of funny, fuzzy animals.&quot; While calling the screenplay the &quot;film&#x27;s weakest element&quot;, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized in her review: &quot;Gloriously colorful, cleverly conceived and set in motion with the usual Disney vigor, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; is one more landmark feat of animation. It does everything a children&#x27;s movie should do except send little viewers home humming its theme song.&quot;

According to Chief Roy &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; Johnson of the Powhatan Renape Nation, an unrecognized tribe in New Jersey, the film &quot;distorts history beyond recognition&quot; and &quot;perpetuates a dishonest and self-serving myth at the expense of the Powhatan Nation&quot;. Roy claimed that Disney had refused the tribe&#x27;s offers to help create a more culturally and historically accurate film. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Angela Aleiss said that &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and other portrayals of the Native princess rarely show her having anything more important in her life than her relationships with men. Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies Cornel Pewewardy argues that the film presents damaging stereotypes of the Native American population. Pewewardy feels that the representation of Native characters, like Grandmother Willow, Meeko, and Flit, as animals, has a marginalizing effect. Anthropologist Kiyomi Kutsuzawa also observed that in the film, Kocoum and John Smith fight for Pocahontas&#x27;s affection. Kutsuzawa viewed Smith&#x27;s victory over Kocoum in this arena as symbolic of Western Europe&#x27;s domination of the Americas and white men&#x27;s domination over men of color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gender/race&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Native American activist Russell Means, who portrays Chief Powhatan in the film, praised the film&#x27;s racial overtones, stating that &quot;&quot;Pocahontas&quot; is the first time Eurocentric male society has admitted its historical deceit&quot;, and that it makes the &quot;stunning admission&quot; that the purpose of the European colonization of the Americas was &quot;to kill Indians and rape and pillage the land.&quot; Means also said that the film marked &quot;the first time, other than on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, that a human face has been put on an Indian female,&quot; dubbing &quot;Pocahontas&quot; &quot;the finest feature film on American Indians Hollywood has turned out.&quot; Sophie Gilbert of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; concurred, stating that the film&#x27;s narrative &quot;had a progressive attitude when it came to interpreting history&quot;, portraying the settlers as &quot;plunderers searching for non-existent gold who were intent upon murdering the &#x27;heathen savages&#x27; they encountered in the process&quot;, although she criticized the depiction of Pocahontas as stereotypical.

===Accolades===
==Historical accuracy==
Pocahontas&#x27; real name was Matoaka (probably also her mother’s name) to her kin, and others called her &quot;Amonute.&quot; &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was only a nickname, and it can variously be translated to &quot;little wanton&quot;, &quot;playful one&quot;, &quot;little brat&quot;, or &quot;the naughty one&quot;. Pocahontas was around 10 or 11 at the time John Smith arrived with the Virginia Company in 1607, in contrast to her portrayal as a mature young adult in the film.

Smith is portrayed as an amiable man; in reality, he was described as having a harsh exterior and a very authoritarian personality by his fellow colonists. Historically, there is no evidence of a romantic relationship emerging between Pocahontas and Smith. Whether or not Pocahontas saved Smith&#x27;s life is debated. In his work, Smith did not account of any danger in his life while he was a prisoner. However, after Pocahontas married John Rolfe, he elaborated a story about her intervention. 

In April 1613, three years after Smith departed for England, Pocahontas became a captive of Captain Samuel Argall in Jamestown. She also converted to Christianity in Henricus. Rolfe, who had recently come to England to try some tobacco, became interested in Pocahontas when she was about 18 and he was 28. He proposed a diplomatic marriage to Powhatan in a confession letter that proceeded to create an alliance between the groups. It is unclear whether Pocahontas reciprocated Rolfe&#x27;s feelings. This marriage helped to establish a short period of peace between the English and the Powhatan. Rolfe may have simply represented a way to establish peaceful relations in her community and a way to escape her oppressive captors.

Governor Ratcliffe did not return to England, but was killed by the Powhatan in 1609.

Ebert criticized the film&#x27;s deviations from history, writing &quot;Having led one of the most interesting lives imaginable, Pocahontas serves here more as a simplified symbol&quot;. Sophie Gilbert of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that &quot;The movie might have fudged some facts&quot;, but that this allowed it to tell &quot;a compelling romantic story&quot;. Conversely, animator Tom Sito defended the film&#x27;s relationship to history, stating that &quot;Contrary to the popular verdict that we ignored history on the film, we tried hard to be historically correct and to accurately portray the culture of Virginia&#x27;s Algonquins.&quot;

==Legacy==
A live musical show titled &quot;The Spirit of Pocahontas&quot; was performed at the Fantasyland Theatre at Disneyland during the film&#x27;s theatrical release. A video game titled &quot;Disney&#x27;s Pocahontas&quot; based on the film was released on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1996. The legacy of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot; video game, especially the Game Boy version, is mixed. While praised for its animation, positive themes, and the unique gameplay of Pocahontas learning skills from animals, it suffers from awkward controls and illogical puzzles, which can frustrate younger players. Despite these flaws, the game is notable for attempting to combine environmental themes with platforming, reflecting the film&#x27;s message of harmony. However, its difficulty and unclear visuals have limited its lasting impact within the Disney game franchise.

The film was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, titled &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;, released on August 25, 1998. Bedard and Kuhn reprised their roles as Pocahontas&#x27; speaking and singing voices, respectively. Donal Gibson starred as John Smith and Billy Zane starred as John Rolfe. Characters from the first film make cameo appearances in numerous episodes of the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. Pocahontas, alongside other Disney Princesses, briefly appeared in the 2018 film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;, with Bedard reprising the role. Pocahontas also made a brief appearance in the 2023 live-action/animated short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, with Kuhn returning to do the character&#x27;s singing voice.

Critics have also discussed the influence of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; on other films. Sophie Gilbert of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; argues that the strong and brave title character of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; influenced the portrayal of subsequent heroines of Disney animated films, specifically Mulan, Rapunzel, Merida, and Elsa. Similarly, &quot;The Verge&quot; Tasha Robinson wrote that &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) &quot;draws on&quot; &quot;Pocahontas&quot; in its portrayal of a woman buoyed by her culture. According to &quot;HuffPost&quot;, James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) is a &quot;rip-off&quot; of &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. &quot;Avatar&quot;″s producer Jon Landau has said that &quot;Avatar&quot; is akin to &quot;Pocahontas&quot; with the Na&#x27;vi aliens taking the place of Native Americans. Cameron has said that he first conceived of &quot;Avatar&quot; in the 1960s, long before &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was released, but he has also said that &quot;Avatar&quot; does reference the story of Pocahontas, the historical figure. Kirsten Acuna of &quot;Business Insider&quot; wrote that, while &quot;Avatar&quot; may be based on Cameron&#x27;s own ideas, it nevertheless takes inspiration from animated films like &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;&quot; (1992).

The New York Times reported in 2023 how Disney appeared to downplay the film and was not interested in revisiting the story the way it has with other animated films due to its subject matter and associated historical controversy.
