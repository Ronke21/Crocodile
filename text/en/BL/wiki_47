<text>Leo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American lynching victim convicted in 1913 of the murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, an employee in a factory in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was the superintendent. Frank&#x27;s trial, conviction, and unsuccessful appeals attracted national attention. His kidnapping from prison and lynching became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Modern researchers generally agree that Frank was wrongly convicted.

Born to a Jewish-American family in Texas, Frank was raised in New York and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1906 before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying Lucille Selig (who became Lucille Frank) in 1910, he involved himself with the city&#x27;s Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. At that time, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory&#x27;s cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look as if she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a &quot;night witch&quot;, they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.

On May 24, 1913, Frank was indicted on a charge of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court, on July 28. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice in the aftermath of the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was, in fact, the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank&#x27;s sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.

The case attracted national press attention and many reporters deemed the conviction a travesty. Within Georgia, this outside criticism fueled antisemitism and hatred toward Frank. On August 16, 1915, he was kidnapped from prison by a group of armed men, and lynched at Marietta, Mary Phagan&#x27;s hometown, the next morning. The new governor vowed to punish the lynchers, who included prominent Marietta citizens, but nobody was charged. In 1986, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles issued a pardon in recognition of the state&#x27;s failures—including to protect Frank and preserve his opportunity to appeal—but took no stance on Frank&#x27;s guilt or innocence. The case has inspired books, movies, a play, a musical, and a TV miniseries.

The African American press condemned the lynching, but many African Americans also opposed Frank and his supporters over what historian Nancy MacLean described as a &quot;virulently racist&quot; characterization of Jim Conley, who was Black.

His case spurred the creation of the Anti-Defamation League and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.

==Background==
===Social and economic conditions===

In the early 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia&#x27;s capital city, underwent significant economic and social change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta. Men from the traditional rural society felt it degrading that women were moving to the city to work in factories.

During this era, Atlanta&#x27;s rabbis and Jewish community leaders helped to resolve animosity toward Jews. In the half-century from 1895, David Marx was a prominent figure in the city. In order to aid assimilation, Marx&#x27;s Reform temple adopted Americanized appearances. Friction developed between the city&#x27;s German Jews, who were integrated, and Russian Jews who had recently immigrated. Marx said the new Russian Jews were &quot;barbaric and ignorant&quot; and believed their presence would create new antisemitic attitudes and a situation which made possible Frank&#x27;s guilty verdict. Despite their success, many Jews recognized themselves as different from the Gentile majority and were uncomfortable with their image. Despite his own acceptance by Gentiles, Marx believed that &quot;in isolated instances there is no prejudice entertained for the individual Jew, but there exists wide-spread and deep seated prejudice against Jews as an entire people.&quot;

An example of the type of tension that Marx feared occurred in April 1913: at a conference on child labor, some participants blamed the problem, in part, on the fact that many factories were Jewish-owned. Historian Leonard Dinnerstein summarized Atlanta&#x27;s situation in 1913 as follows:

===Early life===
Leo Max Frank was born in Cuero, Texas on April 17, 1884, to Rudolph Frank and Rachel &quot;Rae&quot; Jacobs. The family moved to Brooklyn when Leo was three months old. He attended New York City public schools and graduated from Pratt Institute in 1902. He then attended Cornell University, where he studied mechanical engineering. At Cornell, Frank was a member of the H. Morse Stephens Debate Club. After graduating in 1906, he worked briefly as a draftsman and as a testing engineer.

At the invitation of his uncle Moses Frank, Leo traveled to Atlanta for two weeks in late October 1907, to meet a delegation of investors for a position with the National Pencil Company, a manufacturing plant in which Moses was a major shareholder. Frank accepted the position, and traveled to Germany to study pencil manufacturing at the Eberhard Faber pencil factory. After a nine-month apprenticeship, Frank returned to the United States and began working at the National Pencil Company in August 1908. Frank became superintendent of the factory the following month, earning $180 per month plus a portion of the factory&#x27;s profits.

Frank was introduced to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta. She came from a prominent, upper-middle class Jewish family of industrialists who, two generations earlier, had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta. They married in November 1910. Frank described his married life as happy.

In 1912, Frank was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, a Jewish fraternal organization. The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic community whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank&#x27;s northern culture and Jewish faith added to the sense that he was different.

==Murder of Mary Phagan ==

===Phagan&#x27;s early life===
Mary Phagan was born on June 1, 1899, into a Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary&#x27;s birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took a job with the National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked across the hallway from Leo Frank&#x27;s office.

===Discovery of Phagan&#x27;s body===

On April 21, 1913, Phagan was laid off due to a materials shortage. Around noon on April 26, she went to the factory to claim her pay. The next day, shortly before 3:00 a.m., the factory&#x27;s night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan&#x27;s body in the rear of the basement near an incinerator and called the police.

Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A strip of wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to first responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.

A service ramp at the rear of the basement led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.

Two notes were found in a pile of rubbish by Phagan&#x27;s head, and became known as the &quot;murder notes&quot;. One said: &quot;he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef.&quot; The other said, &quot;mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me.&quot; The phrase &quot;night witch&quot; was thought to mean &quot;night watch[man]&quot;; when the notes were initially read aloud, Lee, who was black, said: &quot;Boss, it looks like they are trying to lay it on me.&quot; Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white, when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.

===Police investigation===
In addition to Lee, the police arrested a friend of Phagan&#x27;s for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred on the second floor (the same as Frank&#x27;s office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.

Just after 4 am on Sunday, April 27 after the discovery of Phagan&#x27;s body, both Newt Lee and the police unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7 a.m. without telling the specifics of what happened at the factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan&#x27;s body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45 a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.

On Monday, April 28, Frank, accompanied by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10 p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4 p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6 p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee was arriving. Frank explained that Lee&#x27;s time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser&#x27;s insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate that he had no cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank&#x27;s house.

Frank then met with N. V. Darley, his assistant, and Harry Scott of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, whom Frank hired to investigate the case and prove his innocence. The Pinkerton detectives would investigate many leads, ranging from crime scene evidence to allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Frank. The Pinkertons were required to submit duplicates of all evidence to the police, including any that hurt Frank&#x27;s case. Unbeknownst to Frank, however, was Scott&#x27;s close ties with the police, particularly his best friend, detective John Black, who believed in Frank&#x27;s guilt from the outset.

On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee&#x27;s residence at 11 a.m. looking for evidence, and found a blood-smeared shirt at the bottom of a burn barrel. The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.

Frank was subsequently arrested around 11:30 a.m. at the factory. Steve Oney states that &quot;no single development had persuaded ... [the police] that Leo Frank had murdered Mary Phagan. Instead, to the cumulative weight of Sunday&#x27;s suspicions and Monday&#x27;s misgivings had been added several last factors that tipped the scale against the superintendent.&quot; These factors were the rejection of rumors that Phagan had been seen on the streets, making Frank the last person to admit seeing Phagan; the dropped charges against two suspects; Frank&#x27;s meeting with the Pinkertons; and a &quot;shifting view of Newt Lee&#x27;s role in the affair.&quot; The police were convinced Lee was involved as Frank&#x27;s accomplice and that Frank was trying to implicate him. To bolster their case, the police staged a confrontation between Lee and Frank while both were still in custody; there were conflicting accounts of this meeting, but the police interpreted it as further implicating Frank.

On Wednesday, April 30, a coroner&#x27;s inquest was held. Frank testified about his activities on Saturday and other witnesses produced corroboration. A young man said that Phagan had complained to him about Frank. Several former employees spoke of Frank flirting with other women; one said she was actually propositioned. The detectives admitted that &quot;they so far had obtained no conclusive evidence or clues in the baffling mystery ...&quot;. Lee and Frank were both ordered to be detained.

In May, the detective William J. Burns traveled to Atlanta to offer further assistance in the case. However, his Burns Agency withdrew from the case later that month. C. W. Tobie, a detective from the Chicago affiliate who was assigned to the case, said that the agency &quot;came down here to investigate a murder case, not to engage in petty politic[s].&quot; The agency quickly became disillusioned with the many societal implications of the case, most notably the notion that Frank was able to evade prosecution due to his being a rich Jew, buying off the police and paying for private detectives.

===James &quot;Jim&quot; Conley===
The prosecution based much of its case on the testimony of Jim Conley, the factory&#x27;s janitor, who is believed by many historians to be the actual murderer. The police had arrested Conley on May 1 after he had been seen washing red stains out of a blue work shirt; detectives examined it for blood, but determined that it was rust as Conley had claimed, and returned it. Conley was still in police custody two weeks later when he gave his first formal statement. He said that, on the day of the murder, he had been visiting saloons, shooting dice, and drinking. His story was called into question when a witness told detectives that &quot;a black negro ... dressed in dark blue clothing and hat&quot; had been seen in the lobby of the factory on the day of the murder. Further investigation determined that Conley could read and write, and there were similarities in his spelling with that found on the murder notes. On May 24, he admitted he had written the notes, swearing that Frank had called him to his office the day before the murder and told him to write them. After testing Conley again on his spellinghe spelled &quot;night watchman&quot; as &quot;night witch&quot;the police were convinced he had written the notes. They were skeptical about the rest of his story, not only because it implied premeditation by Frank, but also because it suggested that Frank had confessed to Conley and involved him.

In a new affidavit (his second affidavit and third statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He said he had met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told him to leave the factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.

The police were satisfied with the new story, and both &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; and &quot;The Atlanta Georgian&quot; gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the &quot;Journal&quot;. They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target. The police placed little credence in the officials&#x27; theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan&#x27;s purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. The police were quoted in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank&#x27;s guilt, and the meeting never took place.

On May 29, Conley was interviewed for four hours. His new affidavit said that Frank told him, &quot;he had picked up a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something.&quot; Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank&#x27;s office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two had returned to the office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, &quot;Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens.&quot; Conley&#x27;s affidavit concluded, &quot;The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter.&quot; At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan&#x27;s body in the basement furnace.

The &quot;Georgian&quot; hired William Manning Smith to represent Conley for $40. Smith was known for specializing in representing black clients, and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white woman. He had also taken an elderly black woman&#x27;s civil case as far as the Georgia Supreme Court. Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final affidavit, he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters. Smith was also anxious about reporters from the Hearst papers, who had taken Frank&#x27;s side. He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail, and severed his own relationship with the &quot;Georgian&quot;.

On February 24, 1914, Conley was sentenced to a year in jail for being an accomplice after the fact to Phagan&#x27;s murder.

===Media coverage===
&quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; broke the story of the murder and was soon in competition with &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; and &quot;The Atlanta Georgian&quot;. Forty extra editions came out the day Phagan&#x27;s murder was reported. &quot;The Atlanta Georgian&quot; published a doctored morgue photo of Phagan, in which her head was shown spliced onto the body of another girl. The papers offered a total of $1,800 in reward money for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer. Soon after the murder, Atlanta&#x27;s mayor criticized the police for their steady release of information to the public. The governor, noting the reaction of the public to press sensationalism soon after Lee&#x27;s and Frank&#x27;s arrests, organized ten militia companies in case they were needed to repulse mob action against the prisoners. Coverage of the case in the local press continued nearly unabated throughout the investigation, trial, and subsequent appeal process.

Newspaper reports throughout the period combined real evidence, unsubstantiated rumors, and journalistic speculation. Dinnerstein wrote, &quot;Characterized by innuendo, misrepresentation, and distortion, the yellow journalism account of Mary Phagan&#x27;s death aroused an anxious city, and within a few days, a shocked state.&quot; Different segments of the population focused on different aspects. Atlanta&#x27;s working class saw Frank as &quot;a defiler of young girls&quot;, while the German-Jewish community saw him as &quot;an exemplary man and loyal husband.&quot; Albert Lindemann, author of &quot;The Jew Accused&quot;, opined that &quot;ordinary people&quot; may have had difficulty evaluating the often unreliable information and in &quot;suspend[ing] judgment over a long period of time&quot; while the case developed. As the press shaped public opinion, much of the public&#x27;s attention was directed at the police and the prosecution, whom they expected to bring Phagan&#x27;s killer to justice. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, had recently lost two high-profile murder cases; one state newspaper wrote that &quot;another defeat, and in a case where the feeling was so intense, would have been, in all likelihood, the end of Mr. Dorsey, as solicitor.&quot;

==Trial==
On May 23, 1913, a grand jury convened to hear evidence for an indictment against Frank for the murder of Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank&#x27;s legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey&#x27;s advice, they decided not to indict Conley.

On July 28, the trial began at the Fulton County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been serving as a judge in Georgia since 1900. The prosecution team was led by Dorsey and included William Smith (Conley&#x27;s attorney and Dorsey&#x27;s jury consultant). Frank was represented by a team of eight lawyersincluding jury selection specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows. The defense, in their legal appeals, would later cite the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses and jury.

Both legal teams, in planning their trial strategy, considered the implications of trying a white man based on the testimony of a black man in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of &quot;Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South&quot;, writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as &quot;a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous.&quot; Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as &quot;a familiar type&quot; of &quot;old negro&quot;, like a minstrel or plantation worker. Dorsey&#x27;s strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley&#x27;s statement explaining the immediate aftermath of the murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.

To support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory&#x27;s second floor in the machine room near Frank&#x27;s office, the prosecution presented witnesses who testified to bloodstains and strands of hair found on the lathe. The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested the place of the murder. Material found around Phagan&#x27;s neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley&#x27;s storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank&#x27;s account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.

The defense, to support their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan&#x27;s missing purse. Conley claimed in court that he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, although he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open and there was no purse in it. The significance of Phagan&#x27;s torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.

===Frank&#x27;s alleged sexual behavior===
The prosecution focused on Frank&#x27;s alleged sexual behavior. They alleged that Frank, with Conley&#x27;s assistance, regularly met with women in his office for sexual relations. On the day of the murder, Conley said he saw Phagan go upstairs, from where he heard a scream coming shortly after. He then said he dozed off; when he woke up, Frank called him upstairs and showed him Phagan&#x27;s body, admitting that he had hurt her. Conley repeated statements from his affidavits that he and Frank took Phagan&#x27;s body to the basement via the elevator, before returning in the elevator to the office where Frank dictated the murder notes.

Conley was cross-examined by the defense for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley&#x27;s entire testimony concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank&#x27;s alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan&#x27;s parents of her death. Ferguson testified that she had tried to get Phagan&#x27;s pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.

The defense called a number of factory girls, who testified that they had never seen Frank flirting with or touching the girls and that they considered him to be of good character. In the prosecution&#x27;s rebuttal, Dorsey called &quot;a steady parade of former factory workers&quot; to ask them the question, &quot;Do you know Mr. Frank&#x27;s character for lasciviousness?&quot; The answers were usually &quot;bad&quot;.

===Timeline===
The prosecution realized early on that issues relating to time would be an essential part of its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15 p.m.

A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution&#x27;s theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan in the metal room. Stover&#x27;s account did not match Frank&#x27;s initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.

Lemmie Quinn, foreman of the metal room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank in his office at 12:20. Frank had not mentioned Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner&#x27;s inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office, and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left. According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense&#x27;s calculations, Frank&#x27;s time was fully accounted for from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn&#x27;s testimony as &quot;a fraud&quot; and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.

Newt Lee, the night watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was normally calm, came bustling out of his office. Frank told Lee that he had not yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out and have a good time in town before coming back.

When Lee returned at 6:00, James Gantt had also arrived. Lee told police that Gantt, a former employee who had been fired by Frank after $2 was found missing from the cash box, wanted to look for two pairs of shoes he had left at the factory. Frank allowed Gantt in, although Lee said that Frank appeared to be upset by Gantt&#x27;s appearance. Frank arrived home at 6:25; at 7:00, he called Lee to determine if everything had gone all right with Gantt.

===Conviction and sentencing===
During the trial, the prosecution alleged bribery and witness tampering attempts by the Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people inside and outside the courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.

The &quot;Constitution&quot; described the scene as Dorsey emerged from the steps of city hall: &quot;[T]hree muscular men swung Mr. Dorsey ... on their shoulders and passed him over the heads of the crowd across the street to his office. With hat raised and tears coursing down his cheeks, the victor in Georgia&#x27;s most noted criminal battle was tumbled over a shrieking throng that wildly proclaimed its admiration.&quot;

On August 26, the day after the guilty verdict was reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private chambers and sentenced Frank to death by hanging, with the date set to October 10. The defense team issued a public protest, alleging that public opinion unconsciously influenced the jury to the prejudice of Frank. This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.

==Appeals==

Under Georgia law at the time, appeals of death penalty cases had to be based on errors of law, not a re-evaluation of the evidence presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley&#x27;s testimony concerning Frank&#x27;s alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, &quot;I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I do not have to be convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that.&quot;

===State appeals===
The next step, a hearing before the Georgia Supreme Court, was held on December 15. In addition to presenting the existing written record, each side was granted two hours for oral arguments. In addition to the old arguments, the defense focused on the reservations expressed by Judge Roan at the reconsideration hearing, citing six cases where new trials had been granted after the trial judge expressed misgivings about the jury verdict. The prosecution countered with arguments that the evidence convicting Frank was substantial and that listing Judge Roan&#x27;s doubts in the defense&#x27;s bill of exceptions was not the proper vehicle for &quot;carry[ing] the views of the judge.&quot; On February 17, 1914, in a 142-page decision, the court denied Frank a new trial by a 4–2 vote. The majority dismissed the allegations of bias by the jurors, saying the power of determining this rested strictly with the trial judge except when an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; was proved. It also ruled that spectator influence could only be the basis of a new trial if ruled so by the trial judge. Conley&#x27;s testimony on Frank&#x27;s alleged sexual conduct was found to be admissible because, even though it suggested Frank had committed other crimes for which he was not charged, it made Conley&#x27;s statements more credible and helped to explain Frank&#x27;s motivation for committing the crime according to the majority. On Judge Roan&#x27;s stated reservations, the court ruled that these did not trump his legal decision to deny a motion for a new trial. The dissenting justices restricted their opinion to Conley&#x27;s testimony, which they declared should not have been allowed to stand: &quot;It is perfectly clear to us that evidence of prior bad acts of lasciviousness committed by the defendant ... did not tend to prove a preexisting design, system, plan, or scheme, directed toward making an assault upon the deceased or killing her to prevent its disclosure.&quot; They concluded that the evidence prejudiced Frank in the jurors&#x27; eyes and denied him a fair trial.

The last hearing exhausted Frank&#x27;s ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank&#x27;s execution was set for April 17 of that year. The defense continued to investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of the hair on the lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan&#x27;s. At the same time that the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter&#x27;s testimony, implicated Conley as the actual murderer.

The defense also raised a federal constitutional issue on whether Frank&#x27;s absence from the court when the verdict was announced &quot;constituted deprivation of the due process of law&quot;. Different attorneys were brought in to argue this point since Rosser and Arnold had acquiesced in Frank&#x27;s absence. There was a debate between Rosser and Arnold on whether it should be raised at this time since its significance might be lost with all of the other evidence being presented. Louis Marshall, a constitutional lawyer and president of the American Jewish Committee, urged them to raise the point, and the decision was made that it should be made clear that if the extraordinary motion was rejected they intended to appeal through the federal court system and there would be an impression of injustice in the trial. For almost every issue presented by the defense, the state had a response: most of the repudiations were either retracted or disavowed by the witnesses; the question of whether outdated order pads used to write the murder notes had been in the basement before the murder was disputed; the integrity of the defense&#x27;s investigators were questioned and intimidation and bribery were charged; and the significance of Conley&#x27;s letters to Annie Carter was disputed. The defense, in its rebuttal, tried to bolster the testimony relating to the murder notes and the Carter letters. (These issues were reexamined later when the governor considered commuting Frank&#x27;s sentence.) During the defense&#x27;s closing argument, the issue of the repudiations was put to rest by Judge Hill&#x27;s ruling that the court could only consider the revocation of testimony if the subject were tried and found guilty of perjury. The judge denied Frank a new trial and the full court upheld the decision on November 14, 1914. The full court also said that the due process issue should have been raised earlier, characterizing what it considered a belated effort as &quot;trifling with the court&quot;.

===Federal appeals===
The next step for the Frank team was to appeal the issue through the federal system. The original request for a writ of error on the absence of Frank from the jury&#x27;s announcement of the verdict was first denied by Justice Joseph Rucker Lamar and then Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Both denied the request because they agreed with the Georgia court that the issue was raised too late. The full Supreme Court then heard arguments, but denied the motion without issuing a written decision. However, Holmes said, &quot;I very seriously doubt if the petitioner ... has had due process of law ... because of the trial taking place in the presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd, thought by the presiding Judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered.&quot; Holmes&#x27;s statement, as well as public indignation over this latest rejection by the courts, encouraged Frank&#x27;s team to attempt a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; motion, arguing that the threat of crowd violence had forced Frank to be absent from the verdict hearing and constituted a violation of due process. Justice Lamar heard the motion and agreed that the full Supreme Court should hear the appeal.

On April 19, 1915, the Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 7–2 vote in the case &quot;Frank v. Mangum&quot;. Part of the decision repeated the message of the last decision: that Frank failed &quot;to raise the objection in due season when fully cognizant of the fact.&quot; Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes dissented, with Holmes writing, &quot;It is our duty to declare lynch law as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn jury as when administered by one elected by a mob intent on death.&quot;

==Commutation of sentence==

===Hearing===
On April 22, 1915, an application for a commutation of Frank&#x27;s death sentence was submitted to a three-person Prison Commission in Georgia; it was rejected on June 9 by a vote of 2–1. The dissenter indicated that he felt it was wrong to execute a man &quot;on the testimony of an accomplice, when the circumstances of the crime tend to fix the guilt upon the accomplice.&quot; The application then passed to Governor John Slaton. Slaton had been elected in 1912 and his term would end four days after Frank&#x27;s scheduled execution. In 1913, before Phagan&#x27;s murder, Slaton agreed to merge his law firm with that of Luther Rosser, who became Frank&#x27;s lead attorney (Slaton was not directly involved in the original trial). After the commutation, popular Georgia politician Tom Watson attacked Slaton, often focusing on his partnership with Rosser as a conflict of interest.

Slaton opened hearings on June 12. In addition to receiving presentations from both sides with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake. Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, &quot;In all frankness, if Your Excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, the way to do it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts.&quot; According to Tom Watson&#x27;s biographer, C. Vann Woodward, &quot;While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his &#x27;friend&#x27;, which would result in his &#x27;becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.

Slaton produced a 29-page report. In the first part, he criticized outsiders who were unfamiliar with the evidence, especially the press in the North. He defended the trial court&#x27;s decision, which he felt was sufficient for a guilty verdict. He summarized points of the state&#x27;s case against Frank that &quot;any reasonable person&quot; would accept and said of Conley, &quot;It is hard to conceive that any man&#x27;s power of fabrication of minute details could reach that which Conley showed, unless it be the truth.&quot; After having made these points, Slaton&#x27;s narrative changed course and asked the rhetorical question, &quot;Did Conley speak the truth?&quot; Leonard Dinnerstein wrote, &quot;Slaton based his opinions primarily upon the inconsistencies he had discovered in the narrative of Jim Conley.&quot; Two factors stood out to Slaton: the transporting of the body to the basement and the murder notes.

====Transport of the body====
During the initial investigation, police had noted undisturbed human excrement in the elevator shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an indication that the elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.
During the commutation hearing, Slaton asked Dorsey to address this issue. Dorsey said that the elevator did not always go all the way to the bottom and could be stopped anywhere. Frank&#x27;s attorney rebutted this by quoting Conley, who said that the elevator stops when it hits the bottom. Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time the elevator made the trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, &quot;If the elevator was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted.&quot;

====Murder notes====
The murder notes had been analyzed before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous evidence at the commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written in the third person rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.

Conley&#x27;s former attorney, William Smith, had become convinced that his client had committed the murder. Smith produced a 100-page analysis of the notes for the defense. He analyzed &quot;speech and writing patterns&quot; and &quot;spelling, grammar, repetition of adjectives, [and] favorite verb forms&quot;. He concluded, &quot;In this article I show clearly that Conley did not tell the truth about those notes.&quot; Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley&#x27;s letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony. Throughout these documents, he found similar use of the words &quot;like&quot;, &quot;play&quot;, &quot;lay&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, and &quot;hisself&quot;. He also found double adjectives such as &quot;long tall negro&quot;, &quot;tall, slim build heavy man&quot;, and &quot;good long wide piece of cord in his hands&quot;.

Slaton was also convinced that the murder notes were written in the basement, not in Frank&#x27;s office. Slaton accepted the defense&#x27;s argument that the notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in the basement. Slaton wrote that the employee signed an affidavit stating that, when he left the company in 1912, &quot;he personally packed up all of the duplicate orders ... and sent them down to the basement to be burned. This evidence was never passed upon by the jury and developed since the trial.&quot;

===Timing and physical evidence===
Slaton&#x27;s narrative touched on other aspects of the evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt. For example, he accepted the defense&#x27;s argument that charges by Conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that Jews were circumcised. He accepted the defense&#x27;s interpretation of the timeline; citing the evidence produced at trialincluding the possibility that Stover did not see Frank because she did not proceed further than the outer officehe wrote: &quot;Therefore, Monteen Stover must have arrived before Mary Phagan, and while Monteen Stover was in the room it hardly seems possible under the evidence, that Mary Phagan was at that time being murdered.&quot; Slaton also said that Phagan&#x27;s head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan&#x27;s nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.

Slaton also commented on Conley&#x27;s story (that Conley was watching out for the arrival of a lady for Frank on the day of the murder):

===Conclusion===
On Monday, June 21, 1915, Slaton released the order to commute Frank&#x27;s murder conviction to life imprisonment. Slaton&#x27;s legal rationale was that there was sufficient new evidence not available at the original trial to justify Frank&#x27;s actions. He wrote:
 
The commutation was headline news. Atlanta Mayor Jimmy Woodward remarked that &quot;The larger part of the population believes Frank guilty and that the commutation was a mistake.&quot; In response, Slaton invited the press to his home that afternoon, telling them:

He also told reporters that he was certain that Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence.

===Reaction of the public===
The public was outraged. A mob threatened to attack the governor at his home. A detachment of the Georgia National Guard, along with county policemen and a group of Slaton&#x27;s friends who were sworn in as deputies, dispersed the mob. Slaton had been a popular governor, but he and his wife left Georgia immediately thereafter.

For Frank&#x27;s protection, he was taken to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary in the middle of the night before the commutation was announced. The penitentiary was &quot;strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms&quot; and separated from Marietta by of mostly unpaved road. However, on July 17, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he &quot;wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank&#x27;s presence was a disgrace to the prison, and he was sure he would be pardoned if he killed Frank.&quot;

==Antisemitism and media coverage==
The sensationalism in the press started before the trial and continued throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, but they were not entirely anti-Frank. The &quot;Constitution&quot; alone assumed Frank&#x27;s guilt, while both the &quot;Georgian&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot; would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the &quot;Journal&quot; called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would &quot;amount to judicial murder.&quot; Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan&#x27;s family, said that based on &quot;the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial.&quot;

On October 12, 1913, the &quot;New York Sun&quot; became the first major Northern paper to give a detailed account of the Frank trial. In discussing the charges of antisemitism in the trial, it described Atlanta as more liberal on the subject than any other Southern cities. It went on to say that antisemitism did arise during the trial as Atlantans reacted to statements attributed to Frank&#x27;s Jewish supporters, who dismissed Phagan as &quot;nothing but a factory girl&quot;. The paper said, &quot;The anti-Semitic feeling was the natural result of the belief that the Jews had banded to free Frank, innocent or guilty. The supposed solidarity of the Jews for Frank, even if he was guilty, caused a Gentile solidarity against him.&quot; On November 8, 1913, the executive committee of the American Jewish Committee, headed by Louis Marshall, addressed the Frank case. They did so following Judge Roan&#x27;s reconsideration motion and motivated by the issues raised in the &quot;Sun&quot;. They chose not to take a public stance as a committee, instead deciding to raise funds individually to influence public opinion in favor of Frank.

Albert Lasker, a wealthy advertising magnate, responded to these calls to help Frank. Lasker contributed personal funds and arranged a public relations effort in support of Frank. In Atlanta, during the time of the extraordinary motion, Lasker coordinated Frank&#x27;s meetings with the press and coined the slogan &quot;The Truth Is on the March&quot; to characterize the efforts of Frank&#x27;s defense team. He persuaded prominent figures such as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Jane Addams to make statements supporting Frank. During the commutation hearing, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall weighed in, as did many leading magazine and newspaper editors, including Herbert Croly, editor of the &quot;New Republic&quot;; C.P.J. Mooney, editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;; Mark Sullivan, editor of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;; R. E. Stafford, editor of the &quot;Daily Oklahoman&quot;; and D. D. Moore, editor of the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot;. Adolph Ochs, publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, became involved about the same time as Lasker, organizing a prolonged campaign advocating for a new trial for Frank. Lindemann argues that the publicity campaign had a wide national reach:Outside of Georgia, as the case gained national visibility, widespread sympathy for Frank was expressed. He received at final count close to a hundred thousand letters of sympathy in jail, and prominent figures throughout the country, including governors of other states, U.S. senators, clergymen, university presidents, and labor leaders, spoke up in his defense. Thousands of petitions in his favor, containing over a million signatures, flowed in. 

Both Ochs and Lasker attempted to heed Louis Marshall&#x27;s warnings about antagonizing the &quot;sensitiveness of the southern people and engender the feeling that the north is criticizing the courts and the people of Georgia.&quot; Dinnerstein writes that these attempts failed, &quot;because many Georgians interpreted every item favorable to Frank as a hostile act.&quot;

Tom Watson, editor of the &quot;Jeffersonian&quot;, had remained publicly silent during Frank&#x27;s trial. Among Watson&#x27;s political enemies was Senator Hoke Smith, former owner of &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, which was still considered to be Smith&#x27;s political instrument. When the &quot;Journal&quot; called for a reevaluation of the evidence against Frank, Watson, in the March 19, 1914, edition of his magazine, attacked Smith for trying &quot;to bring the courts into disrepute, drag down the judges to the level of criminals, and destroy the confidence of the people in the orderly process of the law.&quot; Watson also questioned whether Frank expected &quot;extraordinary favors and immunities because of his race&quot; and questioned the wisdom of Jews to &quot;risk the good name ... of the whole race&quot; to save &quot;the decadent offshoot of a great people.&quot; Subsequent articles concentrated on the Frank case and became more and more impassioned in their attacks. C. Vann Woodward writes that Watson &quot;pulled all the stops: Southern chivalry, sectional animus, race prejudice, class consciousness, agrarian resentment, state pride.&quot;

When describing the public reaction to Frank, historians mention the class and ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging the complexity of the case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that &quot;economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law. ... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth.&quot; Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said &quot;[could] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker.&quot; Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself &quot;in a position of much latent tension and symbolism.&quot; Stating that it is impossible to determine the extent to which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that &quot;[Frank was seen as] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, &#x27;at his mercy&#x27;a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women.&quot;

==Abduction and lynching==
The June 21, 1915, commutation provoked Tom Watson into advocating Frank&#x27;s lynching. He wrote in &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot; and &quot;Watson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;: &quot;This country has nothing to fear from its rural communities. Lynch law is a good sign; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people.&quot; A group of prominent men organized themselves into the &quot;Vigilance Committee&quot; and openly planned to kidnap Frank from prison. They consisted of 28 men with various skills: an electrician was to cut the prison wires, car mechanics were to keep the cars running, and there was a locksmith, a telephone man, a medic, a hangman, and a . The ringleaders were well known locally, but were not named publicly until June 2000, when a local librarian posted a list on the Web based on information compiled by Phagan&#x27;s great-niece, Mary Phagan Kean (b. 1953). The list included Joseph Mackey Brown, former governor of Georgia; Eugene Herbert Clay, former mayor of Marietta and later president of the Georgia Senate; E. P. Dobbs, mayor of Marietta at the time; Moultrie McKinney Sessions, lawyer and banker; part of the Marietta delegation at Governor Slaton&#x27;s clemency hearing; several current and former Cobb County sheriffs; and other individuals of various professions.

On the afternoon of August 16, the eight cars of the lynch mob left Marietta separately for Milledgeville. They arrived at the prison at around 10:00 p.m. The electrician cut the telephone wires, and members of the group drained the gas from the prison&#x27;s automobiles, handcuffed the warden, seized Frank, and drove away. The trip took about seven hours at a top speed of through small towns on back roads. Lookouts in the towns telephoned ahead to the next town as soon as they saw the line of cars pass by. A site at Frey&#x27;s Gin, two miles (3 km) east of Marietta, had been prepared, complete with a rope and table supplied by former Sheriff William Frey. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Frank was handcuffed, his legs tied at the ankles, and that he was hanged from a branch of a tree at around 7:00 a.m., facing the direction of the house where Phagan had lived.

&quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; wrote that a crowd of men, women, and children arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;wanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, and asked for a vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank&#x27;s face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.

In Atlanta, thousands besieged the undertaker&#x27;s parlor, demanding to see the body; after the mob began breaking glass panes, they were allowed to file past the corpse. Around 15,000 people were estimated to have looked upon Frank&#x27;s body. Policemen guarded Frank&#x27;s casket for fear of further violence. Frank&#x27;s body was then transported by rail on Southern Railway&#x27;s train No. 36 from Atlanta to New York and buried in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, New York on August 20, 1915. (When Lucille Frank died, she was not buried with Leo; she was cremated, and eventually buried next to her parents&#x27; graves.)

==After the trial and lynching==
===Immediate reactions===
On August 19, 1915, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the vast majority of Cobb County believed Frank had received his &quot;just deserts&quot;, and that the lynch mob had simply stepped in to uphold the law after Governor Slaton arbitrarily set it aside. A Cobb County grand jury was convened to indict the lynchers; although they were well known locally, none were identified, and some of the lynchers may have served on the very same grand jury that was investigating them. Nat Harris, the newly elected governor who succeeded Slaton, promised to punish the mob, issuing a $1,500 state reward for information. Despite this, Charles Willis Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the citizens of Marietta &quot;would die rather than reveal their knowledge or even their suspicion [of the identities of the lynchers]&quot;, and the local &quot;Macon Telegraph&quot; said, &quot;Doubtless they can be apprehendeddoubtful they will.&quot;

Several photographs were taken of the lynching, which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each; also sold were pieces of the rope, Frank&#x27;s nightshirt, and branches from the tree. According to Elaine Marie Alphin, author of &quot;An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank&quot;, they were selling so fast that the police announced that sellers would require a city license. In the postcards, members of the lynch mob or crowd can be seen posing in front of the body, one of them holding a portable camera. Historian Amy Louise Wood writes that local newspapers did not publish the photographs because it would have been too controversial, given that the lynch mob can be clearly seen and that the lynching was being condemned around the country. The &quot;Columbia State&quot; newspaper, which opposed the lynching, sarcastically wrote: &quot;The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers.&quot; Wood also writes that a news film of the lynching that included the photographs was released, although it focused on the crowds without showing Frank&#x27;s body; its showing was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S., though Wood says there is no evidence that it was stopped in Atlanta.

The lynching of Frank and its publicity temporarily halted lynchings.

Frank&#x27;s case was mentioned by Adolf Kraus when he announced the creation of the Anti-Defamation League in October 1913. After Frank&#x27;s lynching, around half of Georgia&#x27;s 3,000 Jews left the state. According to author Steve Oney, &quot;What it did to Southern Jews can&#x27;t be discounted ... It drove them into a state of denial about their Judaism. They became even more assimilated, anti-Israel, Episcopalian. The Temple did away with chupahs at weddingsanything that would draw attention.&quot; Many American Jews saw Frank as an American Alfred Dreyfus, like Frank, a victim of antisemitic persecution.

Two weeks after the lynching, in the September 2, 1915, issue of &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot;, Watson wrote, &quot;the voice of the people is the voice of God&quot;, capitalizing on his sensational coverage of the controversial trial. In 1914, when Watson began reporting his anti-Frank message, &quot;The Jeffersonian&#x27;s&quot; circulation had been 25,000; by September 2, 1915, its circulation was 87,000.

The lynching of Leo Frank and its backlash may have contributed to the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, a group notorious for racial violence against Jewish people in particular. Its 1915 revival came just one month after the lynching, and hot off the heels of the release of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, a film glorifying the first Ku Klux Klan.

===Later consensus: a miscarriage of justice===
The consensus of researchers on the subject is that Frank was wrongly convicted. &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; stated it was investigating the case again in the 1940s. A reporter who visited Frank&#x27;s widow (she never remarried), Lucille, stated that she started crying when he discussed the case with her.

Jeffrey Melnick wrote, &quot;There is near unanimity around the idea that Frank was most certainly innocent of the crime of murdering Mary Phagan.&quot; Other historians and journalists have written that the trial was &quot;a gross injustice&quot;, &quot;a miscarriage of justice&quot;, and &quot;a mockery of justice&quot;; that &quot;there can be no doubt, of course, that ... [Frank was] innocent&quot;; that &quot;Leo Frank ... was unjustly and wrongly convicted of murder&quot;; that he &quot;was falsely convicted&quot;; and that &quot;the evidence against Frank was shaky, to say the least&quot;. C. Vann Woodward, like many other authors, believed that Conley was the actual murderer and was &quot;implicated by evidence overwhelmingly more incriminating than any produced against Frank.&quot;

Critics cite a number of problems with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley&#x27;s attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.

In modern times, despite strong evidence pointing to Frank&#x27;s innocence, the case has become a modern focal point for neo-Nazis and anti-Semites. This is partly because it led to the creation of the Anti-Defamation League but also because it fed into anti-semitic conspiracy theories claiming Jewish control of the media. As a consequence, in recent years a number of websites have been established by white supremacists disputing the prevailing consensus of Frank&#x27;s innocence. On the centenary of the trial, the Anti-Defamation League issued a press release condemning what it called &quot;misleading websites&quot; from &quot;anti-Semites ... to promote anti-Jewish views&quot;.

===Applications for posthumous pardon===
In 1982, Alonzo Mann, who had been Frank&#x27;s office boy at the time of Phagan&#x27;s murder, told &quot;The Tennessean&quot; that he had seen Jim Conley alone shortly after noon carrying Phagan&#x27;s body through the lobby toward the ladder descending into the basement. Though Mann&#x27;s testimony was not sufficient to settle the issue, it was the basis of an attempt by Charles Wittenstein, Southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, and Dale Schwartz, an Atlanta lawyer, to obtain a posthumous pardon for Frank from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The board also reviewed the files from Slaton&#x27;s commutation decision. It denied the pardon in 1983, hindered in its investigation by the lack of available records. It concluded that, &quot;After exhaustive review and many hours of deliberation, it is impossible to decide conclusively the guilt or innocence of Leo M. Frank. For the board to grant a pardon, the innocence of the subject must be shown conclusively.&quot; At the time, the lead editorial in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; began, &quot;Leo Frank has been lynched a second time.&quot;

Frank supporters submitted a second application for pardon, asking the state only to recognize its culpability over his death. The board granted the pardon in 1986. It said:

In response to the pardon, an editorial by Fred Grimm in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; said, &quot;A salve for one of the South&#x27;s most hateful, festering memories, was finally applied.&quot;

===Historical marker===
In 2008, a state historical marker was erected by the Georgia Historical Society, the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, and Temple Kol Emeth, near the building at 1200 Roswell Road, Marietta where Frank was lynched. In 2015, the Georgia Historical Society, the Atlanta History Center, and the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation dedicated a Georgia Historical Society marker honoring Governor John M. Slaton at the Atlanta History Center.

===Anti-lynching memorial===

In 2018, The Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, with support from the ADL, and Rabbi Steve Lebow of Temple Kol Emeth, placed the first national anti-lynching memorial at the Georgia Department of Transportation designated Leo Frank memorial site. The anti-lynching memorial was facilitated by a strong letter of support to the Georgia Department of Transportation by Congressman John Lewis when the Department turned down siting permission. The text of the anti-lynching memorial text reads, &quot;In Respectful Memory of the Thousands Across America, Denied Justice by Lynching; Victims of Hatred, Prejudice and Ignorance. Between 1880-1946, ~570 Georgians Were Lynched.&quot;

===Conviction Integrity Unit===
In 2019, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard founded an eight-member panel called the Conviction Integrity Unit to investigate the cases of Wayne Williams and Frank. The board will re-examine the cases and make recommendations to Howard on whether they should be re-adjudicated.

==In popular culture==
During the trial, Atlanta musician and millworker Fiddlin&#x27; John Carson wrote and performed a murder ballad entitled &quot;Little Mary Phagan&quot;. During the mill strikes of 1914, Carson sang &quot;Little Mary Phagan&quot; to crowds from the Fulton County courthouse steps. His daughter, Moonshine Kate, later recorded the song. An unrecorded Carson song, &quot;Dear Old Oak in Georgia&quot;, sentimentalizes the tree from which Leo Frank was hanged.

The Frank case has been the subject of several media adaptations. In 1921, African-American director Oscar Micheaux directed a silent race film entitled &quot;The Gunsaulus Mystery&quot;, followed by &quot;Murder in Harlem&quot; in 1935. In 1937, Mervyn LeRoy directed &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot;, based on the Ward Greene novel &quot;Death in The Deep South&quot;, which was in turn inspired by the Frank case. 

An episode of the 1964 TV series &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; dramatized Governor John M. Slaton&#x27;s decision to commute Frank&#x27;s sentence. The episode starred Walter Matthau as Governor Slaton and Michael Constantine as Tom Watson. The 1988 TV miniseries &quot;The Murder of Mary Phagan&quot; was broadcast on NBC, starring Jack Lemmon as Gov. John Slaton, and featured Kevin Spacey. 

The 1998 Broadway musical &quot;Parade&quot;, based on the case, won two Tony Awards. 

In 2009, Ben Loeterman directed the documentary film &quot;The People v. Leo Frank&quot;. 

A 2023 Broadway revival of &quot;Parade&quot; won Tony Awards for Best Revival of a Musical and Best Direction of a Musical.

<text>Good cop, bad cop, also informally called the Mutt and Jeff technique, is a psychological tactic used in interrogation and negotiation, in which a team of two people take opposing approaches to the subject. One interrogator adopts a hostile or accusatory demeanor, emphasizing threats of punishment, while the other adopts a more sympathetic demeanor, emphasizing reward, in order to convince the subject to cooperate. It is an instance of the Reid technique.

==Technique==
The &quot;bad cop&quot; takes an aggressive, negative stance towards the subject, making blatant accusations, derogatory comments, threats, and in general creating antipathy with the subject. This sets the stage for the &quot;good cop&quot; to act sympathetically, appearing supportive and understanding, and in general showing sympathy (or even empathy) for the subject. The good cop defends the subject from the bad cop. The subject may feel able to cooperate with the good cop, either out of trust or out of fear of the bad cop and may then seek protection by the good cop and provide the information the interrogators are seeking. 

When this technique is used as a negotiation tactic outside of the interrogation context, the good cop attempts to convince the counterpart to cut a deal by implying that the bad cop will return if no agreement is reached. The order can also be reversed. In this scenario, the good cop does most of the talking, while the bad cop intervenes only to apply pressure to elicit compliance from the subject.

The disadvantage of this technique is that it can be easily identified, and the &quot;bad cop&quot; may alienate the subject.

<text>Mohammad Hashem Cheshti, also known with surname Chishti and as Ustad Hashem (), was a contemporary classical musician and composer born in Kharabat area of Kabul, Afghanistan, who died in 1994 in Germany under unclear circumstances.
Ustad Hashem was born and raised in a musical family, which originally came from Kasur in Punjab, but settled in the 19th century in Kabul as court musicians. Several of his close family members, including his brothers and his father are/were also famous musicians in their own right. Both he and his brothers appeared regularly on Afghan Television and Radio prior to the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent wars. He accompanied regularly other famous Afghan musicians like Ahmad Zahir and Ustad Mahwash on his tabla.

He was the teacher and mentor of Ustad Mahwash, the first Afghan female master musician and Zuleikha, a US American dancer and artist.

<text>Anyphaenidae is a family of araneomorph spiders, sometimes called anyphaenid sac spiders or ghost spiders. They are distinguished from the sac spiders of the family Clubionidae and other spiders by having the abdominal spiracle placed one third to one half of the way anterior to the spinnerets toward the epigastric furrow on the underside of the abdomen. In most spiders the spiracle is just anterior to the spinnerets.

Like clubionids, anyphaenids have conical anterior spinnerets and are wandering predators that build silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark or under rocks. There are more than 600 species in over 50 genera worldwide.

The family is widespread and includes such common genera as &quot;Anyphaena&quot; (worldwide except tropical Africa and Asia) and &quot;Hibana&quot; (New World). Only one species (&quot;A. accentuata&quot;) occurs in northwestern Europe.

Species in the latter genus are important predators in several agricultural systems, especially tree crops. They are able to detect and feed on insect eggs, despite their poor eyesight. They share this ability at least with some miturgid spiders.

<doc id="401950" wikidata="Q1335573" url="?curid=401950" title="Emerson College">
<text>Emerson College is a private college in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It also maintains campuses in Los Angeles and Well, Limburg, Netherlands (Kasteel Well). Founded in 1880 by Charles Wesley Emerson as a &quot;school of oratory,&quot; the college offers more than three dozen degree and professional training programs specializing in the fields of arts and communication with a foundation in liberal arts studies. The college is one of the founding members of the ProArts Consortium, an association of six neighboring institutions in Boston dedicated to arts education at the collegiate level. Emerson is also notable for the college&#x27;s namesake public opinion poll, Emerson College Polling.

Originally based in Boston&#x27;s Pemberton Square, the college moved neighborhoods several times, and is now located in the Theater District along the south side of the Boston Common. Emerson owns and operates the historic Colonial, Paramount, and Cutler Majestic theaters, as well as several smaller performance venues.

==History==

===Origins===
Charles Wesley Emerson founded the Boston Conservatory of Elocution, Oratory, and Dramatic Art in 1880, a year after Boston University closed its School of Oratory. Classes were held at Pemberton Square in Boston, where ten students enrolled in the conservatory&#x27;s first class. The following year, the institution changed its name to the Monroe Conservatory of Oratory, in honor of Charles Emerson&#x27;s teacher at Boston University&#x27;s School of Oratory, Professor Lewis B. Monroe. In 1890, the name changed again to Emerson College of Oratory and was later shortened to Emerson College in 1939.

===Early expansion and growth===
The college expanded and rented space at 36 Bromfield Street, and moved to Odd Fellows Hall on Berkeley and Tremont Streets in the South End of Boston. With the new location, the college&#x27;s first library was established in 1892. Henry Lawrence Southwick, a faculty member and alumnus, became a financial partner for the college with Emerson. This financial partnership led to the acquisition of the Boston School of Oratory from Moses T. Brown in 1894.

At the turn of the century, faculty members Henry and Jessie Eldridge Southwick and William H. Kenney purchased the college from Dr. Emerson. Soon after, the college rented a new location in Chickering Hall.

Dr. Emerson retired in 1903 and William J. Rolfe, a Shakespearean scholar and actor, was named the second President of Emerson College of Oratory. His service as president lasted until his retirement in 1908.

As the Student Government Association of the college held its first meeting in 1908, the third president of the college, Henry Lawrence Southwick, was inaugurated. He introduced the study of acting and stagecraft into the college curriculum. During his tenure, the college rented a new building at 30 Huntington Avenue in Copley Square. The college was also granted the right to award Bachelor of Literary Interpretation (B.L.I.) degrees. In addition, Emerson became the first school with a collegiate-level program in children&#x27;s theater in 1919. The school offered its first course in Journalism in 1924.

The college purchased its first piece of real estate with a new women&#x27;s dormitory building at 373 Commonwealth Avenue in the Back Bay, and started intramural sports in 1931 with the organization of volleyball games.

===Administrative restructuring===
In 1930, full charge and control of the college was transferred to the Board of Trustees by William H. Kenney, Henry Lawrence Southwick, and Jessie Eldridge Southwick.

When Harry Seymour Ross was appointed the fourth president of Emerson College in 1931, the first course in Radio Broadcasting was taught by the program director of WEEI, a Boston AM radio station. The purchase of buildings at 130 Beacon Street and 128 Beacon Street a year later began the presence of Emerson College in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay. Emerson kept ownership of these buildings until summer 2003.

In the following years, a professional training program in Speech Pathology (1935) and the first undergraduate program in Broadcast Journalism (1937) were offered for the first time in the United States. Construction of a theater behind 128–130 Beacon began, and the institution was granted the right to award Master of Arts degrees.

===Post-war era===
In the post-war era, the G.I. Bill of Rights and the Broadcasting curriculum contributed to the rebalancing of the student body from a primarily-female population to an equally-balanced population of men and women. Boylston Green, the first president to have no prior association with the college, used his background as a dean of students to enhance extracurricular activities, including the establishment of a student activities fee. These efforts led to the first publication of Emerson&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Berkeley Beacon&quot;, in 1947, which is still in production today.

Emerson also saw major development in its broadcasting program. A one-year Certificate of Broadcasting was offered via evening classes. The FCC awarded the college a 10-watt license in 1949, and WERS, the first educational FM radio station in New England, was born. The station&#x27;s power was increased to 300 watts three years later, and 18,000 watts by 1953.

At the start of the decade, in 1950, Emerson College became a member of the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, an accreditation association for schools and colleges in New England.

President Green left the college in 1949 after being selected as president of the University of the South, and Godfrey Dewey served as Acting President until 1951. At that time, Jonathon French was appointed as Acting President, and he became president in December of that year, despite never being formally inaugurated.

===Financial crisis of 1952 and recovery===
The college suffered from a severe financial crisis in 1952, and sought $50,000 in emergency funding. At the time, the Chairman of the Corporation stated that without these funds, the college had three alternatives: go broke, sell out, or merge with another institution. Led by the National Alumni Council, a grassroots campaign was launched to improve the financial situation of the college. The efforts led to the resignation of the Council of Trustees, which was then replaced mostly by alumni. The new board elected a former Emerson history professor, S. Justus McKinley, as the fifth President of Emerson College.

Pulling out of its financial crisis, the college started to develop its programs with new facilities. In 1953, Emerson opened The Robbins Speech, Language and Hearing Clinic at 145 Beacon Street, furthering the Communication Sciences and Disorders Program. A television studio was dedicated at 130 Beacon in 1954, with its first closed-circuit TV program the following year as WERS-TV. The first annual spring musical, &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; by Moss Hart, was presented. Later, the school was authorized to grant honorary degrees, Bachelors and Masters of Science in speech, and a Bachelors of Music in conjunction with the Longy School of Music.

===Back Bay as Emerson&#x27;s campus===
As the 1960s started, 373 Commonwealth Avenue was sold to purchase a dormitory at 100 Beacon Street for 609 undergraduate and 29 graduate students. A year later, a building at 150 Beacon Street was obtained for dorms, a dining hall, and administrative offices. With major gifts from Elisabeth Abbot Smith and J.F. Buzzard, the college library moved from the fourth floor of 130 Beacon Street into its own building at 303 Berkeley Street. In 1964, two buildings were purchased: 96 Beacon Street, which became the student union building, and 132–134 Beacon Street, which became a dormitory. The campus remained primarily in Back Bay until the late 1990s.

In 1967, Richard Chapin, former Dean of the Harvard Business School was inaugurated as the seventh president of Emerson College.

Shortly afterwards, an academic planning committee approved a new course of study for general education requirements. The first level of this program replaced the college-wide requirements with a two-year interdisciplinary course of study and electives. In order to accommodate this new program, the building at 67–69 Brimmer Street was purchased. The Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies was born. A year later in 1972, the college gained authorization} to grant BFA and MFA degrees.

===Attempted relocation===
Though Emerson College has moved to various locations within the city of Boston, the appointment of Allen E. Koenig (the ninth President of Emerson College) almost took the college completely outside of Boston. As soon as he was inaugurated in 1979, Koenig initiated talks with Pine Manor College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to relocate Emerson and merge the two schools. However, an agreement was never reached and the plan was dropped entirely.

At the start of the 1980s, Koenig made a proposal to the board of trustees for a major renovation of the college&#x27;s facilities. The plan allowed for new performance spaces, classrooms, and faculty offices at Brimmer Street; remodeling the Library and Learning Resources Center at 150 Beacon; remodeling the 303 Berkeley building for the Humanities and Social Sciences Division; a new radio/audio complex at 126 Beacon; and construction of two new television studios behind 130 Beacon. In 1984, 335 Commonwealth Avenue was purchased for Administration and the Communication Studies department. The college also received the authorization to grant MFA degrees in Creative Writing.

Despite the newly purchased Commonwealth Avenue buildings, Lawrence, Massachusetts, was soon being discussed as a new location for Emerson College, about away from Boston. The Mayor of Lawrence announced that the necessary land would be taken by eminent domain and sold to Emerson for a token payment of $100. However, the five affected private landowners disagreed with this arrangement and fought the city in court. Three years later in 1988, Judge John Forte ruled in favor of the City of Lawrence. The river-front site in Lawrence was proposed as the new campus for the college. However, as real estate values in Boston dropped and the costs of constructing a new campus increased, the plans were put on hold and eventually abandoned when Koenig resigned as president in 1989. In 1988, the college bought a building at Zero Marlborough Street (also known as 6 Arlington Street) for dormitories and a dining hall.

===Rebirth in the Historic Theater District===
John Zacharis became the tenth President of Emerson College and faced a college fractured by the failed move to Lawrence, Massachusetts. Over the course of two years, he worked to restore unity to the campus by purchasing a building at 180 Tremont Street, now called the Ansin Building. This purchase started a transition from Back Bay to the Boston Theater District. Zacharis went on medical leave in 1992 and died of leukemia shortly after.

During Zacharis&#x27;s leave, speech pathologist Jacqueline Weis Liebergott was appointed as Acting President and, a year later, inaugurated to become the first female president of the college. Shortly after, she submitted a 10-year master plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority which involved moving the college to the Washington Street Theatre District.

In the mid-1990s, a planning document of the college&#x27;s future plans was drafted and public hearings were held. The college also extended health care benefits to domestic partners of gay and lesbian faculty, administration and staff. Under the plan, dental coverage and tuition waivers were also available. That same year, the college debuted online with a $100,000 gift from Mrs. Mary E. Tufte. Financed by the contribution, The Tufte Lab was placed on the fourth floor of the Ansin Building and dedicated in Mrs. Tufte&#x27;s honor. The lab was the catalyst for a telecommunications/fiber optic network installation, which was completed in October 1995.

In addition, the college announced the purchase and restoration of The Little Building (1994) across the street from the Ansin Building and next to Emerson&#x27;s Majestic Theatre. Restoration was completed on the facades of the college&#x27;s buildings at 126, 128, 130, 132–134, 168 Beacon Street, and 21 Commonwealth Avenue.

In 1998, Emerson purchased the Walker Building (Boston) at 120 Boylston. The building currently hosts the school&#x27;s Department of Television, Radio, Film Production, the Institutional Advancement (Alumni and Development) department, and the Government and Community Relations department. It also contains the school&#x27;s library and many of its classrooms.

===Early 21st century (2000-2019)===
The Tufte Performance Production Center (PPC) at 10 Boylston Place opened in 2003. The 11-story steel-and-glass building houses the Department of Performing Arts and includes two theaters (The Semel Theatre and The Greene Theatre), two television studios, makeup and costume labs, faculty offices, and an exhibition area. Also that year, the Cutler Majestic Theatre finished renovations and re-opened as one of the main stages of Emerson Stage productions.

Circa 2001 Emerson adjuncts voted to establish a union and in 2004 ratified its first contract with the college. The Affiliated Faculty of Emerson College, American Association of University Professors (AFEC-AAUP) represents 240 adjunct faculty members at Emerson College as of 2022.

In 2004, it was announced that the buildings at 96, 100, and 132 Beacon had been sold and would be vacated by the Fall 2006 semester. Construction of a new 14-story residence hall at 150 Boylston Street began in March 2004, and was completed in September 2006. It is the first entirely-new residence hall in Emerson&#x27;s history. The facility includes residential suites, athletic facilities, offices and meeting rooms for student organizations, informal gathering places for off-campus students, spaces for small-group rehearsals and performances, and dining facilities.

The school purchased Boston&#x27;s historic Paramount Theatre on Washington Street in 2005, with plans to build a new complex at the site including a 565-seat main stage theater inside the existing Paramount Theater and a 125-seat black box theater in an adjacent new building. Plans also included a 200-seat film screening room, eight rehearsal studios ranging from , six smaller rehearsal spaces, a sound stage for film students, a new scene shop, and a dormitory.

In May 2006, the Campus Center in the Piano Row building was named the Max Mutchnick Campus Center after a major gift from the 1987 graduate and co-creator of the television sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. In the same year, the school exercised its purchase option on the Colonial Theatre, adjacent to the Little Building, and then converted the upper floors of the building to a 372-bed dormitory. With the addition of dorm space here and at the Paramount Theatre, the school hoped to accommodate up to 75% of its students in on-campus housing by 2010.

In September 2006, a long-running labor dispute between the administrators and faculty union was resolved. The administration limited the union&#x27;s role in promotion and tenure, and brought department chairs into administrative roles, where they were not covered by the union. In response, the college agreed not to dismantle the union.

In September 2007, students in Emerson Alliance for Gays, Lesbians, and Everyone (E.A.G.L.E.) as well as the Student Government Association (S.G.A.) received the gender neutral bathrooms they had pitched to the administration in the spring. In September 2016, every bathroom on Emerson&#x27;s campus was converted into a gender inclusive restroom.

On December 2, 2009, President Liebergott announced she would step down in June 2011. On September 8, 2010, the college announced she would be succeeded by M. Lee Pelton of Willamette University.

On March 18, 2010, the newly renovated Paramount Center officially opened, with Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino illuminating the Paramount&#x27;s original art deco marquee, which Emerson had restored. In addition to the 590-seat Paramount Theatre, the Paramount Center also houses an experimental black box theater, the Bright Family Screening Room, a sound stage, a scene/prop production shop, nine rehearsal studios, six practice rooms, four classrooms, 20 faculty offices, and a student commons area.

, two students are suing the college for mishandling their rape cases and failing to provide their Title IX rights.

In late 2019, Marlboro College announced that it would merge with Emerson at the end of the 2019–20 academic year. Under the agreement, finalized on July 23, 2020, Marlboro gave its endowment to Emerson, which created the Marlboro Institute of Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies. Marlboro students were guaranteed admission and tenure-track faculty were guaranteed teaching positions at Emerson. At that time, Marlboro had approximately 150 students.

===Post-COVID and onward (2020-)===

In December 2020, President Lee Pelton announced his planned departure from Emerson College in June 2021 to assume a new role as CEO and President of the Boston Foundation. Jay M. Bernhardt became the 13th president of Emerson College on June 1, 2023, after serving as dean of the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin. On the day of his investiture ceremony, a protest for Palestinian liberation led to the arrest of 13 individuals, 12 of which were Emerson students. Additionally, 11 of those arrested were people of color. On April 25, 2024, 118 Emerson students were arrested (and several injured) after Boston Police cleared an encampment that was part of the nationwide college protests against the Israel-Hamas War.

As a result of the controversies, and because students did not feel safe, the Student Government Association called for the resignation of President Bernhardt on April 26th, 2024. As of October 2024, he still acts as the president of Emerson College, even amidst continued criticism.

==Campus==
Emerson College&#x27;s permanent move from the Back Bay to its current location revitalized and preserved the distinct character and profiles of the surrounding neighborhoods, which comprise many significant historic landmarks and structures - the most notable being Boston Public Garden and Boston Common. Presently, the majority of the college&#x27;s acquired properties were reclaimed, renovated and/or restored without having to introduce new developments into the Downtown core. Abutting the southeast corner of the Boston Common, the 8-acre urban campus at the intersection of Boylston Street and Tremont Street is served by Boylston station on the MBTA Green Line and Chinatown station on the Orange Line. In addition, Emerson College extends its campus outside Massachusetts state, operating in a fourteenth-century castle in the Netherlands and a major academic center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood for its long-established Los Angeles program.

<text>Adabas, a contraction of &quot;adaptable database system&quot;, is a database package that was developed by Software AG to run on IBM mainframes. It was launched in 1971 as a non-relational database. As of 2019, Adabas is marketed for use on a wider range of platforms, including Linux, Unix, and Windows.

Adabas can store multiple data relationships in the same table.

==History==
Initially released by Software AG in 1971 on IBM mainframe systems using DOS/360, OS/MFT, or OS/MVT, Adabas is currently available on a range of enterprise systems, including BS2000, z/VSE, z/OS, Unix, Linux, and Microsoft Windows. Adabas is frequently used in conjunction with Software AG&#x27;s programming language Natural; many applications that use Adabas as a database on the back end are developed with Natural. In 2016, Software AG announced that Adabas and Natural would be supported through the year 2050 and beyond.

Adabas is one of the three major inverted list DBMS packages, the other two being Computer Corporation of America’s Model 204 and ADR’s Datacom/DB.

==4GL support==
Since the 1979 introduction of Natural the popularity of Adabas databases has grown. By 1990, SAS was supporting Adabas.

==Non-relational==
In a 2015 white paper, IBM said: &quot;applications that are written in a pre-relational database, such as Adabas, are no longer mainstream and do not follow accepted IT industry standards&quot;. However, an Adabas database can be designed in accordance with the relational model. While there are tools and services to facilitate converting Adabas to various relational databases, such migrations are usually costly.

===Hardware zIIP boost===
IBM&#x27;s zIIP (System z Integrated Information Processor) special purpose processors permit &quot;direct, real-time SQL access to Adabas&quot; (even though the data may still stored in a non-relational form).

==Adabas data model==
Adabas is an acronym for Adaptable Data Base System (originally written in all caps; today only the initial cap is used for the product name).

Adabas is an inverted list data base, with the following characteristics or terminology:
* Works with tables (referred to as files) and rows (referred to as records) as the major organizational units.
* Columns (referred to as fields) are components of rows.
* No embedded SQL engine. SQL access via the Adabas SQL Gateway was introduced through an acquired company, CONNX, in 2004. It provides ODBC, JDBC, and OLE DB access to Adabas and enables SQL access to Adabas using COBOL programs.
* Search facilities may use indexed fields, non-indexed fields, or both.
* Does not natively enforce referential integrity constraints, and parent–child relations must be maintained by application code.
* Supports two methods of denormalization: repeating groups in a record (&quot;periodic groups&quot;) and multiple value fields in a record (&quot;multi-value fields&quot;).

Adabas is typically used in applications that require high volumes of data processing or in high-transaction online analytical processing environments.

Adabas access is normally through Natural modules using one of several Natural statements including READ, FIND, and HISTOGRAM. These statements generate additional commands, under the covers, like open and close file. Adabas data can also be retrieved via direct calls.

=== Example of Natural program running against Adabas ===

FIND EMPLOYEE WITH NAME = &#x27;JONES&#x27; OR = &#x27;BAKER&#x27;
 AND CITY = &#x27;BOSTON&#x27; THRU &#x27;NEW YORK&#x27;
 AND CITY NE &#x27;CHAPEL HILL&#x27;
 SORTED BY NAME
 WHERE SALARY &lt; 28000
 DISPLAY NAME FIRST-NAME CITY SALARY
END-FIND 
END
In the above program, the search criteria specified in the codice_1 clause is processed by Adabas, whereas the additional filtering indicated by the codice_2 clause is performed by Natural.

Output of program:

NAME FIRST-NAME CITY SALARY 
BAKER PAULINE DERBY 4450
JONES MARTHA KALAMAZOO 21000
JONES KEVIN DERBY 7000
==Natural (4GL)==
Natural is a proprietary fourth-generation programming language. It was not part of the initial (1971) Adabas release.

Natural programs can be &quot;run&quot; interpretively or &quot;executed&quot; as compiled objects. Compiled programs can more directly use operating system services, and run faster.

Proponents say that Natural has evolved from a competitor of COBOL
to &quot;being in competition with Java as language of choice for writing services (SOA).&quot;

===About Natural===

Natural, which includes a built-in screen-oriented editor, has two main components: the system and the language.

The system is the central vehicle of communication between the user and all other components of the processing environment.

The language is structured and less procedural than conventional languages.

Natural objects (programs, maps, data areas, etc.) are stored in libraries, similar in structure to a DOS directory, and can be named with identifiers up to 8 characters.

Objects, even if they are of different types, cannot have the same name (within the same library).

Natural provides both online and batch execution. Batch programs can read/write up to 32 work files and print up to 32 reports. Natural also supports an interactive debugger that allows developers to step through the code and display the contents of variables.

Versions exist for z/OS, z/VSE, BS2000/OS, Linux, Unix and Windows.

===Language features===

Natural works not only with Adabas files, but also supports Oracle,
DB2, and others.
Sample code:

DEFINE DATA LOCAL 
01 EMPLOYEES VIEW OF EMPLOYEES 
 02 SALARY (1) 
END-DEFINE 
READ EMPLOYEES BY NAME 
 AT END OF DATA 
 DISPLAY 
 MIN (EMPLOYEES.SALARY(1)) (EM=ZZZ,ZZZ,ZZ9) 
 AVER(EMPLOYEES.SALARY(1)) (EM=ZZZ,ZZZ,ZZ9) 
 MAX (EMPLOYEES.SALARY(1)) (EM=ZZZ,ZZZ,ZZ9) 
 END-ENDDATA 
END-READ 
END 

Output:

The language is strongly-typed, using explicit typing of variables, which may be one of:
* Alphanumeric 
* Numeric Zoned decimal up to 27 total digits, of which a total of 7 may be to the right of decimal point
* Packed Decimal, same limits as &quot;Numeric&quot;)
* Integer (1, 2 or 4 bytes, ranging from -128 to 127 / -32,768 to 32,767 and -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
* Date
* Time (which includes the date)
* Logical (True or False)
* Binary
* Control variable paralleling CICS map attribute
* Floating Point (4 or 8 bytes)

===The system file===

The system file is an Adabas file reserved for use by Natural, which contains, but is not limited to, the following:
* All Natural programs, both in source format (programs) and in object format (compiled), grouped in libraries;
* File Definition Modules, or Data Definition Modules (DDM), which describe the fields defined within Adabas or other databases supported by Natural as well as userviews, which are fields groupings/subsets;
* Natural error messages;
* The texts of the Help function.

The system file is not limited to Adabas. Natural can also store programs in VSAM on mainframe operating systems. Natural uses the file system on Windows and various Unix implementations.

====Programs====
Natural objects are identified by names up to 8 characters, the first of which must be alphabetical.

The Natural program editor allows source in rows of up to 72 positions. Lines are numbered by 4 digits. This numbering is generated by Natural during program creation. Line numbers used by the compiler and editors, and can have important logical functions in the programs.

Comments can be included in two ways:

* Full-line comments are identified by a &quot;*&quot; or &quot;**&quot; prefix.
* Annotated code lines have a &quot;/*&quot; - everything to its right is a comment.

Examples:
 0010 * These two lines (0010 and 0020)
 0020 ** are comments.
 0030 FORMAT LS = 80 /* As well as this part of the line (0030)
 0040 * NOTE: The &quot;/*&quot; form has no space between the SLASH and ASTERISK.
 .
 0200 END
&quot;END&quot; or &quot;.&quot; indicates the end of a program.

A Hello World code example:

 * Hello World in NATURAL
 WRITE &#x27;Hello World!&#x27;
 END

==Related products==
Most Natural installations include add-on products such as:
* Natural Security - used to administer security related to Users, Libraries and Files (tables).
* Predict - A dictionary used to define and document Files, Relationships, Programs, etc.
* Natural Construct - A code generator used to generate Natural applications.

<doc id="401963" wikidata="Q3997683" url="?curid=401963" title="Deathtrap (plot device)">
<text>A deathtrap is a literary and dramatic plot device in which a villain who has captured the hero or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of murdering them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero&#x27;s resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer&#x27;s ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or deus ex machina.

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by movie serials and 19th-century theatrical melodramas. A well-known example is the cliché of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the James Bond film series and superhero stories is well known.

== Famous examples ==
*&quot;The Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot; (Sherlock Holmes story): the engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;: Sealing Indiana Jones and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;: Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitaire to a platform to be lowered into a shark-infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch&#x27;s rotary saw function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*&quot;Goldfinger&quot;: James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a circular saw (a laser in the film) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: In the original novel, Bond loses consciousness, thwarting Goldfinger&#x27;s plan to make him suffer, leading to the villain cancelling the imminent demise. In the film, Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement &quot;008&quot; also knows about Goldfinger&#x27;s plans and that Bond&#x27;s death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;: The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures rats to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical &quot;movie-serial&quot; villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt. The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, &quot;Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one.&quot; In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action television series &quot;Batman&quot; usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a cliffhanger.
**Example: The Joker traps the Dynamic Duo without the use of their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*&quot;Final Destination&quot;: The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.
*&quot;The Venture Brothers&quot;: Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as &quot;Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls.&quot;
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for &quot;Hot Voile&quot;, which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*&quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot; always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the Hooded Claw.
*Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;: Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*&quot;Saw&quot;: The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a terminally ill vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in complex traps, both to test their resolve and force them to appreciate the value of life. 
*&quot;The Snowman&quot;: Rakel, Harry Hole&#x27;s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*&quot;You&#x27;re Next&quot;: One of the methods used by the killers includes the use of a garotte-based death trap. The heroine also sets up a death trap to defend herself from the killers but it accidentally kills a police officer that arrives to save her in the finale. 

A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the villain speech, also known as &quot;monologuing&quot;. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (which used the term &quot;monologuing&quot;), Mr. Incredible and Frozone attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking Syndrome and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of exposition.

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film &quot;2001 - A Space Odyssey&quot; when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: &quot;This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!&quot;. Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many satires.

* Deathtraps were heavily spoofed in the Austin Powers movies, including a replication of James Bond&#x27;s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as &quot;an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death&quot; with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which Dr. Evil calls &quot;the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism&quot;). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil&#x27;s disappointment), ill-tempered mutant seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, Scott Evil, Dr. Evil&#x27;s son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, Prince Edmund is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund&#x27;s friends, Baldrick and Percy, manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers terribly by the chair&#x27;s mechanisms, although not fatally (he dies when he drinks the same poisoned wine that killed the Hawk, and later, the royal family). In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* &quot;Curse of Monkey Island&quot; makes fun of this cliché. The villain LeChuck, after capturing Guybrush Threepwood, insists on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from &quot;Watchmen&quot; wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that &quot;Dan, I&#x27;m not a Republic serial villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago.&quot;
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot;, which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss Hank Scorpio has &quot;Mr. Bont&quot; strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio&#x27;s henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the Evil Overlord List point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a very small estimated time of death or such lines as &quot;Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies.&quot;
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series &quot;The Flintstones&quot; entitled &quot;Dr. Sinister&quot; spoofed the James Bond series (&quot;James Bondrock&quot;) and featured, among other deathtraps, Fred and Barney being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;. The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

<text>Software GmbH, trading as Software AG, is a German multinational software corporation that develops enterprise software for business process management, integration, and big data analytics. Founded in 1969, the company is headquartered in Darmstadt, Germany, and has offices worldwide.

In 2023, Silver Lake and Bain Capital made separate offers to buy the German company. In June, Software AG had most of its controlling interest acquired by Silver Lake, in a deal valued at 2.4 billion euros.

==History==
The company was founded in 1969 by six young employees at the consulting firm AIV (Institut für Angewandte Informationsverarbeitung). One of the founders was the mathematician Peter Schnell, who later became chairman of the board for many years.

ADABAS was launched in 1971 as a high-performance transactional database management system. In 1979, Natural, a 4GL application development English-like language, that was mainly developed by Peter Pagé, was launched. The company continued to open offices and subsidiaries in North America (1971), Japan (1974), UK (1977), France (1983), Spain (1984), Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, and Saudi Arabia (1985).

By 1987, Software AG had around 500 employees, 12 subsidiaries in Europe and offices in more than 50 countries. In 1999, Software AG was listed on Frankfurt Stock Exchange and soon after the company released Tamino Information Server and Tamino XML Server.

In January 2005, Software AG acquired Sabratec Ltd, a privately held legacy integration vendor headquartered in Israel. This was followed by the acquisition of its Israeli distributor SPL Software in March 2007 and the application modernization business of another Israeli company, Jacada in December 2007, which formed the basis for its research and development center in Israel.

The company launched Centrasite SOA Governance platform in 2006 and with the $546M acquisition of U.S. rival webMethods in 2007 Software AG became active in the enterprise service bus, business process management and service-oriented architecture (SOA) product space.

In July 2009, it announced a takeover offer for the Germany-based company IDS Scheer AG. Since February 2010, IDS Scheer is part of the Software AG Group. In October 2010, the company acquired New Jersey–based Data Foundations, a leading master data management provider.

In May 2011, Software AG acquired Terracotta, Inc. and Metismo Ltd. Terracotta Inc is in the field of in-memory technology for high-performance applications and cloud services – especially the middleware platform WebMethods should benefit from this acquisition.

In April 2012, Software AG (SAG) announced buying the British technology provider my-Channels. With it, Software AG gained in-house access to universal messaging technology that allowed the company to transfer their data streams quickly and safely to the cloud and mobile applications.

In March 2013, SAG invested in Berlin-based company metaquark, which is specialized in mobile software – the aim is to jointly develop the webMethods Mobile Suite. In April, Software AG bought the US cloud platform provider LongJump, which offers modules and templates for building and running business applications in the public or private cloud settings.

On June 13, 2013, it acquired alfabet AG, a software provider of enterprise architecture and IT portfolio management. Then SAG announced purchased the Apama Complex Event Processing platform of Progress Software; the platform provides an environment for the design and operation of CEP applications providing tools and graphical analysis and test capabilities for analysts, developers and administrators.

In August 2013, Software AG acquired JackBe to serve as the foundation for its Intelligent Business Operations Platform, which provides analytics and decision management for real-time applications. In December, Software AG invested in big data analytics company Datameer, which offers self-service Big Data Analytics and &quot;to follow cutting edge technology trends&quot;.

On March 27, 2017, SAG announced the acquisition of Cumulocity GmbH, based in Düsseldorf, Germany. On June 12, 2018, Software AG acquired the Belgian self-service analytics company, TrendMiner NV., a specialist in virtual data analysis for the manufacturing and process industry.

In April 2023, private equity firm Silver Lake agreed to buy the company for (billion). Silver Lake was outbid by Bain Capital in a non-binding counteroffer through its portfolio company Rocket Software, but Software AG&#x27;s board and management supported the original offer citing its higher likelihood to go through and since it would remain an independent company. In June 2023, Silver Lake secured 63% of Software AG. Later that year, Software AG agreed to sell its StreamSets and webMethods platforms to IBM for $2.33 billion.

During 2024, the company was reorganized from a stock corporation (AG, &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot;) to a company with limited liability (GmbH, &quot;Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung&quot;). As a result, it changed its logo and other branding slightly, and now refers to itself as &quot;Software AG, a Software GmbH Brand&quot;.

Following the acquisition by Silver Lake, Software AG sold or divested the majority of its portfolio, including the sale of Alfabet and Cumulocity to an undisclosed buyer or buyers. In 2025, Software AG announced their intention to spin off the remaining two products, ARIS, and Adabas &amp; Natural, as two separate businesses. The company also announced in January 2025 that Sanjay Brahmawar was stepping down as CEO and four executives had been appointed to lead Software AG&#x27;s holding company, Software GmbH -- Martin Biegel, Martin Clemm, Robin Colman, and Toktam Khatibzadeh.

===Corruption allegations===
In July 2017 allegations emerged in South Africa that Software AG made &quot;kickback&quot; payments by entering into questionable commission agreements with a Gupta-controlled company in the hope of securing lucrative state contracts.
&quot;Software AG [launched] an internal investigation after a media report alleged it had paid kickbacks as part of a wide-ranging South African scandal...&quot;

<text>The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMass Dartmouth or UMassD) is a public research university in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. It is the southernmost campus of the University of Massachusetts system. Formerly Southeastern Massachusetts University (known locally as SMU), it was merged into the University of Massachusetts system in 1991.

The campus has an overall student body of 8,513 students (school year 2019–2020), including 6,841 undergraduates and 1,672 graduate/law students. As of the 2019–2020 academic year, UMass Dartmouth had 402 full-time faculty on staff. The Dartmouth campus also includes the University of Massachusetts School of Law. UMass Dartmouth is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

The university has nine colleges including law, engineering, art &amp; science and honors college, each having several departments.

==History==
The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth traces its roots to 1895 when the Massachusetts legislature chartered the New Bedford Textile School in New Bedford and the Bradford Durfee Textile School in Fall River. The New Bedford Textile School was renamed the New Bedford Institute of Textiles and Technology, and the Bradford Durfee Textile School was renamed the Bradford Durfee College of Technology.

In 1962, the two schools were combined to create the Southeastern Massachusetts Technological Institute, expanding to become Southeastern Massachusetts University by 1969.

The University sits on a 710 acre site acquired in the early 1960s. In 1964, the ground was broken on a unified campus not far from the Smith Mills section of Dartmouth between the two cities of New Bedford and Fall River. The Liberal Arts building was completed in 1966, the Science &amp; Engineering building in 1969, and the other original buildings were finished by 1971. The main campus has been expanded several times, including the Cedar Dell residences (begun in 1987), the Dion Science &amp; Engineering Building in 1989, the Charlton College of Business in 2004, the new apartment-style residence halls in 2005, and the Research Building in 2007.

In 1991, SMU joined the UMass system and adopted its present name, the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Since then, the university has expanded back into its original cities as well, with the Center for Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, formerly Advanced Textiles &amp; Manufacturing Center, (2001, at the former Kerr Mill site in Fall River) and Professional and Continuing Education Center (2002, in the former Cherry &amp; Webb building in Fall River), and the School for Marine Science and Technology (1996, adjacent to Fort Rodman in New Bedford), the Star Store visual arts building in New Bedford (2001) and a second Center for Professional and Continuing Education (2002, one block north on Purchase Street) in New Bedford.

Billionaire Robert T. Hale spoke at the May 2024 commencement ceremony, surprising graduating students by giving each of them $1,000 in cash onstage, asking that they keep half and donate the other half.

==Architecture==

The buildings on the campus were designed by Modernist architect Paul Rudolph beginning in the early 1960s to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture is similar to that of the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows. The stairs were made relatively short in height. Atria was also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science &amp; Engineering buildings to give people a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls south of the main campus, have been built to complement Rudolph&#x27;s Late Modernist aesthetic.
In October 2013, &quot;Travel and Leisure&quot; named the university one of the most mysterious campuses in the United States. It compared the library to a concrete spaceship, describing it as an icon of the Brutalist style of architecture that has been both beloved and derided since its construction in the 1960s.

The university has large areas of undeveloped green space with numerous footpaths, including wooded areas, grasslands, wetlands, and ponds.

==Student life==

===Student organizations===
The Student Government Association, which is controlled by 34 seats, is a student-run group that handles all student activity fees and disperses them to the various clubs and organizations. There are over 160 student clubs and organizations, 11 intramural sports teams/organizations, and a full-service, public radio spectrum campus radio station, WUMD 89.3, broadcasting at 9,600 watts.

===Housing and residential education===

====General information====
On-campus living provides three different residence options:
* Traditional Residence Halls
* Apartments
* Townhouses
Each hall is staffed by a professional Resident Director, and 8–14 student Resident Assistants. Each Hall also features a Hall Council which plans events, holds elections, and engages with the larger residential population through Resident Student Association (a student-government organization for all residential students).

===Transportation===
On-campus transportation is provided by the university, which includes a campus-loop shuttle that makes several stops across the main campus, shuttle services to nearby stores and businesses, and shuttle services from the main campus to the satellite campuses. The university also manages a &quot;safe-rides&quot; program, which offers on-request shuttle services across the campus for students after the shuttle stops operating, and &quot;safe-walk&quot; services which offers a campus police officer to escort students when the safe-ride shuttle stops. Zipcar and bus charters are also offered on campus, and taxi services are available nearby.

The shuttle stop outside the campus center also serves as a stop for the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority, which provides public bus services to New Bedford and Fall River at no cost to students. Daily bus service to Taunton and Boston is also offered via DATTCO buses.

==Athletics==

UMass Dartmouth athletic teams, known by their nickname, the Corsairs, compete in a variety of sports. Men and women compete in NCAA Division III. The men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, ice hockey, soccer, and track and field. The women&#x27;s sports are basketball, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Most of the teams compete in the Little East Conference, while the men&#x27;s ice hockey and football teams compete in the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference.

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, UMass Dartmouth cut eight athletic teams to redirect funding to the remaining 17 programs. The discontinued sports were men&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s equestrian, men&#x27;s golf, co-ed sailing, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis. After &quot;a review of the athletics program’s overall strategy as it relates to Title IX and the proportionality test&quot;, women&#x27;s swimming and women&#x27;s tennis were re-established a short time later.

<doc id="401983" wikidata="Q208301" url="?curid=401983" title="Khalid of Saudi Arabia">
<text>Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (; 13 February 1913 13 June 1982) was King and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia from 25 March 1975 until his death in 1982. Before his death, he was Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the fifth son of King Abdulaziz, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia.

Khalid was the son of King Abdulaziz and Al Jawhara bint Musaed Al Saud. He assisted his half-brother Prince Faisal in his duties as foreign minister of Saudi Arabia. Khalid served as viceroy of the Hejaz region for a brief time in the 1930s. He visited the United States in 1943 together with Faisal, establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. He was appointed deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia in 1962. King Faisal named Khalid as crown prince in 1965, after Khalid&#x27;s full brother Prince Muhammad removed himself from the line of royal succession.

Following the assassination of King Faisal in 1975, Khalid ascended to the throne. His reign saw both huge developments in the country due to an increase in oil revenues and also significant events in the Middle East. In 1979, a group of civilians seized the Grand Mosque of Mecca and sought but failed to kidnap Khalid. Saudi forces regained control over the mosque, but the seizure resulted in the introduction of stricter religious policies in Saudi Arabia. Khalid died in 1982 and was succeeded by his half-brother Fahd.

==Early life and education==

Khalid was born in Qasr Al Hukm, Riyadh, on 13 February 1913. He was the fifth son of King Abdulaziz. His mother, Al Jawhara bint Musaed, was from the important Al Jiluwi clan. She was a second cousin of Abdulaziz, their paternal grandfathers Jiluwi bin Turki and Faisal bin Turki being brothers. This was in keeping with long-standing traditions in Arabia of marriage within the same lineage, and members of Al Jiluwi frequently intermarried with the members of Al Saud.

Khalid had one full-brother, Muhammad. His full sister, Al Anoud, married to the sons of King Abdulaziz&#x27;s brother Sa&#x27;ad bin Abdul Rahman. She first married Saud bin Sa&#x27;ad. After Saud died, she married Fahd bin Sa&#x27;ad. Khalid attended the Mufirej school founded by Sheikh Abdul Rahman Al Mufirej in 1879 based in the Sheikh Abdullah bin Abdul Latif Mosque in the Dukhna neighborhood of Riyadh. There he acquired basic literacy skills and studied arithmetics.

==Early experience==
Aged 14, Khalid was sent by Abdulaziz as his representative to the desert tribes to hear their concerns and problems. In 1928 he and his brother Muhammad were given the task of observing the Transjordan border during the Ikhwan revolt. Prince Khalid&#x27;s preparation for ruling a modern state started through his visits with his brother Prince Faisal on foreign missions. He served as advisor to Faisal. Prince Khalid became an international figure due to his visits and service as a Saudi representative. He was more liberal in informing the press about the rationale behind foreign policy decisions.

Prince Khalid was made acting viceroy of Hejaz in early 1932 when his full brother Prince Muhammad carried out the task badly. The same year he was named as viceroy of Hejaz, replacing Prince Faisal in the post, who was named minister of foreign affairs, and Prince Khalid&#x27;s term lasted until 1934. Prince Khalid joined the Saudi army led by his older brother Prince Faisal and fought against Yemeni forces in 1934. After the war, Prince Khalid served as the chairman of the Saudi delegation at the Taif Conference with Yemen in 1934. This was a diplomatic move that led to the Taif Treaty later that year which was signed by Prince Khalid on behalf of Saudi Arabia and Abdullah Al Wazeer on behalf of Yemen.

Prince Khalid was named interior minister in 1934 and was the Saudi representative at the peace negotiations in Yemen in 1935. In 1939, he participated in the St. James Conference on Palestine in London as the minister of interior as well as an assistant to Prince Faisal, head of the Saudi delegation.
In October 1943 Prince Faisal and Prince Khalid visited the United States representing their father, upon the July 1943 invitation of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The visit was the earliest high-level contact between Saudi Arabia and the US. Vice President Henry A. Wallace organized a dinner for them at the White House. They also met with President Roosevelt. They stayed at the official government guest house, Blair House, and visited the West Coast by a special train that was officially provided by the U.S. government. A foreign diplomat described Prince Khalid following the visit as the &quot;nicest man in Saudi Arabia.&quot;

However, after this visit and during most of the 1950s Prince Khalid did not play a significant role in the government partly due to the fact that his half-brother Mansour bin Abdulaziz and his nephew Abdullah bin Faisal became much more dominant political figures. Prince Khalid reemerged as a significant figure in 1960 when King Saud named him acting prime minister. In addition, on 31 October 1962 he was appointed deputy prime minister in the new cabinet formed by Crown Prince Faisal. This move indicated his prominence in the line of succession. During the rivalry between Crown Prince Faisal and King Saud, Prince Khalid supported the former together with other princes who were members of the Al Jiluwi branch of Al Saud through maternal lineage or marriage. The group was led by Prince Muhammad, Prince Khalid and Prince Abdullah.

At the beginning of King Faisal&#x27;s reign Prince Khalid was made a member of the council which had been established by the king to guide the succession issues.

==Crown prince==
Khalid&#x27;s older full-brother Prince Muhammad declined a place in the succession. Khalid also refused the offer of King Faisal to be named as crown prince several times until March 1965. In addition, he asked King Faisal to remove him from the position various times. However, the King persuaded Khalid that his presence as crown prince was necessary to keep peace within the House of Saud. One of the speculations about Prince Khalid&#x27;s selection as heir designate was his lack of predilection for politics. In short, by selecting him as heir designate the royal family could create intra-familial consensus.

Khalid was named crown prince on 29 March 1965. King Faisal announced Khalid&#x27;s appointment on the same day through a broadcast over Mecca Radio:Since the position of Crown Prince is a fundamental factor for the continuation and firmness of the reign, now the country enjoys stability, advancement and prosperity. Thanks to its adherence to Islam. It gives me great pleasure to announce...that I have chosen my brother Prince Khalid bin Abdulaziz as Crown Prince to rule after me.

Prince Khalid was also named first deputy prime minister following his appointment as crown prince. Although Joseph A. Kéchichian argues that Crown Prince Khalid was not active in daily issues, but acted as a representative during King Faisal&#x27;s absences in meetings or ceremonies, he governed all organisational and executive powers of the Council of Ministers. He also dealt with the affairs of the Governorate of Mecca on behalf of King Faisal. However, in 1968 Crown Prince Khalid expressed his desire not to preside over the Council of Ministers against King Faisal&#x27;s request which led to the appointment of Prince Fahd as second deputy prime minister with the task of leading the Council meetings.

In 1970 Crown Prince Khalid led Saudi delegations to Jordan to meet the needs of Palestinians who were seriously affected from Israel&#x27;s attacks. According to the declassified US diplomatic documents of 1971, he enjoyed the support of the tribal chiefs, religious authorities and of Prince Abdullah, head of the Saudi National Guard, during this period.

==Reign==

Khalid succeeded to the throne on 25 March 1975 when King Faisal was assassinated. He was proclaimed king after a meeting of senior members of Al Saud: his uncle Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman and his brothers Muhammad, Nasser, Saad, Fahd, and Abdullah. The meeting occurred just hours after the assassination of King Faisal. Khalid also became the de facto prime minister of Saudi Arabia and the chairman of two significant councils, namely the Higher Council for Administrative Reform and the Supreme Council for National Security.

Although there are various reports stating that King Khalid was only a figurehead during his reign, he was in fact not a figurehead, but the final decision-maker on all major policy issues during his reign. King Faisal established a system in which the king was the final mediator in family problems. King Khalid reduced the power of the Sudairi Seven concerning succession in 1977 when he was in London for treatment. Following the unsuccessful attempt of the Sudairi Seven to overthrow King Khalid and to install one of their own, Prince Sultan, as deputy crown prince instead of Prince Abdullah, the King asked Crown Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah to fully obey the existing succession plan without any change. King Khalid also closely checked the activities of Crown Prince Fahd due to the latter&#x27;s clear support for the pro-Western policies and hostile tendency against Iran and Shia population of Saudi Arabia.

In addition, King Khalid was not an ineffective leader. Although he seemed to be reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. During the first two years of his reign he was not active in politics due to his poor health condition, but later he became much more active as a result of his much better health.

King Khalid is also considered to have been a genial caretaker during his reign. However, he failed to monopolize power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal&#x27;s reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. He was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country. Ghadah Alghunaim, a board member of the King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue, argues in her doctoral dissertation that Khalid&#x27;s reign was a golden era and the &quot;era of goodness&quot; for the country.

===Domestic affairs===

King Khalid&#x27;s reign was of massive development in Saudi Arabia and therefore, the country became one of the richest countries in that the oil revenues became $40 billion in 1977 and $90 billion in 1980.

King Khalid primarily dealt with domestic affairs with special focus on agricultural development. The industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu were created during the early days of his reign. In 1975 the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu was founded to run the cities, and its first secretary general was Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki. Jeddah Port Authority was established in September 1976 to expand the capacity of the existing port. The number of schools increased during his reign. In 1975, there were 3,028 elementary schools, 649 secondary schools and 182 high schools. In 1980, there were 5,373 elementary, 1,377 secondary and 456 high schools. The other significant development in the field of education during his reign was the establishment of King Faisal University. The others were the Higher Education Center for Women which was opened in 1976 as well as colleges of medicine and pharmacology established specifically for female students.

Immediately following his ascension to the throne King Khalid issued a general amnesty which allowed the release of political prisoners who had been members of the left wing movements and the return of those who had been in exile to Saudi Arabia. Most of them were arrested during the reign of King Faisal.

In terms of administrative functions King Khalid followed the structure established by King Faisal in which both royals and non-royals occupied significant positions. The political power consolidation of the ruling family was intensified during his reign. However, King Khalid expanded the role of nonroyals in bureaucracy without diminishing the roles of royal family members. These non-royals were mostly graduates of foreign universities, and by 1977 ten of the thirty-six members in the council of ministers were those who received a master&#x27;s or doctorate degree from Western universities.

The strict financial policies of King Faisal, coupled with the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis, created a financial windfall that fueled development and led to a commercial and economic boom in the country. Notable achievements in his reign included the institution of the second Five-Year Plan in 1975, which aimed to build up Saudi infrastructure and health care. The planned budget for the development plan was $142 billion. Although not all goals were achieved, the second development plan was much more successful than the first one. King Khalid also launched the Kingdom&#x27;s third development plan with the budget of $250 billion in May 1980.

In a reorganization of the council of ministers on 30 March 1975, King Khalid named Crown Prince Fahd deputy prime minister and Prince Abdullah second deputy prime minister. Appointment of Prince Fahd as both crown prince and first deputy prime minister made him much powerful figure in contrast to the status of King Khaled when he was crown prince under King Faisal reign. Prince Nayef was named minister of interior succeeding Prince Fahd on 30 March 1975. King Khalid also appointed Prince Saud as the foreign affairs minister in March 1975.

In addition to the existing ministerial bodies six new ones were established by King Khalid in October 1975. One of them was the ministry of municipal and rural affairs established, and Prince Majid was appointed minister. Additionally, Prince Mutaib was appointed minister of public works and housing that was also established by King Khalid in October 1975. These two appointments were a move to reduce the power of Sudairi Seven in the cabinet. Besides, the ministry of industry and electricity, the ministry of higher education, the ministry of post, telegraph, and telephone and the ministry of planning were all founded by King Khalid. In the same government reshuffle he removed Prince Musaid, his uncle, from the post of finance minister which he had been held since 16 March 1962, and Mohammed bin Ali Aba Al Khail was made new finance minister. The number of non-royal members of the cabinet was decreased, and only eight royal family members were given ministerial posts in this reshuffle. King Khalid also expanded the internal structure of some ministries. For instance, the Public Security Administration was created in 1976 to preserve the public order and tranquility, to promote of the public health, safety, and morals, and to detect and punish the crimes, and attached it to the ministry of interior.

The members of the inner family council headed by King Khalid included his brothers, namely Prince Mohammad, Crown Prince Fahd, Prince Abdullah, Prince Sultan, and Prince Abdul Muhsin and two of his uncles, Prince Ahmed and Prince Musaid. Prince Mohammad was one of King Khalid&#x27;s key advisors. In fact, they acted together on almost all political issues. Another of his advisors was Maarouf al-Dawalibi, former Prime Minister of Syria and founder of the Islamic Socialist Front.

Kamal Adham served as the president of Al Mukhabarat Al A&#x27;amah or the general intelligence directorate until 19 January 1979 which he had held since 1965. Adham&#x27;s successor in the post was Turki bin Faisal.

In 1977 a coup attempt by Saudi Air Force personnel, backed by the Libyan Intelligence Service, was discovered and quickly defeated.

Saudi Arabia acquired full control of Aramco in 1980 during his reign and the company was renamed as Saudi Aramco. In March 1980 King Khalid established a constitutional committee with eight members under the presidency of Prince Nayef. However, the committee could not manage to produce the basic law that had been promised. King Khalid implemented a significant policy towards bedouins through a decree dated 15 March 1981 which required them to settle in a fixed place.

In November 1979, Khalid&#x27;s reign saw two major local incidents which have had significant effects on the politics of Saudi Arabia: the Grand Mosque seizure and the Qatif Uprising.

====Grand Mosque seizure====
Some foreign observers thought traditionalism was no longer a strong force in Saudi Arabia. This idea was disproved when at least 500 dissidents invaded and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979. The same day two other raids were made by the groups related to these dissidents in Medina and Taif. The dissidents in Medina were immediately defeated by the Saudi troops. The goal of the dissidents in Taif was to abduct King Khalid who escaped the attack due to the changes in his plans.

When the first news of the attack in Mecca reached Riyadh, the initial reaction of King Khalid was to consult the ulama, to get permission to use military force to eject the attackers. The ulama hesitated and refrained from a definite answer. Only after the assault had been underway for 36 hours did some ulama allow the use of force. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit and the commander of the National Guard Prince Abdullah was in Morocco for an official visit. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to Prince Sultan, the minister of defense, and Prince Nayef, the minister of interior, to deal with the incident.

The Grand Mosque was regained by Saudi forces on 4 December 1979 and 63 rebels were executed on 9 January 1980 in eight different cities. The executions were decreed by King Khalid after the edict issued by ulemas. Although the Saudi government under King Khalid executed the rebels, the religious establishment that inspired them were given greater powers. And ulema successfully pressed King Khalid to realize their intentions.

====1979 Qatif Uprising====
In November 1979, Shiites in the Eastern Province, particularly in Qatif and in nearby villages, organized protests. Several demonstrators were arrested. The major reason for the uprising was negative conditions in villages. In the spring of 1979, King Khalid announced an annual budget of 160 billion riyals, indicating that this budget would be employed to improve the living conditions of all Saudi citizens. However, the budget did not make any significant contribution to the services. Instead, the royal family benefitted from the budget. Following the release of the demonstrators in February 1980, King Khalid and Crown Prince Fahd visited the Eastern region from town to town. Due to King Khalid&#x27;s policy change towards the Shiite population in the region, they positively modified their approach towards the Saudi government and abandoned their oppositional ideas and actions.

===International relations===
Although King Khalid did not have an extensive interest in foreign affairs as much as King Faisal had, his reign witnessed many important international events, including the Iranian Revolution, the assassination of Anwar Sadat and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all of which had significant effects for Saudi Arabia. In addition, the Saudi government led by King Khalid was much more active in improving the relations of Saudi Arabia with neighbouring states in contrast to the reign of Faisal. His government was also much more moderate and less conservative in regard to the Arab–Israeli conflict than that of King Faisal. Kamal Adham was King Khalid&#x27;s key counsellor on foreign policy during his reign from 1975 to 1982.

King Khalid initiated a move to bring in foreign labor to help with the country&#x27;s development.

====1975–1980====
In April 1975, King Khalid&#x27;s first diplomatic coup was the conclusion of a demarcation agreement concerning the Al Buraymi Oasis, where the frontiers of Abu Dhabi, Oman and Saudi Arabia meet. Claims and counterclaims over this frontier had exacerbated relations among them for years. Therefore, King Khalid aimed at settling this long-standing boundary disputes. The conclusion of negotiations under King Khalid added to his stature as a statesman. Between 21 and 23 April 1975 a high-level talk was held in Riyadh with the attendance of King Khalid, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad concerning the peace negotiations as a result of the conflict in the Sinai between Egypt and Israel.

Another significant event was the visit of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran to Riyadh on 28 April 1975. In June 1975, Saudi Arabia appointed an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, which also assigned an ambassador to Saudi Arabia the same date.

His first official visit as the King of Saudi Arabia was to Cairo, Egypt in mid-July 1975. The visit was an indication of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s support of the initiatives of Anwar Sadat concerning peace settlement between the Arabs and Israel. King Khalid visited Damascus in December 1975 and met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to discuss the ways to support Muslims in Lebanon, where a civil war began in April 1975. He declared the Saudi Arabia&#x27;s support to Syria&#x27;s role in the war.

Diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen were reestablished in March 1976. A month later, in April 1976, King Khalid made state visits to all of the Gulf states in the hope of promoting closer relations with his peninsular neighbors. On 24 May 1976 King Khalid visited Tehran to meet with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He also called numerous summits and inaugurated the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 that is seen an outcome of his early visits. Then GCC was established along with Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

One of the significant international moves occurred in the reign of King Khalid was the establishment of the Safari Club, of which the treaty was signed on 1 September 1976. It was a secret organization with the participation of Egypt, France, Iran, Morocco and Saudi Arabia to eliminate the potential influence of communism in the region. The treaty was signed by Kamal Adham on behalf of Saudi Arabia. King Khalid organized a conference in Riyadh in October 1976 to resolve the ongoing Lebanese civil war, and the conference contributed to end the war. The same month he also visited Pakistan, and the visit was mostly concerned with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s financial support for the joint developmental projects in Pakistan. In addition, he visited Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi, and initiated the construction of King Faisal Mosque in Islamabad.

On 19 May 1977, King Khalid met Hafez al-Assad and Anwar Sadat in Riyadh to initiate a coordinated policy on the Arab–Israeli conflict. He also met Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Riyadh on 18 June 1977. Lebanese Foreign Minister Fuad Butrus was received by King Khalid in Riyadh on 5 July 1977 to discuss the current situation in Lebanon. On 10 July 1977, Yen Chia-kan, President of Taiwan, visited Saudi Arabia and was received by the King in Riyadh. Two days later, on 12 July 1977, King Khalid and Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre met in Jeddah. Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiry and King Khalid met in Ta&#x27;if on 2 August 1977. King Khalid&#x27;s next visitors were Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and Foreign Minister Arnaldo Forlani who visited Saudi Arabia on 5–6 August.
In early January 1978 the US President Jimmy Carter paid an official visit to Riyadh and met King Khalid to discuss the Middle East peace efforts. Immediately after this meeting Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi visited King Khalid on 11 January 1978 to discuss some topics related to the security of the region. Following King Khalid&#x27;s heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic on 3 October 1978 Jimmy Carter invited him to the White House for lunch, and they met on 27 October. The Camp David accord which was signed by Egypt and Israel in September 1978 severely affected the Saudi–Egyptian alliance, and Saudi Arabia&#x27;s diplomatic relations with Egypt were terminated following the Baghdad Conference in November 1978. The same year King Khalid visited France to finalize the procurement of $24 billion military equipment, namely tanks, helicopters, and a complete radar network which was capable of covering the entire Red Sea. Much of this equipment was sent to North Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia to assist their resistance against communism.

Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, King Khalid sent Khomeini a congratulatory message, stating that Islamic solidarity could be the basis for closer relations of two countries. He also argued that with the foundation of the Islamic Republic in Iran there were no obstacles that inhibited the cooperation between two countries. In addition, King Khalid requested the secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to congratulate the new Iranian government. However, his initiatives were unsuccessful in that Saudi Arabia unofficially supported Iraq against Iran in the Iran–Iraq War in 1980.

On 24 December 1979 Pakistan President Zia ul Haq visited Riyadh and met King Khalid in relation to the Grand Mosque crisis which had been solved at the beginning of the month.

====1980–1982====
In April 1980 King Khalid cancelled the state visit to Britain as a protest over the broadcasting of &quot;Death of a Princess&quot; on 9 April 1980 in the United Kingdom that narrated the execution of Misha&#x27;al bin Fahd, the granddaughter of Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz. King Khalid had been invited by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1979, following the Queen&#x27;s visit to Saudi Arabia in February 1979, during which King Khalid gave her a diamond necklace. In addition, the British ambassador was expelled from Saudi Arabia for five months due to the broadcasting of the documentary on ITV. Egyptian actress Suzan Abu Talib or Sawsan Badr and other actors who had roles in the documentary were banned from entering Saudi Arabia.

King Khalid in the capacity of the chairman of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation assisted Pakistani authorities to end the hijacking of the Pakistan International Airlines Flight 326 on 2 March 1981 first to Kabul and to Damascus on the request of President Zia ul Haq. Upon meeting then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia in April 1981, King Khalid is reputed to have said he would be happy to discuss falcons with her, but for all matters of administration she should talk to Crown Prince Fahd. King Khalid&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom that had been cancelled in 1980 occurred on 9 June 1981 for four days. Next he visited Spain on 15 June 1981.

King Khalid asked the US President Jimmy Carter to sell advanced fighter planes to Saudi Arabia to assist in countering communist aggression in the area. The delivery of the first of sixty F-15s under the agreement approved by Carter arrived in the Kingdom in 1982. He purchased a Boeing 747 with an operating room should he be stricken while on his travels. Jimmy Carter in his memoirs stated that both King Khalid and then Crown Prince Fahd assured him of &quot;their unequivocal support for Sadat&quot;, but they would realize no concrete move in this direction, at least not publicly.

Just one week before his death King Khalid sent messages to the US President Ronald Reagan and other world leaders on 6 June 1982 stating that a quick intervention was needed to stop the Israeli massacre in Lebanon referring to the Israeli attacks against Palestinians in the country.

==Views==
In June 1974 when he was Crown Prince Khalid argued that France taught the Syrians to be stubborn, and the British instilled the idea for the Arabs to differ with each other.

At the very beginning of his reign King Khalid stated &quot;Islamic law is and will remain our standard, our source of inspiration, and our goal.&quot; and &quot;We are against communism and we will protect ourselves against it by all means. If the United States pressed Israel into making a just peace settlement, Russia would not acquire a single foothold in the Middle East.&quot;

He questioned the support of the US administration to Greece instead of Turkey in late May 1976 citing Turkey&#x27;s contributions in the Korean War during the 1950s. In an interview on BBC Summary of World Broadcasts he expressed the following views on Zionism, Communism and colonialism on 3 July 1979: &quot;We regard Zionism, communism and colonialism as a trinity allied against Arab and Islamic rights and aspirations. Our policy is based on that understanding, and it is natural for us to be always subjected to biased and poisonous campaigns at the hand of that very trinity.&quot; Following the defeat of invaders of Grand Mosque King Khalid expressed the following: &quot;if [Juhayman] al Otaibi and his cohorts had targeted palaces rather than the Grand Mosque [in their 1979 uprising] the results of the uprising might have been very different.&quot;

At the third summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Taif in January 1981 he declared non-alignment of Saudi Arabia concerning the tensions between the US and Soviet Union: &quot;Our loyalty must be neither to an eastern bloc nor to a western bloc. The security of the Islamic nation will not be assured by joining a military alliance, nor by taking refuge under the umbrella of a superpower.&quot;

==Personal life==

King Khalid married four times and was the father of ten children. While the sequence in seniority of his wives is not known clearly, his wives were:
* Latifa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. Latifa was a daughter of King Abdulaziz&#x27;s maternal uncle and Khalid was fifteen when he married her. They had no children.
* Tarfa bint Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. She was a daughter of his uncle, Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman. They had no children.
* Noura bint Turki bin Abdulaziz bin Abdullah bin Turki Al Saud. She was the mother of Khalid&#x27;s elder sons, Prince Bandar and Prince Abdullah and his elder daughter, Al Bandari. Noura bint Turki died at age 95 on 12 September 2011.
*Seeta bint Fahd Al Damir had seven children with King Khalid: Al Jawhara, Fahd (died young), Nouf, Moudi, Hussa, Mishaal, and Faisal. She was from the Ujman tribe in Al Badiyah and was a niece of Wasmiyah Al Damir, wife of Abdullah bin Jiluwi. She died on 25 December 2012 at the age of 90.

Khalid had four sons and six daughters. Prince Bandar, the eldest son of King Khalid, was born in 1935. He was one of the members of Al Saud Family Council established by Crown Prince Abdullah in June 2000 to discuss private issues such as business activities of princes and marriages of princess to individuals who were not member of House of Saud. Prince Bandar died in Mecca in March 2018. His youngest child, Prince Faisal, is the former governor of Asir Province and a member of the Allegiance Council.

Khalid&#x27;s eldest daughter, Princess Al Bandari, married her cousin Prince Badr, son of Prince Abdul Muhsin. Another of his daughters, Princess Hussa, married Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki, grandson of Turki I bin Abdulaziz. She died at the age of 59 in November 2010. Two of his daughters married the sons of Abdullah bin Faisal: Princess Al Jawhara married Khalid bin Abdullah Al Saud and has a son, Mohammed, and Princess Nouf married Mohammed bin Abdullah and has four children, including Noura.

Another daughter of Khalid, Moudi, married Prince Abdul Rahman bin Faisal and is the general secretary of the King Khalid Foundation and the Al Nahda Foundation, and a former member of the Consultative Assembly. One of Khalid&#x27;s daughters, Mishael bint Khalid died in Riyadh in April 2014.

===Personality, pastimes and property===

Khalid was described as warm, cheerful, attentive and devout and was adored by his sisters and brothers. An American journalist from &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, John K. Cooley, following his observation of King Khalid at majlis stated that he carefully listened to his subjects showing his sense of humor and amused smile. During the first year of his rule King Khalid was said by his close observers to be an open and good man without any pretense representing the best example of Arab gentlemanly culture. His favourite topics to discuss at majlis with visitors were the problems related to education and youth.

Khalid had the capacity to settle conflicts which was first recognized by his father. It was the reason for sending him to Yemen in 1935 to handle the problems with local people. During his kingship Khalid acted as a mediator between the Sudairi brothers and Prince Abdullah although he was much closer to the latter.

Falconry and horse-riding were Khalid&#x27;s favorite pastimes. He was described as a man of the desert. He had one of the best falcon collections. In the late 1970s King Khalid was given a rare Alberta-trained gyrfalcon by the Canadian government as a gift. Hunting was also one of his favorites, and he went to African countries to participate in hunting safaris when he was young. Khalid bought the first Toyota Landcruiser in 1955 for falconry. In December 1975 he bought the then longest Cadillac at 25 feet and 2 inches long again for falconry, and &quot;Time magazine&quot; called it &quot;Khalidillac&quot;. In June 1974 while he was Crown Prince in a meeting with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger Khalid stated that he had been interested in hunting with hawks for forty years.

In the same meeting Kissinger asked him where he lived. In response he stated that he lived in Riyadh, but in the summer he stayed in Taif. King Khalid owned a desert farm outside Riyadh at Um Hamam. He bought Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate for £1.9 million in March 1977 to use following two operations on his hip in the Wellington Hospital in London.

===Health===
When Khalid bin Abdulaziz was crown prince, he had a massive heart attack in 1970 and had a heart surgery in 1972 at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States. Since King Khalid suffered from heart ailment for a long period of time, Crown Prince Fahd was in charge of ruling the country. On 3 October 1978, he underwent a second heart surgery again in Cleveland. He also had a hip operation at Wellington Hospital in London in 1976. In February 1980, King Khalid had a minor heart attack.

==Death and funeral==
King Khalid died on 13 June 1982 due to a heart attack in his summer palace in Taif. On the same day his body was brought from Taif to Mecca. After funeral prayers at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, King Khalid was buried in Al Oud cemetery in Riyadh. Leaders of Qatar, Kuwait, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, as well as President of Egypt Hosni Mubarak, participated in the funeral.

==Legacy==
King Khalid International Airport, King Khalid University, King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, King Khalid Military City and King Khalid Medical City in the Eastern province were all named after him. In Riyadh there is also a mosque named after him, King Khalid Grand Mosque, serving the Muslims since 1988. In Jeddah a bridge is named after King Khalid. There is a research center on wildlife in Saudi Arabia named after him, Khalid Wildlife Research Centre.

In addition, his family established King Khalid Foundation, which is being headed by his son, Abdullah bin Khalid. The foundation awards individuals who have achievements in the fields of corporate social responsibility, nonprofit management and social innovation.

===Awards===
In January 1981 King Khalid was awarded by the United Nations (UN) a gold medal which is the UN&#x27;s highest decoration for the statesmen who significantly contributed to peace and cooperation worldwide. King Khalid also received the King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam due to his efforts in support of Islamic solidarity in 1981.

<text>Hornblower is a series of British historical fiction war television films based on three of C. S. Forester&#x27;s ten novels about the fictional character Horatio Hornblower, a Royal Navy officer during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

The series ran from 7 October 1998 until 6 January 2003, with Ioan Gruffudd in the title role. It was produced by the British broadcaster ITV Meridian, and was shown on ITV in the UK and A&amp;E in the US. It is often repeated on ITV4.

==The film series==
The series consists of eight television films, which are notable for their high production values. All were later released on DVD (with the original aspect ratio of 16:9 widescreen in Europe and 4:3 in the US). In the US, the series was retitled &quot;Horatio Hornblower&quot;, and some of the films were known by different titles. The eight films cover the events of just three of the ten novels (&quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot;, &quot;Lieutenant Hornblower&quot;, and &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;), and various alterations and additions are made to the source material (e.g., the recurring characters of Lt. Archie Kennedy, Matthews and Styles).

* &quot;Retribution&quot; (15 April 2001)
* &quot;Loyalty&quot; (5 January 2003)
* &quot;Duty&quot; (6 January 2003)

==Production==
Captain Pellew&#x27;s ship, , is represented by the &quot;Grand Turk&quot;, a modern copy of the frigate built in 1741. To represent Hornblower&#x27;s ship, HMS &quot;Hotspur&quot;, the &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;, a civilian ship, underwent some conversion. The Baltic trading schooner &quot;Julia&quot; and the brig &quot;Phoenix of Dell Quay&quot; were used to represent the smaller vessels. No real 74-gun ship existed any longer at the time of production (the last one, HMS &quot;Implacable&quot;, was scuttled in 1949), so HMS &quot;Justinian&quot; and HMS &quot;Renown&quot; had to be recreated as models. For the first series a quarter of a 74-gun ship (one exterior side and three open sides to shoot live action on several decks) called the &quot;pontoon&quot; was built. Later live action on the quarterdeck or the gundeck below was shot on the actual HMS &quot;Victory&quot;. Eleven scale models, ranging from 4.5 to 7 m in length, were used for the battle scenes, the largest weighing 1400 kg, and made with working rigging and cannons that were fired by remote control. Shooting locations included the Black Sea, the Livadia Palace, Portugal, and the former administration (Melville) building of the Royal William Yard and the Barbican, Plymouth in England.

==Awards==
* Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries (1999)
* Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or Movie (1999)

==Series continuation==
Ioan Gruffudd had shown interest in participating in more &quot;Hornblower&quot; films. In 2007, he reportedly discussed the possibility of a big-screen version of &quot;Hornblower&quot;, and had been attempting to gain the rights to the books by C. S. Forester.&quot;

<text>Ioan Gruffudd (; ; born 6 October 1973) is a Welsh actor. He is known for his roles in film and television series in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia.

Gruffudd became known for his portrayal of Harold Lowe in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), and as Horatio Hornblower in the &quot;Hornblower&quot; series of television films (1998–2003). His subsequent roles have included Lancelot in &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005) and its 2007 sequel &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, William Wilberforce in &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (2006), Tony Blair in &quot;W.&quot; (2008), and Adam Lockwood in &quot;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&quot; (2024).

==Early life and education==
Gruffudd was born on 6 October 1973 in Aberdare, the eldest of three siblings. His parents, Gillian (née James) and Peter Griffiths (Ioan uses Gruffudd, the more traditional Welsh version of the surname), were both teachers.

His father was headmaster at two Welsh-language comprehensive schools in South Wales, first at Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari (in Llanharry, Rhondda Cynon Taf) then later at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen (in Rhydfelin). Gruffudd was raised in a Nonconformist household.

During his childhood, his family moved to Cardiff. Gruffudd attended three Welsh-medium schools: Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Aberdar (Ynyslwyd; now located in Cwmdare), Ysgol Gymraeg Melin Gruffydd (in Whitchurch, Cardiff), and Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf (in Llandaff North).

He was an accomplished oboist in his teens, achieving a Grade 8 level in the ABRSM music examinations and playing in the South Glamorgan Youth Orchestra for several years, but gave it up once acting took up most of his time. He won prizes for his high baritone singing while at school, including one at the National Eisteddfod. He has said, &quot;As a Welshman, I grew up in a culture of singing and performing with music, and I think it was through this performing that I got my confidence as an actor.&quot;

Gruffudd&#x27;s parents are committed Christians, and in his early 20s he was a member of the London Church of Christ, but his mother later came to London to &quot;sort [his] head out&quot;.

==Career==

Gruffudd started his acting career at the age of 13 in a Welsh television film, &quot;Austin&quot; (1986), and later moved on to the Welsh language soap opera &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; (&quot;People of the Valley&quot;) from 1987 to 1994. He also played football with the &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; football team &quot;Cwmderi FC&quot; alongside co-stars Hywel Emrys, Gwyn Elfyn and Ieuan Rhys. During this time, he was also active on stage, in school performances, and in the 1991 Urdd Eisteddfod production of &quot;Cwlwm&quot;.

In 1992, aged 18, he began attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. However, he was only given small parts in the academy&#x27;s productions, and feeling isolated and directionless, almost dropped out several times. But in 1995, while in his final year, he was cast in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; as George (Jørgen) Tesman, the husband of Hedda, the lead character. This performance led to his being offered the role of Jeremy Poldark in the 1996 TV remake of &quot;Poldark&quot;.

After playing Oscar Wilde&#x27;s lover John Gray in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Wilde&quot; he took a role as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe in James Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;Titanic&quot;. He later landed the role of Horatio Hornblower in &quot;Hornblower&quot;, the Meridian production of the C. S. Forester novels (1998–2003), shown on ITV and A&amp;E. He has said: &quot;It was quite something for an unknown actor to get the lead. So I will always be grateful to Hornblower. ... I would love to play this character through every stage of his life. I think it would be unique to have an actor playing him from the very early days as a midshipman, through till he&#x27;s an Admiral. So, I would love to play this character till he perishes.&quot;

His television work includes playing the character Pip in the BBC TV production of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1999), Lt. John Feeley in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Warriors&quot; (1999) and architect Philip Bosinney in ITV&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (2002). He has starred in the films &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; (2000), &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001) and &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004).

Gruffudd, a native Welsh speaker, was inducted into the &quot;Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain&quot; (the Bardic Order of Great Britain) at the highest rank of Druid in the National Eisteddfod at Meifod, mid-Wales, on 4 August 2003, with the bardic name &quot;Ioan&quot;.
In 2007, he starred in the historical drama &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as William Wilberforce, the British abolitionist, receiving critical acclaim for the role. Gruffudd has also portrayed characters of both Marvel Comics and DC Comics, having appeared as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2005) and &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; (2007), and guest starred as the voice of Mister Miracle in DC&#x27;s &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2005).

In 2008, he appeared in the Julia Roberts-Ryan Reynolds film, &quot;Fireflies in the Garden&quot;. In 2008, he also appeared in &quot;The Secret of Moonacre&quot;. In 2009, he starred alongside Josh Brolin in &quot;W.&quot;, a biopic about the life of US President George W Bush, in which Gruffudd played Tony Blair. In 2011, he played the financier of a cave dive in &quot;Sanctum&quot;.

In July 2008, he featured in a promotional trailer in Welsh for BBC Wales, alongside fellow Welshmen Matthew Rhys and Gethin Jones, publicising BBC coverage of the 2008 National Eisteddfod of Wales in Cardiff. In early 2014, Gruffudd was among the stars of Wales in a short film from the BBC to mark the centenary of the birth of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.

Gruffudd débuted his new male lead of Dr Andrew Earlham, a respected surgeon and widowed father of a teenage son, on 11 September 2017, in ITV&#x27;s new 6-part thriller miniseries, &quot;Liar&quot;. Dr Earlham&#x27;s world—personally and professionally—is torn asunder when his son&#x27;s schoolteacher, Laura Neilson (Joanne Froggatt) accuses him of raping her after their first date, the details of which she cannot remember. &quot;Liar&quot; also began airing in the US on SundanceTV on 25 September 2017.

In 2018, Gruffudd was cast as forensic pathologist Dr. Daniel Harrow in the Australian TV show &quot;Harrow&quot; airing on the ABC. The show is set and filmed in Brisbane and focuses on Gruffudd&#x27;s character Dr. Harrow - a forensic pathologist with a total disregard for authority, and an unfailing empathy for the dead which helps him to solve the most bizarre cases.

<doc id="402013" wikidata="Q489800" url="?curid=402013" title="Lineage (video game)">
<text>Lineage (), also known as Lineage: The Blood Pledge in Western markets, is a medieval fantasy, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in Korea and the United States in 1998 by the South Korean computer game developer NCSoft, based on a Korean comic book series of the same name. It is the first game in the &quot;Lineage&quot; series. It is most popular in Korea and is available in Chinese, Japanese, and English. The game was designed by Jake Song, who had previously designed &quot;&quot;, another MMORPG.

&quot;Lineage&quot; features 2D isometric-overhead graphics similar to those of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and &quot;Diablo II&quot;. &quot;Lineage II: The Chaotic Chronicle&quot;, a &quot;prequel&quot; set 150 years before the time of &quot;Lineage&quot;, was released in 2003. By 2006, the &quot;Lineage&quot; franchise had attracted 43 million players. &quot;Lineage W&quot; and &quot;Throne and Liberty&quot; are sequels set after &quot;Lineage&quot; and will be the last two games in the &quot;Lineage&quot; series.

The North American servers were shut down on June 29, 2011 by NCSoft.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Lineage&quot;″s stat, monster, and item system was originally largely borrowed from &quot;NetHack&quot; with MMO elements added.

Players can choose one of seven character classes: Elf, Dark Elf, Knight, Prince, Magician, Dragon Knight, or Illusionist. Princes are the only class that can lead a blood pledge (which is Lineage&#x27;s term for a guild or clan).

Gameplay is based primarily upon a castle siege system which allows castle owners to set tax rates in neighboring cities and collect taxes on items purchased in stores within those cities. It features classic RPG elements reminiscent of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, such as killing monsters and completing quests for loot and experience points, levels, character attributes (charisma, strength, wisdom, etc.), and alignments (neutral, chaotic or lawful). A character&#x27;s alignment affects how monsters and town guards react to the player&#x27;s character, often turning hostile to chaotic players and attacking on sight.

Player versus player combat (also known as PVP) is extensive in &quot;Lineage&quot;. Players can engage in combat with other player characters at any time as long as they are not in safe zones such as cities. By joining a &quot;bloodpledge&quot; (an association of players similar to a clan in other games) players become eligible to engage in castle sieges or wars between bloodpledges.

==Development==
The title &quot;Lineage&quot; came from a series of comic books with the same title &quot;Lineage&quot; by Shin Il-sook, and the servers of &quot;Lineage&quot; are named after the characters of the comic book. It is a fantasy story where a rightful prince reclaims the throne from the hands of a usurper. When first created, the game closely resembled the original work. As developers have added new features, however, the fictional universes of the two works have gradually diverged.

== Reception ==
NCSoft reported that &quot;Lineage&quot; had at one point more than three million subscribers, most of them in Korea. The magnitude of the number Korean subscribers compared to other countries has sparked a number of theories. A ban on some Japanese imports until 1998 has been cited for delayed growth in its video game console market.

As of April 2008, &quot;Lineage&quot; had a little under 1 million active subscriptions.

In 2011, NC Interactive, the subsidiary of NCSoft in the United States began to shut down the &quot;Lineage&quot; servers (3 at that time) because of poor subscription revenues. Various events were scheduled to take place in the weeks remaining. Players were given free subscriptions to other NCSoft titles of their choice. As of June 2011, &quot;Lineage&quot; has shut down all servers in NA, permanently.

Between the start in 1998 and August 2012, NCSoft had accumulated in sales revenue from &quot;Lineage&quot;. By November 2013, the game made .

==&quot;Lineage M&quot;==
&quot;Lineage M&quot; is a mobile port of &quot;Lineage&quot; developed by NCSoft. It was released in South Korea on June 21, 2017.

===Reception===
By June 2018, the game had generated more than in gross revenue. As of July 2020, it has grossed .

The game attracted controversy in 2021. The game issued a major balance patch in January that offered improved rates for attaining certain in-game abilities and items, but then did a rollback four days later. There were disputes over how refunds were issued; NCSoft did not return real-money purchases made during the four days of the patch, but rather refunded spent in-game currency instead. This essentially forced players - who may have bought in-game currency expecting the higher rates from the new patch - to keep the purchase at the lower rates of the old patch. One player was sued by NCSoft after they spent 160 million Korean won (approximately US$141,000 at 2021 exchange rate) during the period the new patch was live then angrily protested the rollback by obstructing the NCSoft office parking lot with their car.

<text>A wagon train is a group of wagons traveling together. Before the extensive use of military vehicles, baggage trains followed an army with supplies and ammunition.

In the American West, settlers traveling across the plains and mountain passes in covered wagons banded together for mutual assistance. Although wagon trains are associated with the Old West, the Trekboers of South Africa also traveled in caravans of covered wagons.

==In migration==

===Transit, traces, and trails===
Wagon trains followed several trails in the American West, nearly all originating at Independence, Missouri. Perhaps the most famous wagon train trail was the Oregon Trail which had a span of over . Other paths included the Santa Fe Trail, the Chisholm Trail, the California Trail (which split southwestward from the Oregon Trail), the Mormon Trail, and the Old Spanish Trail.

Although &quot;wagon train&quot; suggests a line of wagons, when terrain permitted, wagons would often fan out and travel abreast to minimize the amount of dust blown onto other wagons. Travel by wagon train occurred primarily between the 1840s–1880s, diminishing after completion of the first transcontinental railroad. Some remnants of wagon ruts along the well-traveled trails are still visible today.

===Organization===
Originally, westward movement began in small groups, but well-funded travelers with 100 or more wagons could employ professional wagon masters (or trail masters) and hostlers.

Overland emigrants discovered smaller groups of 20 to 40 wagons were more manageable than larger ones, especially without professional wagon masters. Many operated under democratic principles, creating bylaws and electing a captain. In reality, a captain had limited authority. His role was largely confined to getting everyone moving in the morning and selecting when and where to camp at night.

Membership of wagon trains was generally fluid and wagons frequently joined or left trains depending on the needs and wishes of their owners. An accident or illness, for instance, might force someone to fall behind and wait for the next train, or an emigrant might &quot;whip up&quot; to overtake a forward train after a quarrel. Some might break away to settle in Colorado Territory or other territories along the way.

At night, wagon trains were often formed into a circle or square for shelter from wind or weather, and to corral the emigrants&#x27; animals in the center to prevent them from running away or being stolen by Native Americans. While Native Americans might attempt to raid horses under cover of darkness, they rarely attacked a train. Contrary to popular belief, wagons were seldom circled defensively.

===Modern-day treks===
Today, covered wagon trains are used to give an authentic experience for those desiring to explore the West as it was in the days of the pioneers and other groups traveling before modern vehicles were invented.

==Baggage trains==
The advent of gunpowder warfare meant that an army could no longer rely solely on foraging in the surrounding countryside, and required a regular supply of munitions. In the 18th century, organized commissary and quartermaster departments were developed to centralize delivery of supplies. The delivery took the form of &quot;baggage trains&quot;, large groups of wagons that traveled at the rear of the main army.

==In popular media==
Westward-bound collective treks are reflected in numerous books, films, and television programs about the journeys. Examples include: Emerson Hough&#x27;s 1922 novel and James Cruze&#x27;s silent film based on it, &quot;The Covered Wagon&quot; (1923); Raoul Walsh&#x27;s film &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930); Robert North Bradbury&#x27;s film &quot;Westward Ho&quot; (1935); John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Master&quot; (1950) and the television series it inspired, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957–1965); William A. Wellman&#x27;s film, &quot;Westward the Women&quot; (1951); A. B. Guthrie Jr.&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;The Way West&quot; and Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s 1967 film based on it; and the &quot;Wagons West&quot; series of 24 novels written by Noel Gerson (under the pseudonym Dana Fuller Ross) between 1979 and 1989.

<text>A multistage rocket or step rocket is a launch vehicle that uses two or more rocket &quot;stages&quot;, each of which contains its own engines and propellant. A &quot;tandem&quot; or &quot;serial&quot; stage is mounted on top of another stage; a &quot;parallel&quot; stage is attached alongside another stage. The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Two-stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched.

By jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant, the mass of the remaining rocket is decreased. Each successive stage can also be optimized for its specific operating conditions, such as decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. This &quot;staging&quot; allows the thrust of the remaining stages to more easily accelerate the rocket to its final velocity and height.

In serial or tandem staging schemes, the first stage is at the bottom and is usually the largest, the second stage and subsequent upper stages are above it, usually decreasing in size. In parallel staging schemes solid or liquid rocket boosters are used to assist with launch. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;stage 0&quot;. In the typical case, the first-stage and booster engines fire to propel the entire rocket upwards. When the boosters run out of fuel, they are detached from the rest of the rocket (usually with some kind of small explosive charge or explosive bolts) and fall away. The first stage then burns to completion and falls off. This leaves a smaller rocket, with the second stage on the bottom, which then fires. Known in rocketry circles as staging, this process is repeated until the desired final velocity is achieved. In some cases with serial staging, the upper stage ignites &quot;before&quot; the separation—the interstage ring is designed with this in mind, and the thrust is used to help positively separate the two vehicles.

Only multistage rockets have reached orbital speed. Single-stage-to-orbit designs are sought, but have not yet been demonstrated.

==Performance==


Multi-stage rockets overcome a limitation imposed by the laws of physics on the velocity change achievable by a rocket stage. The limit depends on the fueled-to-dry mass ratio and on the effective exhaust velocity of the engine. This relation is given by the classical rocket equation:
:formula_1 
where:
:formula_2 is delta-v of the vehicle (change of velocity plus losses due to gravity and atmospheric drag);
:formula_3 is the initial total (wet) mass, equal to final (dry) mass plus propellant; 
:formula_4 is the final (dry) mass, after the propellant is expended; 
:formula_5 is the effective exhaust velocity (determined by propellant, engine design and throttle condition);
:formula_6 is the natural logarithm function.

The delta v required to reach low Earth orbit (or the required velocity of a sufficiently heavy suborbital payload) requires a wet to dry mass ratio larger than has been achieved in a single rocket stage. The multistage rocket overcomes this limit by splitting the delta-v into fractions. As each lower stage drops off and the succeeding stage fires, the rest of the rocket is still traveling near the burnout speed. Each lower stage&#x27;s dry mass includes the propellant in the upper stages, and each succeeding upper stage has reduced its dry mass by discarding the useless dry mass of the spent lower stages.

A further advantage is that each stage can use a different type of rocket engine, each tuned for its particular operating conditions. Thus the lower-stage engines are designed for use at atmospheric pressure, while the upper stages can use engines suited to near vacuum conditions. Lower stages tend to require more structure than upper as they need to bear their own weight plus that of the stages above them. Optimizing the structure of each stage decreases the weight of the total vehicle and provides further advantage.

The advantage of staging comes at the cost of the lower stages lifting engines which are not yet being used, as well as making the entire rocket more complex and harder to build than a single stage. In addition, each staging event is a possible point of launch failure, due to separation failure, ignition failure, or stage collision. Nevertheless, the savings are so great that every rocket ever used to deliver a payload into orbit has had staging of some sort.

One of the most common measures of rocket efficiency is its specific impulse, which is defined as the thrust per flow rate (per second) of propellant consumption:
: formula_7 = formula_8

When rearranging the equation such that thrust is calculated as a result of the other factors, we have:
: formula_9

These equations show that a higher specific impulse means a more efficient rocket engine, capable of burning for longer periods of time. In terms of staging, the initial rocket stages usually have a lower specific impulse rating, trading efficiency for superior thrust in order to quickly push the rocket into higher altitudes. Later stages of the rocket usually have a higher specific impulse rating because the vehicle is further outside the atmosphere and the exhaust gas does not need to expand against as much atmospheric pressure.

When selecting the ideal rocket engine to use as an initial stage for a launch vehicle, a useful performance metric to examine is the thrust-to-weight ratio, and is calculated by the equation:
: formula_10

The common thrust-to-weight ratio of a launch vehicle is within the range of 1.3 to 2.0.
Another performance metric to keep in mind when designing each rocket stage in a mission is the burn time, which is the amount of time the rocket engine will last before it has exhausted all of its propellant. For most non-final stages, thrust and specific impulse can be assumed constant, which allows the equation for burn time to be written as:
: formula_11

Where formula_12 and formula_13 are the initial and final masses of the rocket stage respectively. In conjunction with the burnout time, the burnout height and velocity are obtained using the same values, and are found by these two equations:
: formula_14
: formula_15

When dealing with the problem of calculating the total burnout velocity or time for the entire rocket system, the general procedure for doing so is as follows:
# Partition the problem calculations into however many stages the rocket system comprises.
# Calculate the initial and final mass for each individual stage.
# Calculate the burnout velocity, and sum it with the initial velocity for each individual stage. Assuming each stage occurs immediately after the previous, the burnout velocity becomes the initial velocity for the following stage.
# Repeat the previous two steps until the burnout time and/or velocity has been calculated for the final stage.
The burnout time does not define the end of the rocket stage&#x27;s motion, as the vehicle will still have a velocity that will allow it to coast upward for a brief amount of time until the acceleration of the planet&#x27;s gravity gradually changes it to a downward direction. The velocity and altitude of the rocket after burnout can be easily modeled using the basic physics equations of motion.

When comparing one rocket with another, it is impractical to directly compare the rocket&#x27;s certain trait with the same trait of another because their individual attributes are often not independent of one another. For this reason, dimensionless ratios have been designed to enable a more meaningful comparison between rockets. The first is the initial to final mass ratio, which is the ratio between the rocket stage&#x27;s full initial mass and the rocket stage&#x27;s final mass once all of its fuel has been consumed. The equation for this ratio is:
: formula_16

Where formula_17 is the empty mass of the stage, formula_18 is the mass of the propellant, and formula_19 is the mass of the payload. 
The second dimensionless performance quantity is the structural ratio, which is the ratio between the empty mass of the stage, and the combined empty mass and propellant mass as shown in this equation:
: formula_20

The last major dimensionless performance quantity is the payload ratio, which is the ratio between the payload mass and the combined mass of the empty rocket stage and the propellant:
: formula_21

After comparing the three equations for the dimensionless quantities, it is easy to see that they are not independent of each other, and in fact, the initial to final mass ratio can be rewritten in terms of structural ratio and payload ratio:
: formula_22

These performance ratios can also be used as references for how efficient a rocket system will be when performing optimizations and comparing varying configurations for a mission.

==Component selection and sizing==

For initial sizing, the rocket equations can be used to derive the amount of propellant needed for the rocket based on the specific impulse of the engine and the total impulse required in N·s. The equation is:
: formula_23

where g is the gravity constant of Earth. This also enables the volume of storage required for the fuel to be calculated if the density of the fuel is known, which is almost always the case when designing the rocket stage. The volume is yielded when dividing the mass of the propellant by its density. Asides from the fuel required, the mass of the rocket structure itself must also be determined, which requires taking into account the mass of the required thrusters, electronics, instruments, power equipment, etc. These are known quantities for typical off the shelf hardware that should be considered in the mid to late stages of the design, but for preliminary and conceptual design, a simpler approach can be taken. Assuming one engine for a rocket stage provides all of the total impulse for that particular segment, a mass fraction can be used to determine the mass of the system. The mass of the stage transfer hardware such as initiators and safe-and-arm devices are very small by comparison and can be considered negligible.

For modern day solid rocket motors, it is a safe and reasonable assumption to say that 91 to 94 percent of the total mass is fuel. It is also important to note there is a small percentage of &quot;residual&quot; propellant that will be left stuck and unusable inside the tank, and should also be taken into consideration when determining amount of fuel for the rocket. A common initial estimate for this residual propellant is five percent. With this ratio and the mass of the propellant calculated, the mass of the empty rocket weight can be determined. 
Sizing rockets using a liquid bipropellant requires a slightly more involved approach because there are two separate tanks that are required: one for the fuel, and one for the oxidizer. The ratio of these two quantities is known as the mixture ratio, and is defined by the equation:
: formula_24

Where formula_25 is the mass of the oxidizer and formula_26 is the mass of the fuel. This mixture ratio not only governs the size of each tank, but also the specific impulse of the rocket. Determining the ideal mixture ratio is a balance of compromises between various aspects of the rocket being designed, and can vary depending on the type of fuel and oxidizer combination being used. For example, a mixture ratio of a bipropellant could be adjusted such that it may not have the optimal specific impulse, but will result in fuel tanks of equal size. This would yield simpler and cheaper manufacturing, packing, configuring, and integrating of the fuel systems with the rest of the rocket, and can become a benefit that could outweigh the drawbacks of a less efficient specific impulse rating. But suppose the defining constraint for the launch system is volume, and a low density fuel is required such as hydrogen. This example would be solved by using an oxidizer-rich mixture ratio, reducing efficiency and specific impulse rating, but will meet a smaller tank volume requirement.

==Optimal staging and restricted staging==

===Optimal===
The ultimate goal of optimal staging is to maximize the payload ratio (see ratios under performance), meaning the largest amount of payload is carried up to the required burnout velocity using the least amount of non-payload mass, which comprises everything else. This goal assumes that the cost of a rocket launch is proportional to the total liftoff mass of the rocket, which is a rule of thumb in rocket engineering. Here are a few quick rules and guidelines to follow in order to reach optimal staging:
# Initial stages should have lower formula_27, and later/final stages should have higher formula_27. 
# The stages with the lower formula_27 should contribute less ΔV. 
# The next stage is always a smaller size than the previous stage. 
# Similar stages should provide similar ΔV.
The payload ratio can be calculated for each individual stage, and when multiplied together in sequence, will yield the overall payload ratio of the entire system. It is important to note that when computing payload ratio for individual stages, the payload includes the mass of all the stages after the current one. The overall payload ratio is:
: formula_30

Where n is the number of stages the rocket system comprises. Similar stages yielding the same payload ratio simplify this equation, however that is seldom the ideal solution for maximizing payload ratio, and ΔV requirements may have to be partitioned unevenly as suggested in guideline tips 1 and 2 from above. Two common methods of determining this perfect ΔV partition between stages are either a technical algorithm that generates an analytical solution that can be implemented by a program, or simple trial and error. For the trial and error approach, it is best to begin with the final stage, calculating the initial mass which becomes the payload for the previous stage. From there it is easy to progress all the way down to the initial stage in the same manner, sizing all the stages of the rocket system.

===Restricted===
Restricted rocket staging is based on the simplified assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific impulse, structural ratio, and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage. Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage. This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design. 
One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system. Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and structural ratios constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages. However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment. The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number. In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.
== Hot-staging ==
Hot-staging is a type of rocket staging in which the next stage fires its engines before separation instead of after. During hot-staging, the earlier stage throttles down its engines. Hot-staging may reduce the complexity of stage separation, and gives a small extra payload capacity to the booster. It also eliminates the need for ullage motors, as the acceleration from the nearly spent stage keeps the propellants settled at the bottom of the tanks. Hot-staging is used on Soviet-era Russian rockets such as Soyuz and Proton-M. The N1 rocket was designed to use hot staging, however none of the test flights lasted long enough for this to occur. Starting with the Titan II, the Titan family of rockets used hot staging. SpaceX retrofitted their Starship rocket to use hot staging after its first flight, making it the largest rocket ever to do so, as well as the first reusable vehicle to utilize hot staging.

==Tandem vs parallel staging design==
A rocket system that implements tandem staging means that each individual stage runs in order one after the other. The rocket breaks free from the previous stage, then begins burning through the next stage in straight succession. On the other hand, a rocket that implements parallel staging has two or more different stages that are active at the same time. For example, the Space Shuttle has two Solid Rocket Boosters that burn simultaneously. Upon launch, the boosters ignite, and at the end of the stage, the two boosters are discarded while the external fuel tank is kept for another stage. 
Most quantitative approaches to the design of the rocket system&#x27;s performance are focused on tandem staging, but the approach can be easily modified to include parallel staging. To begin with, the different stages of the rocket should be clearly defined. Continuing with the previous example, the end of the first stage which is sometimes referred to as &#x27;stage 0&#x27;, can be defined as when the side boosters separate from the main rocket. From there, the final mass of stage one can be considered the sum of the empty mass of stage one, the mass of stage two (the main rocket and the remaining unburned fuel) and the mass of the payload.

==Upper stages==
High-altitude and space-bound upper stages are designed to operate with little or no atmospheric pressure. This allows the use of lower pressure combustion chambers and engine nozzles with optimal vacuum expansion ratios. Some upper stages, especially those using hypergolic propellants like Delta-K or Ariane 5 ES second stage, are pressure fed, which eliminates the need for complex turbopumps. Other upper stages, such as the Centaur or DCSS, use liquid hydrogen expander cycle engines, or gas generator cycle engines like the Ariane 5 ECA&#x27;s HM7B or the S-IVB&#x27;s J-2. These stages are usually tasked with completing orbital injection and accelerating payloads into higher energy orbits such as GTO or to escape velocity. Upper stages, such as Fregat, used primarily to bring payloads from low Earth orbit to GTO or beyond are sometimes referred to as space tugs.

==Assembly==

Each individual stage is generally assembled at its manufacturing site and shipped to the launch site; the term &quot;vehicle assembly&quot; refers to the mating of all rocket stage(s) and the spacecraft payload into a single assembly known as a space vehicle. Single-stage vehicles (suborbital), and multistage vehicles on the smaller end of the size range, can usually be assembled directly on the launch pad by lifting the stage(s) and spacecraft vertically in place by means of a crane.

This is generally not practical for larger space vehicles, which are assembled off the pad and moved into place on the launch site by various methods. NASA&#x27;s Apollo/Saturn V crewed Moon landing vehicle, and Space Shuttle, were assembled vertically onto mobile launcher platforms with attached launch umbilical towers, in a Vehicle Assembly Building, and then a special crawler-transporter moved the entire vehicle stack to the launch pad in an upright position. In contrast, vehicles such as the Russian Soyuz rocket and the SpaceX Falcon 9 are assembled horizontally in a processing hangar, transported horizontally, and then brought upright at the pad.

==Passivation and space debris==
Spent upper stages of launch vehicles are a significant source of space debris remaining in orbit in a non-operational state for many years after use, and occasionally, large debris fields created from the breakup of a single upper stage while in orbit.

After the 1990s, spent upper stages are generally passivated after their use as a launch vehicle is complete in order to minimize risks while the stage remains derelict in orbit. Passivation means removing any sources of stored energy remaining on the vehicle, as by dumping fuel or discharging batteries.

Many early upper stages, in both the Soviet and U.S. space programs, were not passivated after mission completion. During the initial attempts to characterize the space debris problem, it became evident that a good proportion of all debris was due to the breaking up of rocket upper stages, particularly unpassivated upper-stage propulsion units.

==History and development==
An illustration and description in the 14th century Chinese &quot;Huolongjing&quot; by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen shows the oldest known multistage rocket; this was the &quot;fire-dragon issuing from the water&quot; (火龙出水, huǒ lóng chū shuǐ), which was used mostly by the Chinese navy. It was a two-stage rocket that had booster rockets that would eventually burn out, yet, before they did so, automatically ignited a number of smaller rocket arrows that were shot out of the front end of the missile, which was shaped like a dragon&#x27;s head with an open mouth. The British scientist and historian Joseph Needham points out that the written material and depicted illustration of this rocket come from the oldest stratum of the &quot;Huolongjing&quot;, which can be dated roughly 1300–1350 AD (from the book&#x27;s part 1, chapter 3, page 23).

Another example of an early multistaged rocket is the &quot;Juhwa (走火)&quot; of Korean development. It was proposed by medieval Korean engineer, scientist and inventor Ch&#x27;oe Mu-sŏn and developed by the Firearms Bureau (火㷁道監) during the 14th century. The rocket had the length of 15 cm and 13 cm; the diameter was 2.2 cm. It was attached to an arrow 110 cm long; experimental records show that the first results were around 200m in range. There are records that show Korea kept developing this technology until it came to produce the Singijeon, or &#x27;magical machine arrows&#x27; in the 16th century. 
The earliest experiments with multistage rockets in Europe were made in 1551 by Austrian Conrad Haas (1509–1576), the arsenal master of the town of Hermannstadt, Transylvania (now Sibiu/Hermannstadt, Romania). This concept was developed independently by at least five individuals:
*Polish–Lithuanian Kazimieras Simonavičius (1600–1651)
*Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935)
*American Robert Goddard (1882–1945)
*German Hermann Oberth (1894–1989)
*French (1889–1969)

The first high-speed multistage rockets were the RTV-G-4 Bumper rockets tested at the White Sands Proving Ground and later at Cape Canaveral from 1948 to 1950. These consisted of a V-2 rocket and a WAC Corporal sounding rocket. The greatest altitude ever reached was 393 km, attained on February 24, 1949, at White Sands.

In 1947, the Soviet rocket engineer and scientist Mikhail Tikhonravov developed a theory of parallel stages, which he called &quot;packet rockets&quot;. In his scheme, three parallel stages were fired from liftoff, but all three engines were fueled from the outer two stages, until they are empty and could be ejected. This is more efficient than sequential staging, because the second-stage engine is never just dead weight. In 1951, Soviet engineer and scientist Dmitry Okhotsimsky carried out a pioneering engineering study of general sequential and parallel staging, with and without the pumping of fuel between stages. The design of the R-7 Semyorka emerged from that study. The trio of rocket engines used in the first stage of the American Atlas I and Atlas II launch vehicles, arranged in a row, used parallel staging in a similar way: the outer pair of booster engines existed as a jettisonable pair which would, after they shut down, drop away with the lowermost outer skirt structure, leaving the central sustainer engine to complete the first stage&#x27;s engine burn towards apogee or orbit.

==Separation events==
Separation of each portion of a multistage rocket introduces additional risk into the success of the launch mission. Reducing the number of separation events results in a reduction in complexity. 
Separation events occur when stages or strap-on boosters separate after use, when the payload fairing separates prior to orbital insertion, or when used, a launch escape system which separates after the early phase of a launch. Pyrotechnic fasteners, or in some cases pneumatic systems like on the Falcon 9 Full Thrust, are typically used to separate rocket stages.

==Two-stage-to-orbit==
A two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) or two-stage rocket launch vehicle is a spacecraft in which two distinct stages provide propulsion consecutively in order to achieve orbital velocity. It is intermediate between a three-stage-to-orbit launcher and a hypothetical single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launcher.

==Three-stage-to-orbit==

The &quot;three-stage-to-orbit&quot; launch system is a commonly used rocket system to attain Earth orbit. The spacecraft uses three distinct stages to provide propulsion consecutively in order to achieve orbital velocity. It is intermediate between a four-stage-to-orbit launcher and a two-stage-to-orbit launcher.

===Examples of three-stage-to-orbit systems===
* Saturn V
* Vanguard
* Ariane 4 (optional boosters)
* Ariane 2
* Ariane 1 (four stages)
* GSLV (three stages and boosters)
* PSLV (four stages)
* Proton (optional fourth stage)
* &quot;Long March 5 (optional boosters and optional third stage)&quot;
* Long March 1, Long March 1D
* Zenit-3SL
* Unha-3
* KSLV-2 &quot;Nuri&quot;

===Examples of two stages with boosters===
Other designs (in fact, most modern medium- to heavy-lift designs) do not have all three stages inline on the main stack, instead having strap-on boosters for the &quot;stage-0&quot; with two core stages. In these designs, the boosters and first stage fire simultaneously instead of consecutively, providing extra initial thrust to lift the full launcher weight and overcome gravity losses and atmospheric drag. The boosters are jettisoned a few minutes into flight to reduce weight.

* US Space Shuttle — SRB first stage ; External Tank + SSME second stage ; OMS on internal tanks third stage ; 
* Angara A5
* Ariane 5
* Atlas V 551
* Delta II third stage)
* Delta III
* Delta IV-Medium+ and -Heavy
* Falcon Heavy
* Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III (However, like the Titan IIIC, the GSLV MkIII is launched solely by the side boosters. The main core only ignites a few minutes into flight, shortly before the boosters are jettisoned.)
* H-IIA, H-IIB
* Soyuz
* Space Launch System
* Titan IV
* Long March 2E, Long March 2F, Long March 3B

==Four-stage-to-orbit==
The &quot;four-stage-to-orbit&quot; launch system is a rocket system used to attain Earth orbit. The spacecraft uses four distinct stages to provide propulsion consecutively in order to achieve orbital velocity. It is intermediate between a five-stage-to-orbit launcher and a three-stage-to-orbit launcher, most often used with solid-propellant launch systems.

===Examples of four-stage-to-orbit systems===
* Ariane 1
* PSLV
* Minotaur IV
* Proton (optional fourth stage)
* Minotaur V (five stages)
* ASLV (five stages)

===Examples of three stages with boosters===
Other designs do not have all four stages inline on the main stack, instead having strap-on boosters for the &quot;stage-0&quot; with three core stages. In these designs, the boosters and first stage fire simultaneously instead of consecutively, providing extra initial thrust to lift the full launcher weight and overcome gravity losses and atmospheric drag. The boosters are jettisoned a few minutes into flight to reduce weight.

* &quot;Long March 5 (optional boosters and optional third stage)&quot;

<text>The Cagots () were a persecuted minority who lived in the west of France and northern Spain: the Navarrese Pyrenees, Basque provinces, Béarn, Aragón, Gascony and Brittany. Evidence of the group exists as far back as 1000 CE. The name they were known by varied across the regions where they lived.

The origins of the Cagots remain uncertain, with various hypotheses proposed throughout history. Some theories suggest they were descendants of biblical or legendary figures cursed of God, or the descendants of medieval lepers, while others propose they were related to the Cathars or even a fallen guild of carpenters. Some suggest descent from a variety of other marginalized racial or religious groups. Despite the varied and often mythical explanations for their origins, the only consistent aspect of the Cagots was their societal exclusion and the lack of any distinct physical or cultural traits differentiating them from the general population.

The discriminatory treatment they faced included social segregation and restrictions on marriage and occupation. Despite laws and edicts from higher levels of government and religious authorities, this discrimination persisted into the 20th century.

== Name ==

=== Etymology ===

The origins of both the term (and , , , etc.) and the Cagots themselves are uncertain.
It has been suggested that they were descendants of the Visigoths
defeated by Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé,
and that the name derives from (&quot;dog&quot;) and the Old Occitan for Goth around the 6th century.
Yet in opposition to this etymology is the fact that the word is first found in this form in 1542 in the works of François Rabelais.
Seventeenth century French historian Pierre de Marca, in his , propounds the reverse – that the word signifies &quot;hunters of the Goths&quot;, and that the Cagots were descendants of the Saracens and Moors of Al-Andalus (or even Jews) after their defeat by Charles Martel,
although this proposal was comprehensively refuted by the Prior of Livorno, Abbot as early as 1754.
Antoine Court de Gébelin derives the term cagot from the Latin , meaning &quot;false, bad, deceitful&quot;, and meaning &quot;god&quot;, due to a belief that Cagots were descended from the Alans and followed Arianism.

=== Variations ===

Their name differed by province and the local language:

* In Gascony they were called , and 
* In Bordeaux they were called , or 
* In the Spanish Basque country they were called , and 
* In the French Basque Country the forms and were also used.
* In Anjou, Languedoc, and Armagnac they were called , and (&quot;marsh people&quot;)
* In Brittany they were called , (possibly from the Breton word meaning leprous), and . They were also sometimes referred to as , , , , and , names of the local Caquins of Brittany due to similar low stature and discrimination in society.
* In Bigorre they were also called and 
* In Aunis, Poitou, and Saintonge they were also called , a name taken from the former class of .
* , or referencing Gehazi the servant of Elisha who was cursed with leprosy due to his greed. With the recording as an insult regularly used against Cagots. is seen in the writings of Dominique Joseph Garat. Elizabeth Gaskell records the anglicised &quot;Gehazites&quot; in her work &quot;An Accursed Race&quot;.
* Other recorded names include , , , , , and (most likely from the Old French meaning leper).

Previously some of these names had been viewed as being similar yet separate groups from the Cagots.

== Origin ==

The origin of the Cagots is not known for certain, though through history many legends and hypotheses have been recorded providing potential origins and reasons for their ostracisation. The Cagots were not a distinct ethnic or religious group, but a racialised caste. They spoke the same language as the people in an area and generally kept the same religion as well, with later researchers remarking that there was no evidence to mark the Cagots as distinct from their neighbours. Their only distinguishing feature was their descent from families long identified as Cagots.

=== Biblical legends ===

Various legends placed the Cagots as originating from biblical events, including being descendants of the carpenters who made the cross that Jesus was crucified on, or being descendants of the bricklayers who built Solomon&#x27;s Temple after being expelled from ancient Israel by God due to poor craftsmanship. Similarly a more detailed legend places the origins of the Cagots in Spain as being descendants of a Pyrenean master carver named Jacques, who traveled to ancient Israel via Tartessos, to cast Boaz and Jachin for Solomon&#x27;s Temple. While in Israel he was distracted during the casting of Jachin by a woman, and due to the imperfection this caused in the column his descendants were cursed to suffer leprosy.

=== Religious origin ===

Another theory is that the Cagots were descendants of the Cathars, who had been persecuted for heresy in the Albigensian Crusade. With some comparisons including the use of the term to refer to Cagots, which evokes the name that the Cathars gave to themselves, . A delegation by Cagots to Pope Leo X in 1514 made this claim, though the Cagots predate the Cathar heresy and the Cathar heresy was not present in Gascony and other regions where Cagots were present. The historian Daniel Hawkins suggests that perhaps this was a strategic move, as in the statutes such discrimination and persecution for those convicted of heresy expired after four generations and if this was the cause of their marginalisation, it also gave grounds for their emancipation. Others have suggested an origin as Arian Christians.

One of the earliest recorded mentions of Cagotes is in the charters of Navarre, developed around 1070. Another early mention of the Cagots is from 1288, when they appear to have been called or . Other terms seen in use prior to the 16th century include , , and , which in medieval texts became inseparable from the term , and so in Béarn became synonymous with the word leper. Thus, another theory is that the Cagots were early converts to Christianity, and that the hatred of their pagan neighbors continued after they also converted, merely for different reasons.

=== Medical origin ===

Another possible explanation of their name or is to be found in the fact that in medieval times all lepers were known as , and that, whether Visigoths or not, these Cagots were affected in the Middle Ages with a particular form of leprosy or a condition resembling it, such as psoriasis. Thus would arise the confusion between Christians and Cretins, and explain the similar restrictions placed on lepers and Cagots. Guy de Chauliac wrote in the 14th century, and Ambroise Paré wrote in 1561 of the Cagots being lepers with &quot;beautiful faces&quot; and skin with no signs of leprosy, describing them as &quot;white lepers&quot; (people afflicted with &quot;white leprosy&quot;). Later dermatologists believe that Paré was describing leucoderma. Early edicts apparently refer to lepers and Cagots as different categories of undesirables, With this distinction being explicit by 1593. The Parlement of Bordeaux and the Estates of Lower Navarre repeated customary prohibitions against them, with Bordeaux adding that when they were also lepers, if there still are any, they must carry (rattles). One belief in Navarre were that the were descendants of French immigrant lepers to the region. Later English commentators supported the idea of an origin among a community of lepers due to the similarities in the treatment of Cagots in churches and the measures taken to allow lepers in England and Scotland to attend churches.

In the 1940s to 1950s blood type analysis was performed on the Cagots of in Navarre. The blood type distribution showed more similarity with those observed in France among the French than those observed among the Basque. Pilar Hors uses this as support for the theory that the Cagots in Spain are descendants of French migrants, most likely from leper colonies.

=== Other origins ===

 wrote that the Cagots were likely descendants of Spanish Roma from the Basque country.

In Bordeaux, where they were numerous, they were called . This name has the same form as the Old French word , meaning leper (ultimately derived from Latin ). It also has the same form as the Gascon word for thief (ultimately derived from Latin , and cognate to the Catalan and the Spanish meaning robber or looter), which is similar in meaning to the older, probably Celtic-origin Latin term (or bagad), a possible origin of .

The alleged physical appearance and ethnicity of the Cagots varied wildly between legends and stories; some local legends (especially those that held to the leper theory) indicated that Cagots had blonde hair and blue eyes, while those favouring the Arab descent story said that Cagots were considerably darker. In Pío Baroja&#x27;s work , he comments that Cagot residents of had both individuals with &quot;Germanic&quot; features as well as individuals with &quot;Romani&quot; features, this is also supported by others who investigated the Cagots in the Basque Country, such as who stated the &quot;ethnic type&quot; and names of Cagots were the same as the Basque within Navarre. Though people who set out to research the Cagots found them to be a diverse class of people in physical appearance, as diverse as the non-Cagot communities around them. One common trend was to claim that Cagots had no ears or no earlobes, or that one ear was longer than the other, with other supposed identifiers including webbed hands and/or feet, or the presence of goitres.

Graham Robb finds most of the above theories unlikely:

A modern hypothesis of interest is that the Cagots are the descendants of a fallen medieval guild of carpenters. This hypothesis would explain the most salient thing Cagots throughout France and Spain have in common: that is, being restricted in their choice of trade. The red webbed-foot symbol Cagots were sometimes forced to wear might have been the guild&#x27;s original emblem, according to the hypothesis. There was a brief construction boom on the Way of St. James pilgrimage route in the 9th and 10th centuries; this could have brought the guild both power and suspicion. The collapse of their business would have left a scattered, yet cohesive group in the areas where Cagots are known.

Robb&#x27;s guild hypothesis, alongside much of the work in his &quot;The Discovery of France&quot;, has been heavily criticised for &quot;[failing] to understand most of the secondary works in his own bibliography&quot; and being a &quot;recycling of nineteenth-century myths&quot;.

For similar reasons due to their restricted trades, Delacampagne suggests a possible origin as a culturally distinct community of woodsmen who were Christianised relatively late.

== Geography ==

=== Distribution ===

The cagots were present in France in Gascony to the Basque Country, but also in the north of Spain (in Aragon, south and north Navarre, and Asturias).

Cagots were typically required to live in separate quarters, these hamlets were called then from the 16th century , which were often on the far outskirts of the villages. On the scale of Béarn, for example, the distribution of Cagots, often carpenters, was similar to that of other craftsmen, who were numerous mainly in the piedmont. Far from congregating in only a few places, the Cagots were scattered in over 137 villages and towns. Outside the mountains, 35 to 40% of communities had Cagots, especially the largest ones, excluding very small villages. The buildings making up the are still present in many villages.

=== Toponomy ===

Toponymy and topography indicate that the places where the cagots were found have constant characteristics; these are gaps, generally across rivers or outside town walls, called &quot; (and derivatives) or &quot; (Laplace names are frequent) next to water points, places allocated to live and above all to practice their trades.

Toponymy also provides evidence of areas where Cagots had lived in the past. Various Street names are still in use such as in the municipalities of Montgaillard and Lourdes, in Laurède, in Roquefort, in Saint-Girons, and in the municipalities of Mézin, Sos, Vic-Fezensac, Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour, Eauze, and Gondrin.

In Aubiet, there is a locality called &quot;&quot;. It was in this hamlet, that the cagots () of Aubiet lived, on the left bank of the Arrats, separated from the village by the river. In this last example, the discovery of the name of the place allowed teachers to discover the local history of the Cagots and to start educational work. Until the beginning of the 20th century, several districts of Cagots still bore the name of (&quot;Carpenter&quot;).

== Treatment ==

Cagots were shunned and hated; while restrictions varied by time and place, with many discriminatory actions being codified into law in France in 1460, they were typically required to live in separate quarters. Cagots were excluded from various political and social rights.

=== Religious treatment ===

While Cagots followed the same religion as the non-Cagots who lived around them, they were subject to variety of discriminatory practices in religious rites and buildings, this included being forced to use a side entrance to churches, often an intentionally low one to force Cagots to bow and remind them of their subservient status. This practice, done for cultural rather than religious reasons, did not change even between Catholic and Huguenot areas, as shown by historian Raymond A. Mentzer, who records how even when Cagots converted from Catholicism to Calvinism they were still subject to the same discriminatory practices, including in religious rites and rituals. Cagots were expected to slip into churches quietly and congregate in the worst seats. They had their own holy water fonts set aside for Cagots, and touching the normal font was strictly forbidden. These restrictions were taken seriously; with one story collected by Elizabeth Gaskell explaining the origin of the skeleton of a hand nailed to the church door in Quimperlé, Brittany, where in the 18th century, a wealthy Cagot had his hand cut off and nailed to the church door for daring to touch the font reserved for &quot;clean&quot; citizens.

=== Treatment by governments ===

Cagots were not allowed to marry non-Cagots leading to forced endogamy, though in some areas in the later centuries (such as Béarn) they were able to marry non-Cagots though the non-Cagot would then be classed as a Cagot. They were not allowed to enter taverns or use public fountains. The marginalization of the Cagots began at baptism where chimes were not rung in celebration as was the case for non-Cagots and that the baptisms were held at nightfall. Within parish registries the term , or its scholarly synonym , was entered. Cagots were buried in cemeteries separate from non-Cagots with reports of riots occurring if bishops tried to have the bodies moved to non-Cagot cemeteries. Commonly Cagots were not given a standard last name in registries and records but were only listed by their first name, followed by the mention &quot; or &quot;, such as on their baptismal certificate, They were allowed to enter a church only by a special door and, during the service, a rail separated them from the other worshippers. They were forbidden from joining the priesthood. Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament, or the Eucharist was given to them on the end of a wooden spoon, while a holy water stoup was reserved for their exclusive use. They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress to which, in some places, was attached the foot of a goose or duck (whence they were sometimes called ), and latterly to have a red representation of a goose&#x27;s foot in fabric sewn onto their clothes. Whilst in Navarre a court ruling in 1623 required all Cagots to wear cloaks with a yellow trim to identify them as Cagots.

In Spanish territories Cagots were subject to the statutes (cleanliness of blood). These statutes established the legal discrimination, restriction of rights, and restriction of privileges of the descendants of Muslims, Jews, Romani, and Cagots.

=== Work ===

Cagots were prohibited from selling food or wine, touching food in the market, working with livestock, or entering mills. The Cagots were often restricted to craft trades including those of carpenter, masons, woodcutters, wood carvers, coopers, butcher, and rope-maker. They were also often employed as musicians in Navarre. Cagots who were involved in masonry and carpentry were often contracted to construct major public buildings, such as churches, an example being the . Due to association with woodworking crafts, Cagots often worked as the operators of instruments of torture and execution, as well as making the instruments themselves. Such professions may have perpetuated their social ostracisation.

Cagot women were often midwives until the 15th century. Due to social exclusion, in France the Cagots were exempt from taxation until the 18th century. By the 19th century these restrictions seem to have been lifted, but the trades continued to be practiced by Cagots, along with other trades such as weaving and blacksmithing. Because the main identifying mark of the Cagots was the restriction of their trades to a few small options, their segregation has been compared to the caste system in India, with the Cagots being compared to the Dalits.

=== Accusations and pseudo-medical beliefs ===

Few consistent reasons were given as to why Cagots were hated; accusations varied from them being cretins, lepers, heretics, cannibals, sorcerers, werewolves, sexual deviants, to actions they were accused of such as poisoning wells, or for simply being intrinsically evil. They were viewed as untouchables, with noting how it was believed that they could cause children to fall ill by touching them or even just looking at them, being considered so pestilential that it was a crime for them to walk common roads barefooted or to drink from the same cup as non-Cagots. It was also a common belief that the Cagots gave off a foul smell. recorded that many believed Cagots were born with a tail. Many Bretons believed that Cagots bled from their navel on Good Friday.

The French early psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol wrote in his 1838 works that the Cagots were a subset of &quot;idiot&quot;, and separate from &quot;cretins&quot;. By the middle of the 19th century, previous pseudo-medical beliefs and beliefs of them being intellectually inferior had waned and German doctors, by 1849, regarded them as “not without the ability to become useful members of society.” Though various French and British doctors were continuing to label the Cagots as a race inherently afflicted with congenital disabilities to the end of the 19th century. Daniel Tuke wrote in 1880 after visiting communities where Cagots lived, noted how local people would not subject &quot;cretins&quot; born to non-Cagots to living with Cagots.

The Cagots did have a culture of their own, but very little of it was written down or preserved; as a result, almost everything that is known about them relates to their persecution. The repression lasted through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Industrial Revolution, with the prejudice fading only in the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== &quot;Cagot&quot; as pejorative ===

Philosopher highlights how even from as far back as the work of François Rabelais in the 16th century, the term was used as a synonym for people viewed as deceitful and hypocritical. In contemporary language the term has been further separated from it being the name of a distinct caste of people to being a pejorative term for any person who is &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;shameful&quot;. Similar transformations have occurred with the Spanish equivalent name .

== Cagot allies ==

An appeal by the Cagots to Pope Leo X in 1514 was successful, and he published a papal bull in 1515, instructing that the Cagots be treated &quot;with kindness, in the same way as the other believers.&quot; Still, little changed, as most local authorities ignored the bull.

The nominal though usually ineffective allies of the Cagots were the government, the educated, and the wealthy. This included Charles V who officially supported tolerance of and improvements to the lives of Cagots. It has been suggested that the odd patchwork of areas which recognized Cagots has more to do with which local governments tolerated the prejudice, and which allowed Cagots to be a normal part of society. In a study in 1683, doctors examined the Cagots and found them no different from normal citizens. Notably, they did not actually suffer from leprosy or any other disease that could clarify their exclusion from society. The parlements of Pau, Toulouse and Bordeaux were informed of the situation, and money was allocated to improve the situation of the Cagots, but the populace and local authorities resisted.

Through many of the centuries Cagots in France and Spain came under the protection and jurisdiction of the church. In 1673, the Ursúa lords of the municipality of Baztán advocated the recognition of the local Cagots as natural residents of the Baztán. Also in the 17th century Jean-Baptiste Colbert officially freed Cagots in France from their servitude to parish churches and from restrictions placed upon them, though in practicality nothing changed.

By the 18th century Cagots made up considerable portions of various settlements, such as in Baigorri where Cagots made up 10% of the population.

In 1709, the influential politician planned and constructed the manufacturing town of Nuevo Baztán (after his native Baztan Valley in Navarre) near Madrid. He brought many Cagot settlers to Nuevo Baztán, but after some years, many returned to Navarre, unhappy with their work conditions.

In 1723 the Parlement of Bordeaux instituted a fine of 500 French livres for anyone insulting any individual as &quot;alleged descendants of the Giezy race, and treating them as agots, cagots, gahets or ladres&quot;; ordering that they will be admitted to general and particular assemblies, to municipal offices and honors of the church, they may even be placed in the galleries and other places of the said church where they will be treated and recognized as the other inhabitants of the places, without any distinction; as also that their children will be received in the schools and colleges of the cities, towns and villages, and will be admitted in all the Christian instructions indiscriminately.

During the French Revolution substantive steps were taken to end discrimination toward Cagots. Revolutionary authorities claimed that Cagots were no different from other citizens, and &quot;de jure&quot; discrimination generally came to an end. And while their treatment did improve compared to previous centuries, local prejudice from the non-Cagot populace persisted, though the practice began to decline. Also, during the revolution, Cagots stormed record offices and burned birth certificates in an attempt to conceal their heritage. These measures did not prove effective, as the local populace still remembered. Rhyming songs kept the names of Cagot families known.

== Modern status ==

Kurt Tucholsky wrote in his book on the &quot;Pyrenees&quot; in 1927: &quot;There were many in the Argelès valley, near Luchon and in the Ariège district. Today they are almost extinct, you have to search hard if you want to see them&quot;. Examples of prejudice still occurred into the 19th and 20th century, including a scandal in the village of Lescun where in the 1950s a non-Cagot woman married a Cagot man.

There was a distinct Cagot community in Navarre until the early 20th century, with the small northern village called Arizkun in Basque (or Arizcun in Spanish) being the last haven of this segregation, where the community was contained within the neighbourhood of Bozate. Between 1915 and 1920 the Ursúa noble family sold the land that Cagots had worked for the Ursúa for centuries in the area of Baztan to the Cagot families. Family names in Spain still associated with having Cagot ancestors include: &quot;Bidegain, Errotaberea, Zaldua, Maistruarena, Amorena,&quot; and &quot;Santxotena&quot;.

The Cagots no longer form a separate social class and were largely assimilated into the general population. Very little of Cagot culture still exists, as most descendants of Cagots have preferred not to be known as such.

There are two museums dedicated to the history of the Cagots, one in the neighborhood of Bozate in the town of Arizkun, Spain, the (Ethnographic Museum of the Agotes), opened by the sculptor and Cagot, in 2003, and a museum in the Château des Nestes in Arreau, France.
In 2021 and 2022 anti-vaccination and anti-vaccine passport protestors in France started wearing the red goose&#x27;s foot symbol that Cagots were forced to wear, and handed out cards explaining the discrimination against the Cagots.

== In media ==

References to Cagots as well as Cagots as characters have appeared in works throughout the past millennia. One of the earliest examples is the legend of the battle of 1373 that led to The Tribute of the Three Cows, the people of the French are said to have been led by a Cagot with four ears. References to Cagots occur semi-regularly in French literary works such as in the 1793 French play , by Sylvain Maréchal. The liberated subjects of the kings of Europe provide critiques of and insult their former rulers, where they say the Spanish king has &quot;stupidity, cagotism and despotism [...] imprinted on his royal face&quot;. Multiple references to Cagots have appeared in the poems of the 19th century French poet Édouard Pailleron.
Multiple travellers to the Pyrenees upon learning about and seeing the Cagots were inspired to write of their conditions both in fictional and non-fictional works. Such travellers included the Irish author and diplomat Thomas Colley Grattan, whose 1823 story &quot;The Cagot&#x27;s Hut&quot; details the &quot;otherness&quot; he perceived in the Cagots during his travels in the French Pyrenees, detailing many of the mythical features that became folklore about the Cagots appearance. In July 1841 the German poet Heinrich Heine visited the town of Cauterets and learned of the Cagots and their discrimination by others, subsequently becoming the topic of his poem &quot;Canto XV&quot; in &quot;Atta Troll&quot;. After travelling in southern France in 1853, Elizabeth Gaskell published her non-fiction work &quot;An Accursed Race&quot;, detailing the contemporary condition of the Cagots.

More recently, the Basque director released a Spanish-language film titled &quot;Baztan&quot; in 2012. The film deals with a young man fighting against the discrimination he and his family have suffered for centuries due to being Cagots. There are several references to the history and persecution of the Cagots in Rachel Kushner’s novel &quot;Creation Lake.&quot;

<doc id="402027" wikidata="Q3039774" url="?curid=402027" title="United Kingdom labour law">
<text>United Kingdom labour law regulates the relations between workers, employers and trade unions. People at work in the UK have a minimum set of employment rights, from Acts of Parliament, Regulations, common law and equity. This includes the right to a minimum wage of £11.44 for over-23-year-olds from April 2023 under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. The Working Time Regulations 1998 give the right to 28 days paid holidays, breaks from work, and attempt to limit long working hours. The Employment Rights Act 1996 gives the right to leave for child care, and the right to request flexible working patterns. The Pensions Act 2008 gives the right to be automatically enrolled in a basic occupational pension, whose funds must be protected according to the Pensions Act 1995. Workers must be able to vote for trustees of their occupational pensions under the Pensions Act 2004. In some enterprises, such as universities or NHS foundation trusts, staff can vote for the directors of the organisation. In enterprises with over 50 staff, workers must be negotiated with, with a view to agreement on any contract or workplace organisation changes, major economic developments or difficulties. The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends worker involvement in voting for a listed company&#x27;s board of directors but does not yet follow international standards in protecting the right to vote in law. Collective bargaining, between democratically organised trade unions and the enterprise&#x27;s management, has been seen as a &quot;single channel&quot; for individual workers to counteract the employer&#x27;s abuse of power when it dismisses staff or fix the terms of work. Collective agreements are ultimately backed up by a trade union&#x27;s right to strike: a fundamental requirement of democratic society in international law. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 strike action is protected when it is &quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;.

As well as the law&#x27;s aim for fair treatment, the Equality Act 2010 requires that people are treated equally, unless there is a good justification, based on their sex, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief and age. To combat social exclusion, employers must positively accommodate the needs of disabled people. Part-time staff, agency workers, and people on fixed-term contracts must be treated equally compared to full-time, direct and permanent staff. To tackle unemployment, all employees are entitled to reasonable notice before dismissal after a qualifying period of a month, and in principle can only be dismissed for a fair reason. Employees are also entitled to a redundancy payment if their job was no longer economically necessary. If an enterprise is bought or outsourced, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 require that employees&#x27; terms cannot be worsened without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. The purpose of these rights is to ensure people have dignified living standards, whether or not they have the relative bargaining power to get good terms and conditions in their contract. Regulations relating to external shift hours communication with employees will be introduced by the government, with official sources stating that it should boost production at large.

==History==
Modern labour law is mostly a creation of the last three decades of the 20th century. However, as a system of regulating the employment relationship, labour law has existed since people worked. In feudal England, after the Black Death with a shortage of workers and consequent price rises, the Ordinance of Labourers 1349 and the Statute of Labourers 1351 suppressed wages to pre-plague levels, banned workers unionising, and created offences for any able-bodied person that did not work. Ultimately this led to the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, which was followed by the Statute of Cambridge 1388, banning workers moving around the country. All these repressive acts were signs that serfdom was breaking down. The more enlightened Truck Acts, dating from 1464, required that workers be paid in cash and not kind. In 1772 slavery was declared to be illegal in &quot;R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett&quot;, and the subsequent Slave Trade Act 1807 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 enforced prohibition throughout the British Empire. In the 19th century, production boomed. Gradually people&#x27;s relationship to their employers moved from one of status - formal subordination and deference - to &quot;freedom of contract&quot; in choosing where to work. However, freedom of contract did not, as the economist Adam Smith observed, change a worker&#x27;s factual dependency on employers and the threat of poverty from unemployment.
At the Industrial Revolution&#x27;s height, the British Empire organised half the world&#x27;s production, on a third of the globe&#x27;s surface, with a quarter of its population. Joint Stock Companies, building railways, canals and factories, manufacturing household goods, connecting telegraphs, distributing coal, formed the backbone of commerce, yet with miserable factory life. The Factory Acts dating from 1803 required minimum standards on hours and conditions of working children. Trade unions were suppressed, especially after the French Revolution of 1789, in the Combination Act 1799. The Master and Servant Act 1823 criminalised workers for disobedience, strikes were branded as an &quot;aggravated&quot; breach of contract. Despite this, unions grew and through massive pressure won the right to exist and bargain in the Trade Union Act 1871 and the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875. Toward the turn of the 20th century, in &quot;Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow &amp; Co&quot;, the House of Lords emphasised that businesses should be free to organise into trade associations in the same way that employees organised into unions. However, in the notorious judgment of &quot;Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants&quot;, the House of Lords changed its mind and made unions liable in economic tort for the costs of industrial action. Although a combination of employers in a company could dismiss employees without notice, a combination of employees in a trade union were punished for withdrawing their labour. The case led trade unions to form a Labour Representation Committee, which then became the Labour Party, to lobby for the reversal of the law. After their landslide victory in the 1906 general election, the Trade Disputes Act 1906 enshrined the essential principle of collective labour law that any strike &quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot; is immune from civil law sanctions. The Old Age Pensions Act 1908 provided pensions for retirees. The Trade Boards Act 1909 created the first minimum wages and the National Insurance Act 1911 levied a fee to insure people got benefits in the event of unemployment.
After the brutality of World War I, the Versailles Treaty created the International Labour Organization to draw up common standards between countries, for as it said, &quot;peace can be established only if it is based on social justice&quot;, and echoed the US Clayton Act 1914 in pronouncing that &quot;labour should not be regarded merely as a commodity or an article of commerce&quot;. But the international system remained disjointed as the United States Congress withheld its approval to join the League of Nations. Within the UK the postwar settlement was to make a home fit for heroes. Whitley Councils extended the Trade Boards Act 1909 system to Joint Industrial Councils that created sector-wide fair wage agreements, while the Ministry of Labour actively organised the growth of trade unions. This was based on a theory of collective bargaining, agreement or action, advocated by Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb in &quot;Industrial Democracy&quot; to remedy the inequality of bargaining power of workers. Without legal force behind collective agreements, the law remained in a state of collective &quot;laissez faire&quot;, encouraging voluntarism for agreement and dispute settlement between industrial partners. The 1920s and 1930s were economically volatile. In 1926 a General Strike against coal miners&#x27; pay cuts paralysed the country, at though it was broken, the Labour Party formed its first government in Parliament in 1929. The onset of the Great Depression, and then war, meant little was achieved.

After the Second World War, under the first majority Labour government of Clement Attlee which promised to &quot;win the peace&quot;, collective agreements covered over 80 per cent of the workforce. As the British Empire dissolved, migration from Commonwealth countries, and record levels of female workplace participation, changed Britain&#x27;s workforce. While the common law was sometimes progressive, but mostly not, the first statutes prohibiting discrimination based on gender and race emerged in the 1960s, after the Civil Rights Act was passed in the United States. Discrimination in employment (as in consumer or public service access) was formally prohibited on grounds of race in 1965, gender in 1975, disability in 1995, sexual orientation and religion in 2003 and age in 2006. A complicated and inconsistent jamboree of Acts and statutory instruments was placed into a comprehensive code in the Equality Act 2010. This was backed by European Union law, which the UK acceded to with the European Communities Act 1972. Although labour laws in the early European Treaties were minimal, the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty brought employment rights squarely into EU law. Meanwhile, starting from the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, workers gained a growing list of minimum statutory rights, such as the right to reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment. Labour governments through the 1960s and 1970s were troubled by reform of the unwieldy trade union system. Despite producing reports such as &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; and the &quot;Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy&quot; which would have codified union governance, and created more direct workplace participation, reform did not take place.
From 1979, a new Conservative government began dismantling most labour rights. During the 1980s ten major Acts gradually reduced the autonomy of trade unions and the legality of industrial action. Reforms to the internal structure of unions mandated that representatives be elected and a ballot is taken before a strike, that no worker could strike in sympathetic secondary action with workers with a different employer, and that employers could not run a closed shop system of requiring all workers to join the recognised union. The wage councils were dismantled. A public campaign against the merits of unions paralleled the decline of membership and collective agreement coverage to under 40 per cent. In addition, the government opted out of the EU Social Chapter in the Maastricht Treaty. In 1997 the new Labour government brought the UK into the EU&#x27;s Social Chapter, which has served as the source for most reform in UK law since that time. Domestic led reform was minimal. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 established a country-wide minimum wage, but did not attempt to reinvigorate the Wage Board system. The Employment Relations Act 1999 introduced a 60-page procedure requiring employers to compulsorily recognise and bargain with a union holding support among workers, though union membership remained at a level steadily declining below 30 per cent. Most advances in labour rights since 1997 came through EU law, such as paid holidays, information and consultation, or spreading equality. Since 2010, the coalition government continued a programme of labour rights by requiring people who take zero hour contracts to get unemployment insurance, and frustrating the right to strike in the Trade Union Act 2016. This has led to consistently rising inequality since 1979, and to large increases in child poverty since 2010.

==Employment rights and duties==

UK labour law&#x27;s main concerns are to ensure that every working person has a minimum charter of rights in their workplace, and voice at work to get fair standards beyond the minimum. It distinguishes self-employed people, who are free to contract for any terms they wish, and employees, whose employers are responsible for complying with labour laws. UK courts and statutes also, however, give more or fewer rights to different groups including &quot;worker&quot;, &quot;jobholder&quot;, &quot;apprentice&quot; or someone with an &quot;employment relation&quot;. A &quot;worker&quot;, for example, is entitled to a minimum wage (£11.44 per hour in 2024), 28 statutory minimum days of paid holiday, enrolment in a pension plan, a safe system of work, and the right to equal treatment that also applies to consumers and public service users. An &quot;employee&quot; has all those rights, and also the right to a written contract of employment, time off for pregnancy or child care, reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment, and the duty to contribute to the National Insurance fund and pay income tax. The scope of the terms &quot;worker&quot;, &quot;employee&quot;, and others, are more or less left to the courts to construe according to the context of its use in a statute, but someone is essentially entitled to more rights if they are in a weaker position and thus lack bargaining power. English courts view an employment contract as involving a relation of mutual trust and confidence, which allows them to develop and enlarge the remedies available for workers and employers alike when one side acts out of bad faith.

===Scope of protection===
The UK has not yet codified a single definition of who is protected by labour rights. The law has two main definitions (employee and worker) and three minor definitions (jobholder, apprentice, and an &quot;employment relation&quot;) each with different rights. EU law does have one consolidated definition of a &#x27;worker&#x27;: someone who has a contract for work in return for a wage, or an indirect &quot;quid pro quo&quot; (as in a communal cooperative), and also stands as the more vulnerable party to the contract. This reflects the kernel of classical labour law theory, that an employment contract is one infused with &quot;inequality of bargaining power&quot;, and stands as a justification for mandating additional terms to what might otherwise be agreed under a system of total freedom of contract.
First, an &quot;employee&quot; has all main rights, including job security, retirement, child care, and the right to equal treatment. Most people are employees, although this has not yet been fully defined in the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230. Instead, Parliament left it to the courts to decide what &quot;employee&quot; with a &quot;contract of service&quot; meant, although the government can explicitly put people into the &quot;employee&quot; category. The classical common law test was that an employee was subject to the employer&#x27;s &#x27;control&#x27;. But in the 20th century, more people worked outside factories where they had greater autonomy in performing their jobs. New tests were used, such as whether an employee was &quot;integrated&quot; into the workplace, or wore the &quot;badge&quot; of the organisation. Most importantly, because employers paid National Insurance contributions for their employees, the tax authorities had a central role in enforcing the proper distinction. Courts focused on &quot;economic reality&quot;, and substance over form. It could also be relevant (but not decisive) if employees owned their tools, if they had the chance of profit, or bore the risk of loss. But in the late 1970s and 1980s, some courts introduced a new test of &quot;mutuality of obligation&quot;. The dominant view of this, now approved by the UK Supreme Court, was merely that employees only needed to exchange work for a wage: this was the &quot;irreducible core&quot; of an employment contract. But a rival view stated that the employment relationship had to be one where there was an ongoing obligation to offer and accept work. This led to cases where employers, who hired people on a casual basis, low wages, and with little bargaining power, argued they owed no duties to their staff, because they had neither side had assumed any such obligation. However, the leading case, &quot;Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher&quot; decided by a unanimous Supreme Court in 2011, adopted the view that mutuality of obligation is the consideration of work for a wage. Lord Clarke held that an exchange of work for a wage was essential, but that employment contracts could not be treated like commercial agreements. As he put it,

This meant that a group of car valeters, although their contracts said they were self-employed, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. The second major category is of a &#x27;worker&#x27;. This is defined in Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or someone who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This means all employees are workers, but not all workers are employees. Non-employee workers are entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, anti-discrimination rights, and trade union rights, but not job security, child care, and employers do not make National Insurance contributions for them. The Supreme Court has held that this category contains quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm, and high-earning plumbers. However, staff who are employed through an agency, will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.

===Contract of employment===
Once a person&#x27;s work contract is categorised, the courts have specific rules to decide, beyond the statutory minimum charter of rights, what are its terms and conditions. Just like ordinary contract law there are rules on incorporation, implied terms and unjust factors. However, in &quot;Gisda Cyf v Barratt&quot;, Lord Kerr emphasised that if it affects statutory rights, the way courts construe a contract must be &quot;intellectually segregated&quot; from the general law of contract, because of the employee&#x27;s relation of dependency. In this case, Ms Barratt was told her employment was terminated in a letter that she opened 3 days after its arrival. She claimed her dismissal was unfair within three months (the time limit to bring claims in Tribunals) after reading the letter, but the employer argued it was barred because in commercial contract cases, one is bound by a notice as soon as it arrives in business hours. The Supreme Court held that Ms Barratt could claim: she was only bound by the notice when she actually read it. The purpose of employment law to protect the employee, and so the rules must be construed to uphold employees&#x27; rights.

Everything an employee is promised or agrees to becomes a term of the contract, so long as this does not contradict statutory labour rights. In addition, terms can be incorporated by reasonable notice, for instance by referring to a staff handbook in a written employment agreement, or even in a document in a filing cabinet next to the staff handbook. While without express wording they are presumed not binding between the union and employer, a collective agreement may give rise to individual rights. The test applied by the courts is to ask loosely whether its terms are &#x27;apt&#x27; for incorporation, and not statements of &#x27;policy&#x27; or &#x27;aspiration&#x27;. Where the collective agreement&#x27;s words are clear, a &quot;last in, first out&quot; rule was held in one case to potentially qualify, but in another case a clause purporting to censure compulsory redundancies was held to be binding &#x27;in honour&#x27; only. Zero-hour contracts are yet to be rescinded in accordance with the Employment Rights Bill 2024 upon approval by Parliament.
As well as statutory rights, expressly agreed terms, and incorporated terms, the employment relation contains standardised implied terms, on top of the individualised implied terms that courts always construe to reflect the reasonable expectations of the parties. First, the courts have long held that employees are owed additional and beneficial obligations, such as a safe system of work, and payment of wages even when the employer has no work to offer. The House of Lords held employers have a duty to inform their employees of their workplace pension rights, although a lower court stopped short of requiring employers to give advice on qualifying for workplace disability benefits. The key implied term is the duty of good faith, or &quot;mutual trust and confidence&quot;. This is applied in many circumstances. Examples include requiring that employers do not act in an authoritarian manner, do not call employees names behind their back, do not treat workers unequally when upgrading pay, do not run the company as a front for international crime, or do not exercise discretion to award a bonus capriciously. There has been disagreement among judges about the extent to which the core implied term of mutual trust and confidence can be &#x27;contracted out of&#x27;, with the House of Lords having held that the parties may when they are &quot;free&quot; to do so, while others approach the question as a matter of construction of the agreement which is within exclusive judicial competence to define.

The second, and older, hallmark of the employment contract is that employees are bound to follow their employers&#x27; instructions while at work, so long as that does not contravene statute or agreed terms. Employments relation give the employer discretion in limited fields. This used to be called the &#x27;master–servant&#x27; relationship. The employer has some ability to vary the way work is done in accordance with business needs, so long as it does not contradict a contract&#x27;s express terms, which always require an employee&#x27;s consent, or a collective agreement. The status of &#x27;flexibility clauses&#x27;, purporting to allow employers the discretion to vary any contract term, has been contested, as it will often enable abuse of power that the common law controls. The limits of the courts&#x27; tolerance for such practices are evident if they touch procedures for accessing justice, or potentially if they would contravene the duty of mutual trust and confidence.

===Wages and tax===
Since 1998, the United Kingdom has fixed a national minimum wage, but collective bargaining is the main mechanism to achieve &quot;a fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work&quot;. The Truck Acts were the earliest wage regulations, requiring workmen to be paid in money, and not kind. Today, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 stipulates that employers can only dock employees&#x27; wages (e.g. for destroying stock) if the employee has consented to deductions in writing. This, however, does not cover industrial action, so following 18th century common law on part performance of work, employees who refused to 3 out of 37 hours a week in minor workplace disobedience had their pay cut for the full 37. From the Trade Boards Act 1909, the UK had set minimum wages according to the specific needs of different sectors of work. This eroded from 1986, and then repealed in 1993. One wages council that survived was the Agricultural Wages Board, established under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948. It was abolished in England in October 2013, though boards still operate for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.
To bring the UK back into compliance with international law, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced. Every worker&quot; who personally performs work, but not for a client or customer, However, it was held that a pupil barrister did not count as a worker. The minimum wage rate is revised annually after guidance from the Low Pay Commission, but since 2010 has been cut for under-25-year-olds and young people doing apprenticeships. The National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 state that for people who are not paid by the hour, total pay is divided by the hours actually worked over an average &quot;pay reference period&quot; of one month. Workers who are &quot;on call&quot; have to be paid when they are on call. But if a worker is given sleeping facilities and is not awake, the minimum wage need not be paid. However, an employer may agree with a worker what the hours worked actually are, if hours are ordinarily unmeasured. In &quot;Walton v Independent Living Organisation Ltd&quot; a worker who cared for a young epileptic lady had to be on call 24 hours a day, 3 days a week, but could do her own activities, such as going shopping, making meals and cleaning. Her company made an agreement with her that her tasks took 6 hours and 50 minutes a day, which resulted in her £31.40 allowance meeting the minimum wage. Deductions up to £6 per day can be made for accommodation the employer provides, though extra bills, such as for electricity, should not ordinarily be charged. The minimum wage can be enforced individually through an Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 claim for a shortfall of wages in a Tribunal. A worker may not be subjected to any detriment for requesting records or complaining about it. However, because many workers will not be informed about how to do this, or have the resources, a primary enforcement mechanism is through inspections and compliance notices issued by Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). A remedy of up to 80 times the minimum wage is available to the worker and HMRC can enforce a penalty of twice the minimum wage per worker per day.
Unlike the rules for Value Added Tax Act 1994, where consumers must see the prices they actually pay after tax, there is currently no requirement for workers to see the final wages they will actually earn after income tax, and National Insurance contributions. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, as amended each year by the Finance Acts, in 2019 the &#x27;personal allowance&#x27; with 0% was up to £12,500 in income, a &#x27;basic rate&#x27; of 20% tax was paid on £12,500 to £50,000, a higher rate was 40% on income over £50,000, and a top rate of 45% over £150,000. The top rate of income tax has been dramatically cut since 1979, while taxation for the richest people, who receive most money through capital gains, dividends, or corporate profits has been cut even further. People will be classified as liable to pay income tax whether or not they work through a company. From 2015 to 2019, the &quot;personal allowance&quot; was linked to the minimum wage, but only up to 30 hours a week of pay (as if people usually had a three-day weekend). This link was cut, and there is no personal allowance for National Insurance contributions, which fund the state pension, unemployment insurance (now partly the universal credit), and the insolvency fund. While self-employed people generally pay the same income tax (albeit with more exemptions and deductions) they pay 9% in National Insurance contributions, while an employee pays 12%. In addition, the employee&#x27;s employer makes a standard 13.8% contribution, while the &quot;self-employed&quot; person has no employer to make such a contribution. These disparities give a large incentive for employers to misrepresent true employment status with &quot;sham self-employment&quot;.

===Working time and child care===

The Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Working Time Directive give every worker the right to paid holidays, breaks and the right to a weekend. Following international law, every worker must have at least 28 days, or four full weeks in paid holidays each year (including public holidays). There is no qualifying period for this, or any other working time right, because the law seeks to ensure both a balance between work and life, and that people have enough rest and leisure to promote better physical and psychological health and safety. Because the purpose is for workers to have the genuine freedom to rest, employers may not give a worker &quot;rolled up holiday pay&quot;, for instance an additional 12.5% in a wage bill, in lieu of taking actual holidays. However, if the worker has not used his or her holidays before the job terminates, the employer must give an additional payment for the unused holiday entitlement.

People working at night may only work 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is classified as &quot;hazardous&quot;. Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive hours of rest in a 24-hour period, and in every day workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6-hour period. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a shorter working week as it increased economic productivity: the current maximum is 48 hours, averaged over 17 weeks, but it does not apply to the self-employed or people who can set their own hours of work. In &quot;Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz&quot; the Court of Justice said the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they do their jobs. Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers &quot;opt out&quot; of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form. Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose. &quot;On call&quot; time where people must be ready to work is working time. The European Court of Justice&#x27;s decision in &quot;Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar&quot; that junior doctors&#x27; on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same &quot;opt out&quot; derogation as the UK, but limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, but it has taken a &quot;light touch&quot; approach to enforcement. There are new employment plans by the Starmer ministry to reduce hours to a four-day week in the future.

Possibly the most important time off during working life will be to care for newly born or adopted children. However, unlike paid holidays or breaks that are available for &quot;workers&quot;, child care rights are restricted to &quot;employees&quot;. They are also less favourable for male parents, which exacerbates the gender pay gap as women take more time out of their careers than men. Going beyond the minimum in the Pregnant Workers Directive, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 71 to 73 and the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 guarantee maternity leave for 52 weeks in total, but in four steps, paid and unpaid. First, women must take two weeks compulsory leave at the time of child birth. Second, and covering the compulsory leave, there is a right to 6 weeks&#x27; leave paid at 90% of ordinary earnings. Third, there is a right to 33 weeks&#x27; leave at the statutory rate, or 90% of ordinary earnings if this is lower, which was £138.18 per week in 2014. The government reimburses employers for the costs according to the employer&#x27;s size and national insurance contributions. Fourth, the mother may take additional, but unpaid maternity leave for another 13 weeks. A contract of employment can always be, and if collectively bargained usually is, more generous. There is no qualifying period for the right to unpaid leave, but the mother must have worked for 26 weeks for the right to paid leave. The mother must also tell the employer 15 weeks before the date of the expected birth, in writing if the employer requests it. Employees may not suffer any professional detriment or dismissal while they are absent, and should be able to return to the same job after 26 weeks, or another suitable job after 52 weeks. If parents adopt, then the rights to leave follow maternity rules for one primary carer. However, for fathers ordinarily, the position is less generous. The Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 entitle a father to 2 weeks leave, at the statutory rate of pay. Both parents may also take &quot;parental leave&quot;. This means that, until a child turns 5, or a disabled child turns 18, parents can take up to 13 weeks unpaid leave. Unless there is another collective agreement in place, employees should give 21 days&#x27; notice, no more than 4 weeks in a year, at least 1 week at a time, and the employer can postpone the leave for 6 months if business would be unduly disrupted. Otherwise, employees have a right to suffer no detriment, nor be dismissed, and have the right to their previous jobs back. To redress the imbalance between women and men bearing children, the Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 made it possible for the woman to transfer up to 26 weeks of her maternity leave entitlements to her partner. This has not stopped the gender pay gap.
In further specific situations, there are a jumble of other rights to leave spread across the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 55 to 80I. &quot;Emergency leave&quot; is, under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 57A, available for employees to deal with birth or a child&#x27;s issues at school, as well as other emergencies such as dependents&#x27; illness or death, so long as the employee informs the employer as soon as reasonably practicable. In &quot;Qua v John Ford Morrison Solicitors&quot;, Cox J emphasised that there is no requirement to deliver daily updates. After Employment Act 2002, employees gained the right to request flexible working patterns for the purpose of caring for a child under the age of 6, or a disabled child under age 18. The right to make the request is contained in Employment Rights Act 1996 section 80F, and despite the fact that employers may decline the request, employers grant requests in 80% of cases. An employee must make the request in writing, the employer must reply in writing, and can only decline the request on the basis of a correct fact assessment, and within 8 grounds listed in section 80G, which generally concern business and organisational necessity. In &quot;Commotion Ltd v Rutty&quot; a toy warehouse assistant was refused a reduction to part-time work because, according to the manager, everyone needed to work full-time to maintain &quot;team spirit&quot;. The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that because &quot;team spirit&quot; was not one of the legitimate grounds for refusal, Rutty should get compensation, which is set at a maximum of 8 weeks&#x27; pay. Finally, the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 63D-I give employees (and agency workers are expressly included) the right to request the right to get time off for training.

===Occupational pensions===
There are three &quot;pillars&quot; of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity and a fair income in retirement. The first pillar is the state pension, administered by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or &quot;personal pensions&quot;, which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every &quot;jobholder&quot; (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) the right to be automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out. This is a simple &quot;defined contribution&quot; scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a &quot;public option&quot; competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders&#x27; wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who have not created a union and collectively bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had &quot;defined benefits&quot;: on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings for the rest of their lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or &quot;member nominated trustees&quot;. The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products.
Because pension schemes save up significant amounts of money, which many people rely on in retirement, protection against an employer&#x27;s insolvency, or dishonesty, or risks from the stock market were seen as necessary after the 1992 Robert Maxwell scandal. Defined contribution funds must be administered separately, not subject to an employer&#x27;s undue influence. The Insolvency Act 1986 also requires that outstanding pension contributions are a preferential over creditors, except those with fixed security. However, defined benefit schemes are also meant to ensure everyone has a stable income regardless of whether they live a shorter or longer period after retirement. The Pensions Act 2004 sections 222 to 229 require that pension schemes have a minimum &quot;statutory funding objective&quot;, with a statement of &quot;funding principles&quot;, whose compliance is periodically evaluated by actuaries, and shortfalls are made up. The Pensions Regulator is the non-departmental body which is meant to oversee these standards, and compliance with trustee duties, which cannot be excluded. However, in &quot;The Pensions Regulator v Lehman Brothers&quot;, the Supreme Court concluded that if the Pensions Regulator issued a &quot;Financial Support Direction&quot; to pay up funding, and it was not paid when a company had gone insolvent, this ranked like any other unsecured debt in insolvency, and did not have priority over banks that hold floating charges. In addition, there exists a Pensions Ombudsman who may hear complaints and take informal action against employers who fall short of their statutory duties. If all else fails, the Pension Protection Fund guarantees a sum is ensured, up to a statutory maximum.

===Health and safety===
Every employer must provide a &quot;safe system of work&quot;. In the industrial revolution from 1802 the Factories Acts required workplaces to be cleaner, ventilated, with machinery fenced. The Acts restricted child labour and limited the working day. They targeted mines, or textile mills, before the Factories Act 1961 spread to all &quot;factories&quot;: where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer&#x27;s Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because individual employees tend not to litigate, to ensure enforcement, there are inspectors under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities. Inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. HSWA 1974 section 2 also foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Health and safety regulations remain in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.
The most important protection for people&#x27;s health has been the National Health Service (NHS), founded by the National Health Service Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 2006 entitles everyone to health care in the UK, and is funded through the tax system. If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, to statutory sick pay. People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress. Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the &quot;course of employment&quot; whenever their actions have a &quot;close connection&quot; to the job, and even if it breaks an employer&#x27;s rules. An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a &quot;frolic of his own&quot;, was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm. Under the Employers&#x27; Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs. Insurance companies may not sue their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud. Until the mid-20th century there was an &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of defences: common employment, &quot;volenti non fit injuria&quot;, and contributory negligence. These are gone, but a fourth defence taken advantage of by employers is &quot;ex turpi causa non oritur actio&quot;, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In &quot;Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd&quot; Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore, and so was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.
Tort law remains relevant when there is scientific uncertainty about an injury&#x27;s cause. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed at a number of companies where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one, and some may be insolvent. In &quot;Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd&quot;, the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses&#x27; insolvency. For a brief period, in &quot;Barker v Corus&quot; the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers&#x27; insolvency back onto workers. Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in &quot;Chandler v Cape plc&quot; that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders may not be able to hide behind the corporate veil to escape their obligations for the health and safety of the workforce.

===Privacy and free expression===
Civil liberties at work, particularly the right to privacy and freedom of expression, are part of the UK&#x27;s constitution and are protected in multiple statutes. Under the Human Rights Act 1998, section 3, domestic law should be interpreted so far as possible to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. If a compatible interpretation would bend an Act&#x27;s words too much, section 4 requires courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility, for Parliament to amend the law. Under section 6, courts are public bodies, themselves bound to act compatibly with human rights. The first main right affecting the workplace is privacy, which is protected in ECHR article 8 and the Data Protection Act 2018, which includes the General Data Protection Regulation. First, it is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 section 1(3) for an employer to intercept any private communication, such as reading email, searching an inbox, or tracking calls or websites, without lawful authority. Second, the employer must preserve a minimum content of privacy, whatever it tells an employee. In &quot;Barbulescu v Romania&quot; the European Court of Human Rights held that a sales engineer had a &#x27;reasonable expectation of privacy&#x27; against personal messages to his brother and fiancé being read, even though he was told not to use a workplace Yahoo messenger for personal reasons, because he was not specifically told his messages would be checked. Even if he was, &quot;an employer&#x27;s instructions cannot reduce private social life in the workplace to zero. Respect for private life and for the privacy of correspondence continues to exist, even if these may be restricted in so far as necessary&quot;. An employer cannot read private messages, for instance to a fiancé or family member. This followed several other similar cases. In &quot;Halford v United Kingdom&quot; the European Court of Human Rights held that intercepting an employee&#x27;s phone calls violated their private life, particularly since they had not been told of any extent of monitoring, and they had been given a reasonable expectation of privacy. In &quot;Smith and Grady v United Kingdom&quot; the Court held that the private life of a woman in the Royal Air Force was violated after an investigation and intimate questioning of her sex life and HIV status. Then, in &quot;Copland v United Kingdom&quot; the Court found that it violated ECHR article 8 for a manager to monitor the calls and internet use of an employee, and then insinuate and gossip about the employee having an affair, again without any warning. On the other hand, in &quot;Kopke v Germany&quot;, the Court held that video surveillance of employees was lawful, after an employer had found money was going missing from the till, in pursuit of the legitimate aim of protecting property rights: implicitly, general video surveillance without any reasonable suspicion of a wrongful act would be a violation. Third, under the GDPR personal data can only be processed by consent or law, fairly, transparently, with a legitimate purpose, kept secure, and no longer than needed. The law distinguishes between ordinary data, and &#x27;sensitive&#x27; personal data, such as political opinions, union membership, or biometric data. There is a right to have any inaccurate data rectified, and erased if consent is withdrawn and there is no longer a lawful ground for it to be kept. All rights are backed by criminal offences and enforceable through complaints to the Information Commissioner.
The second main civil liberty in the workplace is the right to freedom of expression, protected in ECHR article 10. First, freedom of expression includes statements of political opinion, as well as association. In &quot;Vogt v Germany&quot; it was held that dismissing a teacher, simply for being a member of the German Communist Party and expressing political views, violated ECHR article 10. There was no expression of disobedience to the country&#x27;s constitution or democratic order, and so a complete ban on party membership was disproportionate. Second there could be disclosures to improve an employer&#x27;s workplace practices. In &quot;Heinisch v Germany&quot; it was held to be unlawful to dismiss from an elderly care home a nurse who complained to a criminal prosecutor about shortages in the home, creating intolerable pressure on staff, and putting patients at risk: there was a failure to balance the public interest in care for the elderly and the employer&#x27;s business interests, and dismissal was an extreme sanction that could have a chilling effect on all freedom of speech if allowed. Third, there is explicit protection for disclosures in the public interest, for instance of unlawful activity, under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 43A to 43K. These &quot;whistleblower&quot; provisions protect &#x27;qualifying disclosures&#x27; such as any criminal offence, a breach of legal duty, miscarriage of justice, health and safety violations, environmental damage, or deliberate concealment of wrongs. The disclosures must be made with a reasonable belief in their truth, not for personal gain, and need not be made first to employers if the employee reasonably believes they may be subject to detriment. This does not protect employees against breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989. Beyond privacy and expression, the human rights that also affect the workplace include the right to a fair trial, the right to property, and critically the right to freedom of association in ECHR article 11, that protects workplace participation.

==Workplace participation==
While UK law creates a &quot;charter protecting employees&#x27; rights&quot; at work, people need a voice in enterprise management to get fair wages and standards beyond the minimum. In law, this means the right to vote for managers, or to vote on important issues such as pensions, and the right to collective bargaining. Trade unions are the main way that workers organise their voices. Unions aim to improve their members&#x27; lives at work. Unions are founded on contract, but members must have the right to elect the executive, not be excluded without good reason, and not be discriminated against by employers. Unions&#x27; main functions are organising and representing a workforce through statutory participation channels, collective bargaining, providing mutual assistance, and being a forum for social deliberation and activism. Collective agreements, which unions make with employers, usually aim to set fair scales of pay and working hours, require pensions, training and workplace facilities, and update standards as the enterprise changes. Trade union bargaining power rests, in the last resort, on collective action. To balance employer power to change the employment relation&#x27;s terms, or dismiss staff, an official trade union has been protected by law in its right to strike. Since the 1875, UK law has said collective action, including the right to strike, is lawful if it is &quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;. Since the 1980s, there have also been a number of requirements for balloting the workforce and warning the employer, suppression of sympathy strikes and picketing. In these respects UK law falls below international labour standards. There are legal rights to information about workplace changes and consultation on redundancies, business restructuring and management generally. Finally, there are a small number of rights for direct participation in workplace and company affairs, particularly pension management. In some enterprises, such as universities, staff can vote for representatives on boards that manage the enterprise.

===Trade unions===
In principle, UK law guarantees trade unions and their members freedom of association. This means people can organise their affairs in the way they choose, a right reflected in the ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 and the European Convention on Human Rights, article 11. Under the ECHR article 11, freedom of association can only be restricted by law as is &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot;. Traditional common law and equity was superficially similar, since unions form through contract, and the association&#x27;s property is held on trust for its members according to the association&#x27;s rules. However, before Parliament became democratic, unions were suppressed for allegedly being in &quot;restraint of trade&quot; and their actions (particularly strikes to improve conditions at work) could be regarded as criminal conspiracy. Nineteenth century reformers, who recognised that unions were democratic, gradually succeeded in guaranteeing unions&#x27; freedom of association. The Trade Union Act 1871 aimed to keep the courts away from unions&#x27; internal affairs, while the Trade Disputes Act 1906 finally confirmed the right of unions to take collective action, free from liability in tort, if it was &quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;. The basic philosophy of &quot;legal abstention&quot; from union organisation lasted until 1971 when the Conservative government attempted comprehensive regulation. This intervention was reversed by Labour in 1974, but after 1979 unions became heavily regulated.
Today union governance can be configured in any manner, so long as it complies with the compulsory standards set by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Before 1979, all unions had systems of elections and were democratic. In most the members elected union executives directly. However, it was thought that indirect elections (e.g. where members voted for delegates, who elected executives in conference) made a minority of unions more &quot;out of touch&quot; and militant than was natural. Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, section 46, requires that members have direct voting rights for the executive, which cannot stay in office for more than five years. In addition, rules were passed (though there was little evidence of problems before) saying no candidate may be unreasonably excluded from an election, all voters are equal, and postal ballots must be available. In practice, UK union elections are often competitive, although voter turnouts (without electronic voting) tend to be low. Minor procedural irregularities that would not affect outcomes do not undermine an election, but otherwise a Certification Officer can hear complaints about malpractice, make inquiries, and issue enforcement orders, which can in turn be appealed to the High Court. For example, in &quot;Ecclestone v National Union of Journalists&quot; Jake Ecclestone, who had been the Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists for 40 years, was dismissed by the executive. He attempted to run for election again, but the executive introduced a rule that candidates had to have the executive&#x27;s &quot;confidence&quot;. Smith J held the union had no express rule stating the executive could do this, nor could any be construed consistently with the democratic nature of the union&#x27;s constitution. The executive&#x27;s &quot;new rule&quot; was also contrary to TULRCA 1992 section 47, which prohibits unfair exclusions of candidates. Where statute is not explicit, standard principles of construction apply. There have been dissenting views, notably in &quot;Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union&quot;, over the extent to which principles of natural justice may override a union&#x27;s express rules. However, the better view appears that construction of a union&#x27;s rules consistently with statutory principles of democratic accountability do require that express rules are disapplied if they undermine the &quot;reasonable expectations&quot; of members. In addition, &quot;best practice&quot; standards will be used to interpret union rules. In &quot;AB v CD&quot;, where the union&#x27;s rules were silent on what would happen when an election was tied, the court referred to the Electoral Reform Society&#x27;s guidance.
Beyond union governance through the vote and elections, members have five main statutory rights. First, although statute asserts that a union is &quot;not a body corporate&quot;, in every practical sense it is: it can make contracts, commission torts, hold property, sue and be sued. The union&#x27;s executives and officials carry out actions on its behalf, and their acts are attributed to it by ordinary principles of agency. However, if any union official acts &quot;ultra vires&quot;, beyond the union&#x27;s powers, every member has a right to claim a remedy for the breach. For example, in &quot;Edwards v Halliwell&quot; a decision of the executive committee of the National Union of Vehicle Builders to increase membership fees was restrained, because the constitution required a two-thirds vote of members first. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 28 requires unions to keep accounts, giving a &quot;true and fair&quot; view of its financial affairs. Records are kept for six years, members have a right to inspect them, they are independently audited and overseen by the Certification Officer. Third, members have a right to not give contributions to the trade union&#x27;s political fund, if there is one. Since the early success of the UK Labour Party in promoting working people&#x27;s welfare through Parliament, both courts and Conservative governments attempted to suppress unions&#x27; political voice, particularly compared to funding by employers through control of corporations. Under TULRCA 1992 sections 72, 73 and 82, a union must hold a separate fund for any &quot;political object&quot; (such as advertising, lobbying or donations), members must approve the fund by ballot at least every 10 years, and individual members have a right to opt-out of it (unlike shareholders in companies). Unions must also have political objects in the constitution. In 2010, just 29 from 162 unions had political funds, though 57 per cent of members contributed. This generated £22m. Consolidated statistics on corporate political spending, by contrast, are not available.
Fourth, members must be treated fairly if they are disciplined by a union, in accordance with judicially developed principles of natural justice. For example, in &quot;Roebuck v NUM (Yorkshire Area) No 2&quot; Templeman J held that it was unfair that Arthur Scargill was on the appeal panel for journalists being disciplined for appearing as witnesses against a libel action by Scargill himself. In another example, &quot;Esterman v NALGO&quot; held that Miss Esterman could not be disciplined for taking up an election counting job outside of her work, especially since the power of the union to restrain her was not clearly in its own rules. Fifth, members cannot be expelled from the union without a fair reason, set out in the statutory grounds under TULRCA 1992 section 174. This could include an expulsion under the Bridlington Principles, an agreement among unions to maintain solidarity and not attempt to &quot;poach&quot; each other&#x27;s members. However, the legislation was amended after &quot;ASLEF v United Kingdom&quot; to make clear that unions may exclude members whose beliefs or actions are opposed to the union&#x27;s legitimate objectives. In &quot;ASLEF&quot;, a member named Lee was involved in the British National Party, a neo-fascist organisation committed to white supremacy, and Lee himself was involved in violence and intimidation against Muslim people and women. The European Court of Human Rights held that ASLEF was entitled to expel Lee because, so long as it did not abuse its organisational power or lead to individual hardship, &quot;unions must remain free to decide in accordance with union rules, questions concerning admission to and expulsion from the union.&quot; Lastly, union members also have the more dubious &quot;right&quot; to not strike in accordance with the decision of the executive. This precludes a union disciplining members who break solidarity, and has been criticised by the International Labour Organization for undermining a union&#x27;s effectiveness, in breach of core labour standards.

===Collective bargaining===
The right of workers to collectively bargain with employers for a &quot;fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work&quot; is regarded as a fundamental right in common law, by the European Convention on Human Rights article 11, and in international law. Historically the UK had, however, left the procedure for making collective agreements, and their content, largely untouched by law. This began to change from 1971, though by contrast to other countries in the Commonwealth, Europe, or the United States the UK remains comparatively &quot;voluntarist&quot;. In principle, it is always possible for an employer and a trade union to come voluntarily to any collective agreement. Employers and unions would usually aim to develop an annually updated wage scale for workers, fair and flexible working time, holidays and breaks, transparent and just procedures for hiring or dismissals, fair and jointly administered pensions, and a commitment to work together for the enterprise&#x27;s success. In 2010, around 32 per cent of the UK workforce was covered by a collective agreement, leaving around two-thirds of the British workforce with little influence over the terms of their work.
Traditionally, if workers organise a union, their last resort to get an employer to the bargaining table was to threaten collective action, including exercising their right to strike. In addition, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 Schedule A1 contains a statutory procedure for workers to become recognised for collective bargaining. To use this procedure, first, a trade union must be certified as independent and the workplace must have a minimum of 21 workers. Second, there must not already be a recognised trade union. This caused particular problems in &quot;R (National Union of Journalists) v Central Arbitration Committee&quot; as the Court of Appeal held that a recognised union which lacked any significant support could block the bargaining claim of a union with support. Third, the union must identify an appropriate &quot;bargaining unit&quot; for a collective agreement, which a government body named the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) can verify and approve. On the union&#x27;s proposal, the CAC must take into account whether the proposed bargaining unit is &quot;compatible with effective management&quot;, as well as the employer&#x27;s views and the characteristics of the workers. The CAC has broad discretion, and may only be challenged by an employer under the general principles of natural justice in administrative law. In &quot;R (Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd) v CAC&quot; the Court of Appeal found that the CAC&#x27;s determination that the appropriate bargaining unit was all of Kwik Fit&#x27;s workers within the M25 London ring road. The union&#x27;s recommendation is the starting point and the CAC is entitled to prefer this over an employer&#x27;s alternative, especially since the employer will often attempt to define a larger &quot;unit&quot; so as to limit the likelihood of union members holding greater majority support. Fourth, once the bargaining unit is defined, the CAC may be satisfied that there is majority support for the union to represent the workforce and will make a recognition declaration. Alternatively, fifth, it may determine that the position is less clear and that a secret ballot is in the interests of good industrial relations. Sixth, if a ballot takes place both the union and the employer should have access to employees, and be able to distribute their arguments, and threats, bribes or undue influence are forbidden. Seventh, when a vote takes place the union must have at least 10 per cent membership, and win 50 per cent of the vote, or least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote. If the union wins a majority, the eighth and final step is that if the parties do not reach an agreement the CAC will regulate the collective agreement for the parties and the result will be legally binding. This contrasts to the basic position, under TULRCA 1992 section 179, which presumes that collective agreements are not intended to create legal relations. The long, problematic procedure, was partly based on the model of the US National Labor Relations Act 1935, but because of its cumbersome nature it strongly encourages the parties to seek voluntary agreement in the spirit of cooperation and good faith.
Though most collective agreements will come about voluntarily, the law has sought to ensure that workers have true freedom of association by prohibiting employers from deterring union membership, and by creating positive rights for members. First, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 137-143 make it unlawful for employers, including agencies, to refuse anyone employment on grounds of union membership. The courts will interpret the legislation purposively to protect union activities, with the same strictness as other anti-discrimination laws. Second, TULRCA 1992 sections 146-166 state that workers may not be subject to any detriment or dismissal. For example, in &quot;Fitzpatrick v British Railways Board&quot; the Board dismissed of a lady who had been a member of a Trotskyist group (which promoted international socialism). The Board justified this on the ground that she had not told the employer about having previously worked for the Ford Motor Company, and so for &#x27;untruthfulness and lack of trust&#x27;. Woolf LJ held that this was not the true reason - Trotskyism was the issue. The dismissal was unlawful under section 152. Given the technicality of the legislation, the most important case is &quot;Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom&quot;, where Wilson&#x27;s pay was not increased by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; because he wished to remain on the union collective agreement, and Palmer&#x27;s pay was not put up by 10 per cent because he would not consent to leaving the union, the NURMTW. The European Court of Human Rights held that any ambiguity about protection in UK law contravened ECHR article 11 because,

In principle, like any victimisation case in discrimination law, &#x27;a detriment exists if a reasonable worker would or might take the view that the [treatment] was in all the circumstances to his detriment&#x27;. If the UK statutes are not updated, the Human Rights Act 1998 section 3 requires interpretation of the common law, or statute, to reflect ECHR principles. More specific legislation, with the Data Protection Act 1998 sections 17-19 and the Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010, penalises a practice of recording or blacklisting union members, and potentially leads to criminal sanctions for employers and agencies who do so.
Third, union members have a right to be represented by union officials in any disciplinary or grievance meeting under Employment Relations Act 1999 sections 10-15. This can be particularly important when a worker is in trouble with management. Fourth, an employer must permit officials of independent trade unions, which it recognises for collective bargaining, to a reasonable amount of time off to fulfill their role. Also, union members have a right to a reasonable amount of time off during work hours also to participate in meetings about agreements with the employer, or voting for elections. An ACAS Code of Practice sets out the general guidelines. A final &quot;right&quot; is that under TULRCA 1992 a worker may not be compelled to become a union member in what used to be called closed shop arrangements. Collective agreements had required that employers did not hire anyone who was not a union member. However, the European Court of Human Rights decided in 1981 that &quot;freedom of association&quot; under article 11 also entailed &quot;freedom from association&quot;. This shift in the law coincided with the start of a Europe-wide trend toward falling union membership, as the closed shop had been the main mechanism to keep up union support, and thus collective bargaining for fairer workplaces. The ECHR does not, however, prevent unions pursuing fair share agreements, where non-union members contribute to union fees for the services they get for collective bargaining. Nor does it prevent collective agreements that would automatically enroll staff in the trade union, as happens under the Pensions Act 2008, with the right for the worker to opt-out if they chose.

===Collective and strike action===
The right of workers to collectively withdraw their labour has always been used to make employers stick to a collective agreement. At critical moments of history, it also combatted political repression (e.g. the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, and the Indian Independence Movement up to 1947), prevented military coups against democratic governments (e.g. the general strike in Germany against the Kapp Putsch in 1920), and overthrew dictatorships (e.g. in the 2008 Egyptian general strike). Anti-democratic regimes cannot tolerate social organisation they do not control, which is why the right to strike is fundamental to every democratic society, and a recognised human right in international law. Historically, the UK recognised the right to strike at least since 1906. UK tradition has inspired the International Labour Organization Convention 87 (1948) articles 3 and 10, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights under article 11, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights article 28. However, the scope of the right to take collective action has been controversial. Reflecting a series of restrictions from 1979 to 1997, the law was partially codified in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 219 to 246, which now falls below international standards.
There is no consensus about the status of the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that &quot;to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law&quot;, that &quot;right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining&quot;, &quot;that workmen have a right to strike&quot;, and that this is &quot;a fundamental human right&quot;. This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith trade dispute as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach of contract, and this creates tortious liability for unions organising collective action, unless it falls within an immunity from statute. On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure, inducement of breach of contract, and tortious interference with a contract. However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula, that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any liability in tort if done &quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;. This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike.
First, the meaning of a &quot;trade dispute&quot; under TULRCA 1992 section 244 is confined to mean a dispute &quot;between workers and their employer&quot; and must mainly relate to employment terms. In &quot;BBC v Hearn&quot; Lord Denning MR granted an injunction against a strike by BBC staff to stop broadcast of the 1977 FA Cup Final to apartheid South Africa. He reasoned that this was a political dispute, not a &quot;trade dispute&quot;, unless the union was requesting &quot;putting a clause in the contract&quot; to not do such work. Strikes against government legislation (rather than an employer), or privatisation, or outsourcing before it happens, have been held unlawful. However, at the least, any dispute over the terms or conditions on which workers do their jobs will allow protection. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 224 prevents collective action against someone who is &quot;not the employer party to the dispute&quot;. &quot;Secondary action&quot; used to be lawful, from the Trade Union Act 1871 until 1927, and again from 1946 till 1980, but today it is not. This makes the definition of &quot;employer&quot; relevant, particularly where a trade dispute involves a company group. A worker&#x27;s written statement of the contract may purport to say that the only &quot;employer&quot; is a subsidiary, although the parent company carries out the employer&#x27;s function of ultimately setting the contractual terms and conditions. Further, any picketing or protest outside a workplace must be &quot;peaceful&quot; and there must be a picket supervisor. There are a limited number of outright prohibitions on strike action, but in accordance with ILO Convention 87 this is only for workplaces that involve the truly essential functions of the state (for armed forces, police, and prison officers), and only when impartial arbitration is used as an alternative.

Third, under TULRCA 1992 section 226 a union wishing to take collective action for a trade dispute must conduct a ballot. In summary, the union must give 7 days notice to the employer about holding a ballot, state the categories of employees being balloted, give a total number, all &quot;as accurate as is reasonably practicable in the light of the information&quot;. Since the Trade Union Act 2016, there is an additional requirement that a ballot has a 50% turnout for a strike to be supported, and a total of 40% of voters supporting a strike (i.e. an 80% turnout if the vote is evenly split) in &quot;important public services&quot; that include health services, schools, fire, transport, nuclear and border security. A scrutineer must be able to oversee the conduct, the vote must be given to all workers who could strike, the vote must be secret and by post, allowing for &#x27;small accidental failures&#x27; which are &#x27;unlikely to affect the result of the ballot&#x27;. The union must inform the employer of the result &quot;as soon as reasonably practicable&quot;, call action within four weeks, and tell the employer of the people taking part. The rules are poorly drafted, and this has generated litigation where some courts allowed injunctions on ostensible technical glitches. However, the Court of Appeal since emphasised in &quot;British Airways Plc v Unite the Union (No 2)&quot; and &quot;RMT v Serco Ltd&quot; that the rules are to be interpreted consistently with the purpose of reconciling the equally legitimate, but conflicting interests of employers and unions. No employee can be dismissed for taking part in a strike for a period of 12 weeks, so long as the strike is officially endorsed by the union. However, if strikes are not conducted in accordance with law, employers can (and often do) go to court to seek an injunction against a union conducting the strike, or potentially damages. A court should not grant any injunction against a strike unless there is a &#x27;serious question to be tried&#x27; and it must consider where the &#x27;balance of convenience lies&#x27;. In &quot;The Nawala&quot; the House of Lords stressed that injunctions should be granted rarely and give &#x27;full weight to all the practical realities&#x27; and the fact that a court should not end the strike in the employer&#x27;s favour.

===Information and consultation===
While rights to take collective action, including strikes, are fundamental to democratic and civilised society, the UK has introduced a growing menu of collective rights to have a &quot;voice at work&quot; without a need for protest. &quot;Information and consultation&quot; are usually seen as precursors to actual participation rights, through binding votes at work. The economic benefit is that directors or decision-makers who inform and consult staff on important workplace changes (e.g. redundancies) think harder, and see alternatives with fewer costs for the enterprise, taxpayers, and staff. Information and consultation rights have historically derived from collective bargaining models. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 181-182 require employers on a union&#x27;s written request to disclose information, without which collective bargaining could be materially impeded, according to &quot;good industrial relations practice&quot;. The Companies Act 2006 section 417-419 also requires disclosure of information in a director&#x27;s report each financial year on how companies &quot;have regard&quot; to &quot;the interests of the company&#x27;s employees&quot; and &quot;business relationships with suppliers&quot; down the supply chain. General consultation rights existed in the UK with collective bargaining since the Whitley Councils from 1918. A general consultation right is now codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 27. The Court of Justice held this was not directly binding, but specific rules apply in four main contexts: in general work councils, transnational work councils, for collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings, and health and safety.
First, the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004, require undertakings with 50 or more employees to inform and consult on probable developments in the enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies. Employees must voluntarily initiate an &quot;information and consultation procedure&quot;. If they do, but employers cannot find a negotiated agreement, a &quot;standard procedure&quot; model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having the right to be consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council. A negotiated agreement can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue &quot;with a view to reaching an agreement&quot;. This is &quot;an obligation to negotiate&quot;, similar to a duty to bargain in good faith. To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a &quot;pre-existing&quot; council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees. If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants to keep it that way, a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure. For example, in &quot;Stewart v Moray Council&quot;, after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on information and consultation. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer&#x27;s claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to £75,000 for failure to comply with the rules, though it is far from clear this is sufficient to ensure an &quot;effective remedy&quot; under EU law.

Second, the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 enable unified work councils in multinational enterprises, operating in the EU. This is most likely for US multinational enterprises. In &quot;community scale undertakings&quot; or corporate &quot;groups&quot; with over 1000 employees, and 150 employees in two or more member states, employees have a right to a transnational work council to consult on any &quot;probable trend of employment, investments, and substantial changes... introduction of new working methods or production processes... and collective redundancies.&quot; A &quot;group&quot; of undertakings exists when one undertaking has a &quot;dominant influence&quot; over another, for instance through company share ownership or rights to appoint or remove directors. Other features of transnational work councils are similar to the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004. Management can initiate a work council, or 100 employees in at least two undertakings and member states can make a request. Then, a &quot;special negotiating body&quot; (elected worker representative and management) will try to seek an agreement on the terms. If agreement cannot be reached, a template set of &quot;subsidiary requirements&quot; will form the work council&#x27;s constitution. The rules have been criticised for not going further, or being integrated with other consultation laws, although every member state in the EU is able to go beyond the minimum standards laid down.
Third, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 188 requires employers, who are &quot;contemplating&quot; redundancies of 20 employees, in an &quot;establishment&quot; over 90 days, to consult for 30 days with the workforce. &quot;Redundancy&quot; is an economic dismissal &quot;not related to the individual concerned&quot; (e.g. for poor work or misconduct). In &quot;University of Stirling v UCU&quot; the Supreme Court held that expiry of fixed term contracts, for 140 University teaching staff, did not count as a reason &quot;related to the individual&quot;, and so staff should have been consulted. An &quot;establishment&quot; includes &quot;a distinct entity that is ordinarily permanent, entrusted with performing specified tasks, namely primarily the sale of goods, and which has, to that end, several workers, technical means and an organisational structure in that the store is an individual cost centre managed by a manager.&quot; In &quot;Lyttle v Bluebird UK Bidco 2 Ltd&quot;, the Court of Justice held this meant that Woolworths shops in Northern Ireland, each with under 20 employees, could claim to be separate establishments. More doubtfully, it was held by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in &quot;E Green &amp; Sons (Castings) Ltd v ASTMS&quot; that three companies, all operating from the same premises, were different establishments even though they were part of the same group. There is considerable disagreement over when an employing entity must begin consulting: the Directive says when decision-makers are &quot;contemplating&quot;, while the Regulations say &quot;proposes&quot;. In &quot;AEK ry v Fujitsu Siemens Computers Oy&quot; the Court of Justice held consulting must begin &quot;once a strategic or commercial decision compelling him to contemplate or to plan for collective redundancies has been taken.&quot; In groups of companies, where a parent controls the subsidiary, the duty to perform the consulting process falls on the subsidiary, but the duty begins as soon as the parent has contemplated that a particular subsidiary &quot;has been identified&quot; for redundancies for consulting &quot;to have any meaning&quot;. Consultation should take place with the recognised trade union first, but if there is none, then elected employee representatives, if necessary giving enough time to organise an election. Section 188(7) says that an employer has a &quot;defence&quot; for not consulting if there are &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, but this &quot;exception&quot; is not in the Directive, and courts have avoided applying it. Dismissals cannot take effect until meaningful negotiation has taken place. If employers fail to negotiate, they must pay a &quot;protective award&quot; of up to 90 days&#x27; pay to each employee. Essentially similar rules apply for consultation with staff before any transfer of an undertaking.

===Votes at work===
Rights of staff to vote for governing boards and bodies in UK enterprises, whether corporations, partnerships or other statutory entities, have an established history in the UK. They remain today in institutions such as universities, NHS hospitals, and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first &quot;codetermination&quot; laws in the world. However, as many of those Acts were updated, the Companies Act 2006 today still has no general requirement for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 27 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation. At board level, UK company law in principle allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but voluntary measures have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees&#x27; financial risk. The Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines only &quot;members&quot; as those with participation rights. Under section 112 a &quot;member&quot; is anybody who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members&#x27; register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. Moreover, under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt to follow the Directive for employee involvement. An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion. An &quot;SE&quot; can have no fewer employee participation rights than what existed before, but for a UK company, there is likely to have been no participation in any case.
In the 1977 &quot;Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy&quot; the Government proposed, in line with the new German Codetermination Act 1976, and mirroring an EU Draft Fifth Company Law Directive, that the board of directors should have an equal number of representatives elected by employees as there were for shareholders. But reform stalled, and was abandoned after the 1979 election. Despite successful businesses like the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose that are wholly managed and owned by the workforce, voluntary granting of participation is rare. Many businesses run employee share schemes, particularly for highly paid employees; however, such shares seldom compose more than a small percentage of capital in the company, and these investments entail heavy risks for workers, given the lack of diversification.

Another form of direct participation rights is for employees to exercise voting rights over specific workplace issues. The primary example is the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241-243 state employees must be able to elect a minimum of one third of the management of their occupational schemes, as &quot;member nominated trustees&quot;. This gives employees the ability, in principle to have a voice on how their pension money is invested in company shares, and also how the voting power attached to company shares is used. There have, at the initiative of the European Union been a growing number of &quot;work councils&quot; and &quot;information and consultation committees&quot;, but unless an employer voluntarily concedes to staff having a binding say, there is no legal right to participate in specific questions of workplace policy. Participation at work is limited to information, consultation, collective bargaining and industrial action.

==Equality==
The Equality Act 2010 embodies the principle that people should treat one another according to the content of their character, and not another irrelevant status, to foster social inclusion. This principle is found in the common law, and EU law, There is an absolute prohibition on discriminating against trade union members, and the EA 2010 protects the characteristics of gender (including pregnancy), race, sexual orientation (including marital status), belief, disability and age. Atypical workers, who have part-time, fixed-term, or agency contracts, are also protected under specific regulations. The common law may also give greater protection to workers who are treated arbitrarily. &quot;Direct&quot; discrimination is when a worker is treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic (e.g. gender or race) compared to another person (with a different gender or race), unless employers can show that a person&#x27;s characteristic is a &quot;genuine occupational requirement&quot;. &quot;Indirect&quot; discrimination is when employers apply a neutral rule to all workers, but this has &quot;disparate impact&quot; on people with a particular protected characteristic, and the rule cannot be &quot;objectively justified&quot;. Equal pay claims between men and women have historically been separate in law, the rules are often less favourable, and do not tackle structural discrimination such as unequal parental leave and responsibility. Workers have a right to not suffer harassment at work. Claimants may not be victimised for bringing a discrimination claim. The law requires employers to make reasonable adjustments to include disabled people at work. The law also allows positive action to include underrepresented groups if a candidate is equally qualified. If discrimination is proven, it is a statutory tort, and employers are vicariously and potentially personally liable.

===Direct discrimination===

Direct discrimination is prohibited by the Equality Act 2010, and means treating a person less favourably than a comparable person, because of a &quot;protected characteristic&quot;, such as sex, race, sexual orientation, disability or age. The employer&#x27;s motives are irrelevant, even if it meant to help underprivileged groups. An appropriate comparator is one who is the same in all respects except for the characteristic. In &quot;Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&quot; a chief inspector claimed the police force was responsible for sex discrimination, and she pointed to male chief inspectors who had not been treated unfavourably. The House of Lords, controversially, overturned a Tribunal finding of sex discrimination because colleagues had complained about how Ms Shamoon had performed appraisals, and her chosen comparators had not received complaints. A claimant may allege they were treated less favourably than a hypothetical person would have been, and does not need to point to an actual comparator. If the claimant shows a set of facts from which a reasonable tribunal could conclude there was discrimination, the burden of proof is on the employer to show there was no discrimination. It is irrelevant whether the person who was targeted themselves has the protected characteristic. For example, in &quot;Coleman v Attridge Law&quot; a lady with a disabled child was abused by her employer for taking time off to care for the child. Even though Ms Coleman was not disabled, she could claim disability discrimination. Similarly, in &quot;English v Sanderson Blinds Ltd&quot;, a man who was from Brighton and went to boarding school was teased for being gay. Even though he was married with children, he successfully claimed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. An instruction by an employer to discriminate against customers or anyone else also violates the law.

Under EA 2010 Schedule 9, an employer may escape liability if they show a &quot;genuine occupational requirement&quot;. An otherwise discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim by the job&#x27;s nature (not the employer&#x27;s business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. In &quot;Etam plc v Rowan&quot; a man was turned down for a job at a woman&#x27;s clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women&#x27;s change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in &quot;Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main&quot; that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state&#x27;s margin of discretion to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military. This was even so, in &quot;Sirdar v The Army Board &amp; Secretary of State for Defence&quot;, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on &quot;interoperability&quot; meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job&#x27;s functions require adherence to an organisation&#x27;s ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious &quot;ethos&quot;, because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job. Direct age discrimination can be objectively justified more easily.
Harassment is an independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person&#x27;s dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in &quot;Majrowski v Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; NHS Trust&quot; a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor from the very start of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In &quot;St Helen&#x27;s MBC v Derbyshire&quot; the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in &quot;Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan&quot;, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings. Harassment and victimisation cannot be justified.

===Indirect discrimination===

&quot;Indirect&quot; discrimination means an employer, without an objective justification, applies a neutral rule to all employees, but it puts one group at a particular disadvantage. However, the particular disadvantage is irrelevant if it involves a discriminatory state of mine. In &quot;Ladele v Islington LBC&quot; a woman who refused to register gay civil partners, because she said her Christianity made her conclude homosexuality was wrong, was dismissed for not carrying out her duties. Lord Neuberger MR held that she was not unlawfully discriminated against because the Council was objectively justified in following its equality policy: that everyone working in marriage or partnership registries had to register everybody equally. The European Court of Human Rights upheld this decision. By contrast, in &quot;Eweida v British Airways plc&quot; a lady who wished to wear a cross claimed that BA&#x27;s instruction to remove it was indirectly discriminatory against Christians. Although the English Court of Appeal held crucifix jewellery is not an essential part of the Christian religion, the ECHR found that, under the reasonableness limb of the proportionality test, it was an illegitimate interference with Ms Eweida&#x27;s religious beliefs under ECHR article 9. British Airways changed its uniform policy shortly afterwards in any case, and this indicated that they had acted unlawfully. The question of particular disadvantage also typically relies on evidence of statistical impact between groups. For instance in &quot;Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz&quot; an employer set up pensions only for full-time workers, and not for part-time workers. But 72 per cent of part-time workers were women. So Frau Weber von Hartz was able to show that this rule put her, and women generally, at a particular disadvantage, and it was up to the employer to show there was an objective justification. Statistics might be presented in a misleading way (e.g. a measure could affect twice as many women as men, but that is only because there is 2 women and 1 man affected in a workforce of 100). Accordingly, the correct approach is to show how many people in the affected workforce group are put at an advantage, and then if there is a statistically significant number of people with a protected characteristic who are not advantaged, there must be an objective justification for the practice. In &quot;R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment&quot; the UK government&#x27;s former rules on unfair dismissal were alleged to be discriminatory. Between 1985 and 1999, the government had made the law so that people had to work for 2 years before they qualified for unfair dismissal, and this meant that there was a 4 to 8 per cent disparity between the number of men and women who qualified on dismissal for a tribunal claim. Following ECJ guidance, the House of Lords held by a majority that this was a large enough disparity in coverage, which required justification by the government.
A significant exception to the basic framework for indirect discrimination is found for the issue of equal pay between men and women. Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, and so did the TFEU article 157, there has always been a separate body of rules. It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to &quot;pay&quot;, concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave. Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same employer, or an associated employer, and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply. It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant must be doing &quot;broadly similar&quot; work to the comparator, or work &quot;rated as equivalent&quot;, or work which is of &quot;equal value&quot;. These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the &quot;value&quot; of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court in a way that the open ended test for indirect discrimination does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court&#x27;s discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an &quot;equality clause&quot; into the claimant&#x27;s contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal. It is unclear what principle justifies the segregation of unequal pay claims based on sex, compared to all other protected characteristics.

Indirect discrimination may be &quot;objectively justified&quot; if a neutral practice puts a member of a group at a particular disadvantage. In most cases, this is based on business necessity. The ECJ, mostly in cases concerning sex discrimination under TFEU art 157, has held that an employer must show a &quot;real need&quot; for the practice that has a disparate impact, and it must be &quot;unrelated&quot; to the protected characteristic. The justification should not involve &quot;generalisations&quot; rather than reasons specific to the workers in question, and budgetary considerations alone are not to be considered an &quot;aim&quot;. Many foundational judgments concerned employers who gave fewer benefits to part-time staff than full-time staff. Given the particular disadvantage this caused women it was hard to justify. In domestic equal pay claims based on gender, instead of &quot;objective justification&quot;, the old terminology still used is that there must be a &quot;genuine material factor&quot;, found in EA 2010 section 69. Despite different headings, the same underlying concepts are present as for objective justification, with the need to show a &quot;legitimate aim&quot; and that action is &quot;proportionate&quot; to such an aim. In &quot;Clay Cross (Quarry Services) Ltd v Fletcher&quot; Lord Denning MR held that an employer could not justify paying a young man a higher wage than an older lady (who in fact trained him) on the basis that this was what the employer had to pay given the state of the job market. However, in &quot;Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board&quot; the House of Lords held that women NHS prosthetists who were paid 40% less than men prosthetists, who had become contracted through private practices, had no claim because it was agreed that such higher prices were necessary to attract their services. Thus, the &quot;objective justification&quot; was said to be an organisational necessity. In &quot;Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority&quot; the ECJ held that although a speech therapist being paid less than a male counterpart could not be justified only on the ground that this resulted from different collective agreements, if a disparity came from market forces, this was an objective justification. It has, however, been emphasised that the legislation&#x27;s purpose is to achieve equal pay, and not fair wages. So in &quot;Strathclyde RC v Wallace&quot; the House of Lords held that women teachers who had to fill in for an absent male head master were not entitled to be paid the same during that time. This was a different job. It has also been asserted that collective agreements designed to incrementally make a transition to equal pay between jobs rated as equivalent cannot be justified, and can even result in liability for the union that concluded them. Unlike other protected characteristics, under EA 2010 section 13(2), direct age discrimination is open to justification on the same principles, on the basis that everyone will go through the ageing process. This has meant, primarily, that older workers can reach a compulsory retirement age set either by the workplace or the government, on the basis that it is a legitimate way of sharing work between generations.

===Disability and positive action===
Because treating people equally is not by itself enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment. According to &quot;Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA&quot; disabilities involve an impairment &quot;which hinders the participation of the person concerned in professional life&quot;. This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound to do as much as reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot;. For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the &quot;disability&quot; if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person&#x27;s handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, &quot;Archibald v Fife Council&quot;, it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Archibald, previously a road sweeper, had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a manual worker, in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in &quot;O&#x27;Hanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners&quot; the Court of Appeal rejected that it would be a reasonable adjustment, as Ms O&#x27;Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim is always to ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible.

For characteristics other than disability, &quot;hard&quot; positive discrimination, through privileged contract terms, hiring and firing based on gender, race, sexuality, belief or age, or setting quotas for underrepresented groups in most jobs, is generally unlawful in the EU. This policy, however, leaves open the issue of historical disadvantage, and sub-conscious exclusion, which may not be addressed through ordinary direct and indirect discrimination claims. The EU has permitted &quot;soft&quot; positive action, in contrast to the United States or South Africa, where &quot;affirmative action&quot; operates in many workplaces. Lawful positive action in the EU means, in the case of hiring candidates for work, employers may select someone from an under-represented group, but only if that person has qualifications equal to competitors, with full consideration of the candidate&#x27;s individual qualities. In &quot;Marschall v Land Nordrhein Westfalen&quot; a male teacher failed to get a promotion, and a woman did. He complained that the school&#x27;s policy, to promote women &quot;unless reasons specific to an individual candidate tilt the balance in his favour&quot;, was unlawful. The ECJ held the school would not be acting unlawfully if it did in fact follow its policy. By contrast in &quot;Abrahamsson and Anderson v Fogelqvist&quot; Göteborg University&#x27;s policy was to hire a woman candidate unless &quot;the difference between the candidates&#x27; qualification is so great that such application would give rise to a breach of the requirement of objectivity&quot;. A male candidate, who was not hired over two less qualified women, was successful in claiming discrimination. In addition, according to &quot;Re Badeck&#x27;s application&quot; legitimate positive action measures include quotas in temporary positions, in training, guaranteeing interviews to people with sufficient qualifications, and quotas for people working on representative, administrative or supervisory bodies such as a company&#x27;s board of directors. This approach, developed initially in ECJ case law, is now reflected in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 157(4) and was put into UK law in the Equality Act 2010 sections 157-158.

===Atypical work===
Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum levels of equal treatment for people with part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the &quot;same type of contract&quot; doing &quot;broadly similar work&quot;, and are in the same establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In &quot;Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority&quot;, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In &quot;O&#x27;Brien v Ministry of Justice&quot; the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension &quot;pro rata&quot; was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.
The Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 cover people with contracts that purport to last for a limited duration. The Regulations (unlike the Directive appears to require) were written to only cover &quot;employees&quot; and not the broader group of &quot;workers&quot;. In contrast, the European Court of Justice held in &quot;Mangold v Helm&quot; that equality was a general principle of EU law. This meant that a German Act which required fixed-term contracts be objectively justified after two years work, but gave no protection to workers beyond the age of 52, was unlawful. Likewise, the UK Regulations ban less favourable treatment of fixed-term staff without objective justification. Less generous than other countries, regulation 8 says if an employee has a succession of fixed term contracts lasting over 4 years, the employee is to be treated as having a permanent contract. In practice, UK law already regulated fixed-term work in this respect, because the qualifying period for unfair dismissal will be met even if an employee has had short breaks in employment.


The Agency Workers Regulations 2010 provide workers some protection against less favourable treatment when they work through an employment agency. However, the right to equal treatment is limited to &quot;basic working conditions&quot;, which is defined as pay and their working time, unless the common law, or general EU law principles are applicable. But an agency worker may, unlike part-time or fixed-term employees, appeal to a hypothetical comparator. This left uncertain the position of agency workers protection by the job security, child care and other rights for employees in ERA 1996. While the dominant view, after the UK Supreme Court decision in &quot;Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher&quot;, is that an agency worker will always qualify as an employee against both the agency and end-user when they work for a wage, the English Court of Appeal had previously issued conflicting judgments on whether an agency worker should have an unfair dismissal claim against the end-employer, the agency, or both or neither. Reflecting their vulnerable position, the regulation of agency work goes beyond anti-discrimination rights, to place a set of duties on employment agents&#x27; operations and conduct. Found in the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 agencies are generally prohibited from charging fees to prospective workers. Various other duties include being honest in their job advertising, keeping all information on jobseekers confidential and complying with all employment laws. Originally agencies had to have licenses, and under the oversight of the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, they risked losing their licenses if found to be acting in violation of the law. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 removed the licensing requirement, but this was partially reinstated for agencies in agricultural, shellfish and packing sectors through the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004. In response to the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster this established another specific regulator, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, to enforce employment law in those areas.

===Free movement and immigration===
The right to move freely and work, within the British Isles, Europe, and the world, is basic human need, yet constrained, evolving and contested. Magna Carta recognised free movement for work among merchants to England, there was unrestricted movement throughout the British Empire until 1962, and from 1973 until 2020 (following the Brexit poll) British workers had the right to free movement throughout the European Union under core principles of EU law. However, there were periodic backlashes and constraints, such as the expulsion of Jews, Bretons and French people, there were restrictive laws imposed on &quot;alien&quot; residents, and even within the realm successive Master and Servant Acts enabled employers to impose criminal penalties on workers who left without permission. In international law, the right to free movement so far only applies &#x27;within the borders of each State&#x27;, and while there are basic standards for protection of refugees and asylum seekers, there is not yet an international right to work. Immigration status is not itself a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 although mistreatment could amount to indirect discrimination, and itself creates a system of differential treatment by employers and the state.

The Immigration Act 1971 is the main law, which put non-UK Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals on the same work permit scheme. Since 2002, the UK has used a &quot;Points Based System&quot;, and with the UK&#x27;s exit from the EU in 2020, this was extended to EU citizens as UK and EU free movement rights were abolished. There is no requirement to apply for a work visa for British citizens returning, people with indefinite leave to remain, refugees, and Irish citizens benefit from the Common Travel Area that enables anyone to move freely, work, vote, and access social services within the UK and Ireland. While a decision on a person&#x27;s immigration application is being made, a person&#x27;s leave is extended, however the Immigration Rules are so strict that an application is invalid (meaning people have overstayed leave) unless it meets all formal requirements, with the government having a discretion but no duty to accept corrections in 10 working days. The limit to this is the Home Office&#x27;s duty of good administration, which the Supreme Court has held to include a requirement of flexibility, despite the &#x27;high level of pedantry&#x27; required by the rules.

There are five main groups of work visa. First, the most common are the Skilled Worker visa and also a Health and Care Worker visa to attract people to the NHS and into care work. Second, there are visas for people to work in the UK through a multi-national employer, particularly the Global Business Mobility visa. Third, there are temporary work visas. Fourth, there are a group of visas without needing a job offer, such as for British Nationals (Overseas), graduates, or &#x27;global talent&#x27;. Fifth, there are &#x27;Start-up&#x27; and &#x27;Innovator&#x27; visas for those who can show they have a credible business plan.

The right to secure employment, either in one&#x27;s current job or in a job that utilises a person&#x27;s skills in the most socially productive way, is usually seen as crucial for the success of the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month&#x27;s work an employee must have at least one week&#x27;s notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years&#x27; work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee&#x27;s capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years&#x27; work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee&#x27;s job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the notice period, redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management&#x27;s decision about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a &quot;jobseekers allowance&quot;, and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create &quot;full employment&quot; however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work.

===Wrongful dismissal===
Wrongful dismissal refers to a termination of employment which contravenes a contract&#x27;s terms, whether expressly agreed or implied by the courts. This depends on construction of the contract, read in the context of the statutory charter of rights for employees in the ERA 1996. In the old common law cases, the only term implied by the courts regarding termination was that employers had to give reasonable notice, and what was &quot;reasonable&quot; essentially depended on the professional status of the employee. In &quot;Creen v Wright&quot;, Lord Coleridge CJ held that a master mariner was entitled to a month&#x27;s notice, though lower class workers could probably expect much less, &quot;respectable&quot; employees could expect more, and the period between wage payments would be a guide. Now the ERA 1996 section 86 prescribes that an employee should receive one week&#x27;s notice before dismissal after one month&#x27;s work, two weeks&#x27; notice after two years&#x27; work, and so forth up to twelve weeks for twelve years. The employer can give pay in lieu of notice, so long as the weeks&#x27; wages for the notice are paid in full. Often, contracts of employment contain express terms regarding a proper disciplinary procedure to be followed if someone is to be dismissed for disputes at work. Dismissals will usually be regarded as both wrongful and unfair if a procedure for dismissal is not followed. If a contractual disciplinary procedure is not followed, the employee may claim damages for the time it would have taken and the potential that she would still be employed. In &quot;Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys&quot;, the Supreme Court affirmed that a wrongful repudiation of a contract by the employer would not automatically terminate the agreement, because to do so would be to reward the wrongdoer. Only if an employee accepts the purported termination will the contract end. Until then the employer is liable for paying wages, and other terms of the contract, such as dismissal procedures, will survive.
The requirements of notice and any disciplinary procedure do not apply if the employee was the one to have repudiated the contract, either expressly, or by conduct. As in the general law of contract, if an employee&#x27;s conduct is so seriously bad that it manifests to the reasonable person an intention to not be bound, then the employer may dismiss the employee without notice. But if the employer is not justified in making a summary dismissal, the employee has a claim under ERA 1996 section 13 for a shortfall in wages. The same principle, that a serious breach of contract gives the other side the option to terminate, also works in favour of employees. In &quot;Wilson v Racher&quot; a gardener was bullied by his employer, the heir of Tolethorpe Hall, and gave him a rude telling off for not picking up some string on the lawn. Wilson, the gardener, told Racher &quot;get stuffed, go and shit yourself&quot;. The Court of Appeal held that the employer&#x27;s attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer&#x27;s own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a &quot;Czar-serf&quot; relationship, Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together, is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in &quot;Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital&quot;, the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer&#x27;s failure to follow a doctor&#x27;s contractual disciplinary procedure. This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.

The primary implied term of an employment contract that may be broken is mutual trust and confidence. In &quot;Johnson v Unisys Ltd&quot; the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence at the point of dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in &quot;Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc&quot;, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.

===Unfair dismissal===
While &quot;wrongful&quot; dismissal concerns breaches of the terms of an employment contract, &quot;unfair&quot; dismissal is a claim based on the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 94 to 134A. It governs the reasons for which an employer terminates a contract, and requires they fall into the statutory definition of what is &quot;fair&quot;. The Industrial Relations Act 1971, following the Donovan Report 1968, set up its structure. Under ERA 1996 section 94 any employee, who is employed for over two years, may claim for an Employment Tribunal (composed of a judge, an employer and an employee representative) to review the decision. Temporary or seasonal breaks in employment, such as for teachers who are not in class over summer, cannot break the continuity of the contract for the qualifying period, even if a contract purports to be for a fixed term. An employee is only &quot;dismissed&quot; if the employer has decided to end the work relationship, or if they have constructively dismissed the employee through a serious breach of mutual trust and confidence. An employee will not have a claim if they have voluntarily resigned, though a court must be satisfied that someone truly intended to forgo the legal right to sue for unfair dismissal. In &quot;Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd v Lineham&quot; Lineham used the toilet at work after drinking at the pub. Afterwards, in response to the manager rebuking him in front of other staff, he threw down his keys and drove off. He claimed he was dismissed, and the Tribunal agreed that at no time had Lineham resigned. By contrast in &quot;Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp&quot; Sharp walked off because the company welfare officer refused to let him collect holiday pay immediately. Although Sharp was in financial difficulty, this was due to his absences, and so he was not justified in leaving, and not constructively dismissed. Under ERA 1996 section 203(1), statutory rights may not be excluded or limited, although section 203(2) and (3) still allows employers and employees to settle a legal claim, so long as the compromise agreement is made freely and with independent legal advice. It has also been held that an employee is not dismissed if the relationship is frustrated. In &quot;Notcutt v Universal Equipment Co (London) Ltd&quot; a man&#x27;s heart attack meant he could no longer work. The employer paid no wages during the ordinary notice period, but was successful in arguing that the contract was impossible to perform and therefore void. This doctrine, applicable as a default rule in general contract law, is controversial since unlike commercial parties it will be rare that an employee has the foresight or ability to contract around the rule. The Supreme Court recently emphasised in &quot;Gisda Cyf v Barratt&quot; that the &quot;need to segregate intellectually common law principles relating to contract law, even in the field of employment, from statutorily conferred rights is fundamental.&quot; This meant that when an employee claimed unfair dismissal, after accusations of allegedly inappropriate behaviour at a private party, the three-month time limit for her claim only began running when the employer had actually notified her. The general contract law principle that notifications take effect when arriving during business hours was not even &quot;a preliminary guide&quot; to the interpretation of the right to a fair dismissal.
Once it is established that a dismissal took place, the employer must show that its reason for dismissing the employee was &quot;fair&quot;. Dismissal on grounds of union membership, or one of a number of grounds set out in sections 99 to 107 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, will be automatically unfair. Otherwise the employer has the opportunity to show the dismissal is fair if it falls within five main categories listed in ERA 1996 section 98. The dismissal must have been because of the employee&#x27;s capability or qualifications, because of conduct, because the employee was redundant, because continued employment would contravene a law, or because of &quot;some other substantial reason&quot;. If the employer has an argument based on one of these categories, then the tribunal evaluates whether the employer&#x27;s actual decision fell within a &quot;reasonable range of responses&quot;, i.e. that a reasonable employer &quot;could&quot; have acted the same way. Thus the review standard lies in between an outright perversity, or &quot;&quot;Wednesbury&quot; unreasonableness&quot; test and a forthright reasonable person test. The test arguably requires Tribunals to evaluate the employer&#x27;s conduct according to good enterprise practice, by analogy to the &quot;Bolam&quot; test in tort. The &quot;proportionality test&quot; (requiring the employer&#x27;s action is appropriate, necessary and reasonable in pursuit of a legitimate aim) has also been proposed as an alternative, which would have the advantage of deferring to the employer&#x27;s aim, if legitimate, but scrutinising whether its actions were proportionate. In practice, the Court of Appeal has given conflicting judgments and remains unable to articulate what the test means, prompting the question of how a &quot;hypothetical reasonable employer&quot; standard under section 98(4)(a) should actually be applied. It has been repeated that Tribunals should not substitute their judgment for the employer&#x27;s. However, there is considerable room for Tribunals to assess the facts and come to their own conclusions, which can only be appealed on legal grounds, and not on their judgment of good workplace relations. For example, in a conduct case, &quot;HSBC Bank plc v Madden&quot;, the Court of Appeal held that it was acceptable for a Tribunal to have decided that dismissing an employee for potential involvement in theft of credit cards was fair, even though an actual police investigation turned up no evidence. By contrast, in &quot;Bowater v Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust&quot;, an employer argued a nurse who, while physically restraining a naked patient who was unconscious and having a seizure, said &quot;It&#x27;s been a few months since I have been in this position with a man underneath me&quot; was lewd and deserved dismissal for her misconduct. The Tribunal said the dismissal was unfair and the Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had competently exercised its discretion in granting the unfair dismissal claim. The absence of a role for elected worker representatives in assessing the fairness of the employer or manager&#x27;s conduct in the UK contrasts to many EU member states. While courts act as a final check, it is often thought that the parties best placed to resolve disputes would be representatives of all staff members, who (unlike an employer or manager) usually have fewer conflicts of interest in dismissal disputes.
While some courts have chosen to be more deferential to the employer&#x27;s substantive reasons for dismissal, they emphasise more strongly the importance of employers having a fair process. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service Code of Practice (2009) explains that good industry practice for disciplinaries requires, among other things, written warnings, a fair hearing by people who have no reason to side against the employee, or with any manager involved in the dispute, and the opportunity for union representation. Often a company handbook will include its own system, which if not followed will likely mean the dismissal was unfair. Nevertheless, in &quot;Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd&quot; the House of Lords held that, in a case where a van driver was told he was redundant on the spot, if an employer can show the dismissal would be made regardless of whether a procedure was followed, damages can be reduced to zero. In the Employment Act 2002, Parliament made an abortive attempt to instil some kind of mandatory minimum procedure for everybody, but after complaints from employers and unions alike that it was merely encouraging a &quot;tick-box&quot; culture, it was repealed in the Employment Act 2008. Now if the ACAS Code is not followed, and this is unreasonable, an unfair dismissal award can be increased by 25 per cent. Generally, under ERA 1996 sections 119 and 227, the principle for a &quot;basic&quot; unfair dismissal award is that, with a cap of £350 per week and a maximum of 20 weeks, an employee should receive one week&#x27;s pay for each year employed if aged between 22 and 40, 1½ weeks if over 40 and ½ a week if under 22. By ERA 1996 section 123, the employee may also be entitled to the more significant, but discretionary &quot;compensatory&quot; award. This should take into account the actual losses of the employee as just and equitable, based on loss of immediate and future wages, the manner of the dismissal and loss of future unfair dismissal protection and redundancy rights. This is capped, but usually increased in line with RPI inflation. It was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award of a successful claimant was merely £4,560. Very few claimants are successful in securing reinstatement, although if they are suspended from their workplace and colleagues, the evidence suggests that the experience of litigation sours the relationship so that the employee will no longer wish to return. It is therefore important that in 2011 the Supreme Court emphasised in &quot;Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital&quot; that in principle an employee may secure an injunction to continue working while internal disciplinary procedures are followed. Particularly given the difficulty of finding alternative employment while removed from work, it is not clear why a staff member who retains the support of his or her colleagues (as opposed to a manager who potentially has a conflict of interest) should not also be able to continue working until a dismissal is confirmed by a court.

===Redundancy===
Redundancies are a special kind of dismissal, which attract specific regulation. Since the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, staff must receive a payment for losing their jobs if the employer no longer has an economic need for their job. This policy is designed to internalise some of the social costs that employers create if they dismiss staff, to try and disincentivise unnecessary job losses, and contribute to employees&#x27; costs in unemployment. Under ERA 1996 section 162, employees over age 40 receive 1½ weeks&#x27; pay per year they had worked, employees aged 22 to 40 receive 1 week&#x27;s pay per year worked, and employees age 21 or less receive half a week&#x27;s pay, though the upper limit was £464 per week in 2014. Dismissal for redundancy counts &quot;fair&quot; in substance under ERA 1996 section 98, but the employer may still carry out an unfair procedure to dismiss the redundant employees. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 139, a &quot;redundancy&quot; exists when an employer&#x27;s demand for an employee&#x27;s role ceases or diminishes. In situations where employees have lost their jobs, this may be straightforward. In cases where an employer uses its discretion practically to worsen the employees&#x27; position the answer may depend on the employees&#x27; contracts. In &quot;Lesney Products &amp; Co v Nolan&quot; a toy company stopped giving its workers overtime. Some refused to work. They were dismissed, and the workers claimed they were redundant. Lord Denning MR held they were not made &quot;redundant&quot; by their terms being changed, even worsened, because &quot;nothing should be done to impair the ability of employers to reorganise their work force and their times and conditions of work so as to improve efficiency.&quot; Apparently, they had simply left stopped working of their own accord. This view is controversial, because if the total wage bill spent by the employer is reduced, it would follow that demand for work (reflected in the employer&#x27;s willingness to pay) must also be diminished. Thus, other courts have suggested the contract terms are irrelevant, and that the test should be purely based on the economic reality of diminished demand. Employers can also argue that a dismissal is for &quot;some other substantial reason&quot;. In &quot;Hollister v National Farmers&#x27; Union&quot; a farmer&#x27;s refusal to accept decreased pension entitlements, after a consultation process, was said to be a &quot;substantial&quot; reason for dismissal. It is not clear whether worsening employees&#x27; contract terms, without their consent or collective approval, was envisaged by the Act as way to evade redundancy payments.
Although workers could be redundant, the employer may still be liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In &quot;Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd&quot; Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers to lose their jobs based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in &quot;Rolls-Royce plc v Unite the Union&quot;, Rolls-Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if the offer is declined. &#x27;Suitable&#x27; means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in &quot;Thomas Wragg &amp; Sons Ltd v Wood&quot; the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except to the extent that the employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.

===Undertaking transfers and insolvency===
Another context in which the common law left workers particularly vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another. In &quot;Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd&quot; it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a personal right, and akin to a property right in their jobs. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted, the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the &quot;Acquired Rights Directive&quot;), required that a business transferee would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers&#x27; contracts. This means that the new employer who is a transferee of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company&#x27;s shares: contractual variations require the employees&#x27; consent and dismissal rights remain as if it were the old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in &quot;Litster v Forth Dry Dock&quot;. The House of Lords held that a purposive interpretation is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would still be there in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law&#x27;s normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance. The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the transferee employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clause or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.

An acute question for the TUPE Regulations, particularly in the years when the Conservative government was implementing a policy of shrinking the size of the public sector, was the extent they applied to jobs being outsourced, typically by a public body, like a local council, or changed between businesses in a competitive tender process for public procurement. On this point a series of ECJ decisions came to the view that there could be a relevant transfer, covered by the Directive, even where there was no contractual link between a transferor and a transferee business, so long as the business entity retained its &quot;identity&quot;. In turn the &quot;identity&quot; of a business would be determined by the degree to which the business&#x27; factors of production remained the same before and after a sale. It could be that no employees were hired after an asset sale, but the sacked employees would still have a claim because all their old workplace and capital equipment was being used by the new employer. It is also relevant to what extent a business is capital or labour-intensive. So in &quot;Oy Liikenne Ab v Liskojärvi&quot; the ECJ held that it was unlikely that 45 Helsinki bus drivers&#x27; contracts were transferred, between the company that lost the contract and the new bus company that won it, even though 33 drivers were rehired, because &quot;bus transport cannot be regarded as an activity based essentially on manpower&quot;. On the other hand, employees will benefit when a new employer offers old staff their jobs, the intention to rehire makes it more likely the court will deem there to be a transfer.
Often business transfers take place when a company has plunged into an insolvency procedure. If a company enters liquidation, which aims to wind down the business and sell off the assets, TUPER 2006 regulation 8(7) states that the rules on transfer will not apply. The main objective, however, in an insolvency procedure particularly since the Cork Report and the Enterprise Act 2002, is to effect rescues through the system of company administration. An administrator&#x27;s task under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paragraph 3, is either to rescue the company as a going concern, rescue the business typically by finding a suitable buyer and thus save jobs, or as a last resort put the company into liquidation. If employees are kept on after an administrator is appointed for more than 14 days, under paragraph 99 the administrator becomes responsible for adopting their contracts. The liability on contracts is limited to &quot;wages and salaries&quot;. This includes pay, holiday pay, sick pay and occupational pension contributions, but has been held to not include compensation for unfair dismissal cases, wrongful dismissal, or protective awards for failure to consult the workforce before redundancies. If the business rescue does ultimately fail, then such money due employees achieves the status of &quot;super priority&quot; among different creditors&#x27; claims.
The priority list in insolvency sees creditors with fixed security (typically banks) get paid first. Second are preferential creditors. Third are unsecured creditors up to a limit of £600,000. Fourth are floating charge holders (usually banks again). Fifth are remaining debts to unsecured creditors (in the unlikely event that anything remains). Sixth are &quot;deferred debts&quot; (typically to company insiders). Last are shareholders. Among the preferential creditors, the insolvency practitioners&#x27; fees together with adopted contracts attain super-priority. Otherwise, employees wages and pensions still have preferential status, but only up to an £800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986. Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897, and is justified on the ground that employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers&#x27; Claims (Employer&#x27;s Insolvency) Convention. Often this limited preference is not enough, and can take a long time to realise. Reflecting the Insolvency Protection Directive under ERA 1996 section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages. Under ERA 1996 section 182 the amount claimable is the same as that for unfair dismissal (£350 in 2010) for a limit of 8 weeks. If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks. The Pensions Act 2004 governs a separate system for protecting pension claims, through the Pension Protection Fund. This aims to fully insure all pension claims. Together with minimum redundancy payments, the guarantees of wages form a meagre cushion which requires more of a systematic supplementation when people remain unemployed.

===Full employment===
One of the most important labour rights, on which all other labour rights rest, is the &quot;right to work&quot; and therefore to full employment &quot;at fair wages&quot; and with all the hours one needs. In international law everyone &#x27;has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.&#x27; However it does not say how this should be achieved. In the UK, three main legal policies have been used: fiscal, monetary, and insurance. First, from the White Paper on &quot;Employment Policy&quot; in 1944, the UK government announced a strategy to spend money to counteract volatility in private investment in five-year blocks. Private spending can be prone to boom and bust, international investment can also, while consumer spending is generally more stable, and government spending can be actively managed. The government also passed the Distribution of Industry Act 1945, which ensured that investment was spread to regions as well as cities, and the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 which required larger firms to hire a quota of disabled people. Full employment, at almost zero cost to government, lasted until the 1973 oil crisis when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raises petrol prices, and so made the cost of running the economy higher. This inflation was argued by economists, such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek to prove there is a natural rate of unemployment, which makes attempts to get full employment impossible. While this theory lacked evidence, From 1979, the new Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher abandoned full employment as a goal, and triggered soaring inflation, as it began attacking organised labour. In 2019, the concept of a natural rate of unemployment, which supposedly was caused by stronger labour rights, has been abandoned by the head of the US Federal Reserve Bank. Briefly, the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 section 1 created a duty on government to report &#x27;annually on the progress which has been made towards full employment&#x27; but this was abandoned with the 2017 general election. Since 2010, while there has been decreasing unemployment, there has been a large rise in under-employment and the longest cuts to workers&#x27; wages since the industrial revolution. This suggests a reluctance of the government to strengthen the incomes and bargaining power of workers if it could decrease the power of corporate capital.
Second, the UK government, particularly since it abandoned using investment and fiscal policy, has emphasised monetary policy. The Bank of England as the UK&#x27;s central bank is able to influence private banks&#x27; lending rates by adjusting its interest rate for lending to them (the &quot;Bank of England base rate&quot;), by buying up assets in large quantities backed by the UK government, by changing reserve requirements, or by fixing rates. If private banks are influenced to reduced their interest rates, this stimulates more lending and borrowing, increases credit and money supply in the economy, encourages businesses to hire more people, and so can reduce employment. However, the Bank of England Act 1998 section 11 states the Bank&#x27;s objectives for monetary policy are (a) to maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to &#x27;support the economic policy of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.&#x27; Although the Bank of England could use monetary policy to encourage investment up to full employment it has not done so because it has also been affected by theories of &quot;natural&quot; unemployment, and triggering higher inflation. Third, the UK government has considerable control over unemployment through its social insurance system. Since the poor laws were abolished and national insurance was introduced, the government has paid people money if they cannot find work. Paying insurance was thought to impel the government to encourage full employment, while it also increases labour&#x27;s bargaining power: workers need not accept any job on starvation wages, because they will have a minimum income to survive. This is part of the universal right to social security. Today under the Jobseekers Act 1995 a &#x27;Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance&#x27; is payable for up to 182 days if someone has made contributions for over 2 years, but for people over 25 this was only up to £73.10 a week in 2019. Further, under the Welfare Reform Act 2012 sections 6-6J the Secretary of State can write rules to place conditions for work on people claiming jobseeker&#x27;s allowance. In &quot;R (Reilly) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions&quot; two claimants argued that requirements to work for free were ultra vires, and also amounted to forced labour. The Secretary of State lost on the ultra vires point, but the Supreme Court declined to hold that &quot;workfare&quot; amounted to forced labour. Nevertheless, it appears from the original conception of William Beveridge of a welfare state with &quot;Full Employment in a Free Society&quot;.

==Enforcement and tribunals==
UK labour law is enforced through three main methods: trade unions, the Tribunal and court system, and by government agencies. First, the most effective system of enforcement and creation of labour rights it through workers joining unions, and collectively bargaining. Whatever rights exist in law, employers routinely flout people&#x27;s rights at work, particularly when the rights involve more complex standards of equality, job security and consultation. The desire to keep a cohesive workforce, and avoid the possibility of strike action, is the primary incentive for employers to negotiate in good faith with employee representatives, and ensure that there is a joint approach to upholding all workplace rights, such as pay, working time, safety, equal treatment and job security. Unions also advise and represent individual workers in grievances and disciplinaries and are protected by law in the conduct of all trade union activities.

Second, any worker can apply to an Employment Tribunal to complain that a right has been breached under the Employment Tribunals Act 1996. &quot;R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor&quot; held that the UK government&#x27;s attempt to impose fees, which led to a massive drop in people&#x27;s access to justice, was unlawful. To bring a Tribunal claim, a claimant must fill out an &quot;ET1&quot; form, and give notice to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service of its attempt to seek conciliation. After a Tribunal judgment, either side may appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, and following this to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court on questions of law. A significant limit on Tribunal applications is that Tribunals have been held unable to award injunctions. By contrast, any claim for breach of contract, including several rights in the Equality Act 2010, can be brought in the High Court: the right to an injunction is in principle available for all types of contractual right, particularly to ensure fairness in dismissal, since damages are usually not an adequate remedy. Third, a small number of government regulators may assist in the enforcement of rights. Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue &amp; Customs is meant to oversee the enforcement of tax, National Insurance and payment of the minimum wage. Under the Equality Act 2006, the Equality and Human Rights Commission was established, and although it has no enforcement powers, it can join litigation, and it develops codes of best practice for employers to use. The Central Arbitration Committee is meant to support trade union rights, such as to statutory recognition and to information, but in practice is a toothless, pro-employer operation, packed with government appointees that has systematically opposed union rights. The Health and Safety Executive is meant to enforce health and safety rights, but again is appointed by government and has been largely ineffective in preventing mass safety violations during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority oversees enforcement of a limited number of employment agencies in food packing and shellfish industries, and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate has a role for agencies.

==International labour law==
Since the Industrial Revolution the labour movement has been concerned how economic globalisation would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without the protection of the labour standards at home. Following World War I, the Treaty of Versailles contained the first constitution of a new International Labour Organization founded on the principle that &quot;labour is not a commodity&quot;, and for the reason that &quot;peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice&quot;. The primary role of the ILO has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing ILO Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the Working Time Directive adopts its principles, subject to the individual opt-out. The present constitution of the ILO comes from the Declaration of Philadelphia 1944, and under the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 1998 classified eight conventions as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos 87 and 98) abolition of forced labour (29 and 105) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school (138 and 182) and no discrimination at work (Nos 100 and 111). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states&#x27; progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis.
Because the ILO&#x27;s enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation&#x27;s operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a &quot;social clause&quot; to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country&#x27;s industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that &quot;the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.&quot; On this view, countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.
While the debate over labour standards applied by the ILO and the WTO seeks to balance standards with free movement of capital globally, conflicts of laws (or private international law) issues arise where workers move from home to go abroad. If a worker from the UK performs part of her job in other countries (a &quot;peripatetic&quot; worker) or if a worker is engaged in the UK to work as an expatriate abroad, an employer may seek to characterise the contract of employment as being governed by other countries&#x27; laws, where labour rights may be less favourable than at home. In &quot;Lawson v Serco Ltd&quot; three joined appeals went to the House of Lords. Lawson worked for a multinational business on Ascension Island, a British territory as a security guard. Botham worked in Germany for the Ministry of Defence. Crofts, and his copilots, worked mostly in the air for a Hong Kong airline, though his contract stated he was based at Heathrow. All sought to claim unfair dismissal, but their employers argued they should not be covered by the territorial reach of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Lord Hoffmann held that, first, if workers are in Great Britain, they are covered. Second, peripatetic workers like Crofts would be covered if they are ordinarily working in the UK, but that this could take account of the company&#x27;s basings policy. Third, if workers were expatriate the general rule was they would not be covered, but that exceptionally if there was a &quot;close connection&quot; between the work and the UK they would be covered. This meant that Lawson and Botham would have claims, because both Lawson and Botham&#x27;s position was in a British enclave, which made a close enough connection. Subsequent cases have emphasised that the categories of expatriate worker who will exceptionally be covered are not closed. So in &quot;Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families&quot; an employee of the UK government teaching in EU schools could claim unfair dismissal because their employer held their connection close to the UK. Then, in &quot;Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd&quot; an employee in Libya, working for a German company that was part of the American multinational oil conglomerate Halliburton, was still covered by UK unfair dismissal rights because he was given an assurance that his contract would come under UK law. This established a close connection. The result is that access to mandatory employment rights mirrors the framework for contractual claims under the EU Rome I Regulation article 8. It is also necessary that a UK court has jurisdiction to hear a claim, which under the Brussels I Regulation articles 20 to 23, requires the worker habitually works in the UK, or was engaged there. Both EU Regulations emphasise that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.

As well as having legal protection for workers rights, an objective of trade unions has been to organise their members across borders in the same way that multinational corporations have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strike internationally. However, this kind of coordination was halted in the European Union in two decisions. In &quot;Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union&quot; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this &quot;shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers&quot;. Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the &quot;host&quot; state&#x27;s legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the &quot;posting&quot; state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the &quot;host&quot; state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business&#x27; freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in &quot;The Rosella&quot;, the ECJ also held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business&#x27; right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers&#x27; &quot;right to strike&quot; in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business&#x27; establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice&#x27;s recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests. For this reason it has been questioned whether the ECJ&#x27;s decisions were compatible with fundamental human rights, particularly the freedom of association guaranteed by article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

<doc id="402030" wikidata="Q13427787" url="?curid=402030" title="German Expellees">
<text>The German Expellees or Heimatvertriebene (, &quot;homeland expellees&quot;) are 12–16 million German citizens (regardless of ethnicity) and ethnic Germans (regardless of citizenship) who fled or were expelled after World War II from parts of Germany annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union and from other countries (the so-called &quot;einheitliches Vertreibungsgebiet&quot;, i.e. uniform territory of expulsion), who found refuge in both West and East Germany, and Austria.

Refugees who had fled voluntarily but were later refused permission to return are often not distinguished from those who were forcibly deported. By the definition of the West German Federal Expellee Law, enacted on 19 May 1953, refugees of German citizenship or German ethnicity, whose return to their home places was denied, were treated like expellees, thus the frequent general usage of the term expellees for refugees alike.

Distinguished are refugees and expellees who had neither German citizenship nor German ethnicity but as a matter of fact had fled or been expelled from their former domiciles and stranded in West Germany or West Berlin before 1951. They were taken care of – as part of the displaced persons – by international refugee organisations until 1951 and then by West German authorities granting them the extra status of &quot;heimatloser Ausländer&quot; with preferential naturalisation rules, distinct from other legal aliens or stateless people. Occupational functionaries and other German expatriates, who had moved to German-annexed or German-occupied foreign territory only due to the war were not considered expellees by law unless they showed circumstances (such as marrying a resident of the respective area) providing for the intention to settle abroad also for the time after the war. Besides the narrow legal definition for the Heimatvertriebene, there were also other groups accepted as Vertriebene (expellees) such as the Aussiedler. These comprised refugees and emigrants either originally of foreign citizenship but of German ethnicity, or who themselves or whose ancestors had involuntarily lost German citizenship, coming from the above-mentioned uniform territory of expulsion or from Albania, Bulgaria, China, Romania, the Soviet Union, or Yugoslavia, and arriving only after the end of general expulsions but not later as 31 December 1992.

In a document signed in 1950 the &quot;Heimatvertriebene&quot; organisations recognised the plight of the different groups of people living in today&#x27;s Poland who were resettled there by force. The Heimatvertriebene are just one (but by far the largest) of the groups of millions of other people, from many countries, who all found refuge in today&#x27;s Germany.

Some of the expellees are active in politics and belong to the political right wing. In West Germany in 1950, a special expellee party - All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights (GB/BHE) was founded, that was active in the 1950s. Many others do not belong to any organizations, but they continue to maintain what they call a lawful right to their homeland. The vast majority pledged to work peacefully towards that goal while rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe.

The expellees are still highly active in German politics, and are one of the major social groups of the nation, with around 2 million members. A president of the Federation of Expellees was a member of the Bundestag. Although expellees and their descendants were active in West German politics, the prevailing political climate within West Germany was that of atonement for Nazi actions. However, the CDU governments have shown considerable support for the expellees and German civilian victims.

==Expellee towns==
As a result of the huge influx of expellees, there was a massive increase of population in some areas such as Mecklenburg (where population numbers doubled), and in some places the previous homogeneity of the population was broken by Protestant expellees moving to a purely Catholic area or vice versa. The population numbers of a number of small settlements in West Germany exploded permanently due to a refugee camp on their territory or nearby. Examples of this phenomenon include &quot;Neugablonz&quot;, a quarter of Kaufbeuren in Bavaria, founded by the expellees and named after Gablonz (Jablonec nad Nisou). Neugablonz nowadays makes up a third of the town&#x27;s population. An extreme example of the population explosion is Neutraubling (also in Bavaria), which had 53 inhabitants in 1947, 1300 in 1951, and 3800 in 1960. Since the refugee camps were mostly located on the sites of former hidden ammunition factories, most of these &quot;Vertriebenenstädte&quot; are located in a (former) forest. See also Espelkamp.

<text>Idaho State University (ISU) is a public research university in Pocatello, Idaho, United States. Founded in 1901 as the Academy of Idaho, Idaho State offers more than 250 programs at its main campus in Pocatello and locations in Meridian, Idaho Falls, and Twin Falls. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity

More than 12,000 students attend Idaho State, with 57 percent of enrollment female and 43 percent male. The student-teacher ratio at Idaho State is 13:1 and 58 percent of students take classes full-time.

== History ==

On March 11, 1901, Governor Frank W. Hunt signed Senate Bill 53, to establish the Academy of Idaho, contingent upon private land donations being made for its site. Theodore F. Turner, mayor of Pocatello, settled the issue (Battle of the Blocks) by securing a permanent location for the academy. The Academy of Idaho officially opened its doors on September 22, 1902. Theodore Swanson, a member of the board of trustees, secured the services of John W. Faris as the first administrator, with the title of principal. By 1910, enrollment had reached nearly 300 students, and the academy had purchased four additional city blocks in Pocatello to meet its growing needs.

The Academy of Idaho was renamed Idaho Technical Institute in 1915. The end of World War I brought an influx of students to the school, and enrollment surged to more than 1,000 students. In the early 1920s, the institution officially adopted the Bengal as the school&#x27;s mascot. Ralph Hutchinson was head football coach from 1920 to 1927, and he pushed to establish the tiger mascot and incorporate orange and black as the official colors. Hutchinson was an alumnus of Princeton, a university with a tiger mascot.

The institution was renamed in 1927, this time as the University of Idaho–Southern Branch, and continued as a two-year school, overseen by John R. Nichols. an executive dean. During World War II, Idaho was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

After Nichols left in 1946, Carl McIntosh, an associate professor of speech, was named the acting executive dean in January 1947. That March, the school was elevated to four-year status and officially became Idaho State College. At the age of 32, McIntosh was appointed the first president of Idaho State College, and he was one of the youngest college presidents in the United States. Although McIntosh was not originally interested in being an administrator, once the school became an independent college, he decided to remain president and see the institution through its early growing pains. Idaho State College was accredited as a four-year degree granting institution in December 1948, after much work by McIntosh and the faculty. Enrollment reached 2,000 in 1949. McIntosh left ISC in 1959 to become president of Long Beach State College, and he was succeeded by Donald E. Walker.

In 1963, ISC was renamed for the fifth and final time to Idaho State University, reflecting its new status as a four-year public university. In the ensuing years, Idaho State continuously expanded both its enrollment and the programs it offered. The presidency of Richard (Dick) Bowen, from 1985 to 2005, is particularly regarded as an era of growth. Bowen served as the president of Idaho State for 20 years, and Connie, his wife, dedicated her time to cultivating community relationships and enhancing long-standing campus traditions. During their tenure at ISU, the Bowens brought several projects forward, including the Stephens Performing Arts Center and Rendezvous Center. Bowen resigned after a vote of no confidence from the faculty, who were angered by generous pay raises for administration members in the midst of calls for fiscal austerity.

Arthur Vailas, former vice chancellor of the University of Houston System and vice president of the University of Houston in Texas, became president of Idaho State on July 1, 2006. He succeeded Michael Gallagher, who had served as interim president for one year during the transition. In February 2011, a majority of ISU faculty voted no confidence in Vailas and called for his resignation. This was also followed by a vote of no confidence by the students. Although Vailas faced mounting criticism and pressure from faculty and students to step down, he refused to resign and campus tension intensified. In February 2011, the Idaho State Board of Education decided to suspend the University&#x27;s faculty senate. As a result of the move, in June 2011, the American Association of University Professors censured ISU. In June 2019, the AAUP removed Idaho State from the list of sanctioned institutions.

Vailas announced his retirement in August 2017, but he continued to serve as president until the expiration of his contract on June 17, 2018. He was succeeded by Kevin D. Satterlee.

== Points of interest ==
The elevation of its main campus in Pocatello is approximately above sea level.

Idaho State, along with the Idaho National Laboratory and other Idaho universities, worked to establish the Center for Advanced Energy Studies in 2007. Renovation of the ESTEC building began in summer 2007, after a team from ISU&#x27;s College of Technology, Idaho National Laboratory, and Partners for Prosperity received grants totaling more than $2.5 million.

In fiscal year 2011, ISU underwent a reorganization designed to allow for better interdisciplinary research and collaboration. The School of Performing Arts was created to allow students to collaborate, learn, and perform at the next level. The Kasiska Division of Health Sciences, which includes the College of Pharmacy and College of Health, was reorganized to provide interdisciplinary education while serving the community through ISU&#x27;s 18 clinics.

In 2011, ISU purchased the $3.6 million former Ballard Medical facility and The ISU Research and Innovation in Science and Engineering Complex (RISE) was created. At that time, research was focused on a Crystal Growth Laboratory (it can grow giant crystals to support nuclear science and engineering programs), High Power Laser/Optics Laboratory, Imaging Laboratory, and a Human Interactive Environment Simulation Laboratory. RISE was eventually closed, and the facility underwent a remodel to become the William M. and Karin A. Eames Advanced Technical Education and Innovations Complex, which is home to many College of Technology programs. 

==Academics==

Established in 2011, the Career Path Internship (CPI) program provides students an opportunity to gain professional experience while in school. All CPI internships are paid positions that are aligned with the student&#x27;s major or career goals. In 2016 the CPI program provided professional experience in approximately 1,000 internships both on and off campus. The CPI program has seen exceptional growth in past years with a 2016 budget estimated at $2.3 million.

ISU offers two doctoral level nursing programs after the Idaho State Board of Education approved a doctoral degree in advanced nursing practice, which will now give ISU two doctoral-level nursing programs. The first offered is a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in nursing beginning summer 2013 and the only one in the state.

ISU received top designation for nuclear training and was tagged Regional Center of Excellence.
The Energy Systems Technology and Education Center (ESTEC) at the ISU College of Technology will soon be coordinating the nuclear energy education and training for technicians in a nine-state region. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) has designated ESTEC as the Northwest Regional Center of Excellence for Nuclear Education and Training. The top designation includes the states of Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah, and Nebraska. ESTEC is one of five regional NEI-designated centers in the country.

ISU&#x27;s new doctoral experimental psychology program, the only program of its type in Idaho, accepted its first three students fall 2011. The new experimental psychology doctoral program complements ISU&#x27;s doctoral clinical psychology program, created in the early 1990s. Eventually, the experimental psychology program plans to accept six students annually. A new Idaho State University geosciences doctoral program is approved to begin in August 2013.

The Center for Sports Concussion at ISU, opened in 2009, is housed within the Department of Sport Science and Physical Education. The purpose of the Center for Sports Concussion is to offer educational outreach on concussion identification and management practices to athletic administrators, coaches, and parent groups throughout Idaho in accordance with Idaho law and demonstrated need, and to facilitate baseline and post-concussion neuro-cognitive testing to athletes participating in sports programs throughout eastern Idaho.

The university awards &quot;The Teaching Literature Book Award&quot; for the best book on teaching literature at the post-secondary or graduate level. The prize is conferred in odd numbered years, and the inaugural award was conferred in 2015. Past winners included Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz and Fiona McHardy for the book &quot;From Abortion to Pederasty: Addressing Difficult Topics in the Classics Classroom&quot;.

== Research ==
At the CORE, ISU faculty and students are performing research and scholarship that is leading to the mechanistic understanding of autism, the relationship between sleep and addictive behaviors, and incorporating research into evidence-based practice. In 2010 ISU obtained a new biochemistry laboratory and was finished in time for the fall 2011 semester.

In 2012 ISU researchers in the Bearden Vascular Health Laboratory found clues on how to block the effects of a chemical in the brain that contributes to dementia and strokes. The fight against dementia is gaining ground at Idaho State University thanks to ongoing research that could one day change the way the disease is prevented.

In 2013 A team of Idaho State University researchers discovered that fish show autism-like gene expression after exposure to water containing psychoactive pharmaceuticals. This study was published in June in the open access journal PLoS ONE and was widely publicized nationally and internationally.

==Health sciences==
Idaho State&#x27;s Kasiska Division of Health Sciences (KDHS) houses the majority of health-related professional programs in Idaho. The KDHS Family Medicine Residency Program is the only medical education program sponsored by an Idaho university.

Each year, the ISU Health Center receives more than 10,000 visits from students. The center treats patients for all types of medical issues and consultation costs are lower in comparison to mainstream health services across the country.

In 2009, Idaho State opened a new campus in Meridian, Idaho that delivers health professional programs as an addition to Idaho&#x27;s Project 60 economic development initiative. In 2011 the Delta Dental Clinic was opened at the ISU-Meridian Health Science Center to serve low-income patients and provide advanced training for dentists. The clinic consists of 17 clinical treatment rooms.

The ISU Meridian Health Science Center plans to open a new anatomy and physiology lab in 2014. The new lab, consisting of &quot;state of the art&quot; virtual applications, will allow students to work directly with the human body and its functions.

==Arts==
In 1998, Idaho State University received a gift of $10 million from Thelma E. Stephens. It was seed funding for the $34 million center that would bear the Stephens&#x27; names. Construction began June 10, 2002. The center&#x27;s design and construction was funded primarily through the support of hundreds of private donors as part of the university&#x27;s $152.5 million capital campaign to fund a variety of needs.
In fall 2013, ISU began to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree in dance. The new major is the only one of its kind offered within Idaho&#x27;s university system. With the new Bachelor of Arts degree in choreography and performance, ISU&#x27;s School of Performing Arts now consists of majors in music, theatre and dance.

==Student life==

Student government is administered by the Associated Students of Idaho State University (ASISU). Each year a president and vice-president are elected by the student body to administer and oversee a variety of activities either partially or fully funded by tuition-based fees. The ASISU Senate is the association&#x27;s legislative body. Made up of 20 student members elected by the students of each individual college (allocation of seats being based on enrollment of each college), the ASISU Senate is primarily responsible for allocating the ASISU budget.

The Student Activities Board, formerly the ASISU Program Board, oversees most of the student activity programming on campus. The board plans concerts, movie showings, homecoming activities, athletic-related events and other activities generally associated with student life.

Reed Gym features recreational facilities, including a climbing wall, swimming pool, tennis courts, and more. The Pond Student Union operates a movie theater, billiard room, and bowling alley, and hosts many student club activities. Fine arts events are regularly featured at the performing arts theater.

ISU has more than 140 registered professional, academic, cultural, service and social student organizations. The cultural organizations host some of the largest events on campus with their &quot;Cultural Nights&quot; celebrations. There are currently four fraternity and sorority chapters that are recognized by the university.

Students at ISU are represented by the Associated Students of Idaho State University (ASISU). Every year the students elect a president, vice-president, and 20 senators. ASISU has administrative oversight of the 140 student organizations and provides funding to various groups that provide student involvement, leadership and service opportunities and events.

Student media on campus includes The Bengal, a weekly student-run newspaper and KISU-FM (91.1). KISU-FM broadcasts from the first floor of the Pond Student Union, serving the university and surrounding communities with alternative music, NPR programming, and live coverage of ISU women athletics. In 2010, KISU-FM and the university developed a monthly public affairs talk show FIRST MONDAY: Idaho State University Forum. The show provides insight into the university&#x27;s programs, accomplishments and local interests.

The Pond Student Union, or SUB, serves as the community center for the university. The SUB consists of three floors that house among other things the campus bookstore, student government and organization offices, Outdoor Adventure Center, craft shop, ISU Credit Union, offices of the Vice President for Student Affairs, bowling alley, movie theater, Veterans Sanctuary, LEAD Center and numerous conference/banquet rooms used for meeting and large scale campus events. The SUB is also home for Campus Connection, a one stop shop for event tickets, photo ID and campus information (282-INFO).

The 255,000 square foot, five-level Rendezvous Complex built in 2007 is centrally located on the Idaho State University campus. The complex houses 50 classrooms, ranging from 15-seat seminar rooms to a 250-seat lecture hall. Other facilities in the Rendezvous include a large computer center and a large meeting room with partitions for conversion into three small meeting rooms, 80 student apartments with 301 beds and the Mind&#x27;s Eye Art Gallery.

The Cooperative Wilderness Handicapped Outdoor Group, otherwise known as CW HOG, is a regional self-help group that was formed in 1981 to provide recreational opportunities for people of all abilities. CW HOG is kept going through dedicated volunteers.

In August 2010, Reed Gym announced the opening of a new addition, the Student Recreation Center, giving Reed nearly 100,000 square feet of recreational opportunities. Additions include added weight and endurance facilities, additional classrooms and teaching facilities, as well as open and window viewing areas to the four indoor tennis courts. Other amenities include racquetball courts, an auxiliary gym, a track, climbing wall, swimming pool, and spinning/multi-purpose rooms.

==Student housing==
Idaho State University operates several residence halls and apartment complexes for its students.

Residence halls include Rendezvous Hall, Turner Hall, Nichols Hall, Owen Hall, and Redfield Hall. On-campus apartments include Bengal Studios , McIntosh Manor (Building #57), Pulling Courts (Building #53), Ridge Crest Townhomes (Building #54), Schubert Heights, University Courts, and West Campus Apartments.

Students with dependent children may live in McIntosh Manor, Pulling Courts, and Ridge Crest Townhouses. Residents are within the Pocatello/Chubbuck School District. Zoned schools include Washington Elementary School, Franklin Middle School, and Century High School.

==Athletics==

The Idaho State University Bengals compete as a member school of the Big Sky Conference in the NCAA Division I FCS. ISU won the NCAA Division I-AA national championship in football in 1981. It also won NCAA national championships in boxing as Idaho State College in 1953 and 1957.

In more recent years ISU has been competitive in track and field, winning the Big Sky Conference Indoor title in 2005 and 2006. The women&#x27;s track and field team won their first outdoors women&#x27;s Big Sky conference in 2007 with a score of 140.5 over Weber State. Dave Nielson was named the Big Sky Coach of the Year in women&#x27;s track and field, and was later named the Mountain Region&#x27;s Outdoor Women&#x27;s Coach of the Year.

Home football games are played at the ICCU Dome (formerly known as Holt Arena), which has a seating capacity of 12,000 for football games and is the oldest enclosed stadium on a college campus in the United States. The ICCU Dome also hosts indoor track and field events.

For years the Bengals enjoyed athletic rivalries with the Boise State Broncos and the University of Idaho Vandals of Moscow. However, in football these rivalries diminished significantly after both BSU and UI left the Big Sky in 1996 to move up to Division I-A. The Bengals still enjoy a healthy rivalry in basketball with both the University of Idaho, who they have dominated in recent years; and Boise State, who has dominated ISU in recent years. With the University of Idaho moving back to Division I FCS in 2018, they, along with the Weber State Wildcats of Ogden, Utah, and the Portland State Vikings of Portland, Oregon, have become Idaho State&#x27;s main rivals.

Idaho State also offers a rugby program that plays in Division II. Idaho State offers scholarships to rugby players in the form of allowing out-of-state students to pay the in-state tuition rate. Idaho State finished the 2010 regular season ranked ninth in Division II. Idaho State reached the semifinals of the 2011 Mountain 7s tournament, and reached the semifinals of the 2012 Pacific Coast championship.

In January 1968, the ISU student body voted on and approved the construction of the ASISU Minidome by a majority vote of 57 percent not to exceed $2.8 million and was financed by student revenue bonds. The Minidome opened in 1970 and was renamed as Holt Arena in 1988. It hosts on average 300,000 to 400,000 annually and events have an estimated annual economic impact of $15 to 20 million. Since its opening, Holt Arena events have provided roughly $600 million of economic impact to the local community.

Davis Field, home of ISU track and soccer, was built in 1936 as a public works project. It was originally called the &quot;Spud Bowl&quot; and is located at the base of Red Hill on lower campus. After Holt Arena was built, the football field became home to the Bengal track and field program, and the name was changed to honor Bud Davis, ISU&#x27;s president from 1965 to 1975. In 1998, women&#x27;s soccer was added as a varsity sport and Davis Field became its home.

ISU started a softball program in 1976, but the program was dropped after the 1983 season. In 2007, the program was reestablished. In 2011, Idaho State completed Miller Ranch Stadium, the home of Bengal softball. The Big Sky Conference added softball in 2013 and ISU won the first ever regular season Big Sky title. (40) 
ISU won the NCAA Division I-AA national championship in football in 1981. The Bengals also won NCAA national championships in boxing as Idaho State College in 1953 and 1957. ISU cross country team meets on the Centennial Course. The course is located east of the main campus at the Idaho State Research Park. The Bengals opened the course in 2002 and hosted the Big Sky Championship that same year.

Reed Gym is the refurbished home of Idaho State women&#x27;s basketball, tennis, and volleyball. Featuring a seating capacity of 3,040, the building was remodeled in 2002 and officially reopened on December 17. It is also the home of the men&#x27;s basketball team on occasions when Holt Arena is unavailable. In more recent years, ISU has been competitive in track and field, winning the Big Sky Conference indoor title in 2005 and 2006. The women&#x27;s track and field team won its first women&#x27;s outdoor Big Sky title in 2007. The women&#x27;s soccer program won its fifth Big Sky Championship in 15 years in 2012 and the women&#x27;s basketball program won its third Big Sky title since 2001.

In the spring of 2011, ISU&#x27;s athletic department became fully certified without condition by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In the summer of 2010, the university received NCAA certification with one condition. To meet the NCAA requirement, ISU constructed a new women&#x27;s softball complex and increased funding for the program, completed new intercollegiate locker rooms for women&#x27;s volleyball, softball and basketball, and increased the number of women&#x27;s athletic scholarships.

Through partnerships between ISU Athletics, ISU Credit Union and Idaho Central Credit Union, ISU received a new basketball court and football field in 2011. The official name of the Bengal basketball facility is Idaho Central Credit Union Court at Holt Arena. Reed Gym is called Idaho Central Credit Union Court at Reed Gym.

In 2013, the ISU Athletics finished third in the Big Sky Conference President&#x27;s Cup. The third-place finish was the highest ever by ISU&#x27;s Athletics department. ISU placed first in the conference in overall academics. Academically, Idaho State had a record 183 student-athletes named to Big Sky All-Academic teams in the academic year.

<text>Chancroid ( ) is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful sores on the genitalia. Chancroid is known to spread from one individual to another solely through sexual contact. However, there have been reports of accidental infection through the hand.

==Signs and symptoms==

These are only local and no systemic manifestations are present. The ulcer characteristically:
* Ranges in size dramatically from 3 to 50 mm (1/8 inch to 2 inches) across
* Is painful
* Has sharply defined, undermined borders
* Has irregular or ragged borders, &quot;described as saucer-shaped&quot;.
* Has a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material
* Has a base that bleeds easily if traumatized or scraped
* Painful swollen lymph nodes occur in 30–60% of patients.
* Dysuria (pain with urination) and dyspareunia (pain with intercourse) in females

About half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women frequently have four or more ulcers, with fewer symptoms. The ulcers are typically confined to the genital region most of the time.

The initial ulcer may be mistaken as a &quot;hard&quot; chancre, the typical sore of primary syphilis, as opposed to the &quot;soft chancre&quot; of chancroid.

Approximately one-third of the infected individuals will develop enlargements of the inguinal lymph nodes, the nodes located in the fold between the leg and the lower abdomen.

Half of those who develop swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes will progress to a point where the nodes rupture through the skin, producing draining abscesses. The swollen lymph nodes and abscesses are often referred to as buboes.

===Complications===
* Extensive lymph node inflammation may develop.
* Large inguinal abscesses may develop and rupture to form draining sinus or giant ulcer.
* Superinfection by &quot;Fusarium&quot; and &quot;Bacteroides&quot;. These later require debridement and may result in disfiguring scars.
* Phimosis can develop in long-standing lesion by scarring and thickening of foreskin, which may subsequently require circumcision.

=== Sites for chancroid lesions ===

==== Males ====
* Internal and external surface of prepuce.
* Coronal sulcus
* Frenulum
* Shaft of penis
* Prepucial orifice
* Urethral meatus
* Glans penis
* Perineum area

==== Females ====
* Labia majora is the most common site. &quot;Kissing ulcers&quot; may develop. These are ulcers that occur on opposing surfaces of the labia.
* Labia minora
* Fourchette
* Vestibule
* Clitoris
* Perineal area
* Inner thighs

==Causes==
Chancroid is a bacterial infection caused by the fastidious Gram-negative streptobacillus &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot;. This pathogen is highly infectious&quot;.&quot; It is a disease found primarily in developing countries, most prevalent in low socioeconomic groups, associated with commercial sex workers.

Chancroid, caused by &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; has infrequently been associated with cases of genital ulcer disease in the US but has been isolated in up to 10% of genital ulcers diagnosed from sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics in Memphis and Chicago.

Infection levels are very low in the Western world, typically around one case per two million of the population (Canada, France, Australia, UK and US). Most individuals diagnosed with chancroid have visited countries or areas where the disease is known to occur frequently, although outbreaks have been observed in association with crack cocaine use and prostitution.

Chancroid is a risk factor for contracting HIV, due to their ecological association or shared risk of exposure, and biologically facilitated transmission of one infection by the other. Approximately 10% of people with chancroid will have a co-infection with syphilis and/or HIV.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; enters skin through microabrasions incurred during sexual intercourse. The incubation period of the infection is 10 to 14 days, after which there is progression of the disease. A local tissue reaction leads to development of erythematous papule, which progresses to pustule in 4–7 days. It then undergoes central necrosis to ulcerate.

==Diagnosis==

===Variants===
Some of clinical variants are as follows.
===Laboratory findings===
From bubo pus or ulcer secretions, &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; can be identified using special culture media; however, there is a &lt;80% sensitivity. PCR-based identification of the organisms is available, but none in the United States are FDA-cleared. Simple, rapid, sensitive and inexpensive antigen detection methods for &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; identification are also popular. Serologic detection of &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; uses outer membrane protein and lipooligosaccharide. &quot;Most of the time, the diagnosis is based on presumptive approach using the symptomatology which in this case includes multiple painful genital ulcers&quot;&quot;.&quot;

===Differential diagnosis===

Despite many distinguishing features, the clinical spectrums of following diseases may overlap with chancroid:
* Primary syphilis
* Genital herpes
Practical clinical approach for this STI as genital ulcer disease is to rule out top differential diagnosis of syphilis and herpes and consider empirical treatment for chancroid as testing is not commonly done for the latter.

==== Comparison with syphilis ====
There are many differences and similarities between the conditions syphilitic chancre and chancroid:

;Similarities
* Both originate as pustules at the site of inoculation, and progress to ulcerated lesions
* Both lesions are typically 1–2 cm in diameter
* Both lesions are caused by sexually transmissible organisms
* Both lesions typically appear on the genitals of infected individuals
* Both lesions can be present at multiple sites and with multiple lesions

;Differences
* Chancre is a lesion typical of infection with the bacterium that causes syphilis, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;
* Chancroid is a lesion typical of infection with the bacterium &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot;
* Chancres are typically painless, whereas chancroid are typically painful
* Chancres are typically non-exudative, whereas chancroid typically have a grey or yellow purulent exudate
* Chancres have a hard (indurated) edge, whereas chancroid have a soft edge
* Chancres heal spontaneously within three to six weeks, even in the absence of treatment
* Chancres can occur in the pharynx as well as on the genitals

==Prevention==
Chancroid spreads in populations with high sexual activity, such as prostitutes. Use of condom, prophylaxis by azithromycin, syndromic management of genital ulcers, treating patients with reactive syphilis serology are some of the strategies successfully tried in Thailand. Also, treatment of sexual partners is advocated whether they develop symptoms or not as long as there was unprotected sexual intercourse with the patient within 10 days of developing the symptoms.

==Treatment==
For the initial stages of the lesion, cleaning with soapy solution is recommended and sitz bath may be beneficial. Fluctuant nodules may require aspiration. Treatment may include more than one prescribed medication.

=== Antibiotics ===
Macrolides are often used to treat chancroid. The CDC recommendation is either a single oral dose (1 gram) of azithromycin, a single IM dose (250 mg) of ceftriaxone, oral (500 mg) of erythromycin three times a day for seven days, or oral (500 mg) of ciprofloxacin twice a day for three days. Due to a paucity of reliable empirical evidence it is not clear whether macrolides are actually more effective and/or better tolerated than other antibiotics when treating chancroid. Data is limited, but there have been reports of ciprofloxacin and erythromycin resistance.

Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin has been used to successfully treat chancroid; however aminoglycoside-resistant strain of &quot;H. ducreyi&quot; have been observed in both laboratory and clinical settings.[7] Treatment with aminoglycosides should be considered as only a supplement to a primary treatment.

Pregnant and lactating women, or those below 18 years of age regardless of gender, should not use ciprofloxacin as treatment for chancroid. Treatment failure is possible with HIV co-infection and extended therapy is sometimes required.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is excellent with proper treatment. Treating sexual contacts of affected individual helps break cycle of infection.

=== Follow-up ===
Within 3–7 days after commencing treatment, patients should be re-examined to determine whether the treatment was successful. Within 3 days, symptoms of ulcers should improve. Healing time of the ulcer depends mainly on size and can take more than two weeks for larger ulcers. In uncircumcised men, healing is slower if the ulcer is under the foreskin. Sometimes, needle aspiration or incision and drainage are necessary.

== Epidemiology ==
Although the prevalence of chancroid has decreased in the United States and worldwide, sporadic outbreaks can still occur in regions of the Caribbean and Africa. Like other sexually transmitted infections, having chancroid increases the risk of transmitting and acquiring HIV.

==History==
Chancroid has been known to humans since time of ancient Greeks. Some of important events on historical timeline of chancre are:

<text>A closed system is a natural physical system that does not allow transfer of matter in or out of the system, althoughin the contexts of physics, chemistry, engineering, etc.the transfer of energy (e.g. as work or heat) is allowed.

==Physics==

===In classical mechanics===
In nonrelativistic classical mechanics, a closed system is a physical system that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings, and is not subject to any net force whose source is external to the system. A closed system in classical mechanics would be equivalent to an isolated system in thermodynamics. Closed systems are often used to limit the factors that can affect the results of a specific problem or experiment.

===In thermodynamics===

In thermodynamics, a closed system can exchange energy (as heat or work) but not matter, with its surroundings.
An isolated system cannot exchange any heat, work, or matter with the surroundings, while an open system can exchange energy and matter. (This scheme of definition of terms is not uniformly used, though it is convenient for some purposes. In particular, some writers use &#x27;closed system&#x27; where &#x27;isolated system&#x27; is used here.)

For a simple system, with only one type of particle (atom or molecule), a closed system amounts to a constant number of particles. However, for systems which are undergoing a chemical reaction, there may be all sorts of molecules being generated and destroyed by the reaction process. In this case, the fact that the system is closed is expressed by stating that the total number of each elemental atom is conserved, no matter what kind of molecule it may be a part of. Mathematically:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the number of j-type molecules, formula_3 is the number of atoms of element formula_4 in molecule formula_5 and formula_6 is the total number of atoms of element formula_4 in the system, which remains constant, since the system is closed. There will be one such equation for each different element in the system.

In thermodynamics, a closed system is important for solving complicated thermodynamic problems. It allows the elimination of some external factors that could alter the results of the experiment or problem thus simplifying it. A closed system can also be used in situations where thermodynamic equilibrium is required to simplify the situation.

===In quantum physics===
This equation, called Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, describes the behavior of an isolated or closed quantum system, that is, by definition, a system which does not interchange information (i.e. energy and/or matter) with another system. So if an isolated system is in some pure state |ψ(t) ∈ H at time t, where H denotes the Hilbert space of the system, the time evolution of this state (between two consecutive measurements).

formula_8

where is the imaginary unit, is the Planck constant divided by , the symbol indicates a partial derivative with respect to time , (the Greek letter psi) is the wave function of the quantum system, and is the Hamiltonian operator (which characterizes the total energy of any given wave function and takes different forms depending on the situation).

==In chemistry==
In chemistry, a closed system is where no reactants or products can escape, only heat can be exchanged freely (e.g. an ice cooler). A closed system can be used when conducting chemical experiments where temperature is not a factor (i.e. reaching thermal equilibrium).

==In engineering==
In an engineering context, a closed system is a bound system, i.e. defined, in which every input is known and every resultant is known (or can be known) within a specific time.

<text>Flag of convenience (FOC) refers to a business practice whereby a ship&#x27;s owners register a merchant ship in a ship register of a country other than that of the ship&#x27;s owners, and the ship flies the civil ensign of that country, called the flag state. The term is often used pejoratively, and although common, the practice is sometimes regarded as contentious.

Each merchant ship is required by international law to be registered in a registry created by a country, and a ship is subject to the laws of that country, which are used also if the ship is involved in a case under admiralty law. A ship&#x27;s owners may elect to register a ship in a foreign country so as to avoid the regulations of the owners&#x27; country, which may, for example, have stricter safety standards. They may also select a jurisdiction to reduce operating costs, avoiding higher taxes in the owners&#x27; country and bypassing laws that protect the wages and working conditions of mariners. The term &quot;flag of convenience&quot; has been used since the 1950s. A registry which does not have a nationality or residency requirement for ship registration is often described as an open registry. Panama, for example, offers advantages such as easier registration (often online), the ability to employ cheaper foreign labour, and an exemption on income taxes.

The modern practice of registering ships in a foreign country began in the 1920s in the United States when shipowners seeking to serve alcohol to passengers during Prohibition registered their ships in Panama. Owners soon began to perceive advantages in terms of avoiding increased regulations and rising labor costs and continued to register their ships in Panama even after Prohibition ended. The use of open registries steadily increased, and in 1968, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom with the world&#x27;s largest ship register.

Traditional maritime nations, mainly from Europe, responded to this practice with creation of so-called &quot;second registers&quot;: open registries, using national flags or flags of semi-sovereign offshore dependencies. That process begun in 1984 with the Isle of Man registry created as a second UK register. Soon after Norway and the Netherlands followed this practice adopting Norwegian International Ship Register (NIS) and Netherlands Antiles respectively. France established in 1989 Kerguelen Islands Register (replaced by International French Register (&quot;Registre International Français&quot; - &quot;RIF&quot; in 2005) and Germany (Federal Republic of) created German International Register (GIS) in the same year. The last two registries are still (in 2024) considered as flags of convenience.

, more than half of the world&#x27;s merchant ships in terms of deadweight tonnage are registered in open registries.

==Background==
Open registries have been criticised, mainly by trade union organisations based in developed countries, especially those in the European Union, United States, Japan, Canada, or the United Kingdom. One criticism is that shipowners who want to hide their ownership may select a flag-of-convenience jurisdiction which enables them to be legally anonymous. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offering substandard working conditions, and negatively impacting the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Prior to the implementation of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, shipowners may have selected a jurisdiction with measurement rules that reduced the certified gross register tonnage of a ship, to reduce subsequent port of call dock dues. Such was a consideration when Carnival Cruise Line changed the flag of the RMS &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; in 1972 to that of Panama. In 2011, Cunard Line registered all its ships in Bermuda, which, besides other considerations, enabled its ship captains to marry couples at sea. Weddings at sea are described as a lucrative market.

Maritime industry practitioners and seafarers from other countries contend that this is a natural product of globalisation. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labour pool. Publications from as early as 1962 argue that shipowners from developed countries use the practice to be competitive in a global environment.

In 2010 in a message connected to the World Maritime Day, the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization gave recognition to the present status of the open registries and noted that the seafarers from some developing countries are providing major source of foreign currency to their home economies:&quot;The development of open registries for ships has given the shipping industry the flexibility to recruit its manpower from alternate sources, with the result that developing and newly industrialized countries now provide the majority of seafarers for the entire global fleet – not just for the ships flying their own country&#x27;s flag.&quot;

===Legal context===
International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a ship is registered is its flag state, and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. A ship&#x27;s flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship&#x27;s equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.

===Reasons for adopting a flag of convenience===
The reasons for choosing an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, the ability to avoid national labor and environmental regulations, and the ability to hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand&#x27;s fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to US$3.5 million per ship every year.

===Accidents and reform===
The environmental disaster caused by the 1978 sinking of the , which flew the Liberian flag, spurred the creation of a new type of maritime enforcement. Resulting from strong political and public outcry over the &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; sinking, fourteen European nations signed the 1982 Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control or Paris MOU. Under port state control, ships in international trade became subject to inspection by the states they visit. In addition to shipboard living and working conditions, these inspections cover items concerning the safety of life at sea and the prevention of pollution by ships. In cases when a port state inspection uncovers problems with a ship, the port state may take actions including detaining the ship. In 2015, member states of the Paris MOU conducted 17,858 inspections with deficiencies, which resulted in 595 detained vessels and 11 banned. Member states of the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding conducted 17,269 ship inspections in 2015, recording 83,606 deficiencies which resulted in 1,153 detentions.

The principle that there be a genuine link between a ship&#x27;s owners and its flag state dates back to 1958, when Article 5(1) of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas also required that &quot;the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag.&quot; The principle was repeated in Article 91 of the 1982 treaty called the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and often referred to as UNCLOS. In 1986, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development attempted to solidify the genuine link concept in the United Nations Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships. The Convention for Registration of Ships would require that a flag state be linked to its ships either by having an economic stake in the ownership of its ships or by providing mariners to crew the ships. To come into force, the 1986 treaty requires 40 signatories whose combined tonnage exceeds 25% of the world total. , only 14 countries have signed the treaty.

==History==
Merchant ships have used false flags as a tactic to evade enemy warships since antiquity, and examples can be found from as early as the Roman era through to the Middle Ages. Following the American Revolutionary War, merchantmen flying the flag of the fledgling United States quickly found it offered little protection against attack by Barbary pirates – many responded by seeking to transfer their registry back to Great Britain. The use of false flags was frequently used as a &quot;ruse de guerre&quot; by the British during the Napoleonic Wars and the United States during the War of 1812. During the mid-19th century, slave ships flew various flags to avoid being searched by British anti-slavery fleets. The &quot;Belen Quezada&quot;, in August 1919, was the first foreign ship to be re-registered in the Panamanian registry, and was employed in running illegal alcohol between Canada and the United States during Prohibition. The modern practice of registering ships in foreign countries to gain economic advantage originated in the United States in the era of World War I, though the term &quot;flag of convenience&quot; did not come into use until the 1950s.
Between 1915 and 1922, several laws were passed in the United States to strengthen the United States Merchant Marine and provide safeguards for its mariners. During this period, U.S.-flagged ships became subject to regular inspections undertaken by the American Bureau of Shipping. This was also the time of Robert LaFollette&#x27;s Seamen&#x27;s Act of 1915, which has been described as the &quot;&quot;Magna Carta&quot; of American sailors&#x27; rights&quot;. The Seamen&#x27;s Act regulated mariners&#x27; working hours, their payment, and established baseline requirements for shipboard food. It also reduced penalties for disobedience and abolished the practice of imprisoning sailors for the offense of desertion. Another aspect of the Seamen&#x27;s Act was enforcement of safety standards, with requirements on lifeboats, the number of qualified able seamen on board, and that officers and seamen be able to speak the same language. These laws put U.S.-flagged vessels at an economic disadvantage against countries lacking such safeguards, and ships started to be re-registered in Panama&#x27;s open registry from 1919. In addition to sidestepping the Seamen&#x27;s Act, Panamanian-flagged ships in this early period paid sailors on the Japanese wage scale, which was much lower than that of western merchant powers. In the early phase of World War II the transfer of American-owned ships to the Panama registry was sanctioned by the United States government so that they could be used to deliver materials to Britain without dragging the United States, as a neutral, unintentionally into war.
The Liberian open registry, founded in 1948, was the brainchild of Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a corporate structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that 25% of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius&#x27; corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama&#x27;s registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.

On 11 March 1949, Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos registered the first ship under the Liberian flag, &quot;World Peace&quot;. When Stettinius died in 1949, ownership of the registry passed to the International Bank of Washington, led by General George Olmsted. Within 18 years, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world&#x27;s largest register.

Due to Liberia&#x27;s 1989 and 1999 civil wars, its registry eventually fell second to Panama&#x27;s flag of convenience, but maritime funds continued to supply 70% of its total government revenue. After the civil war of 1990, Liberia joined with the Republic of the Marshall Islands to develop a new maritime and corporate program. The resulting company, International Registries, was formed as a parent company, and in 1993 was bought out by its management. After taking over the Liberian government, Americo-Liberian warlord Charles Taylor signed a new registry contract with the Liberian International Ship and Corporate Registry, commonly known as LISCR. LISCR was one of the few legal sources of income for Taylor&#x27;s regime. Liberia&#x27;s registry is operated from Virginia, United States.

To counteract &quot;class hopping&quot;, in 2009 the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) established a Transfer of Class Agreement (TOCA).

Ships of the Russia&#x27;s shadow fleet, that transport sanctioned cargo, especially crude oil are frequently change their flag registrations. Because of this previously tiny ship registries including Gabon, Eswatini, the Comoro Islands, and Guinea-Bissau since 2022 gain significant participants in global shipping. According to a report of the Atlantic council &quot;They are so permissive that virtually any vessel can register, even ones turned down by other flag-of-convenience-states.&quot;

, the open registries of Panama, Liberia, and Marshall Islands accounted for more than 46% of the entire world fleet by deadweight tonnage, maintaining roughly the same proportion for over a decade.

==Extent of use==

The International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation (ITF) is the biggest campaigner against FOC since 1948, and maintains a list of registries it considers to be flags of convenience. In developing the list, the ITF takes into account &quot;ability and willingness of the flag state to enforce international minimum social standards on its vessels,&quot; the &quot;degree of ratification and enforcement of ILO Conventions and Recommendations,&quot; and &quot;safety and environmental record&quot;. , the list includes 43 registries.

, Liberia, Panama and the Marshall Islands are the world&#x27;s three largest registries in terms of deadweight tonnage (DWT). These three nations registered 17,752 ships of and above, for a total of : more than 46% of the world&#x27;s shipborne carrying capacity.

The following table gives the distribution between the 10 largest world registries in terms of tonnage (millions dwt): 


In comparison, the total capacity of ships in the U.S. and U.K. registers as of 1 January 2024 is 13.2 mil. dwt and 11.1 mil. dwt respectively.

==Criticism==
There are a number of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of convenience system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship&#x27;s actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of enabling tax avoidance, providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.

David Cockroft, former general secretary of the ITF, says:

Panama has the largest maritime register, followed by Liberia. Landlocked Mongolia also has a major registry, as does Bolivia. Also, some registers are based in other countries. For example, Panamanian overseas consulates manage the documentation and collect registration fees, Liberia&#x27;s registry is managed by a company in Virginia and Bahamas&#x27; from the City of London.

===Concealed ownership===
A ship&#x27;s beneficial owner is legally and financially responsible for the ship and its activities. For any of a number of reasons, some justifiable and some suspicious, shipowners who wish to conceal their ownership may use a number of strategies to achieve that goal.

In jurisdictions that permit it, actual owners may establish shell corporations to be the legal owners of their ships, making it difficult, if not impossible, to track who is the beneficial owner of the ship. The 2004 Report of the UN Secretary General&#x27;s Consultative Group on Flag State Implementation reported that &quot;It is very easy, and comparatively inexpensive, to establish a complex web of corporate entities to provide very effective cover to the identities of beneficial owners who do not want to be known.&quot;

According to a 2003 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report entitled &quot;Ownership and Control of Ships&quot;, these corporate structures are often multi-layered, spread across numerous jurisdictions, and make the beneficial owner &quot;almost impenetrable&quot; to law enforcement officials and taxation. The report concludes that &quot;regardless of the reasons why the cloak of anonymity is made available, if it is provided it will also assist those who may wish to remain hidden because they engage in illegal or criminal activities, including terrorists.&quot; The OECD report concludes that the use of bearer shares is &quot;perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism&quot; to protect the anonymity of a ship&#x27;s beneficial owner. Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.

Two similar techniques to provide anonymity for a ship&#x27;s beneficial owner are &quot;nominee shareholders&quot; and &quot;nominee directors&quot;. In some jurisdictions that require shareholder identities to be reported, a loophole may exist where the beneficial owner may appoint a nominee to be the shareholder, and that nominee cannot legally be compelled to reveal the identity of the beneficial owner. All corporations are required to have at least one director, however many jurisdictions allow this to be a nominee director. A nominee director&#x27;s name would appear on all corporate paperwork in place of the beneficial owners, and like nominee shareholders, few jurisdictions can compel a nominee director to divulge the identity of beneficial owners. A further hurdle is that some jurisdictions allow a corporation to be named as a director.

===Crime===
Flag of convenience ships have long been linked to crime on the high seas. For example, in 1982, Honduras shut down its open registry operations because it had enabled &quot;illegal traffic of all kinds and had given Honduras a bad name&quot;.

Ships registered by the Cambodia Shipping Corporation (CSC) were found smuggling drugs and cigarettes in Europe, breaking the Iraq oil embargo, and engaging in human trafficking and prostitution in Europe and Asia. In response to these activities, in 2000, Ahmad Yahya of the Cambodian Ministry of Public Works and Transport told industry publication &quot;Fairplay&quot; &quot;We don&#x27;t know or care who owns the ships or whether they&#x27;re doing &#x27;white&#x27; or &#x27;black&#x27; business ... it is not our concern.&quot; Less than two years later, French forces seized the Cambodian-flagged, Greek-owned MV &quot;Winner&quot; for cocaine smuggling. Shortly after the seizure, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen closed the registry to foreign ships, and Cambodia canceled its contract with CSC shortly thereafter.

The North Korean flag of convenience has also garnered significant scrutiny. In 2003, the North Korean freighter &quot;Pong Su&quot; reflagged to Tuvalu in the middle of a voyage shortly before being seized by Australian authorities for smuggling heroin into that country. That year, thirteen nations began monitoring vessels under the North Korean flag for &quot;illicit cargos like drugs, missiles or nuclear weapon fuel&quot;.

===Working conditions===
In the accompanying material of the ILO&#x27;s Maritime Labour Convention of 2006, the International Labour Organization estimated that at that time there were approximately 1,200,000 working seafarers across the world. This document goes on to say that when working aboard ships flagged to states that do not &quot;exercise effective jurisdiction and control&quot; over their ships that &quot;seafarers often have to work under unacceptable conditions, to the detriment of their well-being, health and safety and the safety of the ships on which they work.&quot;

The International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation goes further, stating that flags of convenience &quot;provide a means of avoiding labor regulation in the country of ownership, and become a vehicle for paying low wages and forcing long hours of work and unsafe working conditions. Since FOC ships have no real nationality, they are beyond the reach of any single national seafarers&#x27; trade union.&quot; They also say that these ships have low safety standards and no construction requirements, that they &quot;do not enforce safety standards, minimum social standards or trade union rights for seafarers&quot;, that they frequently fail to pay their crews, have poor safety records, and engage in practices such as abandoning crewmen in distant ports.

===Environmental effects===
While flag of convenience ships have been involved with some of the highest-profile oil spills in history (such as the Maltese-flagged , the Bahamian-flagged , the Marshallese-flagged &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;, and the Liberian-flagged , and ), the most common environmental criticism they face regards illegal fishing. These critics of the flag of convenience system argue that many of the FOC flag states lack the resources or the will to properly monitor and control those vessels. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) contends that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) vessels use flags of convenience to avoid fisheries regulations and controls. Flags of convenience help reduce the operating costs associated with illegal fishing methods, and help illegal operators avoid prosecution and hide beneficial ownership. As a result, flags of convenience perpetuate IUU fishing which has extensive environmental, social and economic impacts, particularly in developing countries. The EJF is campaigning to end the granting of flags of convenience to fishing vessels as an effective measure to combat IUU fishing.

According to Franz Fischler, European Union Fisheries Commissioner,

==Port state control==

In 1978, a number of European countries agreed in The Hague to audit labour conditions on board vessels &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; the rules of the International Labour Organization. To this end, in 1982 the &quot;Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control&quot; (Paris MOU) was established, setting port state control standards for what is now twenty-six European countries and Canada.

Several other regional Memoranda of Understanding have been established based on the Paris model, including the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control in the Asia-Pacific Region&quot;, typically referred to as the &quot;Tokyo MOU&quot;, and organizations for the Black Sea, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and Latin America. The Tokyo and Paris organizations generate, based on deficiencies and detentions, black-, white-, and grey-lists of flag states. The US Coast Guard, which handles port state control inspections in the US, maintains a similar target list for underperforming flag states.

, it could be said that the 6 major FOC registries in terms of tonnage (representing more than half of the world tonnage) are performing pretty well in respect of PSC inspections:

Both Paris and Tokyo MoU-s maintain black lists of low performing flags, but there are FOC and non-FOC registries among them.

Panama has a policy to reduce PSC detentions and to improve performance on Panamanian vessels.

The effectiveness of the port state control regime in correcting deficiencies is mitigated in some part by the practice of flag-hopping, in which shipowners and operators will rename their ships and acquire new vessel registrations in other jurisdictions in order to avoid detection and reduce the likelihood of being selected for port state control inspections.

==Ratification of maritime conventions==

International regulations for the maritime industry are promulgated by agencies of the United Nations, particularly the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. Flag states adopt these regulations for their ships by ratifying individual treaties. One common criticism against flag of convenience countries was that they allow shipowners to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them. Recent surveys (table on right side) shows that major FOC administrations comply with the international conventions. Only small percent of FOC tonnage belongs to flags, which are out of this process.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) issues an annual report entitled the &quot;Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table&quot; identifying the six &quot;core&quot; conventions representing a minimum level of maritime regulation, from the viewpoint of shipowners, as SOLAS, MARPOL, LL 66, STCW, MLC, and CLC/FUND92. Of these, all 43 flag of convenience countries listed by ITF have ratified the STCW Convention, concerning standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers, and 23 of them have ratified all six. However, at least fifteen listed countries have not ratified all the remaining five conventions. To put this in context, over 50 flag states have not ratified all six conventions, including China and United States of America.

The Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and Load Line (LL 66) conventions focus on shipboard safety issues. Originally developed in response to the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, SOLAS sets regulations on lifeboats, emergency equipment and safety procedures, including continuous radio watches. It has been updated to include regulations on ship construction, fire protection systems, life-saving appliances, radio communications, safety of navigation, management for the safe operation of ships, and other safety and security concerns. LL 66 sets standards for minimum buoyancy, hull stress, and ship&#x27;s fittings, as well as establishing navigational zones where extra precautions must be taken.

The International Labour Organization Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 provides comprehensive rights and protection at work for seafarers, including requirements for minimum age, qualifications, hours of work and rest, medical care, complaint procedures, wage payments, and onboard living arrangements. The MLC replaced a number of earlier ILO Conventions including ILO147.

MARPOL and CLC/FUND92 relate to pollution. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL), as modified by the Protocol of 1978, including Annexes I–VI&quot; regulates pollution by ships, including oil and air pollution, shipboard sewage and garbage. The Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC) and International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (FUND92) together provide mechanisms to ensure compensation for victims of oil spills.

==Wages==
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in its 2009 &quot;Report on Maritime Trade&quot;, states that shipowners often register their ships under a foreign flag in order to employ &quot;seafarers from developing countries with lower wages&quot;. The Philippines and China supply a large percentage of maritime labor in general, and major flags of convenience in particular. In 2009, the flag-states employing the highest number of expatriate-Filipino seafarers were Panama, the Bahamas, Liberia and the Marshall Islands. That year, more than 150,000 Filipino sailors were employed by these four flags of convenience. In a 2006 study by the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD), sailors from the People&#x27;s Republic of China comprised over 40% of the crews on surveyed ships flying the Panamanian flag, and around 10% of those flying the Liberian flag. The MARAD report referred to both China and the Philippines as &quot;low cost&quot; crewing sources.

The seafaring industry is often divided into two employment groups: licensed mariners including deck officers and marine engineers, and mariners that are not required to have licenses, such as able seamen and cooks, but are required to be certified. The latter group is collectively known as unlicensed mariners or ratings. Differences in wages can be seen in both groups, between &quot;high cost&quot; crewing sources such as the United States, and &quot;low cost&quot; sources such as China and The Philippines. However, salaries on flag of convenience ships are still far higher than median salaries of non-seafarers in these countries, in addition to income tax exemption of some seamen, particularly those from the Philippines.

For unlicensed mariners, 2009 statistics from the American Bureau of Labor Statistics give median earnings for able and ordinary seamen as US$35,810, varying from $21,640 (at the 10th percentile) to $55,360 (at the 90th percentile). This can be compared with 2006 statistics from the International Labour Organization, giving average yearly earnings for Filipino and Chinese able seamen around $2,000 to $3,000 per year (PHP9,900 per month and CNY3,071 per year). Among licensed mariners, American chief engineers earned a median $63,630, varying from $35,030 to $109,310 while their Filipino counterparts averaged $5,500 per year (PHP21,342 per month).

<text>64 Baker Street is a commercial property in Baker Street, central London. It was the address of the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive.

==History==
The building was completed in the first half of the 20th century and, after becoming part of the Government estate, was let to the Prison Commission. It became the headquarters of the Special Operations Executive in September 1940. A plaque on the building&#x27;s face gives details of its former inhabitants. 

After the war, the property was occupied by EMI Classics before it was converted for retail use.

<doc id="402052" wikidata="Q238795" url="?curid=402052" title="St. Vincent (musician)">
<text>Anne Erin Clark (born September 28, 1982), known professionally as St. Vincent, is an American musician and singer. Her guitar playing has been praised for its melodic style and use of distortion, and she has been listed among the best guitarists of the 21st century by multiple publications. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Clark the 26th-greatest guitarist of all time in 2023.

Raised in Dallas, St. Vincent began her music career as a member of choral rock band the Polyphonic Spree. She was also a member of Sufjan Stevens&#x27; touring band before forming her own band in 2006. Her debut solo studio album, &quot;Marry Me&quot;, was released in 2007; it was followed by &quot;Actor&quot; (2009) and &quot;Strange Mercy&quot; (2011). In 2012, St. Vincent released &quot;Love This Giant&quot;, an album made in collaboration with David Byrne of Talking Heads. Her fourth studio album, &quot;St. Vincent&quot; (2014), received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics and was named album of the year by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. She collaborated with producer and songwriter Jack Antonoff for her albums &quot;Masseduction&quot; (2017) and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; (2021) and self-produced her seventh studio album &quot;All Born Screaming&quot; (2024).

St. Vincent produced Sleater-Kinney&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;The Center Won&#x27;t Hold&quot; (2019) and co-wrote Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;. She also directed a segment in the horror anthology film &quot;XX&quot; (2017), and co-wrote and starred in the psychological thriller film &quot;The Nowhere Inn&quot; (2020).

== Early life ==
Clark was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 28, 1982, to Sharon Christine and Richard &quot;Rick&quot; Clark. Her mother is a social worker and administrator for a nonprofit organization, and her stepfather works in corporate tax administration. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and when she was 7, she moved with her mother and two older sisters to Dallas, Texas. She has said that a 23andMe DNA test revealed her ancestry to be 80% Irish and 20% Ashkenazi Jewish, via one of her grandmothers. Clark was raised Catholic and Unitarian Universalist.

Clark has four brothers and four sisters from her parents&#x27; blended families.

As a child, Clark was fond of Ritchie Valens and the movie &quot;La Bamba&quot;. When she was five, her mother gave her a red plastic guitar from a Target store for Christmas. She began playing her first real guitar at age 12, taking classes with Tony Hyatt, a local guitar shop employee, and worked some of her teenage years as a roadie for her aunt and uncle, the guitar-vocal jazz duo Tuck &amp; Patti. In 2001, she graduated from Lake Highlands High School, where she participated in theater and the school&#x27;s jazz band, and was a classmate of actor Mark Salling.

She attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, studying with professor Lauren Passarelli. She left after three years, feeling that art institutions such as Berklee were sometimes focused more on the aesthetics of art than the product. In retrospect, she said, &quot;I think that with music school and art school, or school in any form, there has to be some system of grading and measurement. The things they can teach you are quantifiable. While all that is good and has its place, at some point you have to learn all you can and then forget everything that you learned in order to actually start making music.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 2003–2007: Career beginnings and &quot;Marry Me&quot; ===

In 2003, Clark released an EP with fellow Berklee students entitled &quot;Ratsliveonnoevilstar&quot;. She also worked with Heavy Rotation Records, where &quot;she revealed a much more private and intimate rendering of &#x27;Count&#x27; for &quot;Dorm Sessions Vol. 1&quot;&quot; and studied with professor of guitar Lauren Passarelli. Shortly after leaving Berklee, she returned home to Texas, where she joined the Polyphonic Spree just before they embarked on a European tour. In 2004, she joined Glenn Branca&#x27;s 100-guitar orchestra for the Queens performance, and she was also briefly in a noise rock band called the Skull Fuckers. Clark left the Polyphonic Spree and joined Sufjan Stevens&#x27; touring band in 2006. During this period, she recorded and released an EP titled &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot; (2006).

In 2006, she began recording a studio album under the stage name St. Vincent. In an interview on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, she said that she &quot;took [her] moniker from a line in a Nick Cave song&quot; that referred to the hospital where Dylan Thomas died: &quot;And Dylan Thomas died drunk in / St. Vincent&#x27;s hospital&quot; (from Cave&#x27;s song &quot;There She Goes, My Beautiful World&quot;, from the 2004 album &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;). The name is also a reference to her great-grandmother, whose middle name was St. Vincent. Clark released her debut album, &quot;Marry Me&quot;, on July 10, 2007, on Beggars Banquet Records. Named after a line from the television sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, it features appearances from drummer Brian Teasley (Man or Astro-man?, the Polyphonic Spree), Mike Garson (David Bowie&#x27;s longtime pianist), and horn player Louis Schwadron (the Polyphonic Spree).

The album was well received by critics, who compared Clark to the likes of Kate Bush and David Bowie and lauded the album for its arrangements, themes and style. In their review, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said: &quot;There&#x27;s a point where too much happiness turns into madness, and St. Vincent&#x27;s multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark knows this place well&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said, &quot;At every turn &quot;Marry Me&quot; takes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillingly &quot;sui generis&quot; vision into vibrant life.&quot; The songs on &quot;Marry Me&quot; were written largely when Clark was 18 and 19, and, she says, &quot;represented a more idealized version of what life was or what love was or anything in the eyes of someone who hadn&#x27;t really experienced anything.&quot; The album yielded one single, &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;, and a music video was produced for &quot;Jesus Saves, I Spend&quot;.

=== 2008–2010: &quot;Actor&quot; and soundtracks ===
In 2008, Clark was nominated for three PLUG Independent Music Awards: New Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Music Video of the Year. On March 6, 2008, she won the PLUG Female Artist of the Year award. After returning to New York from a lengthy tour, Clark began working on her second album. Her inspiration reportedly came from several films, including Disney movies: &quot;Well, the truth is that I had come back from a pretty long — you know, about a year-and-a-half of touring, and so my brain was sort of all circuit boards that were a little bit fried&quot;, Clark said. &quot;So I started watching films as sort of a way to get back into being human. And then it started to just really inform the entire record.&quot; Clark, who did not have a studio at the time, began writing the album in her apartment on her computer using GarageBand and MIDI, because she had gotten noise complaints from neighbors. The songs were inspired largely by scenes from various children&#x27;s films. Clark said she imagined soundtracks for certain scenes in films when writing the music and lyrics, including scenes in &quot;Snow White&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939).
Her second album, &quot;Actor&quot;, was released by 4AD Records on May 5, 2009. It was also well received and gained more commercial attention than its predecessor. &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album eight out of ten stars, noting its &quot;[juxtaposition of] the cruel and the kind, and here, the baroque arrangements are even more complex and her voice even prettier, with both only underlining the dark currents running through her songs&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the album &quot;plays up the contrasts, [with Clark] letting her church-choir voice linger on lyrics that hint darkly at themes of violence, sex, and general chaos&quot;, and branded it &quot;a uniquely potent cocktail of sounds and moods&quot;. &quot;Actor&quot; charted well for an independent release, peaking at No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Independent Albums chart, No. 5 on the Tastemaker Albums chart, and No. 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Although it spawned no singles (except in the UK, where &quot;Actor Out of Work&quot; was issued as a 7&quot; vinyl single), music videos for &quot;Marrow&quot; and &quot;Actor Out of Work&quot; were released, and aired on several music channels. A promotional music video for &quot;Laughing with a Mouth of Blood&quot;, featuring &quot;Portlandia&quot;&#x27;s Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein (then of ThunderAnt), was also filmed.

Two soundtracks for &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot; have featured Clark&#x27;s songs. &quot;Rosyln&quot;, in collaboration with indie folk band Bon Iver, appeared on the 2009 soundtrack of &quot;New Moon&quot;; and &quot;The Antidote&quot; was written for and appeared on 2012&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Dawn – Part 2&quot;. In November 2010, Clark appeared with American rappers Kid Cudi and Cage on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. They performed &quot;Maniac&quot; from Cudi&#x27;s &quot;Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager&quot;, which prominently samples &quot;The Strangers&quot;, the opening song on &quot;Actor&quot;.

=== 2011–2012: &quot;Strange Mercy&quot; and collaborations ===

Clark spent much of her time in Seattle writing her third album, &quot;Strange Mercy&quot;, in October 2010. In an interview with Julie Klausner for Spin magazine, she recalled: &quot;[Death Cab for Cutie drummer] Jason McGerr had an office that was closing. He offered me the space for a month, for all of October. I was alone. I stayed at the Ace Hotel downtown, in one of the rooms with a shared bathroom. I would just get up in the morning and caffeinate, and run, and go to the studio for 12 hours, come back, eat dinner alone with a book, have a glass of wine, and go to bed. And do it all over again.&quot; On January 12, 2011, Clark announced via Twitter that she was working on &quot;Strange Mercy&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;Actor&quot;. In early March 2011, producer John Congleton, who also worked with Clark on &quot;Actor&quot;, said that he and Clark were nearly a third of the way through recording it.

On July 4, Clark stated via Twitter that if enough followers tweeted the hashtag &quot;#strangemercy&quot;, she would release a track from the album. On July 22, after the threshold was met, she released &quot;Surgeon&quot; for download and streaming on her official website. In August 2011, Clark was interviewed and featured on the cover of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. On August 24, 2011, a music video was released for the song &quot;Cruel&quot;, and on September 5, the entire album was put up for streaming on NPR Music. On August 25, 2011, she debuted &quot;Strange Mercy&quot; in the Temple of Dendur room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, introducing Toko Yasuda (ex-Enon), Matt Johnson, and Daniel Mintseris as members of her live band. The album was released September 13, 2011.

&quot;Strange Mercy&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. It achieved an overall rating of 8.1/10 at AnyDecentMusic? based on 36 reviews. It was St. Vincent&#x27;s highest-charting album yet, peaking at No. 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Clark stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best record I&#x27;ll ever make, but I think it&#x27;s a good record.&quot; She began touring the US and Europe in support of the record in the fall of 2011 and continued a worldwide tour throughout 2012.

In 2011, Clark composed &quot;Proven Badlands&quot;, an instrumental piece based on &quot;The Sequel&quot; from her sophomore release &quot;Actor,&quot; for ensemble Music&#x27;s album &quot;Beautiful Mechanical&quot;. In 2012, Clark was featured on Andrew Bird&#x27;s album &quot;Break It Yourself&quot; singing on &quot;Lusitania&quot;. On June 14, 2012, &quot;Who&quot;, the first single from her collaboration with David Byrne, formerly of Talking Heads, was released. The single came from their album &quot;Love This Giant&quot;, which was released September 11, 2012. On September 18, 2012, Clark participated in the &quot;30 Songs / 30 Days&quot; campaign to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multiplatform project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn&#x27;s bestselling book. Clark also provided guest vocals for the song &quot;What&#x27;s the Use of Won&#x27;drin&#x27;&quot; on the album &quot;Who Killed Amanda Palmer&quot; from Amanda Palmer, of the Dresden Dolls.

=== 2013–2015: &quot;St. Vincent&quot; ===

On May 28, 2013, David Byrne and St. Vincent released &quot;Brass Tactics&quot;, which includes a previously unreleased &quot;Love This Giant&quot; bonus track, two remixes, and two live tracks. In November 2013, Clark received the Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award for Performing Arts and signed to Loma Vista Recordings. The new label released &quot;Birth in Reverse&quot; the following month, the first single from Clark&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;St. Vincent&quot;, The second single, &quot;Digital Witness&quot;, was released in January 2014, and the album was released the next month to critical acclaim. A number of publications, including &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, Gigwise, and MusicOMH, ranked it as the No. 1 album of 2014, while &quot;Time&quot; put it at No. 2 and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 4. Clark received her first Grammy, as &quot;St Vincent&quot; won &quot;Best Alternative Music Album&quot; in February 2015.

On April 10, 2014, Clark fronted Nirvana, performing lead vocals on &quot;Lithium&quot; at the 29th Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. She also provided vocals on the Swans&#x27; album &quot;To Be Kind.&quot; On August 12 and 13, 2014, Clark filled in for Fred Armisen, who was away filming the fifth season of &quot;Portlandia&quot;, as band leader for the 8G Band on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;. Clark toured the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia throughout 2014, ending the year as the supporting act for the Black Keys. She extended her &quot;Digital Witness&quot; tour into the summer of 2015, and performed alongside the Pixies and Beck at Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015.

A demo of &quot;Teenage Talk&quot;, a track she had previously recorded but that was not included on her eponymous album, premiered on the HBO series &quot;Girls&quot; on March 10, 2015. The song was released as a single on April 6. On May 17, 2015, Clark performed with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra for the inaugural Soluna: International Music &amp; Arts Festival.

=== 2016–2019: &quot;Masseduction&quot; ===

On April 12, 2016, it was announced that Clark would make her film directorial debut helming one of the segments of the women-directed anthology horror film &quot;XX&quot;.

In June 2017, St. Vincent released &quot;New York&quot;, the lead single from her fifth album. The Fear the Future Tour was announced in June 2017, with dates between October 2017 and February 2018. &quot;Masseduction&quot;, Clark&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released in October 2017 through Loma Vista Recordings. It was met with &quot;universal acclaim&quot; with an average score of 88 on Metacritic. In the US, &quot;Masseduction&quot; debuted at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, becoming St. Vincent&#x27;s first album to peak in the top ten of the chart, selling 29,000 units in its first week.

Clark was Record Store Day&#x27;s ambassador for 2017, making her its first female ambassador. In 2018, the singer embarked on the I Am a Lot Like You! Tour, a second tour promoting the album, which took her to perform at Coachella in April. One of her performances, &quot;Slow Disco&quot;, inspired the release of a new rendition of the track titled &quot;Fast Slow Disco&quot; in June. She released &quot;MassEducation&quot;, an acoustic rendition of her previous album. The album was given an 80 on Metacritic and praised by Entertainment Weekly for her versatile lyrics and strong vocals. That same year, St. Vincent collaborated with the American rock band Sleater-Kinney to produce their ninth studio album, &quot;The Center Won&#x27;t Hold&quot;, which was released the following year.

In 2019, St. Vincent performed at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, where she joined Dua Lipa for a medley of her own &quot;Masseduction,&quot; the late Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Respect,&quot; and Lipa&#x27;s Calvin Harris collaboration &quot;One Kiss.&quot; The same night, &quot;Masseduction&quot; was awarded the Grammy for Best Rock Song. That summer, St. Vincent was credited as a co-writer on &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; with Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff for Swift&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Lover&quot; (2019). In December, she released &quot;Masseduction Rewired&quot;, a collection of remixes curated by Russian techno DJ Nina Kraviz.

=== 2020–2023: &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; ===

In 2020, St. Vincent was credited as a guitarist on &quot;Texas Man&quot; and as a co-writer on &quot;Young Man&quot; with the Chicks, Antonoff, and Justin Tranter for the Chicks&#x27; eighth studio album &quot;Gaslighter&quot;. In August 2020, St. Vincent collaborated with Japanese musician Yoshiki to release a classical arrangement of &quot;New York&quot;. In October 2020, St. Vincent&#x27;s online instruction class on Creativity and Songwriting was added to the MasterClass series. In late 2020, St. Vincent was featured on the track &quot;Chalk Tablet Towers&quot; from the first season of the &quot;Song Machine&quot; project by Gorillaz.

On December 15, 2020, St. Vincent announced she would be releasing her sixth studio album in 2021. On February 25, 2021, street posters revealed the &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; album would be released on May 14, 2021.

The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Pay Your Way in Pain&quot; was released March 4, 2021, along with a music video.

The album&#x27;s second single &quot;The Melting of the Sun&quot; was released April 1, 2021, alongside a lyric video. Two days later St. Vincent was the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing both &quot;Pay Your Way in Pain&quot; and &quot;The Melting of the Sun&quot;.

St. Vincent starred in the 2020 psychological thriller film &quot;The Nowhere Inn&quot;, featuring a script written by her and Carrie Brownstein, about a fictional attempt to make a documentary on St. Vincent&#x27;s musical career. Additionally, she wrote the film&#x27;s soundtrack, releasing on digital streaming services on September 17, 2021, and later on limited vinyl on April 23, 2022, as part of Record Store Day. She contributed a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Sad but True&quot; to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot;, released in September 2021.

On April 3, 2022, &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; won the award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. On June 3, 2022, St. Vincent released her cover of Lipps Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Funkytown&quot; appearing on the for Illumination&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;.

In September 2023, St. Vincent performed in the music documentary film &quot;&quot;.

=== 2024–present: &quot;All Born Screaming&quot; ===

On February 29, 2024, St. Vincent released &quot;Broken Man&quot;, the lead single from her seventh studio album &quot;All Born Screaming&quot; which was released on April 26, 2024. A second single, &quot;Flea&quot;, was released on March 28, same day the All Born Screaming Tour was officially announced. Upon release, the album received critical acclaim, aggregating a weighted average score of 89 on Metacritic.

A profile in &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the album&#x27;s release noted: &quot;Seven albums and 17 years into an acclaimed solo career, Clark has eked out a singular space in music, occasionally intersecting with the mainstream but for the most part staying uncompromisingly countercultural,&quot; labeling tracks from the new release &quot;some of the heaviest, darkest and weirdest St. Vincent music to date. &#x27;That’s what I want from music right now, personally,&#x27; Clark said, safe in the shade of the California sun. &#x27;I would like a pummeling. I want something to feel dangerous&#x27;&quot;.

On November 15, 2024, St. Vincent released a Spanish-language version of &quot;All Born Screaming&quot; entitled &quot;Todos Nacen Gritando&quot;. In an interview prior to &quot;Todos Nacen Gritando&quot;″s release, Clark said that translating and recording the album was &quot;a beautiful exercise and an attempt to offer a little thanks to Spanish-language fans who have met me in my native tongue for seven records.&quot;

On February 2, 2025, St. Vincent attended the 67th Annual Grammy Awards where she won in three separate categories for Best Rock Song, Best Alternative Music Performance, and Best Alternative Music Album. The latter category marked her third win in the category, extending her record there as the female soloist with the most wins.

== Musical style and influences ==

Clark’s music, which features her mezzo-soprano voice, has been noted for its wide array of instruments and complex arrangements, as well as its polysemous lyrics, which have been described as teetering between &quot;happiness and madness&quot;. In response, Clark has said, &quot;I like when things come out of nowhere and blindside you a little bit. I think any person who gets panic attacks or has an anxiety disorder can understand how things can all of a sudden turn very quickly. I think I&#x27;m sublimating that into the music.&quot; In addition to guitar, Clark also plays bass, piano, organ, and theremin. Her music also often features violins, cellos, flutes, trumpets, clarinets, and other instruments. Her musical style has been characterised as rock, pop, art rock and indie rock, incorporating a wide range of influences including experimental rock, chamber pop, electropop, soft rock, and cabaret jazz.

Clark mentioned that singers such as David Bowie and Kate Bush had inspired her, as had Jimi Hendrix and Siouxsie and the Banshees. She said in a 2015 lecture she listens to a Bowie track every day, and that &quot;It&#x27;s No Game (Part One)&quot; was her favorite. Talking Heads, Patti Smith and Pink Floyd are also influences, as well as guitarists Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew (both from King Crimson), Marc Ribot and Tool. Clark cited the author Lorrie Moore as an inspiration for &quot;St Vincent&quot;.

== Equipment ==

Clark has played a 1967 Harmony Bobkat, 1960&#x27;s Silvertone 1488, 1979 Hagström Super Swede, and Fender Deluxe Nashville Telecaster. In recent years, she has primarily played her signature Ernie Ball Music Man St. Vincent guitar.

=== Signature guitar ===
In March 2016, Ernie Ball announced that Clark had designed a signature Music Man guitar. Unique to the guitar was the design, which Welsh singer Cate Le Bon claimed in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being made for women&#x27;s bodies and providing pleasing aesthetic form in support of the guitar&#x27;s function. However, Clark has since stated that the guitar being specifically for women was not a consideration during the design process.

It was originally released in 2016 as the St. Vincent HHH with three mini-humbuckers in a signature Vincent Blue finish, a paint color which Clark herself had personally hand-mixed and selected, as well as in Black.

In 2017, four additional colors were added to the guitar line, Polaris White, Heritage Red, Tobacco Burst, and Stealth Black. 2017 was also the last year to feature a solid rosewood neck and fingerboard, due to heavy rosewood trade restrictions under CITES, later models would primarily use a roasted maple neck with ebony fingerboard. A St. Vincent HH signature model was released in 2018 featuring two humbuckers in place of the three mini-humbuckers on the original.

In 2021, a new St. Vincent Goldie signature model was released, featuring three gold foil mini-humbucker pickups, a reverse matching finish headstock, redesigned pickguard shape in 3-ply parchment, a roasted maple neck, and stainless steel frets.

Notable users of the guitar include Jack White, who used the three pickup version during every performance of his &quot;Boarding House Reach&quot; tour in 2018, Todd Tamanend Clark, Tom Morello, J Mascis, Les Priest of LANY, Eva Hendricks of Charly Bliss, Emily Roberts of The Last Dinner Party, and Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade.

== Personal life ==
Clark divides her time between Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York City. A 2014 &quot;Village Voice&quot; profile describes her as a private person. David Byrne, with whom she collaborated and toured, said of her: &quot;Despite having toured with her for almost a year, I don&#x27;t think I know her much better, at least not on a personal level... Mystery is not a bad thing for a beautiful, talented young woman (or man) to embrace. And she does it without seeming to be standoffish or distant.&quot;

When asked during a 2014 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; whether she identified as gay or straight, Clark responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t think about those words. I believe in gender fluidity and sexual fluidity. I don&#x27;t really identify as anything. I think you can fall in love with anybody. I don&#x27;t have anything to hide but I&#x27;d rather the emphasis be on music.&quot; Later that year, in an interview with the UK&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, she elaborated: &quot;I&#x27;m not one for gender or sexual absolutism in the main; I fully support and engage in the spectrum.&quot; She identifies as queer. Clark was in a relationship with the actress and fashion model Cara Delevingne from late 2014 until mid-2016. Clark briefly dated the actress Kristen Stewart in late 2016. While accepting a Grammy Award in 2025, she revealed she has a wife named Leah as well as a daughter.

In May 2010, Clark&#x27;s father was convicted of one count of conspiracy, seven counts of wire fraud, five counts of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering. The album &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; was in part inspired by her father&#x27;s eventual release.

<doc id="402055" wikidata="Q6025330" url="?curid=402055" title="Individual retirement account">
<text>An individual retirement account (IRA) in the United States is a form of pension provided by many financial institutions that provides tax advantages for retirement savings. It is a trust that holds investment assets purchased with a taxpayer&#x27;s earned income for the taxpayer&#x27;s eventual benefit in old age. An individual retirement account is a type of individual retirement arrangement as described in IRS Publication 590, &quot;Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)&quot;. Other arrangements include individual retirement annuities and employer-established benefit trusts.

==Types==
There are several types of IRAs:
* Traditional IRA – Contributions are mostly tax-deductible (often simplified as &quot;money is deposited before tax&quot; or &quot;contributions are made with pre-tax assets&quot;), no transactions within the IRA are taxed, and withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income (except for those portions of the withdrawal corresponding to contributions that were not deducted). Depending upon the nature of the contribution, a traditional IRA may be a &quot;deductible IRA&quot; or a &quot;non-deductible IRA&quot;. Traditional IRAs were introduced with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and made popular with the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.
* Roth IRA – Contributions are non-deductible and transactions within the IRA have no tax impact. The contributions may be withdrawn at any time without penalty, and earnings may be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. Named for Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Roth IRA was introduced as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
** myRA – a 2014 Obama administration initiative based on the Roth IRA, which can invest only in government bonds; phased out in 2017.
* SEP IRA – a provision that allows an employer (typically a small business or self-employed individual) to make retirement plan contributions into a Traditional IRA established in the employee&#x27;s name, instead of to a pension fund in the company&#x27;s name.
* SIMPLE IRA – a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees that requires employer matching contributions to the plan whenever an employee makes a contribution. The plan is similar to a 401(k) plan, but with lower contribution limits and simpler (and thus less costly) administration. Although it is termed an IRA, it is treated separately.
* Conduit IRA – a traditional IRA funded exclusively with a transfer from a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) plan.

Conduit IRAs have fallen in use due to 2001 legislation that allowed for direct transfers between qualified plans without an intermediate IRA, but plan administrators may choose to accept transfers only from conduit IRAs. Transferring funds from a qualified plan to a conduit IRA preserves certain tax and asset protection advantages that apply to the qualified plan.

A self-directed IRA is considered the same by the tax code, but refers to IRAs where the custodian allows the investor wider flexibility in choosing investments, typically including alternative investments. Some examples of these alternative investments are: real estate, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas limited partnerships, precious metals, horses, and intellectual property. While the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) has placed a few restrictions on what can be invested in, the IRA custodian may impose additional restrictions on what assets they will custody. Self-directed IRA custodians, or IRA custodians who specialize in alternative investments, are better equipped to handle transactions involving alternative investments.

Some IRA custodians and some investment funds specialize in socially responsible investing, sometimes using public environmental, social and corporate governance ratings.

Starting with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), many of the restrictions of what type of funds could be rolled into an IRA and what type of plans IRA funds could be rolled into were significantly relaxed. Additional legislation since 2001 has further relaxed restrictions. Essentially, most retirement plans can be rolled into an IRA after meeting certain criteria, and most retirement plans can accept funds from an IRA. An example of an exception is a non-governmental 457 plan which cannot be rolled into anything but another non-governmental 457 plan.

The tax treatment of the above types of IRAs (except for Roth IRAs) are very similar, particularly for rules regarding distributions. SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs also have additional rules similar to those for qualified plans governing how contributions can and must be made and what employees are qualified to participate.

==Custodians==

Custodians can include:
* Banks
* Credit unions
* Mutual fund companies, sometimes for the purpose of offering their own mutual funds
* Brokerage firms, either independent or &quot;captive&quot; (affiliated with a specific mutual fund or insurance company)
* Life insurance companies

==Funding==
Individual retirement arrangements were introduced in 1974 with the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Taxpayers could contribute up to fifteen percent of their annual income or $1,500, whichever is less, each year and reduce their taxable income by the amount of their contributions. The contributions could be invested in a special United States bond paying six percent interest, annuities that begin paying upon reaching age 59, or a trust maintained by a bank or an insurance company.

Initially, ERISA restricted IRAs to workers who were not covered by a qualified employment-based retirement plan. In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) allowed all working taxpayers under the age of 70 to contribute to an IRA, regardless of their coverage under a qualified plan. It also raised the maximum annual contribution to $2,000 and allowed participants to contribute $250 on behalf of a nonworking spouse.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 phased out the deduction for IRA contributions among workers covered by an employment-based retirement plan who earned more than $35,000 if single or over $50,000 if married filing jointly. Other taxpayers could still make nondeductible contributions to an IRA.

The maximum amount allowed as an IRA contribution was $1,500 from 1975 to 1981, $2,000 from 1982 to 2001, $3,000 from 2002 to 2004, $4,000 from 2005 to 2007, $5,000 from 2008 to 2012, $5,500 from 2013 to 2018, and $6,000 from 2019 to 2022. In tax year 2023, the maximum amount allowed is $6,500. Beginning in tax year 2024, the limit is $7,000. Beginning in 2002, those over 50 years old could make an additional contribution of up to $1,000 called a &quot;catch-up contribution&quot;.

Current limitations:
*The IRS allows an investor to revoke a new IRA, without penalty, for seven calendar days after opening it.
*An IRA can be funded only with cash or cash equivalents. Attempting to transfer any other type of asset into the IRA is a prohibited transaction and disqualifies the fund from its beneficial tax treatment.
* Additionally, an IRA (or any other tax-advantaged retirement plan) can be funded only with what the IRS calls &quot;taxable compensation&quot;. This in turn means that certain types of income cannot be used to contribute to an IRA; these include but are not limited to:
** Any unearned taxable income.
** Any tax-exempt income, apart from military combat pay.
*** Social Security payments, whether retirement pensions or disability payments, may or may not be taxable, but in either case are not eligible.
** Child support payments received. (On the other hand, alimony and separate maintenance payments, if taxable, are eligible.)
*Rollovers, transfers, and conversions between IRAs and other retirement arrangements can include any asset.
*The total contributions a person can make to all of their traditional and Roth IRAs cannot be more than the lesser amount of either their earned income for the year or $6,000 ($7,000 if the contributor is age 50 or older). The latter figure is examined annually to determine if an inflationary adjustment is needed and has been in effect from 2019 to 2021.
*This limit applies to the total annual contributions to both Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs. For example, a person aged 45, who put $4,000 into a traditional IRA this year so far, can either put $2,000 more into this traditional IRA, or $2,000 in a Roth IRA, or some combination of those.
*The amount of the traditional IRA contributions that can be deducted is partially reduced for levels of income beyond a threshold, and eliminated beyond another threshold, if the contributor or the contributor&#x27;s spouse is covered by an employer-based retirement plan. The dollar amounts of the thresholds vary depending on tax filing status (single, married, etc.) and on which spouse is covered at work (see IRS Publication 590-A, &quot;Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)&quot;).

==Restricted investments==
Once money is inside an IRA, the IRA owner can direct the custodian to use the cash to purchase most types of publicly traded securities (traditional investments), and non-publicly traded securities (alternative investments). Specific assets such as collectibles (e.g., art, baseball cards, and rare coins) and life insurance cannot be held in an IRA. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) only outlines what is not allowed in an IRA. Some assets are allowed according to the IRC, but the custodians may add additional restrictions for accounts held in their custody. For example, the IRC allows an IRA to own a piece of rental property, but certain custodians may not allow this to be held in their custody.

While there are only a few restrictions on what can be invested inside an IRA, some restrictions pertain to actions which would create a prohibited transaction with those investments. For example, an IRA can own a piece of rental real estate, but the IRA owner cannot receive or provide any immediate benefit from/to this real estate investment. An example of such benefit would be the use of the real estate as the owner&#x27;s personal residence, allowing a parent to live in the property, or allowing the IRA account owner to fix a leaky toilet. The IRS specifically states that custodians may impose their own policies above the rules imposed by the IRS. Neither custodians nor administrators can provide advice.

Many IRA custodians limit available investments to traditional brokerage accounts such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Investments in an asset class such as real estate would only be permitted in an IRA if the real estate is held indirectly via a security such as a publicly traded or non-traded real estate investment trust (REIT). Self-directed IRA custodians/administrators can allow real estate and other non-traditional assets held in forms other than a REIT, such as a piece of rental property, raw land, or fishing rights.

Publicly traded securities such as options, futures or other derivatives are allowed in IRAs, but certain custodians or brokers may restrict their use. For example, some options brokers allow their IRA accounts to hold stock options, but others do not. Using certain derivatives or investments that involve leverage may be allowed by the IRC, it may also cause the IRA to pay taxes under the rules of Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT). Self-directed IRAs which hold alternative investments such as real estate, horses, or intellectual property, can involve more complexity than IRAs which only hold stocks or mutual funds.

An IRA may borrow or loan money but any such loan must not be personally guaranteed by the owner of the IRA. Any loan on assets in the IRA would be required to be a non-recourse loan. The loan could not be personally secured by the IRA account owner, or the IRA itself. It can only be secured by the asset in question. The owner of the IRA may not pledge the IRA as security against an outside debt.

==Distribution of funds==
Although funds can be distributed from an IRA at any time, there are limited circumstances when money can be distributed or withdrawn from the account without penalties. Unless an exception applies, money can typically be withdrawn penalty-free as taxable income from an IRA once the owner reaches age 59 years and 6 months. Also, non-Roth owners must begin taking distributions of at least the calculated minimum amounts by April 1 of the year after reaching age 72. If the required minimum distribution (RMD) is not taken the penalty is 50% of the amount that should have been taken. The amount that must be taken is calculated based on a factor taken from the appropriate IRS table and is based on the life expectancy of the owner and possibly his or her spouse as beneficiary if applicable. Withdrawals are taxable unless paid to a charity after age 72; this cutoff has changed over time. Payments to charities are called Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD).
At the death of the owner, distributions must continue and if there is a designated beneficiary, distributions can be based on the life expectancy of the beneficiary.

There are several exceptions to the rule that penalties apply to distributions before age 59. 
Each exception has detailed rules that must be followed to be exempt from penalties. This group of penalty exemptions are popularly known as hardship withdrawals. The exceptions include:
*The portion of unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of adjusted gross income
*Distributions that are not more than the cost of medical insurance while unemployed
*Disability (defined as not being able to engage in any substantial gainful activity)
*Amounts distributed to beneficiaries of a deceased IRA owner
*Distributions in the form of an annuity (see substantially equal periodic payments)
*Distributions that are not more than the qualified higher education expenses of the owner or their children or grandchildren
*Distributions to buy, build, or rebuild a first home ($10,000 lifetime maximum)
*Distribution due to an IRS levy of the plan

There are a number of other important details that govern different situations. For Roth IRAs with only contributed funds the basis can be withdrawn before age 59 without penalty (or tax) on a first in first out basis, and a penalty would apply only on any growth (the taxable amount) that was taken out before 59 where an exception didn&#x27;t apply. Amounts converted from a traditional to a Roth IRA must stay in the account for a minimum of 5 years to avoid having a penalty on withdrawal of basis unless one of the above exceptions applies.

If the contribution to the IRA was nondeductible or the IRA owner chose not to claim a deduction for the contribution, distributions of those nondeductible amounts are tax and penalty free.

==Bankruptcy status==
In the case of &quot;Rousey v. Jacoway&quot;, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously on April 4, 2005, that under section 522(d)(10)(E) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (), a debtor in bankruptcy can exempt his or her IRA, up to the amount necessary for retirement, from the bankruptcy estate. The Court indicated that because rights to withdrawals are based on age, IRAs should receive the same protection as other retirement plans. Thirty-four states already had laws effectively allowing an individual to exempt an IRA in bankruptcy, but the Supreme Court decision allows federal protection for IRAs.

The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 expanded the protection for IRAs. Certain IRAs (rollovers from SEP or Simple IRAs, Roth IRAs, individual IRAs) are exempt up to at least $1,000,000 (adjusted periodically for inflation) without having to show necessity for retirement. The law provides that &quot;such amount may be increased if the interests of justice so require.&quot; Other IRAs (rollovers from most employer sponsored retirement plans (401(k)s, etc.) and non-rollover SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) are entirely exempt.

The 2005 BAPCPA also increased the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit for IRA deposits at banks.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has ruled that if an IRA engages in a &quot;prohibited transaction&quot; under Internal Revenue Code sections 408(e)(2) and 4975(c)(1), the assets in the IRA will no longer qualify for bankruptcy protection.

With respect to inherited IRAs, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in the case of &quot;Clark v. Rameker&quot; in June 2014, that funds in an inherited IRA do not qualify as &quot;retirement funds&quot; within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy exemption statute, 11 U.S.C. section 522(b)(3)(C).

==Protection from creditors==
There are several options of protecting an IRA: (1) roll it over into a qualified plan like a 401(k), (2) take a distribution, pay the tax and protect the proceeds along with the other liquid assets, or (3) rely on the state law exemption for IRAs. For example, the California exemption statute provides that IRAs and self-employed plans&#x27; assets &quot;are exempt only to the extent necessary to provide for the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor retires and for the support of the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor, taking into account all resources that are likely to be available for the support of the judgment debtor when the judgment debtor retires&quot;. What is reasonably necessary is determined on a case-by-case basis, and the courts will take into account other funds and income streams available to the beneficiary of the plan. Debtors who are skilled, well-educated, and have time left until retirement are usually afforded little protection under the California statute as the courts presume that such debtors will be able to provide for retirement.

Many states have laws that prohibit judgments from lawsuits to be satisfied by seizure of IRA assets. For example, IRAs are protected up to $500,000 in Nevada from Writs of Execution. However, this type of protection does not usually exist in the case of divorce, failure to pay taxes, deeds of trust, and fraud.

In accordance with the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, IRAs are protected from creditors during bankruptcy up to $1,000,000 (the act requires the IRS to adjust this limit for inflation every three years; the most recent adjustment was $1,362,800 in 2019). An exception is that inherited IRAs do not qualify for an exemption from the bankruptcy estate and thus federal law does not protect them from creditors in bankruptcy. Some state laws, however, may protect inherited IRAs from creditors in bankruptcy.

==Borrowing==
An IRA owner may not borrow money from the IRA except for a 60-day period in a calendar year. Any borrowing in excess of 60 days in a calendar year disqualifies the IRA from special tax treatment. An IRA may incur debt or borrow money secured by its assets, but the IRA owner may not guarantee or secure the loan personally. An example of this is a real estate purchase within a self-directed IRA along with a non-recourse mortgage.

Income from debt-financed property in an IRA may generate unrelated business taxable income in the IRA.

The rules regarding IRA rollovers and transfers allow the IRA owner to perform an &quot;indirect rollover&quot; to another IRA. An indirect rollover can be used to temporarily &quot;borrow&quot; money from the IRA, once in a twelve-month period. The money must be placed in an IRA arrangement within 60 days, or the transaction will be deemed an early withdrawal (subject to the appropriate withdrawal taxes and penalties) and may not be replaced.

==Double taxation==
Double taxation still occurs within these tax-sheltered investment arrangements. For example, foreign dividends may be taxed at their point of origin, and the IRS does not recognize this tax as a creditable deduction. There is some controversy over whether this violates tax treaties, such as the &quot;Convention Between Canada and the United States of America With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital&quot;.

==Inheriting==
If the IRA owner dies, different rules are applied depending on who inherits the IRA (spouse or other &quot;eligible designated beneficiary&quot;, other beneficiary, multiple beneficiaries, and so on).

In case of spouse inherited IRAs, the owner&#x27;s spouse has the following options:
* treat the IRA account as his or her own, which means that he or she can name a beneficiary for the assets, continue to contribute to the IRA and avoid having to take distributions. This avoids paying the extra 10% tax on early distributions from an IRA.
* rollover the IRA funds into another plan and take distributions as a beneficiary. Distributions will be determined by the required minimum distribution rules based on the surviving spouse&#x27;s life expectancy.
* disclaim up to 100% of the IRA assets, which, besides avoiding extra taxable income, enables their children to inherit the IRA assets
* take all of the IRA assets out in one lump-sum, which can subject the spouse to federal taxes if particular requirements are not met
In case of non-spouse inherited IRAs, the beneficiary cannot choose to treat the IRA as his or her own, but the following options are available:
* take out all of the assets within 10 years of the owners death (10-year rule); withdrawals may be subject to federal taxes.
* disclaim all or part of the assets in the IRA for up to 9 months after the IRA owner&#x27;s death.
* if the beneficiary is older than the IRA owner, he or she can take distributions from the account based on the IRA owner&#x27;s age.
In case of multiple beneficiaries the distribution amounts are based on the oldest beneficiary&#x27;s age. Alternatively, multiple beneficiaries can split the inherited IRA into separate accounts, in which case the rules will apply separately to each separate account.

==Statistics==
Detailed statistics on IRAs have been collected by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, in its EBRI IRA Database (Center for Research on IRAs), and various analyses performed. An overview is given in . Some highlights from the 2008 data follow:
* The average and median IRA account balance was $54,863 and $15,756, respectively, while the average and median IRA individual balance (all accounts from the same person combined) was $69,498 and $20,046. The average is significantly higher than the median (over three times higher), reflecting significant positive skew – very large balances increase the average.
** Average and median balances increased with age, reaching a maximum in the 65–69 age group, before leveling off for 70 and over.
* &quot;Rollovers overwhelm contributions&quot; – the overwhelming majority of IRA contributions, in dollar terms, were from rollovers, rather than new contributions – over 10 times as much is added to IRAs from rollovers than new contributions.
** While many rollovers were small (28.5% were less than $5,000, and 53.1% were less than $25,000), a significant number of rollovers were quite large, with 20.2% being more than $100,000.
* IRAs were divided by type as 33.6% traditional IRAs, 33.4% rollover IRAs (combined with the traditional IRAs, 67 percent), 23.4% Roth IRAs, and 9.6% SEPs and SIMPLEs.
* Excluding SEPs and SIMPLEs (i.e., concerning traditional, rollover, and Roth IRAs), 15.1% of individuals holding an IRA contributed to one. The percentage was much higher for Roth IRAs: 7.2% of owners of traditional or rollover IRAs (same for contribution purposes) contributed, while 29.5% of owners of Roth IRAs contributed.
* &quot;Contributions are concentrated at the maximum amount&quot; – of those contributing to an IRA, approximately 40% contributed the maximum (whether contributing to traditional or Roth), and 46.7% contributed close to the maximum (in the $5,000–$6,000 range).
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on IRAs in November 2014. This report gives the GAO&#x27;s estimate on the number of taxpayers with IRAs as well as the estimated account balances. Here are some highlights from the report:
* For tax year 2011 (the most recent year available), an estimated 43 million taxpayers had individual retirement accounts (IRAs) with a total reported fair market value (FMV) of $5.2 trillion.
* Few taxpayers had aggregated balances exceeding $5 million as of 2011. Generally, taxpayers with IRA balances greater than $5 million tend to have adjusted gross incomes greater than $200,000, be joint filers, and are age 65 or older.
* In 2014, the federal government will forgo an estimated $17.45 billion in tax revenue from IRAs, which Congress created to ensure equitable tax treatment for those not covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans. 
* 98.5% of taxpayers have IRA account balances at $1,000,000 or less.
* 1.2% of tax payers have IRA account balances at $1,000,000 to $2,000,000.
* 0.2% (or 83,529) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $2,000,000 to $3,000,000
* 0.1% (or 36,171) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000
* &lt;0.1% (or 7,952) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $5,000,000 to $10,000,000
* &lt;0.1% (or 791) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $10,000,000 to $25,000,000
* &lt;0.1% (or 314) taxpayers have IRA account balances of $25,000,000 or more

===Retirement savings===
While the average (mean) and median IRA individual balance in 2008 were approximately $70,000 and $20,000 respectively, higher balances are not rare. 6.3% of individuals had total balances of $250,000 or more (about 12.5 times the median), and in rare cases, individuals own IRAs with very substantial balances, in some cases $100 million or above (about 5,000 times the median individual balance). This can occur when IRA owners invest in shares of private companies, and the share value subsequently rises substantially.

In November 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that stated there were an estimated 314 taxpayers with IRA account balances of greater than $25,000,000. Also that there are an estimate of 791 taxpayers with IRA account balances between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The purpose of this report was to study individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and the account valuations. There were concerns raised about whether the tax incentives encourage new or additional saving. Congress is reexamining retirement tax incentives as part of tax reform. GAO was asked to measure IRA balances and assess IRS enforcement of IRA laws.

The Joint Committee on Taxation reported that as of the end of 2019, there were 28,615 taxpayers with traditional and Roth IRA assets in excess of $5 million and an aggregate value totaling almost $280 billion. An investigative report in 2021 highlighted Peter Thiel, who built a Roth IRA worth $5 billion by investing in startups on terms unavailable to most taxpayers. The owners of such high-value IRAs constituted less than one tenth of a percent of the more than 65 million IRA owners at the end of 2018, and policy proposals have been advanced to limit such accumulation.

According to a 2015 study done by the National Institute on Retirement Security, titled &quot;The Continuing Retirement Savings Crisis&quot;, 45% of working Americans do not own any retirement account assets, whether in an employer-based 401(k) type plan or an IRA. Furthermore, the typical working household has virtually no retirement savings - the median retirement account balance is $2,500 for all working-age households and $14,500 for near-retirement households. In 2020, half of American adults had less than $6,500 in the combination of their IRAs and defined contribution plans, such as 401(k).

While inflation-adjusted stock market values generally rose from 1978 to 1997, in March 2013, they were lower than during the period 1998 through 2007. This has caused IRAs to perform substantially more poorly than expected when current retirees were investing the bulk of their savings in them. In 2010, Duncan Black wrote in an opinion column in USA Today that the median household retirement account balance for workers aged 55 to 64 was $120,000, which &quot;will provide only a trivial supplement to Social Security&quot;, but a third of households had no retirement savings at all.

<text>Sir David Joseph Dobbyn (born 3 January 1957) is a New Zealand musician, singer–songwriter and record producer. In his early career he was a member of the rock group Th&#x27; Dudes and was the main creative force in pop band DD Smash. Since then he has released the majority of his recordings as a solo performer.

== Early life ==
Dave Dobbyn was born on 3 January 1957 in the working class area of Glen Innes, (Auckland), the third of five children to tour-bus driver Terry Dobbyn and Molly. He was influenced by music from a young age, ranging from the Irish songs his father listened to, to the music of the church across the road, to the various radio stations he was able to pick up on the family radiogram. 

While his family had a piano at home, he was the only member to not receive piano lessons, something he was grateful for in retrospect as it meant he was able to come to it without memories of strict lessons. He, along with his three brothers, attended the local Catholic college Sacred Heart College, where he would meet Ian Morris and Peter Urlich. 

While Sacred Heart actively encouraged music, Dobbyn was too shy to be involved, and on graduating high school worked nine months as a bank teller, and applied to teachers&#x27; college twice, to be accepted on the second try. As he started teachers&#x27; college he was asked by Morris and Urlich to join the band that would become Th&#x27; Dudes.

==Musical career==
=== Th&#x27; Dudes (1975–1980) ===

Dobbyn&#x27;s first success came with rock band, Th&#x27; Dudes, which he joined as guitarist. After performing with the band for a year, Dobbyn quit teachers&#x27; college to focus on the band full-time. Dobbyn suffered extreme stage fright and played early performances standing at the back with his eyes closed. However, he took on the role of frontman for the song &quot;Be Mine Tonight&quot; (1978). The song won single of the year in 1979 in New Zealand and led to many critics seeing him as the breakout star of the band. The band&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Bliss&quot; (1980) has become an iconic New Zealand drinking song.

=== DD Smash (1980–1986) ===

After Th&#x27; Dudes disbanded in 1980, Dobbyn formed a pop group DD Smash. The band&#x27;s first release was the single &quot;Lipstick Power&quot;, followed by &quot;Bull by the Horns&quot; (1981), thought to be about Dobbyn overcoming the stage fright he sometimes experienced while performing with Th&#x27; Dudes. Their first album &quot;Cool Bananas&quot; (1982) debuted in the New Zealand charts at number one.

After &quot;Cool Bananas&quot;, DD Smash released &quot;Deep in the Heart of Taxes&quot; (1983), an album recorded live at Auckland&#x27;s popular eighties venue Mainstreet. Their final album, &quot;The Optimist&quot; (1984), although slicker sounding production-wise than its predecessor, showed signs of compromise with the dominant commercial, blue-eyed soul inflected, synth-pop sound of the post-new wave era of British and Australian music which was flooding the New Zealand charts at the time. Dobbyn apparently had his eye on the larger Australian market and it was not long before he had a number one solo hit there.

In December 1984, DD Smash was playing an outdoor concert in Aotea Square in Auckland. During their set, a power failure led sections of the crowd to become restless. Some of the crowd started throwing beer bottles and police arrested them. The situation escalated and the riot squad was called in. Dobbyn made negative remarks about the police which allegedly spurred on the crowd. The concert was stopped by the police and sections of the crowd rioted, smashing shop windows along Queen Street. Prime Minister David Lange called a commission of inquiry and as a result, Dobbyn was charged with inciting a riot. The criminal prosecution against Dobbyn began in June 1985. His lawyer successfully defended him and he was acquitted on the charge of &quot;behaving in a manner likely to cause violence against person or property and using insulting language&quot;.

When DD Smash eventually disbanded, partially to make room for the commercially expanding vision of Dobbyn, they left behind them the hit singles &quot;Outlook for Thursday&quot; (1983) and the violin-tinged, hi perennial classic &quot;Whaling&quot; (1984).

=== Solo career (1986–present) ===
When DD Smash folded, Dobbyn began a successful solo career, by writing the soundtrack music for the animated feature film &quot;Footrot Flats: The Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot; in 1986. The film yielded two hit singles: &quot;You Oughta Be In Love&quot; (1986) and the chart-topping &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; (1986) recorded with the band Herbs. After the release of the film, &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; became one of Dobbyn&#x27;s best-known songs, frequently used in tourism advertisements aired on Australian television that encouraged people to visit New Zealand. With the success of the song in Australia, Dobbyn settled in Australia.

In April 1987, a re-worked version of Dobbyn&#x27;s song &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; featured in a number of television commercials in Australia. Funded by the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC), the commercials promoted the Devon meat product by substituting the word &quot;Heaven&quot; for &quot;Devon&quot; in the chorus.

Dobbyn released his debut solo album &quot;Loyal&quot;, a personal celebration of love and loyalty, in 1988.
His follow-up was the Mitchell Froom-produced &quot;Lament for the Numb&quot; (1993), which included members of Elvis Costello&#x27;s one-time backing band. The album was called &quot;un-releasable&quot; by Dobbyn&#x27;s record label at the time and was shelved for a year until its eventual release. After nearly a decade in Australia, Dobbyn moved back to Auckland in the early 1990s, and made 1994&#x27;s &quot;Twist&quot; with fellow New Zealander and recently returned singer–songwriter Neil Finn, whose contribution Dobbyn stated &quot;was crucial to the sound of that record&quot;. &quot;Twist&quot; is also notable for its inclusion of the Māori singer Emma Paki, who was popular in the country at the time of the album&#x27;s release.

In 1995 Dobbyn became one of the first musical performers in the world to simulcast a performance on the Internet. However, it was hindered by technical problems.

Dobbyn took on the role of producer in fourth solo album, &quot;The Islander&quot;. The album received widespread popular and critical acclaim, reaching number 1 on the New Zealand charts.

In 1999 Dobbyn joined Jan Hellriegel and Toi Iti to co-write &quot;Read About It&quot;, the theme song of the Duffy Books in Homes programme which is still performed by 100,000 children annually.

Dobbyn&#x27;s hit song &quot;Loyal&quot; (1988) from his debut solo album &quot;Loyal&quot; (1988) was used as an anthem for Team New Zealand&#x27;s failed 2003 America&#x27;s Cup defence. He has also produced albums for Australian singer Grant McLennan and contributed to albums by Jenny Morris, Gyan Evans, Wayne Gillespie and Bic Runga. In 2000 Dobbyn toured New Zealand with Runga and Tim Finn. The tour was recorded and the live album, &quot;Together in Concert: Live&quot; (2000) was released soon after. The tour also included the lead off song &quot;Just Add Water&quot; from his 2000 album &quot;Hopetown&quot;, a record Dobbyn has since referred to as &quot;a cartoon album&quot;.

In 2005, Dobbyn released his sixth solo album; &quot;Available Light&quot;. The album received popular and critical acclaim. In the same year Dobbyn performed the lead single from &quot;Available Light&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (2005) at the New Zealand Music Awards ceremony. During the performance, Ahmed Zaoui, who was appealing a security certificate issued due to alleged links to terrorist groups, appeared on stage with Dobbyn.

2008 saw Dobbyn release &quot;Anotherland&quot;. The album entered the NZ Top 40 Album Charts at Number 2 and remained in the charts for 6 weeks, eventually attaining Gold status.

In 2009 Dobbyn released a second greatest hits album, including re-recorded versions of &quot;Devil You Know&quot;, &quot;Shaky Isles&quot; and &quot;Whaling&quot;. The second CD includes less known songs. A limited edition version also included a DVD tracking his three decades in music, and included interviews with former bandmates and collaborators.

In 2012 Dobbyn was part of the all-star lineup for the Flight of the Conchords charity single &quot;Feel Inside (And Stuff Like That)&quot;. The song debuted at number 1 on the New Zealand music chart and remained there for two weeks.

<text>Richard Edgcumbe, 1st Baron Edgcumbe, (23 April 168022 November 1758) of Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall, was an English Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1701 until 1742 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Edgcumbe. He is memorialised by Edgecombe County, North Carolina.

==Origins==
He was the son of Sir Richard Edgcumbe and Lady Anne Montagu, daughter of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich.

==Career==
In 1694, at the age of 14, Edgcumbe succeeded his brother, Piers Edgcumbe, in the family estates. He was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1697 and travelled abroad in 1699.

Edgcumbe was returned unopposed as MP for Cornwall at a by-election on 25 June 1701 but never took his seat as Parliament had been prorogued. At the general election later in 1701, he was returned unopposed as MP for St Germans. Edgcumbe was elected MP for Plympton Erle at the 1702 English general election, probably on the Treby interest. He was re-elected at the 1705 English general election in a contest, and voted for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705. Edgcumbe was returned as a Whig at the 1708 British general election, and was several times a teller for the Whigs. Although absent from the vote on the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell, he was attacked by the mob supporting Dr Sacheverell in Cornwall. Edgcumbe was returned again at the 1710 British general election but his behaviour in parliament appears contradictory. He was however to be one of the leaders of the great Whig procession through the City of London, which was banned by the government. Edgcumbe voted for the motion ‘No Peace Without Spain’ on 7 December 1712 and divided against the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. He was returned again at the 1713 British general election, and voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele.

At the 1715 British general election, Edgecombe was returned unopposed as MP for Plympton Erle. He was appointed lord of the treasury in 1716. Edgcumbe surrendered the post when he went into opposition with Walpole in 1717, but was re-instated in 1720. He was returned again for Plympton Erle at the 1722 British general election. Edgcumbe held his post at the Treasury until 1724 when he was appointed Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, a post he held until 1742. He was returned again at the 1727 British general election, and was appointed a Privy Councillor for Ireland on 28 November 1727. At the 1734 British general election, Edgcumbe was returned as MP for Plympton Erle and Lostwithiel and chose to sit for Lostwithiel. He was Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1734 to 1747. Edgcumbe was elected again for Plympton Erle at the 1741 general election and sat until he was raised to the peerage in 1742 and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. Edgcumbe was a faithful follower of Sir Robert Walpole, in whose interests he managed the elections for the Cornish boroughs, and his elevation to the peerage was designed to prevent him from giving evidence about Walpole&#x27;s expenditure of the secret service money. In 1742, Edgcumbe was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, which posts he held for the rest of his life. He became a colonel of a regiment of foot in 1745 and became major-general in 1755. He was appointed Chief Justice in Eyre, north of Trent in January 1758.

==Marriage and children==
Edgcumbe married Matilda Furnese (died 1721), a daughter of Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet (c. 1658 – 1712), of Waldershare in Kent, by whom he had four children, including:
*Henry Edgcumbe, eldest son, died in infancy,
*Richard Edgcumbe, 2nd Baron Edgcumbe (1716–1761), eldest surviving son and heir, who died unmarried;
*George Edgcumbe, 3rd Baron Edgcumbe, 1st Earl of Mount Edgcumbe (1720–1795), who succeeded his brother and was created Earl of Mount Edgcumbe in 1789.
