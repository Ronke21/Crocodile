<text>The 7th Cavalry Regiment is a United States Army cavalry regiment formed in 1866. Its official nickname is &quot;Garryowen&quot;, after the Irish air &quot;Garryowen&quot; that was adopted as its march tune. The regiment participated in some of the largest battles of the American Indian Wars, including its famous defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where its commander Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was killed. The regiment also committed the Wounded Knee Massacre, where more than 250 men, women and children of the Lakota were killed.

The 7th Cavalry became part of the 1st Cavalry Division in the 1920s, it went on to fight in the Pacific Theater of World War II and took part in the Admiralty Islands, Leyte and Luzon campaigns. It later participated several key battles of the Korean War. During the Korean War the unit committed the No Gun Ri massacre, in which between 250 and 300 South Korean refugees were killed, mostly women and children. The unit later participated in the Vietnam War. It distinguished itself in the Gulf War and in the Global War on Terror where its squadrons and battalions now serve as Combined Arms Battalions or as reconnaissance squadrons for Brigade Combat Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan.

== American Indian Wars ==

At the end of the American Civil War, the ranks of the Regular cavalry regiments had been depleted by war and disease, as were those of the other Regular regiments. Of the 448 companies of cavalry, infantry, and artillery authorized, 153 were not organized, and few, if any, of these were at full strength. By July 1866 this shortage had somewhat eased since many of the members of the disbanded Volunteer outfits had by then enlisted as Regulars. By that time, however, it became apparent in Washington, D.C. that the Army, even at full strength, was not large enough to perform all its duties. It needed occupation troops for the Reconstruction of the South and it needed to replace the Volunteer regiments still fighting Native Americans in the West. Consequently, on 28 July 1866 Congress authorized 4 additional cavalry regiments and enough infantry companies to reorganize the existing 19 regiments (then under two different internal organizations) into 45 regiments with 10 companies each. After this increase there were 10 regiments of cavalry, 5 of artillery, and 45 of infantry. The new cavalry regiments, numbered 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, were organized under the same tables as the 6 already in existence. A regiment consisted of 12 companies formed into 3 squadrons of 4 companies each. Besides the commanding officer who was a colonel, the regimental staff included 7 officers, 6 enlisted men, a surgeon, and 2 assistant surgeons. Each company was authorized 4 officers, 15 non-commissioned officers, and 72 privates. A civilian veterinarian accompanied the regiment although he was not included in the table of organization.

The 7th Cavalry Regiment was constituted in the Regular Army on 28 July 1866 at Fort Riley, Kansas and organized on 21 September 1866. Andrew J. Smith, a Veteran of the Mexican–American War, who had been a distinguished cavalry leader in the Army of the Tennessee during the Civil War, promoted to colonel, took command of the new regiment. Subsequently, Smith resigned from the US Army and Colonel Samuel D. Sturgis took command of the regiment on May 6, 1869. Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer had been serving as second in command of the regiment since July 1866. Neither Smith nor Sturgis served with the regiment in the field, were involved in mostly administrative matters with the regiment, and were in command in name only. Meanwhile, Custer commanded the regiment in the various campaigns against the Native American tribes and during Reconstruction duty in the southern states. Sturgis commanded the regiment until his retirement and Colonel James W. Forsyth took command of the regiment in June 1886. Forsyth commanded the regiment during the controversial Wounded Knee Massacre in December 1890 and he left the regiment in 1894 when Forsyth was promoted to brigadier general.

===First campaigns===
On 26 November 1868, Custer&#x27;s Osage scouts located the trail of an Indian war party. Custer&#x27;s troops followed this trail all day without a break until nightfall, when they rested briefly until there was sufficient moonlight to continue. They followed the trail to Chief Black Kettle&#x27;s village, where Custer divided his force into four parts, moving each into position so that at first daylight they could simultaneously converge on the village. (Separating his forces into several columns in order to surround the faster Indians before they could flee became one of the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s standard operating procedures.) At daybreak, the 7th charged as the Regimental band played Garryowen (many of the musicians&#x27; lips froze to their instruments), Double Wolf awoke and fired his gun to alert the village; he was among the first to die in the charge. The Cheyenne warriors hurriedly left their lodges to take cover behind trees and in deep ravines. The 7th Cavalry soon controlled the village, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance.

The Osage, enemies to the Cheyenne, were at war with most of the Plains tribes. The Osage scouts led Custer toward the village, hearing sounds and smelling smoke from the camp long before the soldiers. The Osage did not participate in the initial attack, fearing that the soldiers would mistake them for Cheyenne and shoot them. Instead, they waited behind the color-bearer of the 7th Cavalry on the north side of the river until the village was taken. The Osage rode into the village, where they took scalps and helped the soldiers round up fleeing Cheyenne women and children.

Black Kettle and his wife, Medicine Woman, were shot in the back and killed while fleeing on a pony. Following the capture of Black Kettle&#x27;s village, Custer was in a precarious position. As the fighting began to subside, he saw large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops and learned that Black Kettle&#x27;s village was only one of many Indian encampments along the river, where thousands of Indians had gathered. Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others seized the Indians&#x27; property and horses. They destroyed what they did not want or could not carry, including about 675 ponies and horses. They spared 200 horses to carry prisoners.
Near nightfall, fearing the outlying Indians would find and attack his supply train, Custer began marching his forces toward the other encampments. The surrounding Indians retreated, at which point Custer turned around and returned to his supply train. This engagement would soon be known as the Battle of Washita River.

===Yellowstone Expedition===
From 20 June – 23 September 1873, Custer led ten companies of the 7th Cavalry in the Yellowstone Expedition of 1873, during which, they fought several engagements with the Lakota Sioux Indians. The first of which was the Battle of Honsinger Bluff, on 4 August 1873. Near present-day Miles City, Montana, the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s horses were grazing when a raiding party led by Chief Rain-in-the-Face approached upon them. Custer ordered the men to saddle up and began pursuit of the band alongside LT Calhoun and his aide, LT William W. Cooke. The Indians retreated into a wooded area, where a hidden force of 100–300 rode out to counterattack. Custer and his men retreated, covered by C Company (led by CPT Thomas Custer, George&#x27;s younger brother), and dismounted his troops, forming a semicircular perimeter along a former channel of the Yellowstone in a wooded area. The bank of the dry channel served as a natural parapet. The Indian forces laid siege to the cavalry troops, but with little effect. About an hour into the battle, a force of nearly 50 warriors attempted to flank the cavalry&#x27;s perimeter by traveling down along the river. They were hidden by the high bank, however a scout accompanying them was spotted and drew fire. The group, thinking they had been discovered, retreated.

The flanking tactic having failed, the Indians set fire to the grass hoping to use the smoke as a screen to approach the cavalry perimeter. However, 7th Cavalry Troopers likewise used the smoke as a screen to move closer to the Indian forces and the tactic did not favor either side. The siege continued for about three hours in reported heat. The 7th Cavalry&#x27;s senior veterinary surgeon, Dr. John Horsinger, was riding approximately 2–3 miles from the battle with Suttler Augustus Baliran, and believed the sporadic shooting in the distance to be Custer&#x27;s men hunting game. When warned by an Arikara scout, he ignored him. Meanwhile, PVTs Brown and Ball of CPT Yates&#x27; Troop were napping by the river. Ball saw Dr. Horsinger and rode to join him, however, Chief Rain in the Face and five warriors ambushed the men and killed all three. PVT Brown, unnoticed by the Indians, galloped toward friendly positions yelling &quot;All down there are killed!&quot; The remaining 7th Cavalry elements, under 2LT Charles Braden, charged the Indian positions. Simultaneously, Custer ordered his men to break out of the woods and charge, effectively scattering the Indians and forcing them to withdraw.
A few days later, on the morning of 11 August 1873, the 7th Cavalry was encamped along the north side of the Yellowstone River near present-day Custer, Montana. In the early morning hours the Battle of Pease Bottom began when warriors from the village of Sitting Bull started firing at Custer&#x27;s camp from across the river. By dawn skirmishing had broken out in several locations. After shooting at least 3 warriors across the river, Private John Tuttle of Company E, 7th Cavalry was killed in the morning fighting. Warriors then crossed the Yellowstone River above and below the camp of the 7th Cavalry and attacked Custer&#x27;s troops. The 7th Cavalry successfully defended their rear, front and center from this attack, then counter-attacked with a charge, breaking the warrior positions and driving the warriors eight or more miles from the battlefield. At about the same time, Colonel Stanley&#x27;s column appeared in the distance several miles away and hurried to support the engagement. During the battle Second Lieutenant Charles Braden of the 7th Cavalry was critically wounded, along with three other Privates of the same regiment. Braden&#x27;s thigh was shattered by an Indian bullet and he remained on permanent sick leave until his retirement from the Army in 1878. He would posthumously be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1925 for his actions during the battle. At least one army horse was wounded during the engagement. Indian losses were unknown, however, estimates from Custer&#x27;s post-battle report claim &quot;their losses in killed and wounded were beyond all proportion to that which they were enabled to inflict on us, our losses being one officer badly wounded, four men killed, and three wounded. Careful investigation justifies the statement that including both day&#x27;s battles, the Indian losses will number forty warriors, while their wounded on the opposite bank of the river may increase this number.&quot;

===The Black Hills and Yellowstone===
Over the next several years, the 7th Cavalry Regiment was involved in several important missions in the American West; one of which was the Black Hills Expedition in 1874. The Troopers escorted prospectors into the Black Hills of South Dakota (considered sacred by many Indians, including the Sioux) to protect them as they searched for gold. In 1875, several 7th Cavalry Troops escorted a railroad survey team into the Yellowstone River Valley. This expedition brought them into constant contact with Native raiding parties. Custer repeatedly requested to share surplus food and grain with the Indians in order to prevent conflict, but was denied by the Standing Rock Indian Agency under the Department of the Interior. Corrupt Indian agents in the area sold food, supplies, and weapons promised to the Natives to white settlers, and what they did sell to the Indians was at unreasonable prices. Given their treatment at the hand of the Indian Agency, the Indians were forced to migrate. Custer found President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s brother Orvil Grant to be the worst culprit of all. He was corrupt, paid and took bribes, and was accused of cheating, abuse, and dishonesty. President Grant promptly relieved Colonel Custer of his position when the latter spoke the truth about Orvil and other agents.

===The Battle of the Little Bighorn===
General Philip H. Sheridan intervened, however, and had Custer returned to his command in early 1876 in order to join the upcoming campaign against the Dakota Sioux. Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry Regiment would be under the command of General Alfred H. Terry, and departed Fort Abraham Lincoln on 17 May 1876. The plan for the 1876 Sioux Expedition involved three marching columns under the commands of Major General George Crook, Colonel Custer, and Major General John Gibbon. Crook&#x27;s column was stopped by the Indians at the Battle of the Rosebud, leaving two columns remaining. The 7th marched on 22 June with 700 troopers and Native Scouts, and made contact with the Indians the next day, causing him to turn west towards the Little Bighorn River. On 24 June, Custer&#x27;s Arikara and Osage scouts identified a party of Sioux shadowing their movements, but they fled when approached. That night, Custer gave his attack plans for 25 June 1876, precipitating the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

====Reno&#x27;s attack====

The first group to attack was Major Marcus Reno&#x27;s second detachment (Companies A, G and M) after receiving orders from Custer written out by Lt. William W. Cooke, as Custer&#x27;s Crow scouts reported Sioux tribe members were alerting the village. Ordered to charge, Reno began that phase of the battle. The orders, made without accurate knowledge of the village&#x27;s size, location, or the warriors&#x27; propensity to stand and fight, had been to pursue the Native Americans and &quot;bring them to battle.&quot; Reno&#x27;s force crossed the Little Bighorn at the mouth of what is today Reno Creek around 3:00 pm on 25 June. They immediately realized that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne were present &quot;in force and not running away.&quot;

Reno advanced rapidly across the open field towards the northwest, his movements masked by the thick bramble of trees that ran along the southern banks of the Little Bighorn River. The same trees on his front right shielded his movements across the wide field over which his men rapidly rode, first with two approximately forty-man companies abreast and eventually with all three charging abreast. The trees also obscured Reno&#x27;s view of the Native American village until his force had passed that bend on his right front and was suddenly within arrow-shot of the village. The tepees in that area were occupied by the Hunkpapa Sioux. When Reno came into the open in front of the south end of the village, he sent his Arikara and Crow Indian scouts forward on his exposed left flank. Realizing the full extent of the village&#x27;s width, Reno quickly suspected what he would later call &quot;a trap&quot; and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment.

He ordered his troopers to dismount and deploy in a skirmish line, according to standard Army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with five to ten yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno&#x27;s firepower by 25 percent. As Reno&#x27;s men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, Chief Gall (in Lakota, &quot;Phizí&quot;), the mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno&#x27;s men anchored on their right by the impassable tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode hard against the exposed left end of Reno&#x27;s line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one), and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill to the left of Reno&#x27;s line and to the right of the Indian village. From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno&#x27;s line, turning Reno&#x27;s exposed left flank. They forced a hasty withdrawal into the timber along the bend in the river. Here the Indians pinned Reno and his men down and set fire to the brush to try to drive the soldiers out of their position.

After giving orders to mount, dismount and mount again, Reno told his men, &quot;All those who wish to make their escape follow me,&quot; and led a disorderly rout across the river toward the bluffs on the other side. The retreat was immediately disrupted by Cheyenne attacks at close quarters. Later, Reno reported that three officers and 29 troopers had been killed during the retreat and subsequent fording of the river. Another officer and 13–18 men were missing. Most of these missing men were left behind in the timber, although many eventually rejoined the detachment. Reno&#x27;s hasty retreat may have been precipitated by the death of Reno&#x27;s Arikara scout Bloody Knife, who had been shot in the head as he sat on his horse next to Reno, his blood and brains splattering the side of Reno&#x27;s face.

====Reno and Benteen on Reno Hill====
Atop the bluffs, known today as Reno Hill, Reno&#x27;s depleted and shaken troops were joined by Captain Frederick Benteen&#x27;s column (Companies D, H and K), arriving from the south. This force had been returning from a lateral scouting mission when it had been summoned by Custer&#x27;s messenger, Italian bugler John Martin (Giovanni Martini) with the handwritten message &quot;Benteen. Come on, Big Village, Be quick, Bring packs. P.S. Bring Packs.&quot;. Benteen&#x27;s coincidental arrival on the bluffs was just in time to save Reno&#x27;s men from possible annihilation. Their detachments were soon reinforced by CPT Thomas Mower McDougall&#x27;s Company B and the pack train. The 14 officers and 340 troopers on the bluffs organized an all-around defense and dug rifle pits using whatever implements they had among them, including knives.
Despite hearing heavy gunfire from the north, including distinct volleys at 4:20 pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno&#x27;s badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer&#x27;s position. Around 5:00 pm, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25 pm, Custer&#x27;s battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the &quot;Last Stand Hill&quot; at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill, some minutes earlier. The destruction of CPT Myles Keogh&#x27;s battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by Crazy Horse, White Bull, Hump, Chief Gall and others. Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing attacks around Weir Ridge by natives coming from the concluded Custer engagement forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter-mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.

Benteen was hit in the heel of his boot by an Indian bullet. At one point, he personally led a counterattack to push back Indians who had continued to crawl through the grass closer to the soldier&#x27;s positions.

====Custer&#x27;s fight====

The precise details of Custer&#x27;s fight are largely conjectural since none of the men who went forward with Custer&#x27;s battalion (the five companies under his immediate command) survived the battle. Later accounts from surviving Indians are useful, but sometimes conflicting and unclear.

While the gunfire heard on the bluffs by Reno and Benteen&#x27;s men was probably from Custer&#x27;s fight, the soldiers on Reno Hill were unaware of what had happened to Custer until General Terry&#x27;s arrival on 27 June. They were reportedly stunned by the news. When the army examined the Custer battle site, soldiers could not determine fully what had transpired. Custer&#x27;s force of roughly 210 men had been engaged by the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne about to the north of Reno and Benteen&#x27;s defensive position. Evidence of organized resistance included an apparent skirmish line on Calhoun Hill and apparent breastworks made of dead horses on Custer Hill. By the time troops came to recover the bodies, the Lakota and Cheyenne had already removed most of their dead from the field. The troops found most of Custer&#x27;s dead stripped of their clothing, ritually mutilated, and in a state of decomposition, making identification of many impossible. The soldiers identified the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s dead as best as possible and hastily buried them where they fell.

Custer was found with shots to the left chest and left temple. Either wound would have been fatal, though he appeared to have bled from only the chest wound, meaning his head wound may have been delivered postmortem. Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture, though this is usually discounted since the wounds were inconsistent with his known right-handedness. (Other native accounts note several soldiers committing suicide near the end of the battle.) Custer&#x27;s body was found near the top of Custer Hill, which also came to be known as &quot;Last Stand Hill&quot;. There the United States erected a tall memorial obelisk inscribed with the names of the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s casualties.

Several days after the battle, Curley, Custer&#x27;s Crow scout who had left Custer near Medicine Tail Coulee (a drainage which led to the river), recounted the battle, reporting that Custer had attacked the village after attempting to cross the river. He was driven back, retreating toward the hill where his body was found. As the scenario seemed compatible with Custer&#x27;s aggressive style of warfare and with evidence found on the ground, it became the basis of many popular accounts of the battle.

According to Pretty Shield, the wife of Goes-Ahead (another Crow scout for the 7th Cavalry), Custer was killed while crossing the river: &quot;...and he died there, died in the water of the Little Bighorn, with Two-bodies, and the blue soldier carrying his flag&quot;. In this account, Custer was allegedly killed by a Lakota called Big-nose. However, in Chief Gall&#x27;s version of events, as recounted to Lt. Edward Settle Godfrey, Custer did not attempt to ford the river and the nearest that he came to the river or village was his final position on the ridge. Chief Gall&#x27;s statements were corroborated by other Indians, notably the wife of Spotted Horn Bull. Given that no bodies of men or horses were found anywhere near the ford, Godfrey himself concluded &quot;that Custer did not go to the ford with any body of men&quot;.

Cheyenne oral tradition credits Buffalo Calf Road Woman with striking the blow that knocked Custer off his horse before he died.

By the end of the day on 26 June 1876, the 7th Cavalry Regiment has been effectively destroyed as a fighting unit. Although MAJ Reno&#x27;s and CPT Benteen&#x27;s commands managed to make good their escape, 268 Cavalrymen and Indian scouts lay dead. Among the fallen was Custer&#x27;s younger brother, Thomas Custer, in command of C Company. Other 7th Cavalry officers who were killed or wounded in action include;

* Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, Regimental Commander
* 1st Lt. William W. Cooke, Adjutant
* Assistant Surgeon George Edwin Lord
* Acting Assistant Surgeon James Madison DeWolf
* 2nd Lt. Charles Varnum, Chief of Scouts (detached from A Company, wounded)
* 2nd Lt. Benjamin Hodgson, Adjutant to Major Reno
* Capt. Thomas Custer, C Company Commander
* 2nd Lt. Henry Moore Harrington, C Company
* 1st Lt. Algernon Smith, E Company Commander
* 2nd Lt. James G. Sturgis, E Company
* Capt. George Yates, F Company Commander
* 2nd Lt. William Reily, F Company
* 1st Lt. Donald McIntosh, G Company Commander
* Capt. Myles Keogh I Company Commander
* 1st Lt. James Porter, I Company
* 1st Lt. James Calhoun, L Company Commander
* 2nd Lt. John J. Crittenden, L Company

Comprehensive &quot;1876 Little Big Horn Roster&quot;

===Nez Perce War===
In 1877, one year after the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s defeat at the Little Bighorn, the Nez Perce War began. The Nez Perce were a coalition of tribal bands led by several chiefs; Chief Joseph and Ollokot of the Wallowa band, White Bird of the Lamátta band, Toohoolhoolzote of the Pikunin band, and Looking Glass of the Alpowai band. Together, these bands refused to be relocated from their tribal lands to a reservation in Idaho, a violation of the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla. When a US Army expedition loomed, the Nez Perce attempted to break out and flee to Canada to seek the aid of Sitting Bull, who had fled there after the Battle of Little Bighorn.

====Battle of Canyon Creek====
As the Army pursued the Indians through Idaho into Montana, elements of the 7th Cavalry joined the chase. Major Lewis Merrill and Captain Frederick Benteen, a veteran of the Little Bighorn, each led a battalion of the 7th. Merrill&#x27;s Battalion consisted of Company F (CPT James M. Bell), Company I (CPT Henry J. Nowlan), and Company L (1LT John W. Wilkinson). Benteen&#x27;s Battalion consisted of Company G (1LT George O. Wallace), Company H (2LT Ezra B. Fuller), and Company M (CPT Thomas H. French). In September 1877, these battalions were with COL Samuel D. Sturgis&#x27;s column when they caught up to the Nez Perce raiding ranches up and down the Yellowstone River. The 7th Cavalry troopers were exhausted from their forced march and anticipated a rest after they crossed the Yellowstone River on the morning of 13 September, but Crow scouts reported the Nez Perce were moving up Canyon Creek six miles away.

Seeing an opportunity, Sturgis sent Major Merrill and his battalion ahead atop a long ridge to head off the Nez Perce traversing the shallow canyon below. Benteen&#x27;s battalion followed, while Sturgis stationed himself with the rear guard. Merrill was halted on the ridge by a scattering of rifle shots from Nez Perce warriors. In the words of his civilian scout, Stanton G. Fisher, Merrill&#x27;s battalion dismounted and deployed &quot;instead of charging which they should have done.&quot; According to Yellow Wolf, a single Nez Perce, Teeto Hoonod, held up the advance for a crucial ten minutes, firing 40 well-aimed shots at the cavalry from behind a rock. The caution of the soldiers was perhaps due to the formidable reputation of the Nez Perce for military prowess and marksmanship. Gale-force winds impacted marksmanship, a factor explaining low casualties on both sides.

When Sturgis arrived at the battleground, he perceived that his troops still had the possibility of capturing the Nez Perce horse herd. He sent Captain Benteen and his men on a swing to the left to plug the exits from the canyon and trap the women, children, and horses. Merrill was told to advance into the canyon to threaten the rear of the Nez Perce column, but he was held up by an increasing number of Nez Perce warriors firing at long distance at his soldiers. He succeeded only in capturing a few horses. Benteen also ran into opposition and was unable to head off the horse herd, the Nez Perce occupying high ground and firing at the soldiers. A rearguard of the Nez Perce held off the soldiers until nightfall. Most of their horse herd and their women and children reached the plains and continued north. Three Troopers were killed and eleven wounded (one mortally) when the shooting stopped. Martha Jane Cannary, better known as &quot;Calamity Jane,&quot; accompanied the wounded by boat down the Yellowstone River as a nurse. According to Yellow Wolf, three Nez Perce were killed and three wounded.

Despite pursuing the band for two days (traveling 37 miles the first day alone), the weary 7th was unable to catch up to their quarry. They awaited reinforcements and supplies on the Musselshell River for two days and continued on once they arrived.

====Battle of Bear Paw====

In late September, the US Army expedition finally caught up with Chief Joseph&#x27;s band of Nez Perce. Under General Oliver Otis Howard and Colonel Nelson A. Miles the expedition consisted of a Battalion of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, a Battalion of the 5th Infantry Regiment, Cheyenne and Lakota scouts (many of which had fought against Custer at the Little Bighorn a year earlier), and a Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment. The 7th Cavalry element was commanded by Captain Owen Hale and consisted of Company A (CPT Myles Moylan), Company D (CPT Edward Settle Godfrey), and Company K (under CPT Owen Hale himself). Captains Moylan and Godfrey were both survivors of the Battle of Little Bighorn, as were many of their men, making them a battle-hardened outfit.

On 30 September 1877, the Battle of Bear Paw began. Miles&#x27; Indian scouts located the Nez Perce camp and the Cavalry were hastily deployed. At 9:15 AM, while still about six miles from the camp, the cavalry started at a trot, organized as follows: the 30 Cheyenne and Lakota scouts led the way, followed by 160 Troopers of the 2nd Cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry was ordered to charge into the Nez Perce camp. 110 Troopers of the 7th Cavalry followed the 2nd as support on the charge into the camp. 145 Soldiers of the 5th Infantry, mounted on horses, followed as a reserve with a Hotchkiss gun and the pack train. Miles rode with the 7th Cavalry.

The Nez Perce camp was alerted by sentries to the US charge and quickly began to prepare. Women and children rushed north towards Canada, some Nez Perce began gathering the horse herd, some began packing up the camp, and the warriors prepared to fight. Rather than rushing the camp directly, the Cheyenne scouts veered off to the Nez Perce horse herd for plunder, and the 2nd Cavalry followed them. However, the 7th under CPT Hale followed the plan and charged into the enemy camp. As they approached, a group of Nez Perce rose up from a coulee and opened fire, killing and wounding several soldiers, forcing them to fall back. Miles ordered two of the three companies in the 7th Cavalry to dismount and quickly brought up the mounted infantry, the 5th, to join them in the firing line. Hale&#x27;s Company K meanwhile had become separated from the main force and was also taking casualties. By 3:00 PM, Miles had his entire force organized and on the battlefield and he occupied the higher ground. The Nez Perce were surrounded and had lost all their horses. Miles ordered a charge on the Nez Perce positions with the 7th Cavalry and one company of the infantry, but it was beaten back with heavy casualties.

At nightfall on 30 September, Miles&#x27; casualties amounted to 18 dead and 48 wounded, including two wounded Indian scouts. The 7th Cavalry took the heaviest losses. Its 110 men suffered 16 dead and 29 wounded, two of them mortally. The Nez Perce had 22 men killed, including three leaders: Joseph&#x27;s brother Ollokot, Toohoolhoolzote, and Poker Joe – the last killed by a Nez Perce sharpshooter who mistook him for a Cheyenne. Several Nez Perce women and children had also been killed. Miles later said of the battle that &quot;the fight was the most fierce of any Indian engagement I have ever been in...The whole Nez Perce movement is unequalled in the history of Indian warfare.&quot;

The end of the pitched battle marked the beginning of a long siege while negotiations commenced. As the year 1877 began falling to winter, the cold siege ended when Chief Joseph surrendered, famously saying
===Crow War===

In 1887, the state of Montana was host to a minor war between the Crow and the Blackfoot Indians where both tribes raided each other&#x27;s reservations in order to steal horses. In late spring, a Blackfoot war party made off with several Crow horses, prompting Crow war-leader Sword Bearer to lead a retaliatory raid against his Chief&#x27;s decision. The raid stepped off in September, and the war party consisted of teenage braves eager to prove themselves in battle. During the raid, a number of Blackfoot braves were killed and the Crow recovered their horses without loss, but when they returned to the reservation, on 30 September, Sword Bearer made the mistake of showing off his victory to the Indian agent, Henry E. Williamson, who was known for being disliked by the native population. In what was called the Crow Incident, Sword Bearer and his men circled around Williamson&#x27;s home and fired into the air and at the ground near Williamson&#x27;s feet, prompting him to wire the Army at Fort Custer for help. When the Army force arrived, their cannon failed to fire, allowing Sword Bearer and his men to flee into the Big Horn Mountains.

An expedition under Brigadier General Thomas H. Ruger and Colonel Nathan Dudley was sent to occupy the reservation to hamper Sword Bearer&#x27;s recruitment. The force included five troops of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, one Company from the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and A Company from the 7th Cavalry Regiment under the command of Captain Myles Moylan, a veteran of the Battle of Little Bighorn and a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Bear Paw. Heading into the mountains on 4 November 1887, the expedition caught up with the Crow band camped on the Little Bighorn River, some three miles from the site of Custer&#x27;s Last Stand (some of Sword Bearer&#x27;s followers were veterans of the battle). Company A, 7th Cavalry was posted on the right flank of the US line at the time of the battle. Sword Bearer charged with 150 mounted warriors but was repulsed and forced to retreat to a series of rifle pits dug into a wooded area near the river.

The American cavalry then counterattacked. In the words of Private Morris; &quot;The cavalry charged and took a volley from the Indian camp. At 200 yards we leaped from our horses and flattened out behind clumps of sagebrush. We traded shots for a while, until two Hotchkiss field guns on the hill began dumping two-inch into the Indian camp. That broke them.&quot; During the fighting, Sword Bearer attempted to encourage his men by riding out in front of the soldiers but he was struck by rifle fire and fell to the ground wounded. Eventually some of the Crow began to surrender but Sword Bearer and the others remained in the mountains, only to surrender later on to the Crow police. It was during the march out of the Big Horn that one of the policemen shot Sword Bearer in the head, killing him instantly and ending the war. One soldier was killed and two others were wounded during what is now called the Battle of Crow Agency. Seven Crow warriors were killed and nine were wounded. An additional nine men were also taken prisoner and all of those who had not taken part in the battle were taken to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The expedition returned to Fort Custer on 13 November.

===Ghost Dance War===
In 1890, a great phenomena spread among the Indian tribes of the Great Plains. It was called the Ghost Dance, and it promised its believers that the white man would be thrown from the American continent, and the bison herds would be returned to their former range and size. White settlers near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation were alarmed by the number of Ghost Dance performers, which included the famous Lakota Chief Sitting Bull. James McLaughlin, the Standing Rock Indian Agent, requested military aid to stop what he saw as the beginnings to a dangerous uprising. Military leaders wanted to use Buffalo Bill Cody, a friend of Sitting Bull&#x27;s, as an intermediary to avoid violence, but were overruled by McLaughlin who sent in the Indian agency police to arrest Sitting Bull.

On 15 December 1890, forty Indian Police arrived at Sitting Bull&#x27;s house to arrest him. When he refused, the police moved in, prompting Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, to fire his rifle, hitting LT Bullhead. LT Bullhead responded by shooting Sitting Bull in the chest, and Policeman Red Tomahawk subsequently shot the Chief in the head, killing him. Fearing reprisals for the incident, 200 of Sitting Bull&#x27;s Hunkpapa fled to join Chief Spotted Elk at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Spotted Elk, in turn, fled to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to join Chief Red Cloud.

A detachment of the 7th Cavalry Regiment under Major Samuel Whitside was sent to maintain order, and on 28 December they met with Red Cloud&#x27;s band southwest of Porcupine Butte as they moved to Pine Ridge. John Shangreau, a scout and interpreter who was half Sioux, advised the troopers not to disarm the Indians immediately, as it would lead to violence. The troopers escorted the Native Americans about five miles westward to Wounded Knee Creek where they told them to make camp. Later that evening, Colonel James W. Forsyth and the rest of the 7th Cavalry arrived, bringing the number of troopers at Wounded Knee to 500.

====Wounded Knee====
At daybreak on 29 December 1890, Forsyth ordered the surrender of weapons and the immediate removal of the Lakota from the &quot;zone of military operations&quot; to awaiting trains. A search of the camp confiscated 38 rifles, and more rifles were taken as the soldiers searched the Indians. None of the old men were found to be armed. A medicine man named Yellow Bird allegedly harangued the young men who were becoming agitated by the search, and the tension spread to the soldiers. Yellow Bird began to perform the Ghost Dance, telling the Lakota that their &quot;ghost shirts&quot; were bulletproof. As tensions mounted, Black Coyote refused to give up his rifle; he spoke no English and was deaf, and had not understood the order. Another Indian said: &quot;Black Coyote is deaf,&quot; and when the soldier persisted, he said, &quot;Stop. He cannot hear your orders.&quot; At that moment, two soldiers seized Black Coyote from behind, and (allegedly) in the struggle, his rifle discharged. At the same moment, Yellow Bird threw some dust into the air, and approximately five young Lakota men with concealed weapons threw aside their blankets and fired their rifles at Troop K of the 7th. After this initial exchange, the firing became indiscriminate.

At first all firing was at close range; half the Indian men were killed or wounded before they had a chance to get off any shots. Some of the Indians grabbed rifles from the piles of confiscated weapons and opened fire on the soldiers. With no cover, and with many of the Indians unarmed, this lasted a few minutes at most. While the Indian warriors and soldiers were shooting at close range, other soldiers (from Battery E, 1st Artillery) used the Hotchkiss guns against the tipi camp full of women and children. It is believed that many of the soldiers were victims of friendly fire from their own Hotchkiss guns. The Indian women and children fled the camp, seeking shelter in a nearby ravine from the crossfire. The officers had lost all control of their men. Some of the soldiers fanned out and finished off the wounded. Others leaped onto their horses and pursued the Natives (men, women, and children), in some cases for miles across the prairies. In less than an hour, at least 150 Lakota had been killed and 50 wounded. Historian Dee Brown, in &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, mentions an estimate of 300 of the original 350 having been killed or wounded and that the soldiers loaded 51 survivors (4 men and 47 women and children) onto wagons and took them to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Army casualties numbered 25 dead and 39 wounded.

====Drexel Mission Fight====
On 30 December 1890, the day after Wounded Knee, COL Forsyth and 8 Troops of the 7th Cavalry and one platoon of Artillery (the same units that had been engaged at Wounded Knee), conducted a reconnaissance to see if the nearby Catholic Mission had been torched by the Indians. In what became known as the Drexel Mission Fight, the 7th Cavalry was ambushed in a valley by Brulé Lakota under Chief Two Strike from the Rosebud Indian Reservation. After exchanging fire with the Indians, the shots were heard by the nearby 9th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) under Major Guy Vernor Henry who rode to the rescue. The Indians were driven off. The 7th Cavalry suffered 2 killed and 7 wounded;

=== Medal of Honor recipients ===
A total of 45 men earned the Medal of Honor while serving with the 7th Cavalry during the American Indian Wars: 24 for actions during the Battle of the Little Bighorn, two during the Battle of Bear Paw, 17 for being involved in the Wounded Knee Massacre or an engagement at White Clay Creek the next day, and two during other actions against the Sioux in December 1890.

==Overseas and the Mexican border==
From 1895 until 1899, the regiment served in New Mexico (Fort Bayard) and Oklahoma (Ft. Sill), then overseas in Cuba (Camp Columbia) from 1899 to 1902. An enlisted trooper with the Seventh Cavalry, &quot;B&quot; Company, from May 1896 until March 1897 at Fort Grant Arizona Territory was author Edgar Rice Burroughs.

The regiment served in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War from 1904 through 1907, with a second tour from 1911 through 1915. Here they conducted counter-insurgency operations against Filipino guerrillas in the jungles and rural areas of the islands.

===Border war===
Back in the United States, the regiment was again stationed in the southwest, in Arizona (Camp Harvey J. Jones), where it patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border and later was part of the Mexican Punitive Expedition of 1916 to 1917. During this expedition, the 7th Cavalry executed what is regarded as America&#x27;s &quot;last true Cavalry charge&quot; at the Battle of Guerrero. Colonel George A. Dodd, commanding a force of 370 from the 7th Cavalry, led his Troopers into the Mexican State of Chihuahua in pursuit of Pancho Villa. After riding 400 miles in 14 days, Dodd&#x27;s exhausted Troopers finally caught up with Villa&#x27;s force in the town of Guerrero on 29 March 1916.

The 7th Cavalry was low on rations, and had to fight a battle against a well defended town. According to varying sources, there were between 200 and 500 Villistas at Guerrero, spread out across the town, and for the first couple of hours after the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s arrival, Dodd had his men attempt to ascertain the number of enemy forces. It was not until 8:00 am that the order to attack was given. Dodd divided his command into three contingents with instructions to charge and surround the town in order to cut off the Villistas&#x27;s avenue of escape. When the Americans charged, fighting erupted at three points. After the charge the Americans dismounted to fight the Mexicans on foot. Guerrero was flanked by mountains on two sides which made it difficult to surround the town and the Villistas used them for cover. There were also not enough cavalrymen to cover all of the escape routes so the majority of the Mexicans got away, including Pancho Villa. Part of the Villista army mounted up and retreated east through a valley. They were pursued by some of the American cavalrymen in a ten-mile running engagement. Another force of Mexicans calmly rode out of Guerrero, pretending to be Carrancistas by displaying a Mexican national flag, this group went unmolested by the 7th Cavalry. Villa lost his friend, General Elicio Hernandez, and fifty-five others killed in the battle and another thirty-five wounded. The Americans suffered only five wounded during a five-hour battle. Colonel Dodd and his men also captured thirty-six horses and mules, two machine guns, many small arms and some war supplies. Several condemned Carrancista prisoners were liberated.

Initially the Battle of Guerrero was thought to be a great opening success in the campaign but it later proved to be a disappointment as it would be the closest they came to capturing Villa in battle. However, the battle was considered the &quot;most successful single engagement of Pershing&#x27;s Punitive Expedition.&quot; After the retreat the Villista army dispersed and for the next three months they no longer posed a significant threat to the United States military. Villa himself hid out in the hills while his knee healed. One day, not long after the battle, Villa was camped at the end of a valley and watched a troop of Pershing&#x27;s cavalrymen ride by. Villa heard them singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary,&quot; this would be the last time Americans got so close to the rebel. News of the victory was widely circulated in the United States, prompting the Senate&#x27;s approval of Colonel Dodd&#x27;s promotion to brigadier general.

In December 1917, eight months after the American entry into World War I, the 7th Cavalry was assigned to the 15th Cavalry Division, an on-paper organization designed for service in France during World War I that was never more than a simple headquarters. This was because no significant role emerged for mounted troops on the Western Front during the 19 months between the entry of the United States into the war and the Armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918. The 7th Cavalry was released from this assignment in May 1918.

On 15 June 1919, Pancho Villa fought his last battle with the Americans. At the Battle of Ciudad Juárez, Villista and Carrancista forces engaged in combat in Ciudad Juárez just south of El Paso, Texas across the Rio Grande. The 7th Cavalry was temporarily at Fort Bliss and responded to the battle when Villista snipers killed and wounded US Soldiers of the 82nd Field Artillery Regiment. The 12th Infantry Regiment, the 82nd Field Artillery, the 5th Cavalry Regiment, and the 7th Cavalry Regiment quickly crossed the Santa Fe Bridge into Mexico to deal with the threat. Advancing towards the enemy, the 7th Cavalry covered the main body&#x27;s flank, and then, under the protection of artillery fire, charged the Villistas and routed them.

===Interwar period===
On 13 September 1921, 7th Cavalry Regiment was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division, which assignment was maintained until 1957. The division and its 2nd Cavalry Brigade was garrisoned at Fort Bliss, Texas, while the 1st Cavalry Brigade was garrisoned at Douglas, Arizona. Additional garrison points were used as well.

The 7th Cavalry Regiment continued to train as horse cavalry right up to the American entry into World War II, including participation in several training maneuvers at the Louisiana Maneuver Area on 26 April – 28 May 1940; 12–22 August 1940; and 8 August – 4 October 1941.

==World War II==
On 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan attacked the US fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, thrusting the United States into World War II, which had already been raging since 1939. The Troopers of the 1st Cavalry Division readied their horses, their equipment, and themselves for the coming war, and were finally alerted for deployment in 1943. Despite being a mounted Cavalry unit since 1866, the 7th Cavalry left its mounts behind in Texas as they left for war; the age of the horse-cavalry was over. The newly dismounted 7th Cavalry Regiment was sent to fight in the Pacific Theater of Operations and the last units left Fort Bliss for Camp Stoneman, CA in June 1943. On 3 July, the 7th Cavalry boarded the &quot;SS Monterey&quot; and the &quot;SS George Washington&quot; bound for Australia. The regiment arrived on 26 July, and was posted to Camp Strathpine, Queensland where they underwent six months of intensive jungle warfare training, and conducted amphibious assault training at nearby Moreton Bay.

===Admiralty Islands campaign===
In January 1944, the 7th Cavalry sailed for Oro Bay on the island of New Guinea. Despite the ongoing New Guinea Campaign, the 7th Cavalry was held in reserve and was organized into &quot;Task Force Brewer&quot; for another mission. On 27 February, TF Brewer embarked from Cape Sudest under the command of Brigadier General William C. Chase. Their objective was the remote Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands which had an important airfield occupied by the Japanese. The 5th Cavalry Regiment landed on 29 February and began the invasion.

The morning of 4 March saw the arrival of the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, which relieved the 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry. The next day Major General Innis P. Swift, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, arrived aboard &quot;Bush&quot; and assumed command. He ordered the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry to attack across the native skidway. The 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry therefore went back into the line to relieve them. While the relief was taking place, the Japanese launched a daylight attack. This was repulsed by the cavalrymen, with the help of artillery and mortar fire, but the American attack was delayed until late afternoon. It then ran into a Japanese minefield and by dawn the advance had only reached as far as the skidway. On the morning of 6 March, another convoy arrived at Hyane Harbour: five LSTs, each towing an LCM, with the 12th Cavalry and other units and equipment including five Landing Vehicles Tracked (LVTs) of the 592nd EBSR, three M3 light tanks of the 603rd Tank Company, and twelve 105mm howitzers of the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The 12th Cavalry was ordered to follow the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in its advance to the north, and to capture the Salami Plantation. The road to Salami was little more than a muddy track in which vehicles soon became bogged. The Japanese also obstructed the route with ditches, felled trees, snipers, and booby traps. Despite incessant rain and suicidal Japanese counterattacks, the 7th Cavalry captured their objectives and mop-up operations were being conducted from 10 to 11 March. Manus Island, to the west, was the next target.

The main landing was to be at Lugos Mission, but General Swift postponed the landing there and ordered the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry to capture Hauwei. The landing was covered by the destroyers &quot;Arunta&quot;, &quot;Bush&quot;, &quot;Stockton&quot; and ; a pair of rocket-firing LCVPs and the LCM (flak), which fired 168  rockets; the guns of the 61st Field Artillery Battalion on Los Negros; and six Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron dropped bombs. The assault was made from three cargo-carrying LVTs. To save wear and tear, they were towed across Seeadler Harbour by LCMs and cut loose for the final run in to shore. The cavalrymen found well constructed and sited bunkers with interlocking fields of fire covering all approaches, and deadly accurate snipers. The next morning an LCM brought over a medium tank, for which the Japanese had no answer, and the cavalrymen were able to overcome the defenders at a cost of eight killed and 46 wounded; 43 dead Japanese naval personnel were counted.

The 8th Cavalry Regiment began the main assault on Manus on 15 March and attacked the important Lorengau Airfield on 17 March. After initially quickly overrunning the enemy positions, the cavalry resumed its advance, and occupied a ridge overlooking the airstrip without opposition. In the meantime, the 7th Cavalry had been landed at Lugos from the LST on its second trip and took over the defense of the area, freeing the 2nd Squadron, 8th Cavalry to join the attack on Lorengau. The first attempt to capture the airstrip was checked by an enemy bunker complex. A second attempt on 17 March, reinforced by the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry and tanks, made good progress. The advance then resumed, with Lorengau itself falling on 18 March.

Although there had been plenty of fighting, the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7th Cavalry found it on 20 March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8th Cavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese bunkers, actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire. These weary Troopers were relieved by the 7th Cavalry on 18 March. That day, the 7th Cavalry attacked, and drove the enemy out of Lorengau Village.

The Admiralty Islands campaign ended on 18 May 1944 with the islands and airfields secured and 3,317 Japanese dead. The 7th Cavalry Regiment suffered 43 killed in action, 17 wounded, and 7 dead from non-battle injuries. Having faced down suicidal Japanese counterattacks and a stubborn defense in the rainy jungles of the Southwest Pacific, the 7th Cavalry Troopers were now veterans.

===Battle of Leyte===

After a period of 5 months in rehabilitation and extensive combat training, the 7th Cavalry Regiment received instructions on 25 September 1944 to prepare for future combat operations. On 20 October, the regiment began the assault of Leyte Island.
The Battle of Leyte began when the first waves of the 7th Cavalry Regiment stormed ashore at White Beach at 1000, H-Hour, and were met with small arms and machine gun fire. 1st Squadron-7th Cavalry Regiment (1-7 Cavalry) landed on the right flank and was to attack north into the Cataisan Peninsula to capture Tacloban Aerodrome. To the left, 2-7 Cavalry was to attack inland, capture San Jose, and seize a beachhead line west of Highway 1. They were met with slight opposition, and within the first 15 minutes, 2-7 Cavalry knocked out two Japanese defensive pillboxes firing into the landing zone. After a house-to-house assault, San Jose was captured by 1230. 2-7 Cavalry&#x27;s largest obstacle was the terrain. &quot;Directly beyond the landing beaches the troops ran into a man-enveloping swamp. All along the line, men cursed as they wallowed toward their objective in mud of arm-pit depth. This unexpectedly tough obstacle however, failed to deter their dogged advance.&quot; By 1545 2-7 Cavalry had crossed Highway No 1. Meanwhile, 1-7 Cavalry, under the command of Major Leonard Smith, had secured the Cataisan Peninsula and the Tacloban Airfield with the aid of the 44th Tank Battalion. All the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s A-Day objectives had been seized before nightfall.

The following day, 21 October 1944, saw 7th Cavalry begin the attack on Tacloban. At 0800, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons advanced abreast toward the city. 1-7 Cavalry entered the city and were overwhelmed by crowds of exuberant Filipinos giving them gifts of eggs and fruit. 2-7 Cavalry, meanwhile, was halted by a force of 200 Japanese entrenched in prepared fighting positions. The Regimental Weapons Troop and Anti-Tank Platoon arrived to break the stalemate but were quickly pinned down by machine gun fire from a bunker as well. PFC Kenneth W. Grove, an ammunition carrier, singlehandedly cut through the jungle, charged the bunker and killed the weapons crew, and allowed the advance to resume. By the end of 22 October the capital of Leyte and its hill defenses were securely in American hands. The 7th Cavalry was one day ahead of schedule, a fact partly explained by the unexpectedly light resistance of the Japanese and partly by the vigor of the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s advance

On 23 October, the 7th was relieved by the 8th Cavalry and prepared to undertake operations to secure the San Juanico Strait across from the island of Samar. On 24 October, landed at Babatngon at 1330 and sent out patrols to secure the beachhead. The landing was unopposed, and 1-7 Cavalry made several other over-water movements to secure the area, making the most of the scant Japanese resistance. By 27 October, (minus 1st Squadron) was in reserve. 1-7 Cavalry, in Babatngon, was ordered to secure the Barugo and Carigara area. Troop C, under 1LT Tower W. Greenbowe, advanced on 28 October without incident, but received fire from Carigara. In the ensuing firefight, C Troop eliminated 75 enemies at the cost of 3 killed, 9 wounded, and 1 missing (the mutilated body of the missing man was found later) before withdrawing to Barugo, where it was joined by the rest of the Squadron on 29 October for an assault on Carigara. They attacked across the Canomontag River by using 2 native canoes, and occupied Carigara by 1200 with no resistance.

After remaining in a reserve role, 2-7 Cavalry relieved elements of the 12th Cavalry operating in the central mountain range of the island. Between 11 and 14 December, they continually assaulted a series of well-defended ridges and hills and only were able to wrest control over them by calling in over 5,000 rounds of artillery support. The 1st Cavalry Division continued to push west toward the coast through the mountainous and dense jungle interior of the island. On the morning of 23 December 1944, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry assault units pushed across Highway 2 and set up night positions on line with the other divisional units. They pushed off for the attack the next morning meeting only scattered resistance. By 29 December, units reached the west coast, north of the village of Tibur, and drove north, capturing the town of Villaba, and killing 35 Japanese there. On 31 December, the Japanese launched four counterattacks on the 7th Cavalry, each starting with a bugle call. The first occurred at 0230 and the last one was at dawn. An estimated 500 enemy attacked the positions, but they were driven off by the stalwart defenders and by American artillery superiority. 77th Infantry Division elements began relieving the 7th Cavalry later that day. Leyte was soon declared secure, despite the large number of Japanese soldiers remaining hidden in the thick jungle of the island&#x27;s interior, and elements of the 7th Cavalry were kept busy by conducting mop-up missions and patrols until their next big operation.

===Battle of Luzon===
For the forces of General MacArthur&#x27;s Southwest Pacific Area the reconquest of Luzon and the Southern Philippines was the climax of the Pacific war. Viewed from the aspect of commitment of U.S. Army ground forces, the Luzon Campaign (including the seizure of Mindoro and the central Visayan Islands) was exceeded in size during World War II only by the drive across northern France. The Luzon Campaign differed from others of the Pacific war in that it alone provided opportunity for the employment of mass and maneuver on a scale even approaching that common to the European and Mediterranean theaters.

The initial Army units in the invasion had landed on 9 January and secured a beachhead, but GEN MacArthur needed more forces on the island to begin his drive to Manila. Despite not receiving adequate rest and replacements from the Battle of Leyte, the 1st Cavalry Division was sent ahead to take part in the Battle of Luzon and landed in Lingayen Gulf on 27 January 1945. The 7th Cavalry quickly moved inland toward Guimba, but as A Troop passed through Labit, they were attacked by a Japanese ambush unit. Technical Sergeant John B. Duncan, of Los Angeles, CA, was cited for his courageous and determined effort to drive the attackers back. He succeeded in doing so, but was mortally wounded. MacArthur ordered that the 1st Cavalry Division assemble three &quot;Flying Columns&quot; for the drive on Manila. The 7th Cavalry was tasked with providing security for them, and air cover on the left flank was provided by the Marine Aircraft Groups 24 and 32 of the 1st Marine Air Wing. As elements of the 8th Cavalry swung south, the 7th Cavalry advanced by foot and kept the Japanese occupied while their counterparts broke through. On 4 February 1945, LTC Boyd L. Branson, the Regimental operation officer from San Mateo, CA, earned the Silver Star by voluntarily leading the advance units over more than 40 miles of un-reconnoitered, enemy-held terrain. While the rest of the Division was fighting in Manila, the 7th Cavalry engaged the enemy near the Novaliches watershed east of the city to prevent their reinforcement. On 20 February, they handed over their positions to elements of the 6th Infantry Division and moved south to begin the attack on the Shimbu Line.

Attacking eastward on the 20th during the onset of the Battle of Wawa Dam, 2-7 Cavalry spearheaded deep into the Japanese line but were quickly fired upon by a heavy barrage of artillery. Drawing on their experiences from the Admiralties and Leyte for attacking entrenched enemy positions in mountainous jungle terrain, the Troopers advanced and destroyed the pillboxes and mortar positions. By 25 February, the 7th Cavalry was 2 kilometers from their objective at Antipolo. The advance continued, and on 4 March, the 7th Cavalry was hit by a strong Japanese counterattack that managed to destroy two of the American&#x27;s supporting tanks before it was defeated. The battle for Antipolo was marked by bitter struggle in unforgiving terrain, and the 1st Cavalry Division was relieved by the 43rd Infantry Division on 12 March after finally capturing the ruined village. Out of the 92 Silver Stars awarded to men of the 1st Cavalry Division in their drive to Antipolo, the largest share went to men of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, with 41 being awarded. PFC Calvin T. Lewis, of Glasgow, KY, B Troop 7th Cavalry, was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism in defeating an enemy bunker. After his platoon was halted by accurate machine gun fire from a concealed bunker, he volunteered to go find it. Wielding a Browning Automatic Rifle, he located the position and poured heavy and accurate fire through the bunker&#x27;s opening. After pinning the enemy down, he moved up and fired into the opening from close range, but was mortally wounded in doing so. Despite his wounds he continued to engage the enemy until all were killed.

After being relieved in their sector on 20 April, the 7th Cavalry prepared for another mission; the capture of Infanta on the east coast of Luzon, which was held by 9,000 troops of the Manila Naval Defense Forces of the Japanese Imperial Navy under Capt. Takesue Furuse who were able to escape the encirclement by the 11th Airborne Division at Fort McKinley mid-February. On 6 May 1945 the 7th Cavalry began moving south into the Santa Maria Valley toward Lamon Bay along Route 455. Along the hairpin curves of the highway, they encountered tough Japanese resistance at the Kapatalin Sawmill. For several days the advance was stalled as patrols reconnoitered the position and pinpointed targets for US Army Air Corps planes. They overran the enemy by mid-afternoon of 9 May. They had killed 350 Japanese for the loss of 4 KIA and 17 WIA. They reached Lamon Bay on 13 May. Sweeping aside Japanese resistance on their march to the coast, the 7th Cavalry Troopers occasionally encountered determined defenders, and the fighting along the advance was characterized by small unit action. On 18 May, A Troop was moving to Real when the lead platoon was pinned down by enemy rifle and machine gun fire. Thinking quickly, Lieutenant Joe D. Crane of Athens, TX led his platoon in a flanking maneuver and annihilated the enemy force, saving his comrades. Near Gumian on 22 May, D Troop was attacked by a large force of 150 Japanese with machine guns, mortars, grenades, and rifles. The foliage was thick enough to conceal the enemy, allowing them to come within ten yards of the Cavalrymen&#x27;s positions before being detected. LT Charles E. Paul of Camden, AR moved to an observation post in the thick of the fighting and called in close and accurate mortar fire, driving the enemy away, and earning the Silver Star for his actions. Accompanied by Philippines guerrillas, the 7th Cavalry captured Infanta on 25 May and soon after secured the surrounding rice-fields. They remained here for some time patrolling the area for Japanese holdouts. By 1 June 1945, most of southern Luzon was in American hands, but there were still determined Japanese forces in the area. On 2 June, 30 Japanese attacked F Troop&#x27;s positions just before dawn broke and the Americans were forced to fight in hand-to-hand combat. SGT Jessie Riddell of Irvine, KY earned his second Silver Star in this attack when he saw one of his Troopers in a death struggle with a Japanese officer wielding a samurai sword. SGT Riddell ran to his aid, shooting 3 attackers on the way, and killed the enemy officer before he could kill the American.

Continuing their patrolling of southern Luzon, a patrol from B Troop ran into an unexpectedly heavy ambush on 19 June 1945. Despite the shock of the ambush, PVT Bernis L. Stringer of Visalia, CA, the patrol&#x27;s BAR-man, ran forward, killing one Japanese and wounding another. He then reloaded in plain sight of the last enemy soldier before dispatching him too. PVT Stringer lost his life soon after in the closing days of the campaign. The Battle of Luzon was officially declared over on 30 June 1945 but scattered Japanese resistance remained. The battle was the longest the 7th Cavalry had fought in World War II, and it would be their last. After pulling out of the combat zone on 4 July, The regiment began to rest and refit as it prepared for the inevitable invasion of the main Japanese islands. On 20 July, the 7th Cavalry again reorganized—this time entirely under Infantry Tables of Organization &amp; Equipment, but still designated as a Cavalry Regiment, in order to bring it up to the full strength of a 1945 Army infantry regiment. Thankfully for the men of the 7th Cavalry, the invasion was terminated after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced the Japanese to surrender. 7th Cavalry Regiment was at Lucena, Tayabas (now. Quezon) in the Philippines until 2 September 1945, when it was moved to Japan to start occupation duty.

==Occupation of Japan==
On 13 August 1945, the 7th Cavalry was alerted that it would accompany General Douglas MacArthur to Tokyo and would be part of the Eighth Army&#x27;s occupation force. On 2 September, the 7th Cavalry landed in Yokohama and began setting up a base of operation. On 8 September, the 1st Cavalry Division sent a convoy under Major General William C. Chase from Hara-Machida to Tokyo to occupy the city. This convoy was made up of one combat veteran from every Troop in the division, and it marched through Hachiōji, Fuchū, and Chōfu before reaching Tokyo; this convoy of the 1st Cavalry Division, with many veterans of the 7th Cavalry Regiment in the ranks, became the first Allied unit to enter the city. The 7th Cavalry set its headquarters at the Japanese Imperial Merchant Marine Academy and were assigned to guard the US embassy and GEN MacArthur&#x27;s residence. For five years they remained in Tokyo. On 25 March 1949, the 7th Cavalry was reorganized under a new table of organization, and its Troops were renamed Companies as in a standard infantry division.

==Korean War==
When World War II ended, the communist Soviet Union and the countries of the Soviet bloc and the United States and its allies became locked in an ideological Cold War. They vied for power across the world using proxy states, but this tension boiled over in the Korean Peninsula. On 25 June 1950, the communist Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded the democratic Republic of Korea. Their military overwhelmed that of their southern neighbors and North Korean tanks were in Seoul within two days. The United States decided to intervene in favor of South Korea and quickly sent in troops with the promise that more were en route. On 18 July 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s 5th and 8th Cavalry Regiments landed at Pohang-dong, 80 miles north of Pusan, in the war&#x27;s first amphibious landing. The 7th Cavalry landed at Pohang-dong on July 22.

The 7th Cavalry, under the command of Colonel Cecil W. Nist, was the 8th Army reserve at Pohang, but when the 5th Cavalry to the north was attacked in great force, the 7th moved up to reinforce them on 25 July. Between 26 and 29 July, 7th Cavalry troopers were dug in astride the main highway 100 miles southeast of Seoul, but were unprepared for the waves of refugees fleeing south. Commanders feared the refugee columns might harbor North Korean infiltrators, and orders came down to stop refugee movements, with gunfire if necessary. The troopers and officers of 2-7 Cavalry opened fire on innocent civilians, mostly women and children, in the No Gun Ri massacre. In 2005, a South Korean government inquest committee certified the names of 150 No Gun Ri dead, 13 missing, and 55 wounded, including some who later died of their wounds. It said reports were not filed on many other victims. Survivors claim the number of dead was closer to 400.

During the next few days a defensive line was formed at Hwanggan with the 7th Cavalry moving east and the 5th Cavalry replacing elements of the 25th Infantry Division. On 1 August, the 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to set up a defensive position near Kumchon on the rail route from Taegu to Pusan. For more than 50 days between late July and mid September 1950, 7th Cavalry Troopers and UN Soldiers performed the bloody task of holding on the vital Pusan Perimeter. At dawn on 9 August, North Korea hurled five divisions against the American lines along the Naktong River near Taegu and managed to gain some high ground. Major General Hobart R. Gay, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, withheld counterattacking until he had more information, but soon learned that 750 Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) troops had occupied Hill 268, soon to be known as &quot;Triangulation Hill. At about 09:30, General Gay ordered 1-7 Cavalry to counter the KPA penetration. The Battalion moved from its bivouac area just outside Taegu, accompanied by five tanks of A Company, 71st Heavy Tank Battalion. This motorized force proceeded to the foot of Hill 268. Meanwhile, the 61st Field Artillery Battalion shelled the hill heavily.&quot;However, 1st Battalion-7th Cavalry Regiment counterattacked their flanks at 0930 that day, and managed to seize Hill 268, &quot;Trianglation Hill&quot;, and killed 400 enemy. The morning of 10 August, a combined tank and infantry attack next reached the crest of the Triangulation Hill without much trouble, and this battle was over by about 16:00. US artillery and mortar fire was now shifted westward, and this cut off the KPA retreat. White phosphorus shells fired from the 61st Field Artillery Battalion caught KPA troops in a village while they attempted to retreat, and they were then routed by US infantry, suffering over 200 killed. That evening the 1-7 Cavalry, returned to the serve as the division reserve, and elements of the 5th Cavalry finished securing Hill 268.

On 26 August 1950, to replenish losses suffered in battle and to build the 7th Cavalry up to its authorized strength, 2nd Battalion-30th Infantry Regiment, from the 3rd Infantry Division, was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division and was redesignated as the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment. By 5 September, enemy pressure along the sector of the 1st Cavalry Division had increased tremendously. General Gay ordered a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division in order to shorten lines and occupy better defensive positions. The withdrawal movement began on the right with the 8th Cavalry, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area and finally the 5th Cavalry in vicinity of Waegwan. The key to the withdrawal was Hill 464, behind the 2nd Battalion-7th Cavalry, that dominated the Waegwan – Tabu-dong road. The withdrawal was slowed by mud created by heavy rains which fell 5–6 September, hampering the movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles. On 6 September, at 0300 hours, 2-7 Cavalry disengaged from the enemy on Hill 464 and fought its way to the east. The 5th Cavalry, occupying positions on Hill 303, came under heavy fire and was driven from key terrain, however, they were able to recapture the lost ground with the aid of elements of the 70th Tank Battalion attached to the 1st Cavalry Division. During the next few days, the situation was precarious. The North Koreans had gained large footholds east of Naktong and south to within about 8 miles of Taegu in the vicinity of Hills 314 and 570. On 12 September, the 3rd Battalion-7th Cavalry was tasked to retake Hill 314. After a fierce struggle, the hill was taken. The North Korean drive halted on 13 September, seven miles short of Taegu. Their momentum began to slow and plans were laid for an all-out offensive.

The turning point in this bloody battle came on 15 September 1950, when GEN MacArthur unleashed his plan to go around the advancing North Korean Army; Operation Chromite – an amphibious landing at Incheon, far behind the North Korean lines. In spite of the many negative operational reasons given by critics of the plan, the Inchon landing was an immediate success allowing the 1st Cavalry Division to break out of the Pusan Perimeter and start fighting north. Task Force Lynch was formed to execute a rapid breakthrough to link up with the Inchon landing forces; it was composed of the 3rd Battalion-7th Cavalry, B Co 8th Engineer Battalion, C Co and the I&amp;R Platoon of 70th Tank Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Battalion (-), 3rd Platoon Heavy Mortar Company, and a tactical air support liaison team. On 22 September, TF Lynch attacked north, breaking out of the Pusan Perimeter and fighting across 106 miles of enemy territory. On 27 September, north of Osan, at a small bridge, L Co, 3-7 Cavalry, linked up with H Co, 31st Infantry, 7th Infantry Division of the landing force. On 28 September, K Co, 3-7 Cavalry, along with C Co 70th Tank Battalion and with the strong assistance of fighter-bombers, destroyed at least seven of ten North Korean T-34&#x27;s in the Pyongtaek area, five by air strikes. After linking up with the rest of the 1st Cavalry Division by 4 October, continued its advance north, securing Kaesong by the 8th, and crossing the 38th parallel on 9 October 1950. The 7th Cavalry rounded up 2,000 prisoners. In one of the ironic moments of the war, Troopers took into custody a small North Korean cavalry unit and all its horses. The Troopers of the 1st Cavalry crashed into Pyongyang, capturing the capital city of North Korea on 19 October 1950.

In late October 1950, the 7th Cavalry moved north again. The North Korean Army was shattered and the UN Troops were nearing the Chinese border; the war seemed to be all but over. On 25 October, Communist China intervened on behalf of North Korea and began pushing UN Troops back. On 24 November, the 7th Cavalry was involved in a grand UN counterattack, but Chinese attacks shattered the ROK Army II Corps on the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s flank, leaving it exposed. On 26 November, the Chinese penetrated the front companies of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 7th Cavalry and tried to exploit the gap. At 0200 hours they were hit by elements of the 3rd Battalion reinforced by tanks. Red troops were stopped and retreated back into an area previously registered for artillery fire. Enemy losses were high and the shoulder was held. On 29 November, the Chinese attacked the 7th Cavalry again, and the Americans were forced to fall back to Sinchang-ni, North Pyongan Province. At midnight, the Chinese attacked again. They were repulsed, but small infiltration teams managed to attack a Battalion command post before being driven off. At the Battle of Sinchang-ni, 7th Cavalry suffered 39 KIA, 107 WIA, and 11 MIA. Enormous Chinese numbers, the surprise of their attack, and the bitter cold of the North Korean winter forced UN troops to fall back. During the withdrawal, the Greek Army&#x27;s Sparta Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Georgios Koumanakos was attached to the 7th Cavalry Regiment and became 4th Battalion (GEF)-7th Cavalry on 16 December 1950. The Greeks soon proved themselves to be gallant soldiers in battle. By 28 December 1950, 7th Cavalry Troopers were in defensive positions near Uijeongbu. The year of 1951 would begin as a cold and dark time for the men of the 7th Cavalry. They had been pushed back into South Korea by the Chinese after having seemingly all but defeated North Korean Communist forces, but the fight was not over yet.

On 22 January 1951, 7th Cavalry began an attack on Chinese lines near Kyong-ni. Here, the Greek Battalion on Hill 381 was counterattacked by a large enemy force. The battle began before dawn and raged on for the rest of the day. By afternoon, the Chinese had enough and retreated leaving 800 dead. The regiment continued its slow drive north. By 12 February, the 7th Cavalry ran into effective enemy defensive positions. On 14 February, heavy fighting erupted around an objective known as Hill 578, which was finally taken by the 7th Cavalry after overcoming stiff Chinese resistance. During this action General MacArthur paid a welcome visit to the First Team. By 22 April 1951, 1st Cavalry Division approached the Hwachon Reservoir on &quot;Phase Line Kansas.&quot; The 7th Cavalry was ordered to capture the dam which would eliminate the possibility of the enemy destroying it and flooding the area. The approaches to the dam severely restricted vehicular movement and the artillery could not be brought into range to support an attack. In an alternate approach, the 4th Ranger Company, attached to the 7th Cavalry, was to cross the reservoir by boat and attack from the east as the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry attacked from the southwest. The Troopers made three separate assaults on the defenders, but none was successful in evicting them. Before another attempt could be organized, the troopers were pulled out for another fight.

From 9 June to 27 November, the 7th Cavalry took on various roles in the summer-fall campaign of the United Nations. On 18 July, a year after it had entered the war, the 1st Cavalry Division was assigned to a reserve status. This type of duty did not last for long. On the nights of 21 and 23 September, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 7th Cavalry repulsed waves of Red Chinese involving hand-to-hand fighting. Earlier in the war, the Chinese attacks, which were accompanied by a cacophony of bells, bugles, whistles, and war cries, terrified the Americans; but after stopping the Chinese counterattack, 7th Cavalry Troopers lost their fear and stood their ground against the sometimes relentless and self-sacrificial enemy. Harder fighting soon followed when Operation Commando, a mission to push the Chinese out of their winter defense positions south of the Yokkok River, was launched. During this operation, the objective was designated as the Jamestown Line.

On 3 October 1951, the 5th and 7th Cavalry attacked abreast along the division front at 0600 hours. Attacking with the Greek, 2nd and 3rd Battalions abreast, they stormed Hills 313 and 418 along the ridge. Both the Greek and 2nd Battalion fought their way to the ridge line, but suffering heavy casualties, neither could hold the ground. Despite heavy fighting on 4 October, there was little forward progress. Elements of the 8th Cavalry reinforced the 7th Cavalry on the right and assaulted the ridges west of Hill 418, but the enemy clung stubbornly to its positions. During the day, elements of the Chinese 140th Division moved up to reinforce their 139th Division which had been hit hard by the constant attacks of the 1st Cavalry Division. On 5 October, it was discovered that the Chinese had withdrawn much of their force in the night and 2-7 Cavalry occupied Hills 418 and 313 without opposition. The following day, at Hill 287, 1-7 Cavalry, fought its way to the crest and held on to part of the hill at nightfall. Enemy prisoners taken indicated that many of the Chinese units were defeated in the opening days of the operation and were falling back to prepared defensive lines to the northwest. On 7 October, the 7th Cavalry effected the seizure of Hill 287 and sent the 3rd Battalion forward two miles southwest to take Hill 347. Attacking from the south, 3-7 Cavalry cleared the hill at the end of the day. The fall of Hill 347 meant that the 1st Cavalry Division now controlled the high ground overlooking the Jamestown Line.

The 7th Cavalry Troopers did not know it, but the battle for Line Jamestown would be their last major combat of the Korean War. On 18 December 1951, the 7th Cavalry left for Hokkaido, Japan after 549 days of continuous fighting. On 12 December 1952, 7th Cavalry returned to Korea, relieving the 8th Cavalry, and held reserve defensive positions as forward UN troops continued skirmishing with Communist forces as the peace talks occurred. 7th Cavalry returned to Hokkaido on 20 February 1953, and the Korean War finally &quot;ended&quot; when the long-awaited armistice was signed at 10:00 on 27 July 1953. While still technically at war, UN and Communist forces ceased all combat operations. The war had been tough; the 7th Cavalry Regiment suffered defeats early in the 1950, but rebounded and took the fight to the northern end of North Korea, where they suffered an agonizing reverse at the hand of the Chinese in the harsh winter. Despite this, they managed to hold their lines and counterattack, learning from their early mistakes and serving with valor and skill.

==Cold War and Vietnam==
The regiment was relieved from its assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division on 15 October 1957, and reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) on 1 November 1957. HQ &amp; HQ Company transferred to the control of the Department of the Army. 1 November,
As part of this reorganization, Company &quot;A&quot; was redesignated 1st Battle Group, 7th Cavalry and assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division. Company &quot;B&quot; was redesignated 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 7th Cavalry and Company &quot;C&quot; was redesignated 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron, 7th Cavalry and assigned to the 10th Infantry Division.

After the Korean War, 7th Cavalry was used mainly in a reconnaissance role. It received the M14 rifle, along with various other new weapons and equipment (including the Patton tank). Also, a few OH-13 helicopters were used by the reconnaissance squadrons.

Three battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 5th, served during the Vietnam War as the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. 3rd Brigade often referred to itself as the &quot;Garryowen Brigade&quot;. These troopers were armed with the new M16 rifle, M1911A1 Pistols and the M79 grenade launcher. The use of Bell UH-1 Iroquois &quot;Huey&quot; helicopters transformed the 1st Cavalry into an &quot;Air-mobile&quot; unit. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 7th Cavalry fought in one of the first American engagements of the Vietnam War, the Battle of Ia Drang. Over the course of the war, seven men earned the Medal of Honor while serving with the 7th Cavalry in Vietnam: Private First Class Lewis Albanese, Company B, 5th Battalion; First Lieutenant Douglas B. Fournet, Company B, 1st Battalion; Sergeant John Noble Holcomb, Company D, 2nd Battalion; Second Lieutenant Walter Joseph Marm Jr., Company A, 1st Battalion; Private First Class William D. Port, Company C, 5th Battalion; Specialist Four Héctor Santiago-Colón, Company B, 5th Battalion; and First Lieutenant James M. Sprayberry, Company D, 5th Battalion.

The other two units, the 3rd and 4th reconnaissance Squadrons, were based in Germany, and South Korea.

The 1st, 2nd, and 5th Battalions were deactivated after the Vietnam War, and only the 3rd and 4th Squadrons remained as divisional reconnaissance squadrons assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and 2nd Infantry Division respectively. Both the 3rd and 4th squadrons were aviation-tank cavalry squadrons using the M48 Patton tank, M113A1 Armored Personnel Carrier and M114A1E1 armored reconnaissance vehicle. Both squadrons had an air cavalry &quot;Delta&quot; Troop, that had both reconnaissance &amp; gunship UH-1B&#x27;s. The gunships were armed with M-5 rocket launchers, and M-22 anti-tank guided missiles. In 1963, the 3rd Squadron became the divisional cavalry squadron for the 3rd Infantry Division and was stationed at Ledward &amp; Conn Barracks, Schweinfurt, West Germany. The squadron consisted of three ground troops and a Headquarters Troop at Ledward Barracks and an aviation troop at Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt. The ground troops were equipped with M60A3 TTS Patton tanks, M113A1 armored personnel carriers, ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle, an M113 variant) and a mortar section with the M106A1, an M113 variant with a 4.2 in mortar. In 1984 the M60A3 TTS Patton were replaced with M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) and also replaced with M1A1 Abrams. The reorganization created two M3-equipped ground troops, one long range surveillance (LRSU) ground troop and two aviation troops equipped with OH-58 scout helicopters and AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters. On 16 November 1992, the squadron was inactivated in Germany and relieved of assignment to the 8th Infantry Division. The Headquarters and Headquarters Troop consolidated on 16 December 1992 with the 3rd Reconnaissance Company and designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry.

On 16 February 1996, the squadron was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and activated at Fort Stewart, Georgia as the Division Cavalry Squadron. The squadron has been involved in several deployments since then, including Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait, Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The squadron was reassigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division in 2004 as the brigade&#x27;s Armored Reconnaissance Squadron. Combat operations for Operation Iraqi Freedom III began on 4 February 2005 when the squadron arrived at Forward Operating Base Rustamiyah located in southeast Baghdad. Immediately on arrival, the squadron began patrolling the area east of the Tigris River in the Rusafa and New Baghdad districts as well as securing Route Pluto North, one of the primary supply routes for the division.

Between 1974 and 1975, other units were reactivated. The 1st Battalion became an armored unit, the 2nd Battalion remained an air mobile unit with a recon platoon using motorcycles moved by helicopters. After 1975, the 2nd and 5th Battalion were reorganized as mechanized infantry. In 1978, the 5th Battalion was once again deactivated.

==The Persian Gulf War==
The 1st and 4th Squadrons fought in Operation Desert Storm in January/February 1991. Ground troops were armed with the M3A1 Bradley CFV. Air cavalry troops AH-1F Cobras, OH-58C scouts.

The 1st Squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter L. Sharp, was the divisional cavalry squadron for the 1st Cavalry Division and assigned to the division&#x27;s aviation brigade. The squadron was organized as a headquarters troop, one ground troop (Troop A), and two air troops (Troops C and D). Prior to deployment, the squadron also attached two ground troops, Troop A, and Troop B, 2d Squadron, 1st Cavalry, from the inactivating 2d Armored Division, also at Fort Hood. After attachment, the additional troops were provisionally flagged as Troop B, and Troop E, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry. The squadron was in Southwest Asia from October 1990 until May 1991. During the campaign, 1-7 CAV overwatched the border area of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait did numerous recon missions into Iraq and led the 1st Cavalry Division during its attack into Iraq after being released as the CENTCOM theater reserve. After the war, Trp E/1-7 CAV remained in the squadron&#x27;s task organization through its reorganization in 1993, exchanging its guidons with Trp C/1-7 CAV in 1994.

The 4th Squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Terry L. Tucker, was the divisional cavalry squadron for 3rd Armored Division, taking part of the Battle of Phase Line Bullet. The squadron was inactivated in 1992 with the rest of the 3d Armored Division. In 1996, the squadron was reactivated as a subordinate element of Aviation Brigade, 2d Infantry Division at Camp Pelham, Korea (later renamed Camp Garryowen), using the equipment and personnel of the inactivating 5th Squadron, 17th Cavalry. In 2004, the squadron was reassigned as a subordinate element of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 2d Infantry Division, Camp Hovey, Korea.

==The Iraq War==
The 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry was the spearhead and the screening force for the main elements of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division during the Iraq War. The 3d Squadron launched an attack under the command of LTC Terry Ferrell on 20 March 2003.

Combat operations for Operation Iraqi Freedom began on 20 March 2003, when the squadron crossed into Iraq as the lead element of the 3rd Infantry Division. The Squadron attacked towards Baghdad fighting both the Republican Guard and the Sadam Fedayeen. With the capture of Baghdad, the division and the squadron transitioned to stabilization operations. By the time the Squadron had redeployed, it had killed 2,200 Iraqi personnel, 64 tanks, 41 armored vehicles, numerous active air defense systems, as well as trucks and civilian vehicles used as suicide bombers. They were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, the highest award given to a unit. The 3rd Squadron remains the only &quot;spearhead&quot; element to complete a combat tour without suffering a casualty.

The 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry returned to Iraq as part of the 2nd Brigade Heavy Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom III. Between 21 January 2005 and 10 January 2006, the Squadron conducted combat operations in the burroughs of Rustamiyah, in southern Baghdad, the town of Salman Pak, and the Tigris river. The Squadron was led by LTC Michael J. Johnson. The Squadron fought through multiple engagements with insurgent forces; which, unfortunately resulted in the death of several Troopers and attached personnel. The Squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for its performance in their Area of Operations.

The 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry was mobilized yet again during the surge, OIV V May 9, 2007 – August 15, 2008, as part of the 2nd Brigade Heavy Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division. As fate would have it, the 2nd HBCT was commanded by Colonel Terry L. Ferrel who commanded the Squadron during the drive to Baghdad in 2003. Unfortunately, the Squadron led by LTC Jeffery D. Broadwater was detached to a Brigade of the 82nd Airbone Division to conduct combat operations in the borough of Adamiyah in Baghdad. The Squadron fought through tough built up conditions against a determined insurgency resulting again in Troopers and attachments making the ultimate sacrifice. The Squadron returned to Fort Stewart, Georgia knowing it will deploy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in the near future.

The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry served in the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s 5th Brigade Combat Team (BCT) during its first deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II from 1 April 2004 to 1 April 2005. The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, commanded by LTC William R. Salter executed combat operations in the Al Rashid District of Baghdad, Iraq. The squadron defeated a surge of enemy attacks and neutralized insurgent and terrorist elements within its area of operations (AO) through a combination of constant day to day interaction with the populace and adaptable tactics. In addition to securing an AO of 68 km2 with a population of more than 1.2 million, the Squadron also secured Route Irish, a strategic highway and Multi-National Corps-Iraq (MNC-I) Main Supply Route connecting the International Zone (IZ) to the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP). The squadron also helped provide a secure environment during the first Iraqi democratic election in January 2005. 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for its actions during this campaign.

Most recently, 1-7 CAV, commanded by LTC Kevin S. MacWatters, deployed as the Armed Reconnaissance Squadron for 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08 (6 October 2006 to 15 January 2008). The squadron conducted full-spectrum operations as a part of Multi-National Division-Baghdad (MND-B)in the Taji Area of Operations. During this deployment the squadron destroyed multiple improvised explosive device (IED) and vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) terrorist cells as a part of the &quot;Surge&quot;, enhancing MND-B&#x27;s ability to secure Baghdad. The secure environment created by the squadron in the Taji area enabled local government to take hold, local police and Iraqi Army forces to take over security operations, and the &quot;Reconciliation&quot; to successfully spread throughout the Area of Operations.

The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry was attached to the 39th BCT although assigned to 3d BCT, 1st CAV. The unit deployed to Iraq under the command of LTC Charles Forshee seven months after arrival in Iraq and was succeeded by LTC James Eugene Rainey in August 2004, the 2nd Battalion supported US Marine Corps operations during the battle of Najaf (2004) and the Battle of Fallujah.

The 2nd Battalion moved from 3rd BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, Ft Hood Texas, to Ft Bliss to become part of the newly formed 4th BCT and in October 2006 The 2nd Battalion again headed for Iraq, this time to Mosul. 2-7 Cav consisting of only four infantry companies were tasked with eliminating AQI and patrolling Iraq&#x27;s third largest city, dividing the sprawling urban area into quarters. Within the first several months the battalion took the first casualties of the 4th BCT. Since October 2006, C Co. 2-7 Cav. has endured 6 KIA and numerous wounded.
2nd Battalion redeployed in December 2007 to Fort Bliss, TX. In 2008, it deployed from Fort Hood, TX to Iraq in support of OIF 08–09. Maintaining control of the northern half of the Maysan province of Iraq, it operated out of FOB Garryowen. FOB Garryowen, located in Amarah, Iraq&#x27;s border city with Iran, was established in June 2008 for the battalion by a team of 23 Air Force enlisted engineers and 2nd PLT C/2-7 CAV prior to the arrival of the battalion&#x27;s main body. 08-09 B/2-7 CAV was relieved by the OIF 06-08 B 2-7 CAV (now 4-6 INF out of Ft.Bliss) who along with the Iraqi Police in Majar al Kabir captured the criminals responsible for murdering 6 British Military Police in November 2004. Among its other accomplishments, 2-7 CAV worked with the Iraqi Security Forces to provide successful security to Iraq&#x27;s provincial elections in January 2009 and is responsible for several large volume cache finds. During its tour, the 10th Iraqi Army Division conducted Operation &quot;Lion&#x27;s Roar,&quot; a combined live-fire exercise in Maysan province in April 2009.

As part of the Army&#x27;s modularity program, the 3rd Infantry Division converted the 1-3 Air Defense Artillery battalion to become 5th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, an armored reconnaissance squadron. The 5th Squadron deployed in 2005 and most recently in January 2007. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Cliff Wheeler, the squadron initially operated north of Ramadi, and remained under the operational control of the 1st Brigade Combat Team. In April 2007, the squadron conducted a full-scale movement to contact, clearing from Ramadi, to the south of Lake Habbaniyah, and then east to Route Iron in Fallujah, while attaching to the Marine Corps&#x27; 6th Regimental Combat Team and basing at Camp Baharia. Due to the firepower and mobility inherent within a cavalry squadron, 5-7 CAV was assigned the largest battlespace within RCT 6&#x27;s area of operations.

The squadron also suffered from the limitations in assigned troopers that also comes with the cavalry. For eight months, the squadron conducted security and COIN operations across the Warpaint AO. The squadron established and maintained freedom of movement along Routes Michigan, Iron, San Juan and Gold, and maintained a secure environment in the towns of Saqliwiyah, North Saqliwiyah, Amariyah, and Farris. Additional operations at both the troop and squadron level cleared and held new terrain within the regimental security zone. In December 2007, the squadron was attached to the operational control of the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team at FOB Kalsu. The squadron conducted relief-in-place with two USMC rifle battalions and redeployed to Kalsu in approximately eight days. An additional week of training and preparations were required before they attacked into Arab Jabour and cleared the town of Sayafiyah (30,000 residents) in conjunction with the Iraqi &quot;Sons of Iraq&quot; program. The squadron occupied an area that had seen no long-term coalition forces presence, and conducted operations in an austere environment. The squadron secured all routes with fixed positions while simultaneously building COP Meade, clearing all routes, terrain and structures within the new Warpaint AO. The squadron completed the mission in March 2008, and conducted a relief-in-place with 1-187 IN, the Rakkasans, before redeploying to Fort Stewart in April 2008.

During OIF V, the squadron suffered six KIA and numerous wounded. During 20 months of subsequent dwell time, the squadron participated, as part of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, in the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosive consequence management reaction force (CCMRF) mission in support of the requirements of defense support to civil authority. This mission requires the unit, at the request of local, state or national civil authorities, to deploy within the United States in response to a catastrophic event.

They maintained this partnership until the Squadron moved from Świętoszów, Poland to Hohenfels Training Area, Germany November 2018 in support of Combined Resolve XI.
While the Squadron was headquartered in Świętoszów, Poland for a majority of the deployment, elements constantly deployed abroad across Europe in order to partner with various NATO Allies. A Troop, C Troop, and D Troop deployed to Pabradė Training Area, Lithuania; Tata and Várpalota, Hungary; and Lest, Slovakia, respectively. Each Troop, including B Troop who remained in Świętoszów, Poland, conducted joint combined arms live fire exercises with their partnered hosts. Live fire exercises were normally accompanied by &quot;force-on-force&quot; situational training exercises. In total, 1st Squadron partnered with 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade from Poland, Mechanized Infantry Brigade &quot;Iron Wolf&quot; from Lithuania, 5th and 25th Mechanized Infantry Brigades from the Hungarian Ground Forces, and 112th Mechanized Infantry Battalion from the Slovakian Ground Forces.

The Squadron moved to Hohenfels Training Area, Germany in November 2018 in order to participate in Combined Resolve XI. The exercise included over 5500 participants from 16 different NATO allies and partners. A 10-day force-on-force exercise was held at Hohenfels Training Area where all 16 participants acted as either friendly or opposing forces (OPFOR). The Squadron relocated to Grafenwoehr Training Area in late December 2018, and participated in a Brigade live fire exercise from 13 to 25 January 2019. 1st Squadron conducted redeployment operations from February to April 2019.

==In popular culture==

* In the 1956 movie &quot;7th Cavalry&quot;, directed by Joseph H. Lewis, Captain Benson (Randolph Scott), who has been on furlough, comes back to the fort just after the Battle of the Little Bighorn and discovers half of the men died. Others hold Benson in contempt, not only for not being at the battle in command of his company of men, but for what they perceived as Custer&#x27;s favoritism of him.
* &quot;The 7th Is Made Up of Phantoms&quot; is Episode 130 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in which the 7th Cavalry plays a major role. It originally aired on 6 December 1963 on CBS.
* The experiences of the 1st and 2nd Battalions at the November 1965 Battle of Ia Drang are recounted in the book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...And Young&quot; by Lieutenant General Harold G. Moore, then a lieutenant colonel and commander of the 1st Battalion, and United Press International correspondent Joseph L. Galloway. The book was later adapted into the film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, with Mel Gibson as Moore and Barry Pepper as Galloway.
* 1991 TV miniseries &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; based on the life of Lt. Col. George A. Custer, and the 7th Cavalry, which ends with the battle of Little Bighorn engagement where 5 companies of the 7th Cavalry are wiped out, along with George Custer, Thomas Custer, Boston Custer and Audie Reed.

<text>Wilder Graves Penfield (January 26, 1891April 5, 1976) was an American-Canadian neurosurgeon. He expanded brain surgery&#x27;s methods and techniques, including mapping the functions of various regions of the brain such as the cortical homunculus. His scientific contributions on neural stimulation expand across a variety of topics including hallucinations, illusions, dissociation and &quot;déjà vu&quot;. Penfield devoted much of his thinking to mental processes, including contemplation of whether there was any scientific basis for the existence of the human soul.

==Life and career ==

===Early life and education===
Born in Spokane, Washington, on January 26, 1891, Penfield spent most of his early life in Hudson, Wisconsin. He studied at Princeton University, where he was a member of Cap and Gown Club and played on the football team. After graduation in 1913, he was hired briefly as the team coach. In 1915 he obtained a Rhodes Scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, where he studied neuropathology under Sir Charles Scott Sherrington. After one term at Merton, Penfield went to France where he served as a dresser in a military hospital in the suburbs of Paris. He was wounded in 1916 when the ferry he was aboard, the SS &quot;Sussex&quot;, was torpedoed. The following year, he married Helen Kermott, and began studying at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, attaining his medical degree in 1918; this was followed by a short period as a house surgeon at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. Returning to Merton College in 1919, Penfield spent the next two years completing his studies; during this time he met Sir William Osler. In 1924, he worked for five months with Pío del Río Hortega characterising the type of glial cells known as oligodendroglia. He also studied in Germany with Fedor Krause and Otfrid Foerster, as well as in New York City. In 1928, during the 6 months he spent in Germany with Foerster, he learned how to use local anesthesia to keep brain surgery patients awake.

===Medical career===
After taking a surgical apprenticeship under Harvey Cushing, he obtained a position at the Neurological Institute of New York, where he carried out his first solo operations to treat epilepsy. While in New York, he met David Rockefeller, who wished to endow an institute where Penfield could further study the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Academic politics amongst the New York neurologists, however, prevented its establishment in New York, so, in 1928, Penfield accepted an invitation from Sir Vincent Meredith to move to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. There, Penfield taught at McGill University and the Royal Victoria Hospital, becoming the city&#x27;s first neurosurgeon.

In 1934, Penfield, along with William Cone, founded and became the first director of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital at McGill University, established with the Rockefeller funding. That year, he also became a British subject (as part of the British Empire, there was no distinct Canadian citizenship until 1947).

Penfield was unable to save his only sister, Ruth, who died from brain cancer, though complex surgery he performed added years to her life.

Penfield was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950 and retired ten years later in 1960. He was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in the 1953 New Year Honours list. He turned his attention to writing, producing a novel as well as his autobiography &quot;No Man Alone.&quot; A later biography, &quot;Something Hidden&quot;, was written by his grandson Jefferson Lewis.

In 1960, the year he retired, Penfield was awarded the Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. He delivered the corresponding Lister Oration, &quot;Activation of the Record of Human Experience&quot;, at the Royal College of Surgeons of England on April 27, 1961. In 1967, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada and, in 1994, was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. Much of his archival material is housed in the Osler Library at McGill University.

===Later life===
In his later years, Penfield dedicated himself to the public interest, particularly in support of university education. With his friends Governor-General Georges Vanier and Pauline Vanier, he co-founded the Vanier Institute of the Family &quot;to promote and guide education in the homeman&#x27;s first classroom.&quot; He was also an early proponent of childhood bilingualism.

Penfield died on April 5, 1976, of abdominal cancer at Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. He and his wife, Helen, had their ashes buried on the family property in East Bolton (Bolton-Est), Quebec on Sargent&#x27;s Bay, Lake Memphremagog.

==Scientific contributions==
===Neural stimulation===

Penfield was a groundbreaking researcher and original surgeon. His development of a neurosurgical technique using an instrument known as the Penfield dissector, which produced the least injurious meningo-cerebral scar, became widely accepted in the field of neurosurgery and remains in regular use. With his colleague Herbert Jasper, he invented the &quot;Montréal Procedure&quot; in which he treated patients with severe epilepsy by destroying nerve cells in the brain where the seizures originated. Before operating, he stimulated the brain with electrical probes while the patients were conscious on the operating table (under only local anesthesia), and observed their responses. In this way he could more accurately target the areas of the brain responsible, reducing the side-effects of the surgery.

This technique also allowed him to create maps of the sensory and motor cortices of the brain (see cortical homunculus) showing their connections to the various limbs and organs of the body. These maps are still used today, practically unaltered. Along with Herbert Jasper, he published this work in 1951 (2nd ed., 1954) as the landmark &quot;Epilepsy and the Functional Anatomy of the Human Brain&quot;. This work contributed a great deal to understanding the localization of brain function. Penfield&#x27;s maps showed considerable overlap between regions (e.g. the motor region controlling muscles in the hand sometimes also controlled muscles in the upper arm and shoulder) a feature which he put down to individual variation in brain size and localisation: it has since been established that this is due to the fractured somatotopy of the motor cortex. From these results he developed his cortical homunculus map, which is how the brain sees the body from an inside perspective.

Penfield reported that stimulation of the temporal lobes could lead to vivid recall of memories. Oversimplified in popular psychology publications, including the best-selling &quot;I&#x27;m OK – You&#x27;re OK&quot;, this seeded the common misconception that the brain continuously &quot;records&quot; experiences in perfect detail, although these memories are not available to conscious recall. Reported episodes of recall occurred in less than five percent of his patients, though these results have been replicated by modern surgeons. Penfield&#x27;s hypothesis on this subject was revised in 1970.

===Hallucinations===
Penfield&#x27;s scientific contributions go past the somatosensory and the motor cortices; his extensive work of the functions of the brain also included charting the functions of the parietal and temporal cortices. Of his 520 patients, 40 reported that while their temporal lobe was stimulated with an electrode they would recall dreams, smells, visual and auditory hallucinations, as well as out-of-body experiences. In his studies, Penfield found that when the temporal lobe was stimulated it produced a combination of hallucinations, dream, and memory recollection. These experiences would only last as long as the electrode stimulations were present on the cortex, and in some cases when patient experienced hallucinatory experiences that evoked certain smells, sensations of flashing light, stroking the back of their hand, and many others. Other stimulations had patients experiencing &quot;déjà vu&quot;, fear, loneliness, and strangeness. Certain areas of patients&#x27; temporal lobes were stimulated with an electrode in order to experience memories. Penfield called these perceptual illusions (physical hallucinations) interpretive responses. According to Penfield, when the temporal lobe was stimulated there were two types of perceptions experienced by patients:

# Experential experience – where the patient recorded hearing a song, or seeing a flash of light.
# Strip experience – The recall seems familiar to the patient and comes from the patient&#x27;s past even though the patient may not be able to pinpoint the exact occasion. The recall of a memory or memories could reinforce the emotion tied to the experience.

Penfield stressed that the &quot;things that have been recorded are the things which once came within the spot-light of attention&quot;. Penfield had over 25 years of research using electrical stimulation to produce experiential hallucinations. His conclusions show that patients experience a range of hallucinations from simple to complex. They also show that hallucinations can be stimulated.

===Déjà vu===

Penfield&#x27;s expansion of the interpretive cortex includes the phenomenon of &quot;déjà vu&quot;. &quot;Déjà vu&quot; is the sensation that an experience a person is having has previously been experienced. &quot;Déjà vu&quot; is typically experienced by people between the ages of 15 and 25, and affects approximately 60-70% of the population. It is thought to be a mismatch of the sensory input people receive and the system in which the brain recalls memory. Another thought on the cause of &quot;déjà vu&quot; is that there is a malfunction in the brain&#x27;s short- and long-term memory systems where memories become stored in incorrect systems. There are several ways one can recognize familiar experiences – by mentally retrieving memories of a previous experience, or by having a feeling that an experience has occurred when it actually has not. &quot;Déjà vu&quot; is having that feeling of familiarity in a situation that is completely new. Memory is good at being familiar with objects, however it does not do well with the configuration or organization of objects. &quot;Déjà vu&quot; is an extreme reaction to the mind telling an individual that they are having a familiar experience. &quot;Déjà vu&quot; is thought to be a consistent phenomenon. However, it has been associated with epilepsy, and with multiple psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and anxiety, but there has not been a clear, frequent diagnostic correlation between &quot;déjà vu&quot; and neurological or psychiatric disorders, except with patients that have a possibility of being epileptic. Temporal lobe epilepsy affects the hippocampus. Patients that have this medical diagnosis are said to have a misfiring of the brain&#x27;s neurons. The neurons transmit at random which results in the false sense of experiencing a familiar situation that had previously been experienced. Different types of &quot;déjà vu&quot; are difficult to pinpoint because researchers who have studied &quot;déjà vu&quot; have developed their own categories and differentiations. On a broad perspective of research that is available, &quot;déjà vu&quot; can be divided into two categories: associative &quot;déjà vu&quot; and biological déjà vu. Associative &quot;déjà vu&quot; is typically experienced by normal, healthy individuals who experience things with the senses that can be associated to other experiences or past events. Biological &quot;déjà vu&quot; occurs in individuals who have temporal lobe epilepsy. Their experience of &quot;déjà vu&quot; occurs usually just before they experience a seizure. Recent research is looking at the new occurrence of chronic &quot;déjà vu&quot;. Chronic &quot;déjà vu&quot; is when an individual is experiencing a constant state of &quot;déjà vu&quot;. Failure of the temporal lobe is thought to be the cause of this phenomenon because the circuits that connect to memories get stuck in an active state, and create memories that never happened.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Legacy ==

Penfield was designated a National Historic Person in 1988 by the government of Canada. As such, a federal historical marker from the national Historic Sites &amp; Monuments Board and Parks Canada was erected, located at a building that bears his name on University Street, part of the McGill University campus in Montreal.

A postage stamp honouring Penfield was issued by Canada Post on March 15, 1991.

&quot;Avenue du Docteur-Penfield&quot; (), on the slope of Mount Royal in Montreal, was named in Penfield&#x27;s honour on October 5, 1978. Part of this avenue borders McGill University&#x27;s campus and intersects with Promenade Sir-William-Oslermeaning medical historians and the like may amuse themselves by arranging to &quot;meet at Osler and Penfield&quot;. 

A portrait of Wilder Penfield hangs in Rhodes House at the University of Oxford, England.
Penfield was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) of the United Kingdom in 1943.

In honour of Wilder Graves Penfield&#x27;s contribution to the public sector in Montreal, notably alongside his interest in further developing education, Wilder Penfield Elementary School was also established as part of the Lester B. Pearson School Board.

Penfield building, one of John Abbott College&#x27;s ten buildings, also bears the name of the famous neurosurgeon.

Penfield was the subject of a Google doodle on January 26, 2018, marking the 127th anniversary of his birth. The doodle appeared on the Google homepage in selected countries on five continents.

Penfield Children&#x27;s Center In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is named for Dr. Penfield for his advocacy of early intervention for children with developmental delays and disabilities.

<text>Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company, LLC (CMC, formerly Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company) is an American firearms manufacturer, founded in 1855 by Samuel Colt that has become a subsidiary of Czech holding company Colt CZ Group. It is the successor corporation to Colt&#x27;s earlier firearms-making efforts, which started in 1836. Colt is known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms, especially during the century from 1850 through World War I, when it dominated its industry and was a seminal influence on manufacturing technology. Colt&#x27;s earliest designs played a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from single-shot pistols. Although Samuel Colt did not invent the revolver, his designs resulted in the first very successful model.

The most famous Colt products include the Colt Walker, made in 1847 in the facilities of Eli Whitney Jr., the Colt Single Action Army, the Colt Python, and the Colt M1911 pistol, which is the longest-standing military and law enforcement service handgun in the world and is still used. Though they did not develop it, for a long time Colt was also primarily responsible for all AR-15 and M16 rifle production, as well as many derivatives of those firearms. The most successful and famous of these are numerous M16 carbines, including the Colt Commando family, and the M4 carbine.

In 2002, Colt Defense was split off from Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company. Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company served the civilian market, while Colt Defense served the law enforcement, military, and private security markets worldwide. The two companies remained in the same West Hartford, Connecticut location cross-licensing certain merchandise before reuniting in 2013. Following the loss of its M4 contract in 2013, the reunited Colt was briefly in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, starting in 2015 and emerging in January 2016. The company was bought by Česká zbrojovka Group in 2021. In April 2022, Česká zbrojovka Group announced it had changed its name to Colt CZ Group.

==History==

===19th century===

====1830s–1850s====

Samuel Colt received a British patent on his improved design for a revolver in 1835, and two U.S. patents in 1836, one on February 25 (later numbered U.S. Patent 9430X) and another on August 29 (). That same year, he founded his first corporation for its manufacture, the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey, Colt&#x27;s Patent. The first firearm manufactured at the new Paterson plant, however, was the Colt First Model Ring Lever rifle beginning in 1837. This was followed shortly thereafter in late 1837 by the introduction of the Colt Paterson. This corporation suffered quality problems in production. Making firearms with interchangeable parts was still rather new (it had reached commercial viability only about a decade before), and it was not yet easy to replicate across different factories. Interchangeability was not complete in the Paterson works, and traditional gunsmithing techniques did not fill the gap entirely there. The Colt Paterson revolver found patchy success and failure; some worked well, while others had problems. The United States Marine Corps and United States Army reported quality problems with these earliest Colt revolvers. Production had ended at the New Jersey corporation by 1842.

Colt made another attempt at revolver production in 1846 and submitted a prototype to the US government. During the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), this prototype was seen by Captain Samuel Hamilton Walker who made some suggestions to Colt about making it in a larger caliber. Having no factory or machinery to produce the pistols, Samuel Colt collaborated with the Whitney armory of Whitneyville, Connecticut. This armory was run by the family of Eli Whitney. Eli Whitney Jr (born 1820), the son of the cotton-gin-developer patriarch, was the head of the family armory and a successful arms maker and innovator of the era. Colt used a combination of renting the Whitney firm&#x27;s facilities and subcontracting parts to the firm to continue his pursuit of revolver manufacture.

Colt&#x27;s new revolvers found favor with Texan volunteers (the progenitors of later Texas Rangers cavalry groups), and they placed an order for 1,000 revolvers that became known as the Colt Walker, ensuring Colt&#x27;s continuance in manufacturing revolvers. In 1848, Colt was able to start again with a new business of his own, and 1855, he converted it into a corporation under the name of Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut.
Colt purchased a large tract of land beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, a club where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.

In an attempt to attract skilled German workers to his plant, Colt built a village near the factory away from the tenements which he named Coltsville and modeled the homes after a village near Potsdam. In an effort to stem the flooding from the river he planted German osiers, a type of willow tree in a 2-mile long dike. He subsequently built a factory to manufacture wicker furniture made from these trees.

The 1850s were a decade of phenomenal success for the new Colt corporation. Colt was the first to widely commercialize the total use of interchangeable parts throughout a product. It was a leader in assembly line practice. It was a major innovator and training ground in manufacturing technology in this decade (and several after). Soon after establishing his Hartford factory, Colt set out to establish a factory in Europe and chose London, England. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain&#x27;s Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world&#x27;s leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Telford Gold Medal.

Colt&#x27;s presence in the British market caused years of acrimony and lawsuits among British arms makers, who doubted the validity of Colt&#x27;s British patent and the desirability of the American system of manufacturing. It took many more years and a UK government commission before the point became universally accepted that such manufacture was possible and economical. Colt opened his London plant on the River Thames at Pimlico and began production on January 1, 1853. Many English people saw Colt&#x27;s advanced steam-powered machinery as proof of America&#x27;s growing position as a leader in modern industrial production. On a tour of the factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt&#x27;s revolvers in an 1854 edition of &quot;Household Words&quot;. Most significant, the Colt factory&#x27;s machines mass-produced interchangeable parts that could be easily and cheaply put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England&#x27;s top gunmakers.

In 1854 the British Admiralty ordered 4,000 Navy Model Colt revolvers. In 1855 the British Army placed an order for 5,000 of these revolvers for army issue. Despite a following order later in the year for an additional 9,000 revolvers, Colt failed to convince the British to adopt his revolver as the issue sidearm for the army. Colt began to realize that British sales were failing to meet his expectations. Unable to justify the London factory&#x27;s expenses, Colt closed the London factory in 1856. Over the next few months his workmen crated and shipped the machinery and disassembled firearms back to America.

Though the U.S. was not directly involved in the Crimean War (1854–1856), Colt&#x27;s weapons were used by both sides. In 1855 Colt unveiled new state-of-the-art armories in the Hartford and London factories stocked with the latest machine tools (some of which were of Colt&#x27;s devising), many built by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney, who would found the original Pratt &amp; Whitney tool building firm a few years later. For example, the Lincoln miller debuted to industry at these armories.

Colt had set up libraries and educational programs within the plants for his employees. Colt&#x27;s armories in Hartford were seminal training grounds for several generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century. Prominent examples included F. Pratt and A. Whitney (as mentioned above); Henry Leland (who would end up at Cadillac and Lincoln); Edward Bullard Sr of the Bullard firm; and, through Pratt &amp; Whitney, Worcester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey (of Warner &amp; Swasey).

In 1852 an employee of Colt&#x27;s, Rollin White, came up with the idea of having the revolver cylinder bored through to accept metallic cartridges. He took this idea to Colt who flatly rejected it and ended up firing White within a few years. Colt historian RL Wilson has described this as the major blunder of Sam Colt&#x27;s professional life. Rollin White left Colt&#x27;s in December 1854 and registered a patent on April 3, 1855, in Hartford, Connecticut, as patent number 12,648: &quot;Improvement in Repeating Fire-arms&quot;. On November 17, 1856, White signed an agreement with Smith &amp; Wesson for the exclusive use of his patent. The contract stipulated that White would be paid 25 cents for every revolver, but that it was up to him to defend his patent against infringement as opposed to Smith &amp; Wesson.

During the 1850s and 1860s, Rollin White had been permanently trying to keep control on his breech-loading system patent, bringing a lawsuit to any breech-loaded manufactured gun. He nevertheless obtained an advance against royalties for using his patent from Smith &amp; Wesson, a company that not only introduced its first revolver in 1857 (Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1, a rear-loader) but also started, as of 1858, to convert cap &amp; ball percussion guns into rear-loaders, even with formerly Colt manufactured revolvers. But the Colt&#x27;s company itself was prevented by American laws from infringing the Rollin White patent and all along the 1850s and 1860s continued manufacturing percussion guns. In 1860 it produced a new revolver model for the United States Army. This Colt Army Model 1860 appeared just in time for the American Civil War.

====1860–1865: American Civil War====

The New York Daily Tribune denounced Colt and his company by asserting, “the traitors have found sympathizers among us, men base enough to sell arms when they knew they would be... in the hands of the deadly enemies of the Union... Col. Colt’s manufactory can turn probably 1,000 a week and has been doing so for the past four months for the South.” This article even chided the Federal Government for not taking action against Colt: “Every man who makes arms should be watched, and if he will not work for a fair equivalent for the Government, his manufactory should be taken away from him.” Despite secession and growing tensions between the North and the South, “Colt’s sales to Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, and Mississippi in 1860 alone were at least $61,000 (today’s equivalent of about 3.35 million).” Until just days before the first shot at Fort Sumter, Colt received orders from various states, some participating in secession. In his memoir on Colt, written in 1866, Henry Barnard reported, “before the rebellion broke out, Col. Colt, foreseeing that his weapons must ere long be in double demand, had made all preparations to extend his factory.”

The American Civil War was a boon to firearms manufacturers such as Colt&#x27;s, and the company thrived during the conflict. Sam Colt had carefully developed contacts within the ordnance department, signing the very first government contract for 25,000 rifles. Colt&#x27;s Factory was described as &quot;an industrial palace topped by a blue dome&quot;, powered by a 250-horsepower steam engine. During the American Civil War, Colt had 1,500 employees who produced 150,000 muskets and pistols a year. In 1861 and 1863, the company sold 107,000 of the Colt Army Model 1860 alone, with production reaching 200,500 by the end of the war in 1865.

During the war, Colt&#x27;s was still prevented by the American laws from infringing Rollin White&#x27;s patent. Nevertheless, the war made a huge fortune for the company, allowing Sam Colt to become America&#x27;s first manufacturing tycoon, though he did not live to see the end of the war; he died of rheumatic fever on January 10, 1862. His close friend and firearms engineer, Elisha K. Root, took over as Colt&#x27;s company president. On February 4, 1864, a fire destroyed most of the factory, including arms, machinery, plans, and factory records. On September 1, 1865, Root died, leaving the company in the hands of Samuel Colt&#x27;s brother-in-law, Richard Jarvis. The company&#x27;s vice-president was William B. Franklin, who had recently left the Army at the end of the Civil War. With the Civil War over and having no new military contracts, Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing was forced to lay off over 800 employees.

The company found itself in a precarious situation. The original revolver patents had expired, allowing other companies to produce copies of his designs. Additionally, metallic cartridge revolvers were gaining in popularity, but Colt could not produce any because of the Rollin White patent held by rival Smith &amp; Wesson. Likewise, Colt had been so protective of its own patents that other companies had been unable to make revolvers similar to their design. As the Rollin White patent neared expiration, Colt moved to develop its own metallic cartridge revolver.

====1865–1880s: Post–Civil War====
It was 1868 when Colt&#x27;s first effort toward a metallic cartridge revolver was by conversion of existing percussion revolvers. The first of these conversions was patented on September 15, 1868, by Colt engineer, F. Alexander Thuer as patent number 82258. The Thuer conversion was made by milling off the rear of the receiver and replacing it with a breechplate containing six internal firing pins. The cartridges were loaded through the mouths of the chambers. Colt made 5000 of these but they were not well accepted. Colt found the mechanism so complex it included a spare percussion cylinder with each revolver.

Colt tasked its superintendent of engineering, Charles Richards, to come up with a solution. The Richards conversion was performed on the Colt 1860 Army revolver. The caliber was .44 Colt and the loading lever was replaced by an ejector rod. This conversion added a breech plate with a firing pin and a rear sight mounted on the breechplate. Cartridges were loaded into the cylinder one at a time via a loading gate. Colt manufactured 9000 of these revolvers between 1873 and 1878. In 1873, Colt performed the same conversion on the M1851 and M1861 revolvers for the US Navy in .38 rimfire. Another of Colt&#x27;s engineers, William Mason, improved this conversion by placing the rear sight on the hammer and, along with Richards, he was granted patents in 1871 to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic-cartridge revolvers. Those converted revolvers are identified as the &quot;Richards-Mason conversion&quot;. There were approximately 2100 Richards-Mason M1860 Army conversions made from 1877 to 1878 in a serial-number range 5800 to 7900.

In November 1865, Franklin had attempted to purchase a license to the Rollin White patent from competitor Smith &amp; Wesson. White and Smith &amp; Wesson would take no less than $1.1 million, but Franklin and Colt&#x27;s directors decided it was too large an investment on a patent that would expire in 1868. In the meantime, Colt turned its attention to manufacturing goods other than firearms, such as watches, sewing machines, typewriters and bicycles. In 1868 Rollin White requested an extension to his patent, but the request was rejected. He then turned to the Congress, but the request was again rejected, this time by the Senate and on the initiative of President Ulysses Grant, in January 1870. This led the patent to expire, allowing competitors to develop their own breech-loading guns and metallic cartridges. Following this, on that same year of 1870, Colt&#x27;s bought the National Arms Company, a Brooklyn, New York company known for manufacturing derringers and for circumventing the Rollin White patent by utilizing a unique cartridge. Colt continued to produce the .41 Short derringer after the acquisition, as an effort to help break into the metallic-cartridge gun market, but also introduced its own three Colt Derringer Models, all of them also chambered in a .41 rimfire unique cartridge. The last model to be in production, the third Colt Derringer, was not dropped until 1912. The first metallic cartridge breech-loading weapons sold by Colt&#x27;s were those Derringers, in 1870, that were formerly conceived by the National Arms Company, but Colt&#x27;s also started developing its own rear-loading guns and cartridges.

In 1871, Colt&#x27;s introduced its first revolver models using rear-loaded metallic cartridges: the .41 caliber Colt House Revolver (also known as the Cloverleaf for its four-round cylinder configuration) and the .22 cal Colt Open Top Pocket Model Revolver. However, Colt&#x27;s wanted a more powerful practical handgun loaded with metallic cartridges so the company put forward William Mason, who in 1871 began work on Colt&#x27;s first .44 caliber metallic-cartridge revolver: the Colt Model 1871-72 Open Top. The company registered two patents for the Open Top, one in 1871, the other in 1872, the same patents mentioned in the markings of Colt Single Action Army revolvers, a nowadays legendary and long produced model, improved and based on the Open Top. Production of the Open Top started in 1872 and stopped in 1873 when the Single Action Army model started to be delivered to the US Army. However, the Open Top was already a completely new design. The parts, for example, would not interchange with the older percussion pistols. Mason moved the rear sight to the rear of the barrel as opposed to the hammer or the breechblock of the earlier efforts. The caliber was .44 rimfire and it was submitted to the US Army for testing in 1872. The Army rejected the pistol and asked for a more powerful caliber with a stronger frame. Mason redesigned the frame to incorporate a topstrap, similar to the Remington revolvers, and placed the rear sight on the rear of the frame; he consulted with Richards on some other improvements. The first prototype of the new gun was still chambered in .44 rimfire, but the first model was in the newest caliber known as the .45 Colt. 
The revolver was chosen by the Army in 1872, with the first order, for 8000 revolvers, shipping in the summer of 1873: The Colt Single Action Army or &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, also known as the Colt Model 1873, was born. This revolver was one of the most prevalent firearms in the American West during the end of the 19th century and Colt still produces it, in six different calibers, two finishes and three barrel lengths.
In the new market of metallic cartridge rear-loading pocket revolvers, Colt&#x27;s not only introduced its three Derringer Models (as of 1870) or the Colt House and the Open Top Pocket (the last two as of 1871) but also introduced in 1873 a subsequent design called its &quot;New Line&quot; revolver models, based on William Mason&#x27;s patents.

After the success of the Colt Single Action Army and Colt&#x27;s conversion of existing percussion revolvers to Richards-Mason conversions, Mason went on to design Colt&#x27;s first Double-action revolver, the Colt M1877. Following this, he once again teamed up with Richards to produce a larger-framed version, the Colt M1878 Frontier. It was Colt&#x27;s first large-frame, double-action revolver. It combined the front end of the Single Action Army revolver with a double-action, 6-shot frame mechanism. It was available commercially in numerous calibers.

The 1870s and 1880s provided sales opportunity to the Colt company via the spread of European-American society ever further westward across the continent, and the demand for firearms that it engendered in various ways. As white Americans displaced Indians from the Indian Territory, both sides were eager for firearms. On the white side, both the U.S. Army and civilians were customers of Colt. The Army carried Colt revolvers through the last of its Indian Wars. On the Indian side, Colt weapons were captured when possible, or bought from whoever was selling. Even among whites in towns where Indians had been vanquished, a thriving demand for guns existed, from the criminals to the police to self-defending civilians. Memoirs of Americans including Walter Chrysler and Jack Black speak of what it was like growing up in Western towns where most people had guns and open carry was common (such as in Kansas and Missouri, which were considered &quot;out West&quot; at the time—now considered the Old West).

====1890s====
Colt finally left the &quot;loading gate concept&quot; for a swing-out cylinder on its revolvers with the Colt M1889 Navy revolver, which resembled the Colt M1878 and was based on another design by Mason. The model was produced for three years between 1889 and 1892 and eclipsed by the Colt M1892 chambered in .38 Long Colt. The M1892 was replaced by the New Service Double Action revolver in 1899. In caliber .45 Colt, the New Service was accepted by the U.S. Military as the Model 1909 .45 revolver. The New Service revolver was available in other calibers such as .38 Special and, later in the 20th century, .45 ACP (as the M1917 revolver) and .357 Magnum.

Under a contract with the U.S. Army, Colt Arms built the Model 1895 ten-barrel variant of the Gatling Gun, capable of firing 800–900 .30 Army rounds per minute and used with great effect at the Battle of San Juan Hill. The M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun or &quot;Potato Digger&quot; was built by Colt. The Colt–Browning was one of the first gas-operated machine guns, originally invented by John Browning. It became the first automatic machine gun adopted by the United States and saw limited use by the U.S. Marine Corps at the invasion of Guantánamo Bay and by the 1st Volunteer Infantry in the Santiago campaign during the Spanish–American War. In 1901, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt sold the company to a group of outside investors based in New York and Boston.

===20th century===

====1900–1920s====
During World War I, Colt surpassed all previous production achievements. John Browning worked for Colt for a time and came up with a design for a semiautomatic pistol, which debuted as the Colt M1900 pistol and eventually evolved into the M1911. Prior to America&#x27;s entry into the war, orders from Canada and the United Kingdom swelled the backlog of orders to three years. Colt hired 4,000 more workers, making a total of 10,000 employees—and its stock&#x27;s price increased by 400%. By 1918, Colt had produced and sold 425,500 of the famous Browning-designed M1911. Because the factory could not keep up with demand for this pistol, the US Military decided to accept Colt New Service revolvers in caliber .45 ACP, called the M1917 revolver, as a substitute weapon. Competing manufacturer Smith &amp; Wesson made double-action revolvers in .45 ACP, which were accepted and issued by the U.S. military under the same name. Colt produced 151,700 revolvers during the war as well as 13,000 Maxim-Vickers machine guns and 10,000 Browning machine guns with an additional 100,000 under subcontract to other companies.

Since Auto-Ordnance had no tooling for production of the newly developed Thompson submachine gun, John T. Thompson, in August 1920, entered into contract with Colt&#x27;s to manufacture 15,000 Thompson 1921 submachine guns. The contract was signed on August 18, 1920. Colt&#x27;s tooled up and produced the 15,000 units between April 1921 and March 1922.

The stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression resulted in a slowing down of production for Colt. In anticipation of this, company presidents William C. Skinner and Samuel M. Stone implemented a diversification program similar to that done at the close of the American Civil War. Colt acquired contracts for business machines, calculators, dishwashers, motorcycles, and automobiles; all marketed under a name other than Colt. Samuel Stone acquired a firm that manufactured plastics and renamed it &quot;Colt rock&quot; as well as a company that manufactured electrical products. Colt weathered the financial crises of the time by cutting the work week, reducing salaries, and keeping more employees on the payroll than they needed. These measures kept the company in business but ate up the cash surplus they had acquired during the World War I years.

====1930s: Great Depression====
In 1935, after employees voted to disband a labor union, 1,000 workers went on strike for 13 weeks. Strikers became violent, attacking workers and detonating a bomb in front of company president Samuel M. Stone&#x27;s house. The company set up a barracks, dining room, and recreation room for workers within the Colt Armory during the strike. On June 3, 1935, the National Recovery Administration ruled that the company was within its rights not to deal with the union and the strike ended. In the year following the strike, the factory was hit by a hurricane and flood. Many company shipping records and historical documents were lost as a result.

====1939–1945: World War II====

At the beginning of World War II, Colt ceased production of the Single Action Army revolver to devote more time to filling orders for the war. During the war Colt manufactured over 629,000 M1911A1 pistols as well as a large number of M1917 water-cooled machineguns. The company had a workforce of 15,000 men and women in three factories and production ran on three shifts, 24 hours a day, and won the Army-Navy rating of &quot;E&quot; for excellence. Colt ranked 99th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. However, the company was losing money every year due to mismanagement, an embittered workforce that had been stretched to its limits, and manufacturing methods which were becoming obsolete.

====1945–1950s====
As the war ended and demand for military arms came to a halt, production literally ceased. Many long-time workers and engineers retired from the company and nothing was built from 1945 to 1947. Mismanagement of funds during the war had a serious impact as the 105-year-old firm faced possible bankruptcy. In September 1955 the board of directors voted to merge Colt with an upstart conglomerate called Penn-Texas, which had acquired Pratt &amp; Whitney Machine Tool the same year. Also in 1955, Colt released one of the most famous revolvers in history, the Colt Python. In 1958 Penn-Texas merged with Fairbanks-Morse to form the Fairbanks-Whitney Corporation and in 1964 the conglomerate reorganized as Colt Industries. In 1956 Colt resumed production of the Single Action Army revolver and in 1961 began making commemorative versions of their classic models.

====1960s–1970s====

The 1960s were boom years for Colt with the escalation of the Vietnam War, Robert McNamara shutting down the Springfield Armory, and the U.S. Army&#x27;s subsequent adoption of the M16, for which Colt held the production rights and would sell over 5 million units worldwide. Colt would capitalize on this with a range of AR-15 derivative carbines. They developed AR-15-based Squad Automatic Weapons, and the Colt SCAMP, an early PDW design. The Colt XM148 grenade launcher was created by Colt&#x27;s design project engineer, gun designer Karl R. Lewis. The May 1967 &quot;Colt&#x27;s Ink&quot; newsletter announced that he had won a national competition for his selection and treatment of materials in the design. The newsletter stated in part &quot;In only 47 days, he wrote the specifications, designed the launcher, drew all the original prints, and had a working model built&quot;. At the end of the 1970s, there was a program run by the Air Force to replace the M1911A1. The Beretta 92S won, but this was contested by the Army. The Army ran their own trials, leading eventually to the Beretta 92F being selected as the M9.

In the early 1960s, Colt threatened legal action against Major League Baseball&#x27;s new Houston franchise, the Colt .45s, citing trademark infringement. In December 1964 the team backed down, renaming itself the Astros.

====1980s–1990s====

The 1980s were fairly good years for Colt, but the coming end of the Cold War would change all that. Colt had long left innovation in civilian firearms to their competitors, feeling that the handgun business could survive on their traditional revolver and M1911 designs. Instead, Colt focused on the military market, where they held the primary contracts for the production of rifles for the US military. This strategy dramatically failed for Colt through a series of events in the 1980s. In 1984, the U.S. military standardized on the Beretta 92F. This was not much of a loss for Colt&#x27;s current business, as M1911A1 production had stopped in 1945. Meanwhile, the military rifle business was growing because the U.S. military had a major demand for more upgraded M16s; the M16A2 model had just been adopted and the military needed hundreds of thousands of them.

In 1985, Colt&#x27;s workers, members of the United Auto Workers went on strike for higher wages. This strike would ultimately last for five years and was one of the longest-running labor strikes in American history. With replacement workers running production, the quality of Colt&#x27;s firearms began to decline. Dissatisfied with Colt&#x27;s production, in 1988 the U.S. military awarded the contract for future M16 production to Fabrique Nationale. The strike finally ended when an agreement was reached on 22 March 1990.

Some criticized Colt&#x27;s range of handgun products in the late 1980s as out of touch with the demands of the market, and their once-vaunted reputation for quality had suffered during the UAW strike. Colt&#x27;s stable of double-action revolvers and single-action pistols was seen as old-fashioned by a marketplace that was captivated by the new generation of &quot;wondernines&quot; – higher capacity handguns chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, as typified by the Glock 17. Realizing that the future of the company was at stake, labor and management agreed to end the strike in an arrangement that resulted in Colt being sold to a group of private investors, the State of Connecticut, and the UAW itself.

The new Colt first attempted to address some of the demands of the market with the production in 1989 of the &quot;Double Eagle&quot;, a double-action pistol heavily based on the M1911 design, which was seen as an attempt to &quot;modernize&quot; the classic Browning design. Colt followed this up in 1992 with the &quot;Colt All American 2000&quot;, which was unlike any other handgun Colt had produced before—being a polymer-framed, rotating-barrel, 9×19mm handgun with a magazine capacity of 15 rounds. It was designed by Reed Knight, with parts manufactured by outside vendors and assembled by Colt; its execution was disastrous. Early models were plagued with inaccuracy and unreliability and suffered from the poor publicity of a product recall. The product launch failed and production of the All American 2000 ended in 1994. This series of events led to the company&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992.

In 1992, the creditors, state and shareholders enlisted the aid of turnaround specialist RC (Ron) Whitaker to overcome the bankruptcy challenge. He developed a new team to address the company&#x27;s situation. In addition to creating a positive working relationship with the UAW to introduce new techniques like cellular manufacturing, operator quality assurance and single-piece flow, they developed a renewed focus on product development. This resulted in the M4 carbine and Colt 22 pistol, two of the most successful new product offerings in the late 1990s, capturing 50% market shares in the first year of production.
The 1990s brought the end of Cold War, which resulted in a large downturn for the entire defense industry. Colt was hit by this downturn, though it would be made worse later in the 1990s by a boycott by the shooting public in America. In 1994, the assets of Colt were purchased by Zilkha &amp; Co, a financial group owned by Donald Zilkha. It was speculated that Zilkha&#x27;s financial backing of the company enabled Colt to begin winning back military contracts. In fact, during the time period it won only one contract, the M4 carbine. However, the U.S. military had been purchasing Colt carbines for the past 30 years (See Colt Commando). During a 1998 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interview, CEO Ron Stewart stated that he would favor a federal permit system with training and testing for gun ownership. This led to massive grassroots boycotts of Colt&#x27;s products by gun stores and US gun owners.

Zilkha replaced Stewart with Steven Sliwa and focused the remainder of Colt&#x27;s handgun design efforts into &quot;smart guns,&quot; a concept favored politically, but that had little interest or support among handgun owners or police departments. This research never produced any meaningful results due to the limited technology at the time. Colt announced the termination of its production of double-action revolvers in October 1999.

===21st century===

====2002–present====

The boycott of Colt gradually faded out after William M. Keys, a retired U.S. Marine Lt. General, took the helm of the company in 2002. Keys salvaged Colt&#x27;s reputation and brought Colt from the brink of bankruptcy to an international leader in Defense production. In 2010 Gerald R. Dinkel replaced Keys as CEO of Colt Defense LLC, while Keys remained on the board of directors for Colt Defense.

Colt has to compete with other companies that make M1911-style pistols such as Kimber and AR-15 rifles such as Bushmaster. Bushmaster has subsequently overtaken Colt in the number of AR-15s sold on the civilian market. Colt suffered a legal defeat in court when it sued Bushmaster for trademark infringement claiming that &quot;M4&quot; was a trademark that it owned. The judge ruled that since the term M4 is a generic designation that Colt does not specifically own, Colt had to pay monetary reimbursement to Bushmaster to recoup Bushmaster&#x27;s legal fees. The M4 designation itself comes from the U.S. military designation system, whose terms are in the public domain.
Colt has entered in several US contracts with mixed results. For example, Colt had an entry in the Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program of the 1980s, but along with other contestants failed to replace the M16A2. Colt and many other makers entered the US trials for a new pistol in the 1980s, though the Beretta entry would win and become the M9 Pistol. The Colt OHWS handgun was beaten by H&amp;K for what became the MK23 SOCOM, it was lighter than the H&amp;K entry but lost in performance. Colt did not get to compete for the XM8 since it was not an open competition. Current M16 rifles have been made primarily by FN USA since 1988. However, Colt remained the sole source for M4 carbines for the US military. Under their license agreement with Colt, the US military could not legally award second-source production contracts for the M4 until July 1, 2009. In 2007 Colt won a contract to produce M4 carbines for the US military worth $71 million. In 2008 this was followed by a $151 million order for 89,000 M4 carbine rifles.
In a 2002 restructuring, Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company, Inc, spun off Colt Defense, LLC, to supply military, law enforcement and security markets. Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company itself become a subsidiary of New Colt Holding Corp, LLC. In 2013 Colt Defense acquired New Colt Holding Corp., in part to protect a licensing agreement set to expire in 2014, where Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing sold sporting rifles marketed to consumers that were manufactured by Colt Defense. This formed a single company to develop, manufacture and sell firearms under the Colt name for all markets for the first time since the 2003 completion of the restructuring.

In 2013, Dennis R. Veilleux assumed the role of president &amp; chief executive officer for Colt Holding Co. LLC and president &amp; chief executive officer of Colt Defense LLC. Mr. Veilleux previously occupied the position of Principal at Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., Inc., Principal at General Electric Co., president &amp; chief executive officer at Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Co. LLC and president &amp; chief executive officer at New Colt Holding Corp.

Following persistent reliability problems, the reunited Colt lost its contract with the US military for M4 rifles in 2013. Parent company Colt Defense, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 15, 2015, citing both assets and debts in the $100 million to $500 million range. According to analysts, Colt&#x27;s problems were due to the loss of the contract and low demand for its civilian handguns. In January 2016, Colt announced that the bankruptcy court had approved its restructuring plan.

After restructuring, a reinvigorated Colt introduced several new versions of its 1911 pistols, including stainless-steel competition and target models. In 2017, Colt returned to the production of double-action revolvers with the .38 Colt Cobra, followed in 2019 by an improved version of the 1999 .357 &quot;Magnum Carry&quot;, the King Cobra. In 2020, Colt reintroduced a modernized Colt Python in stainless steel, followed by the reintroduction of 6- and 8-inch stainless steel versions of the Colt Anaconda in 2021- and a 4.25-inch Anaconda in 2023.

In 2021, Colt was purchased by the Česká zbrojovka Group (CZG), which would rename itself Colt CZ Group in 2022. Lubomír Kovařík, the chairman of the CZG, stated that the acquisition would allow for co-operative research and development between the two companies, and specified that Colt products would continue to be manufactured in the United States.

<text>Possessed is an American death metal band, originally formed in 1982 in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Noted for their fast style of playing and Jeff Becerra&#x27;s growled vocals, they are often called the first band in the death metal genre, and paved the way for the 1980s Bay Area thrash metal scene, along with Metallica, Exodus, Testament and Death Angel. The band is also notable for featuring future Primus member Larry LaLonde, who was the guitarist for Possessed from 1984 to 1987.

After breaking up in 1987, and reforming from 1990 to 1993, the band reformed again under original bassist and vocalist Jeff Becerra in 2007. Possessed has released three studio albums − &quot;Seven Churches&quot; (1985), &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot; (1986) and &quot;Revelations of Oblivion&quot; (2019) − as well as one live album, two compilation albums and two EPs.

==History==
===Formation (1982–1983)===
The band originated in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1982, when San Pablo and El Sobrante residents Mike Torrao (guitar) and Mike Sus (drums) started a garage band with vocalist Barry Fisk and former Exodus bassist Jeff Andrews under the name Possessed. While the quartet had begun writing some music together, the line-up would be cut short when Fisk committed suicide by gunshot in front of his girlfriend&#x27;s house in Tara Hills, California, and Andrews subsequently opted not to participate in the group any longer.

Meanwhile, bassist and vocalist Jeff Becerra had recently split with his band Blizzard in the neighboring city of Pinole. That band included Larry LaLonde and Danny Boland on guitars and Michael Miner on drums, all of whom were high school students in the same graduating class. After being approached by Torrao and Sus, Becerra joined Possessed filling both the vacant vocal and bassist positions. The band had placed an advertisement for a new guitarist, which was responded to by Brian Montana leading to the second incarnation of Possessed.

===Initial career (1983–1987)===
Possessed spent 1983 and 1984 practicing and working on their sound by performing at local venues and becoming an active part of the Bay Area thrash scene. They recorded the 3-song demo &quot;Death Metal&quot; in 1984. After concerts with Metallica and Exodus, the latter group brought the band&#x27;s demo recording to the attention of Brian Slagel, head of Metal Blade Records. Slagel showed interest in the band and offered to put their song &quot;Swing of the Axe&quot; on the upcoming compilation &quot;Metal Massacre VI&quot;. Following the release of the compilation, guitarist Brian Montana left the band due to creative differences and was replaced by Blizzard guitarist Larry Lalonde. The band then hired Mechanics Bank heiress Debbie Abono (&quot;nee&quot; Downer), mother of LaLonde&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Julie, to manage the band.

The compilation drew the attention of Combat Records who signed the band and released their debut album &quot;Seven Churches&quot; in 1985, with Roadrunner Records handling European distribution. 
In November of the same year, the band flew to Montreal, Quebec, Canada for the WWIII Weekend Festival in support of the Seven Churches release, playing alongside Celtic Frost, Destruction, Voivod and Nasty Savage. The concert was Possessed&#x27;s first and largest arena appearance, with nearly 7,000 in attendance. Possessed followed the release with a supporting tour which included a performance with Slayer and Venom at San Francisco&#x27;s Kabuki in 1986.

On Halloween 1986, Possessed released their second album &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;. They embarked on a short European tour with Voivod and in the U.S. opening for Dark Angel. In May 1987, the band issued a five-song EP produced by guitarist Joe Satriani titled &quot;The Eyes of Horror&quot; which marked a change in musical direction for the band. The Satanic themes they had become noted for were almost completely absent, and the songs had more of a thrash metal style than their earlier death metal sound. The song &quot;Storm in My Mind&quot; was written by Lalonde and the rest by Torrao, who had written most of the band&#x27;s earlier material. Soon after the release, internal tensions among the band members led to their break up.

In 1989, Jeff Becerra was held up at gunpoint by two assailants and was shot twice, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. Despite this, he continued to play a role in the death, black, and thrash metal scenes, and received a degree in labor studies and plans to attend law school.

===Reformations (1990–present)===
Mike Torrao formed a new version of Possessed in 1990, taking over lead vocals himself, and recorded a two-song demo in 1991. Several different line-ups were attempted, and a four-song demo was recorded in 1993, but the group failed to gain momentum and disbanded shortly thereafter.

In 2007, it was announced vocalist and bassist Jeff Becerra would be performing under the Possessed name at the Wacken Open Air festival and would be backed by the members of Sadistic Intent, one of the bands featured on the Possessed tribute album &quot;Seven Gates of Horror&quot; released in 2004. They would also headline the Gathering of the Bestial Legions III festival in Los Angeles. This same lineup also performed at Maryland Deathfest VIII in May 2010. After a U.S. tour with Danzig and Marduk, Rick and Bay Cortez along with Ernesto Bueno returned to Sadistic Intent, while drummer Emilio Marquez remained.

By late 2012, Possessed had begun writing new material for their first full-length studio album since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;. They had performed several new songs live which were expected to appear on the new album.

In 2017, the band signed a three-album recording contract with Nuclear Blast Records. By this time, the band consisted of Becerra and Marquez along with guitarists Daniel Gonzalez and Claudeous Creamer and bassist Robert Cardenas. Initially set for release in 2018, the band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Revelations of Oblivion&quot; was released on May 10, 2019, their first in 33 years. The album entered the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles and Albums Charts at #7 in its first week.

In a February 2021 interview, Becerra stated that he would begin writing new material for the next Possessed album after the conclusion of the &quot;Revelations of Oblivion&quot; tour. Becerra said in December 2023 that the band would record their new album in 2024.

==Influences==
At least four Possessed members who had written and recorded with the band at some point (vocalist/bassist Becerra and former guitarists Torrao, Montana and LaLonde) cite early Exodus and Venom as their main influences, in addition to NWOBHM acts like Motörhead, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, and other bands such as Rush, Scorpions and Van Halen. Although AllMusic attributed Slayer as being a musical influence for &quot;Seven Churches&quot;, the first Slayer album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; had not been released until December 1983, shortly after members of Possessed were already writing material for their demo and debut album. Lyrically, most of Possessed&#x27;s songs focused on Satanism and death.

==Legacy==

Possessed are often cited as the first death metal band, largely because of the early use of grunted vocals, ultra-fast drumming and guitar tremolo picking as previously noted. In the 2004 book, &quot;Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore&quot;, Jeff Becerra staked claim to creating the &quot;death metal&quot; nomenclature in 1983. The band&#x27;s efforts on &quot;Seven Churches&quot; have been called an influence by groups like Death, Pestilence, Sepultura, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Sadistic Intent, Cannibal Corpse, Gorguts, Sinister, Vader, God Dethroned and Amon Amarth, the latter five bands having appeared on a 2004 Possessed tribute album. Possessed&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot; had been covered earlier by Cannibal Corpse on the 1993 &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot; EP.

Even while the band had played only a handful of gigs in the Bay Area, they earned a huge capital of popularity in Europe&#x27;s metal scene. Members of Napalm Death were influenced by Possessed and credit the band for their musical shift from grindcore to a more death metal direction after &quot;Scum&quot;. In addition to their impression on overseas death metal, the group would also inspire black metal acts like Germany&#x27;s Falkenbach, Greece&#x27;s Rotting Christ, Switzerland&#x27;s Samael and Norway&#x27;s Dimmu Borgir.

Chuck Schuldiner, who had relocated his band Death to the Bay Area to write &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; with Chris Reifert, in tandem with Possessed&#x27;s rise, told magazine &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot;:

In the book &quot;Choosing Death&quot;, Mantas/Death drummer Kam Lee called Possessed the first death metal band, and added:

Author Daniel Ekeroth expanded on Lee&#x27;s assessment of the 1984 &quot;Death Metal&quot; demo in his book, &quot;Swedish Death Metal&quot;:

Possessed&#x27;s association with Debbie Abono would be a &quot;first&quot; for both sides: Abono would be the band&#x27;s first manager, and Possessed were Abono&#x27;s first managed signed band. A grandmother in her mid-fifties at that time, Abono had no previous connection to heavy metal music other than as a concert designated driver for her daughters, one of whom was a girlfriend of guitarist Larry LaLonde. Due to generation gap, Abono also had limited awareness of the sometimes blasphemous themes of heavy metal, and was allegedly offended upon reading the lyric sheet of &quot;Seven Churches&quot;. Nevertheless, she agreed to manage and represent Possessed as long as Becerra and LaLonde finished high school commitments. Although the group&#x27;s relationship amongst themselves and their first manager would reach points of discord and eventual termination, Abono would go on to manage additional bands in the Bay Area thrash metal scene like Exodus, Vio-lence and Forbidden Evil, as well as death metal bands like Chicago&#x27;s Broken Hope and Florida&#x27;s Cynic and Obituary.

While Possessed&#x27;s first album, &quot;Seven Churches&quot;, was praised for its speed and the brutality of the vocals, the second album, &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;, disappointed both fans and critics alike. Released on Halloween of 1986, the album was not as powerful and as influential as its predecessor, and the band&#x27;s popularity suffered because of it. The band members themselves expressed disappointment in the release, in general, and the sound production in particular. 

==Whereabouts of former members==
In 1993, former drummer Mike Sus retired from music to pursue other careers, going on to get a degree in psychology and is helping injured people to live a normal everyday life. He is also a drug addiction counselor.

Former guitarist Larry LaLonde joined the Bay Area thrash metal band Blind Illusion which released &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot; in 1988, after which Lalonde went on to join the influential funk metal band Primus in 1989 (led by former Blind Illusion bassist Les Claypool).

In 1995, former guitarist Mike Torrão joined a new death metal band, Infanticide, but never released any songs to the public. Infanticide broke up in 1997. He has since worked as a landscaper and plays music only in his spare time. As of 2008, Torrao is working with the band INaCAGE in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>World Rowing, also known as the World Rowing Federation (officially FISA; ), is the international governing body for rowing. Its current president is Jean-Christophe Rolland who succeeded Denis Oswald at a ceremony held in Lucerne in July 2014.

The World Rowing Cup, World Rowing Championships, and other such competitions are overseen by this organization.

== History ==
===General===
It was founded by rowing representatives from France, Switzerland, Belgium, Adriatica, and Italy on 25 June 1892 in Turin in response to the growing popularity of the sport of rowing, and the consequent need for uniformity of regulations over such matters as race lengths, boat composition, and weight classes. Also, at the time, betting on rowing was very popular, and the rowers or coaches were themselves often taking bets. Amateur status, while widespread in England and elsewhere, was unknown in the sport in many nations, a state of affairs which could lead to corruption such as thrown races.

The first regatta organised by the newly formed FISA was the European Rowing Championships and was held in 1893 in Orta, Italy. It only had 10 entries in 3 events and no professional participants. By 1925, the 27th European Championships, held in Prague, included 24 entries in 10 different events.

FISA established its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1922.

FISA was the first international sports federation to join the Olympic movement. It has been on the Olympic program since the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. (The rowing events at the 1896 games were cancelled because of high winds). Each country that participates in rowing has a federation or governing body which belongs to the &quot;World Rowing Congress&quot;. These federations (of which there are currently 157) have overall control of what World Rowing does.

FISA decided in 1955 that only a united German team could compete at international rowing championships; this first applied to European Championships and later, from the inaugural in 1962 onwards, to World Championships. This required that East and West Germany held selection trials, with the winning country for each boat class choosing the rowers who would compete at the championships. Over the years, the relationship between the two German countries deteriorated, and East Germany made seven application to FISA congresses to be recognised as a separate and independent country. On the seventh occasion, there was insufficient time to discuss the issue at the congress held in Duisburg just prior to the men&#x27;s competition of the 1965 European Rowing Championships. FISA president Thomas Keller stated that an extraordinary congress were to be held in November in Vienna that would discuss the issue, and that he personally saw no problem with solving the problems. In October 1965, the International Olympic Committee decided that East Germany was to have its own team at future Olympic Games. At the FISA congress in November 1965, the East German application found forty-six votes of support, four abstentions (from Germany and Austria), and no votes of disapproval. At the same congress, Keller&#x27;s proposal to not play national anthems or raise flags during medal ceremonies was also approved. These changes first applied at the European Championships (for women) in August 1966 and then the World Championships (for men) two weeks later in September.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Rowing banned athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus from international competitions. A year later, it started a working group tasked with reinstating Russian and Belarusian athletes.

===Presidents===
FISA is led by a president. The following list gives presidents since 1924:
* 1924–1926 Eugène Baud, Switzerland
* 1926–1949 Rico Fioroni, Switzerland

* 1958–1989 Thomas Keller, Switzerland
* 1989–2014 Denis Oswald, Switzerland
* 2014–present Jean-Christophe Rolland, France

==Membership== 
At the 2022 Ordinary Congress, World Rowing admitted its 157th member. 

== Events ==
World Rowing organises a large number of international rowing events throughout the year.

===Olympics===

World Rowing has been sponsoring the program for rowing events at the Olympic games since the initial Olympic games in 1896 in Athens. It is also responsible for running the qualification program to select the participants for the games.

=== Paralympics ===
World Rowing has been sponsoring the program for rowing events at the Paralympic games since the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing. It is also responsible for running the qualification program to select the participants for the games.

===World Rowing Under 23 Championships===

First held in 1976, this regatta is for those too old for the Junior Championships but who do not turn 23 by the end of the current calendar year (previously categorised as &quot;Senior B&quot; by FISA). The event was originally named the &quot;Nations Cup&quot; and opposed by FISA.

There are also events for mixed crews – where half the crew is men and half women (excluding cox). The 2010 regatta took place in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, 2011 in Poznan, Poland, 2012 in Duisburg, Germany, 2013 in Varese, Italy, 2014 in Ballarat, Australia, 2015 in Hazewinkel, Belgium, 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017 in Bled, Slovenia, 2018 in Sarasota, Florida, USA, and 2019 in Lake Valence, Hungary. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 regatta was a virtual competition on indoor rowers. The 2021 regatta will be in Linz-Ottensheim, Austria, 2022 in Libourne, France, 2023 in Pretoria, South Africa, and 2024 in Brandenburg, Germany. 

In 2025 the regatta is in Banyoles, Spain... 10–14 September.

===World Rowing Sprints===
A new idea introduced in 2002 as an attempt to bring rowing to the centre of cities. The first (and only) event took place on the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park, London and was sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. Crews from Great Britain, United States, Germany, and the Netherlands took part in the 500 m race. Famous rowing champions raced, including Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell, and Marcel Hacker.

Each team was made up of 13 rowers (5 women, 7 men, and a cox). Events were held in Women&#x27;s Single Sculls, Men&#x27;s Single Sculls, Women&#x27;s Double Sculls, Men&#x27;s Pairs, Women&#x27;s Pairs and Men&#x27;s Fours. These crews then combined to form Mixed Quad Sculls and Eights.

Great Britain were the eventual winners and crowned the &quot;Mercedes-Benz Sprints Champions&quot;.

<doc id="400155" wikidata="Q2708652" url="?curid=400155" title="1948 Irish general election">
<text>The 1948 Irish general election to the 13th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 4 February following the dissolution of the 12th Dáil on 12 January 1948 by the President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly on the request of Taoiseach Éamon de Valera. The general election took place in 40 constituencies throughout Ireland for 147 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. A revision of Dáil constituencies under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947 had increased the number of seats by 9 since the previous election. The election resulted in Fianna Fáil leaving government for the first time in 16 years and the formation of the first coalition government in Ireland.

The constituency of Carlow–Kilkenny voted on 8 February after the death during the campaign of Fine Gael candidate Eamonn Coogan TD. Another Fine Gael deputy in the same constituency, James Hughes, had died shortly before the dissolution.

The 13th Dáil met at Leinster House on 18 February to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland on the nomination of the Taoiseach. John A. Costello was appointed leading the first inter-party government, a five-party minority coalition.

This election was the last one before Ireland&#x27;s withdrawal from the British Commonwealth and the declaration of the Republic of Ireland, which came into effect on 18 April 1949 under The Republic of Ireland Act 1948.

==Campaign==
The general election of 1948 was called by the Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, in the hope of stopping the rise of a new party, Clann na Poblachta. In 1947 the rapid rise of Clann na Poblachta threatened the position of Fianna Fáil. The government of Éamon de Valera introduced the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947 which increased the size of the Dáil from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by historian Tim Pat Coogan as &quot;a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no Six County Unionist could have bettered.&quot;

Other issues were raised on the campaign that the parties had not foreseen. Fianna Fáil had enjoyed an uninterrupted sixteen years of dominance in government. Many people believed that the party had become stale and there was a strong desire for change. Although World War II had ended three years earlier, rationing continued, and massive inflation plagued the economy. A prolonged teachers&#x27; strike during the lifetime of the previous Dáil damaged the government due to its inability to settle the dispute. Bad weather added to the woes of the farmers, and poor harvests resulted in anger at the ballot box. Allegations that de Valera and Seán Lemass were involved in bribery and corruption raised questions about certain public officials.

Despite these issues, Fianna Fáil still expected to retain power. This prospect seemed very likely; however, an unlikely coalition was soon to be formed.

==Result==





Fianna Fáil dropped 8 seats but remained the largest party. Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote. The other parties remained roughly the same, with Fine Gael only gaining an extra seat.

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
==Government formation==
The election left de Valera six seats short of a majority in the 147-seat Dáil. Fianna Fáil had long refused to enter a formal coalition with another party, instead preferring confidence and supply agreements with other parties when it was short of an outright majority. This time, however, de Valera was unable to reach an agreement with National Labour and the Independents to form a government.

It seemed unlikely that the other political parties could unite to oust Fianna Fáil. Between them, they only had one seat fewer than Fianna Fáil. If they could get the support of at least seven independents, they would be able to form a government. On paper, such a motley coalition appeared politically unrealistic. However, a shared dislike of Fianna Fáil and de Valera overcame all other difficulties to knock Fianna Fáil from power for the first time in 16 years.

As the largest party in the coalition, it was a foregone conclusion that Fine Gael would provide the nominee for Taoiseach. However, republicans such as Seán MacBride refused to serve under Fine Gael leader, Richard Mulcahy, the man who had been the commander of the National Army during the civil war. Since the other parties would have been 17 seats short of a majority (and indeed, would have been 11 seats behind Fianna Fáil) without MacBride, Mulcahy stepped aside in favour of John A. Costello, a relatively unknown politician and former Attorney General. Mulcahy, who remained leader of Fine Gael, became Minister for Education. William Norton, the leader of the Labour Party became Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare.

On paper, this new coalition government looked weak and seemed unlikely to last. It consisted of a patchwork collection of political parties. There were young and old politicians, republicans and Free Staters, conservatives and socialists. The government&#x27;s survival depended on a united dislike of Fianna Fáil, the skill of Costello as Taoiseach and the independence of various ministers.

The coalition lasted over three years from February 1948 to May 1951.

<text>George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly (156213 June 1636) was a Scottish nobleman who took a leading role in the political and military life of Scotland in the late 16th century, and around the time of the Union of the Crowns.

==Biography==
The son of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly, and of Anne, daughter of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran and Duke of Châtellerault, he was educated in France as a Roman Catholic. He took part in the plot which led to the execution of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton in 1581 and in the conspiracy which saved King James VI from the Ruthven raiders in 1583. In 1588 he signed the Presbyterian confession of faith, but continued to engage in plots for the Spanish invasion of Scotland. On 28 November he was appointed captain of the guard, and while carrying out his duties at Holyrood his treasonable correspondence was discovered. King James, however, finding the Roman Catholic lords useful as a foil to the tyranny of the Kirk, was at this time seeking Spanish aid in case Queen Elizabeth I tried to challenge his right to the English throne; Huntly, always one of his favourites, was pardoned.

The Scottish Justice Clerk, Lewis Bellenden wrote of Huntly in October 1587, alleged to be a promoter of the Catholic faith at court:to the Earl of Huntly&#x27;s lying in his majesty&#x27;s chamber and preaching Papistry, truth it is I think he be a Papist, but not precise as he had not rather lie in a fair gentlewoman&#x27;s chamber than either in the king&#x27;s, or yet where he might have an hundred masses.

Huntly married Henrietta Stewart, daughter of Esmé Stewart and Catherine de Balsac, on 21 July 1588. They had contracted to marry in 1581. James VI composed a poetic entertainment with speeches from Mercury, a group of nymphs, Agrestis, and some comedy. This marriage increased Huntly&#x27;s influence and connections within Scotland and also brought him closer to French Catholic influences.
He was the father of Mary Gordon, who married William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas.

In April 1589, Huntly raised a rebellion in the north. The Earl and his supporters met the king at the Bridge of Dee near Aberdeen on 17 April. Huntly was obliged to surrender to Sir John Carmichael, captain of the king&#x27;s guard, and Captain William Home at Terrisoul near Aberdeen. He was brought to Edinburgh to be warded in Robert Gourlay&#x27;s house. After a short imprisonment in Borthwick Castle he was again freed. On 18 October 1591 he was playing golf with the Duke of Lennox, and joined in an unsuccessful search for the rebel Earl of Bothwell in Leith.

He then involved himself in a private war with the Grants and the Mackintoshes, who were assisted by the Earls of Atholl and Moray; and on 8 February 1592 he set fire to Moray&#x27;s castle of Donibristle in Fife, and stabbed the earl to death with his own hand. This outrage, which inspired the ballad &quot;The Bonnie Earl o&#x27; Moray&quot;, brought retribution on Huntly when his enemies ravaged his lands.

In December the &quot;Spanish Blanks&quot; were intercepted, two of which bore Huntly&#x27;s signature, and a charge of treason was again brought against him, while on 25 September 1593 he was excommunicated. James treated him and the other rebel lords with great leniency. On 26 November they were freed from the charge of treason, being ordered at the same time, however, to renounce their Catholic faith or leave the kingdom. On their refusal to comply they were attainted. Huntly then joined Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll and Francis Stewart-Hepburn, 5th Earl of Bothwell, in a conspiracy to imprison the king, and they defeated the royal forces under Argyll in the Battle of Glenlivet on 3 October 1594, Huntly especially distinguishing himself. His victory gained no real advantage; his castle of Strathbogie was blown up by James, and Huntly left Scotland in about March 1595. He returned secretly soon afterwards, and his presence in Scotland was at first tolerated by James; but owing to the hostile feeling aroused, and the &quot;No Popery&quot; riot in Edinburgh, the king demanded that he should abjure Romanism (Roman Catholicism) or go into permanent banishment. He submitted to the Kirk in June 1597, and was restored to his estates in December.

On 7 April 1599, he was created a Marquess, and on 9 July, together with Lennox, appointed lieutenant of the north. He was treated with great favour by the king and was reconciled with Murray and Argyll. The Kirk still doubted the genuineness of his abjuration and, on 10 December 1606, he was confined to Aberdeen; on 19 March 1607 he was summoned before the privy council. Huntly thereupon went to England and appealed to James in person. He was excommunicated in 1608, and imprisoned in Stirling Castle until 10 December 1610, when he signed again the confession of faith.

Accused of Romanist intrigues in 1616, he was ordered once more to subscribe the confession, which this time he refused to do; imprisoned at Edinburgh, he was set free by James&#x27;s order on 18 June, and having joined the court in London was absolved from excommunication by Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury; this absolution, after a further subscription to the confession by Huntly, was confirmed by the Kirk.

At the accession of King Charles I Huntly lost much of his influence at court. He was deprived in 1630 of his heritable sheriffships of Aberdeen and Inverness. The same year a feud broke out between the Crichtons and the Gordons, in the course of which Huntly&#x27;s second son, Lord Melgum, was burnt to death either by treachery or by accident, while being entertained in the house of James Crichton of Frendraught. For the ravaging of the lands of the Crichtons Huntly was held responsible, and having been summoned before the privy council in 1635 he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle from December till June 1636. He left his confinement with shattered health, and died at Dundee while on his journey to Strathbogie on 13 June 1636, after declaring himself a Roman Catholic.

<doc id="400165" wikidata="Q2342274" url="?curid=400165" title="1944 Irish general election">
<text>The 1944 Irish general election to the 12th Dáil was held on Tuesday, 30 May, having been called on 9 May by President Douglas Hyde on the advice of Taoiseach Éamon de Valera. The general election took place in 34 parliamentary constituencies for 138 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. Fianna Fáil won an overall majority. The outgoing 11th Dáil was dissolved on 7 June.

The 12th Dáil met at Leinster House on 9 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland on the nomination of the Taoiseach. Outgoing Taoiseach Éamon de Valera was re-appointed leading a single-party Fianna Fáil government.

==Calling the election==
The outgoing Fianna Fáil government, formed on 1 July 1943, was a minority government. On 9 July 1944, it suffered a defeat for the second reading of its Transport Bill. Taoiseach Éamon de Valera sought a snap election, just one year after the previous election, in hopes of getting an overall majority.

It was the second election called under the General Elections (Emergency Provisions) Act 1943. The Act, intended to increase national security by minimising the interval during which no Dáil is in existence, subvented the requirement under the Constitution for the president to dissolve the Dáil before a general election took place, and was permitted under the state of emergency in effect during the Second World War. The election was called on 9 May but the Dáil met as scheduled on the following day, when an adjournment debate was held in which the opposition TDs condemned the decision to hold an election in wartime as unnecessary and reckless. The 11th Dáil was dissolved on 7 June 1944.

==Campaign==
The campaign was not wanted by the opposition parties. Fianna Fáil fought the election on its record in government and also in the hope of securing a fresh mandate for its policies. During the campaign Fine Gael put forward the proposal of forming a coalition government with the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan; however, this was ridiculed by Fianna Fáil as untenable. National Labour had split from Labour in January 1944.

Due to the fractured nature of the opposition, Éamon de Valera&#x27;s tactic of calling a snap general election succeeded, with Fianna Fáil increasing its share of seats, as it had in the previous snap elections of 1933 and 1938.

<text>Sigmund Romberg (July 29, 1887 – November 9, 1951) was a Hungarian-born American composer. He is best known for his musicals and operettas, particularly &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (1924), &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926) and &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1928).

Early in his career, Romberg was employed by the Shubert brothers to write music for their musicals and revues, including several vehicles for Al Jolson. For the Shuberts, he also adapted several European operettas for American audiences, including the successful &quot;Maytime&quot; (1917) and &quot;Blossom Time&quot; (1921). His three hit operettas of the mid-1920s, named above, are in the style of Viennese operetta, but his other works from that time mostly employ the style of American musicals of their eras. He also composed film scores.

==Biography==
Romberg was born in Hungary as Siegmund Rosenberg to a Jewish family, Adam and Clara Rosenberg, in Gross-Kanizsa (Hungarian: Nagykanizsa) during the Austro-Hungarian &quot;kaiserlich und königlich&quot; (Imperial and Royal) monarchy period. In 1889 Romberg and his family moved to Belišće, which was then in Hungary, where he attended a primary school. Influenced by his father, Romberg learned to play the violin at six, and piano at eight years of age. He enrolled at Osijek gymnasium in 1897, where he was a member of the high school orchestra. He went to Vienna to study engineering, but he also took composition lessons while living there. In June 1909, to the Port of New York. After a brief stint working in a pencil factory in New York, he was employed as a pianist in cafés and restaurants.

He eventually founded his own orchestra and published a few songs, which, despite their limited success, brought him to the attention of the Shubert brothers, who in 1914 hired him to write music for their Broadway theatre shows. That year he wrote his first successful Broadway revue, &quot;The Whirl of the World&quot;. He then contributed songs to several American musical adaptations of Viennese operettas, including the successful &quot;The Blue Paradise&quot; (1915). Even more successful was the musical &quot;Maytime&quot;, in 1917. Both involved love across generations and included nostalgic waltzes, along with more modern American dance music. At the same time, Romberg contributed songs to the Shuberts&#x27; popular revues &quot;The Passing Show of 1916&quot; and &quot;The Passing Show of 1918&quot; and to two vehicles for Al Jolson: &quot;Robinson Crusoe, Jr.&quot; (1916), an extravaganza burlesque on the familiar story, and &quot;Sinbad&quot; (1918), an Arabian Nights-themed musical. Romberg wrote another Jolson vehicle in 1921, &quot;Bombo&quot;. He wrote the music for the musical comedy &quot;Poor Little Ritz Girl&quot;, which also had songs by Richard Rodgers. He also wrote the music for &quot;Love Birds&quot; (1921).

Romberg&#x27;s adaptation of melodies by Franz Schubert for &quot;Blossom Time&quot; (1921, produced in the UK as &quot;Lilac Time&quot;) was a great success. He subsequently wrote his best-known operettas, &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (1924), &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926) and &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1928), which are in a style similar to the Viennese operettas of Franz Lehár. He also wrote &quot;Princess Flavia&quot; (1925), an operetta based on &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. His other works, &quot;My Maryland&quot; (1927), a successful romance; &quot;Rosalie&quot; (1928), together with George Gershwin; and &quot;May Wine&quot; (1935), with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, about a blackmail plot; and &quot;Up in Central Park&quot; (1945), are closer to the American musical in style. In 1948, he wrote a new score for &quot;My Romance&quot; after the show had folded in try-outs. Romberg also wrote a number of film scores and adapted his own work for film.

Columbia Records asked Romberg to conduct orchestral arrangements of his music (which he had played in concerts) for a series of recordings from 1945 to 1950 that were issued both on 78-rpm and 33-1/3 rpm discs. These performances are now prized by record collectors. Naxos Records digitally remastered the recordings and issued them in the U.K. (They cannot be released in the U.S. because Sony Music Entertainment, which is a parent company of Columbia Records, holds the copyright for their American release.) Much of Romberg&#x27;s music, including extensive excerpts from his operettas, was released on LP during the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Columbia, Capitol, and RCA Victor. Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, who appeared in an MGM adaptation of &quot;The New Moon&quot; in 1940, regularly recorded and performed his music. There have also been periodic revivals of the operettas.

Romberg died in 1951, aged 64, of a stroke at his Ritz Towers Hotel suite in New York City and was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

Romberg married twice. Little is known about his first wife, Eugenia, who appears on a 1920 federal census form as being Austrian. His second wife was Lillian Harris, whom he married on March 28, 1925, in Paterson, New Jersey. They had no children. Lillian Harris was born March 8, 1898, and died April 15, 1967, in New York City.

==Media==
Romberg was the subject of the 1954 Stanley Donen-directed film &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot;, in which he was portrayed by José Ferrer. The film was an adaptation of Elliott Arnold &#x27;s 1949 biography of Romberg.

His operetta &quot;The New Moon&quot; was the basis for two film adaptations, both titled &quot;New Moon&quot;; the 1930 version starred Lawrence Tibbett and Grace Moore in the main roles, and the 1940 version starred Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.

&quot;Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Lover, Come Back to Me&quot; from &quot;The New Moon&quot; are jazz standards and have been performed by many jazz performers.

He is featured in the lyrics to the 1963 Allan Sherman comedy song &quot;The Mexican Hat Dance&quot;.

==Radio==
Romberg starred in &quot;An Evening with Romberg&quot; on NBC June 12, 1945 – August 31, 1948, mostly Tuesdays at 10:30 pm as a summer replacement series for Hildegarde&#x27;s &quot;Raleigh Room&quot; (1945) and for &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; (1947–1948). The program featured three vocalists (Anne Jamison, Reinhold Schmidt, Robert Merrill), a 58-piece orchestra, and Frank Gallop as host/announcer. Music genres included &quot;operatic arias, short symphonic works and overtures to popular songs, light classics, dance music and even a bit of outright jazz.&quot;

==Honors==
Since 1970, Belišće organizes musical evenings in Romberg&#x27;s honor; similar events are held in Osijek since 1995. He was named as one of the meritorious and notable citizens of Osijek. Romberg was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<doc id="400168" wikidata="Q5538280" url="?curid=400168" title="George Curry (Wild Bunch)">
<text>George Sutherland Currie (March 20, 1871 – April 17, 1900), also known as George &quot;Flat-Nose&quot; Curry, was a Canadian-American robber of the American Old West. Curry was a mentor to Harvey Logan, who would adopt the surname Curry, and the two robbed banks together before both became members of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch. Curry was killed by a sheriff while rustling in Grand County, Utah.

==Early outlaw career==
Currie was born in West Point, Prince Edward Island, in 1871, the second of six children of John and Nancy Ann (Macdonald) Currie. His family moved to Chadron, Nebraska, where he started rustling as a young man. He gained the nick-name &quot;Flat-Nose&quot; and took up residence at the outlaw hideout Hole-in-the-Wall, Utah. While there, he met Harvey Logan, who adopted his surname and became known as Kid Curry. The Kid&#x27;s brothers Lonny and Johnnie Logan, following his example, also adopted Curry as a surname. Kid Curry would go on to become one of the most dangerous and feared gunmen of the Old West.

George Currie formed a gang that included Kid Curry, and was captured with him on June 28, 1897. The gang had held up the Butte County Bank at Belle Fourche, South Dakota, earlier in the month. All but one of them (Tom O&#x27;Day, whose horse had run away without him) had escaped with the money, but while planning another robbery a posse caught them in Fergus County, Montana, and captured Curry, along with the Kid and Walt Putney. They escaped from Deadwood jail in November by overpowering the jailer.

The three men stole horses and made their way back to Montana, stealing supplies as they went. Another posse caught up with them in the Bearpaw mountains. There was a gunfight from which the fugitives escaped on foot, leaving the stolen goods and horses behind. They retreated to the Hole-in-the-Wall, robbing two post offices on their route.

==Wild Bunch==

At the Hole they were involved in a gun battle with another posse, but the rough terrain, and the defensive structures built and manned by the several dozen outlaw members of the Wild Bunch hiding there, were too much for the lawmen.

Curry participated in the Wild Bunch raid on the Union Pacific Overland Flyer train at Wilcox, Wyoming on June 2, 1899, which became famous, as well as taking part in several other robberies. The Overland Flyer&#x27;s train crew provided descriptions of the robbers, which local Converse County Sheriff Josiah Hazen recognized as Butch Cassidy, Kid Curry, Flat Nose George Curry, and Elzy Lay. Hazen formed a posse immediately but Kid Curry and George Curry shot and killed Hazen during his posse&#x27;s pursuit of them, which slowed the posse. In the ensuing confusion the Wild Bunch were able to wade downstream and escape without their horses. The outlaws walked to a sheep ranch at Castle Creek, where they rested before continuing to the Tisdale mountains on the north fork of the Powder River. Here they were able to obtain replacement horses and resupply. (Local Deputy Sheriff William Deane came into contact with the gang there but was shot and killed by Kid Curry April 15, 1897.)

Although the posse greatly outnumbered them and could cover a lot of ground in its search, the Wild Bunch reached the safe stronghold of the Hole-in-the-Wall. Pinkerton agent Charlie Siringo and contracted Pinkerton agent Tom Horn developed information that identified Kid Curry as killing Hazen. There were never any definite accounts connecting Kid Curry to the killing of Deputy Deane, but rumors uncovered by Siringo while he worked undercover indicated that Kid Curry had been the killer.

The Currys and some of the other members of the Wild Bunch went to hide at Robbers Roost in Utah, after getting supplies at the ranch of female outlaws Josie and Ann Bassett.

George Curry was shot and killed on April 17, 1900, by Sheriff Jesse Tyler while Curry was rustling in Grand County, Utah. Upon hearing of this, Harvey &quot;Kid Curry&quot; Logan, who was also enraged by the recent law enforcement killing of his younger brother Lonny in Missouri, vowed to get revenge. In May, Kid Curry rode from New Mexico to Utah, and took revenge for his brother and George Curry&#x27;s deaths by killing Sheriff Tyler and his Deputy Sheriff Sam Jenkins in a gunfight.

<text>The 1943 Irish general election to the 11th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 23 June, having been called on 31 May by proclamation of President Douglas Hyde on the advice of Taoiseach Éamon de Valera. It took place in 34 parliamentary constituencies for 138 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. Fianna Fáil lost its overall majority of seats. The outgoing 10th Dáil was dissolved on 26 June, although it had not met after 26 May.

The 11th Dáil met at Leinster House on 1 July to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland on the nomination of the Taoiseach. Outgoing Taoiseach Éamon de Valera was re-appointed leading a single-party Fianna Fáil government.

==Election during the emergency==
Ireland had declared a state of emergency on 2 September 1939, arising from the Second World War. The Emergency Powers Act 1939 was in force at the time of the election campaign, and concomitant press censorship affected coverage.

In April the government had proposed to postpone the election by introducing a bill to extend the maximum term of the Dáil from five to six years; however, in the absence of support from the Fine Gael opposition, the bill was withdrawn.

As an alternative, the General Elections (Emergency Provisions) Act 1943 provided that a general election could be called without a dissolution and that the outgoing Dáil would not be dissolved until after all returns from the general election. This was in contravention of provisions of the Constitution, which require the president to dissolve the Dáil before a general election. However, this was permitted under the state of emergency.

<text>The 1938 Irish general election to the 10th Dáil was held on Friday, 17 June following the dissolution of the 9th Dáil on 27 May 1938 by the Presidential Commission on the request of Taoiseach Éamon de Valera. It was a snap election, less than a year after the previous election, the proximate cause being the government&#x27;s loss of an opposition motion recommending use of arbitration to resolve Civil Service labour disputes. The general election took place in 34 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 138 seats in Dáil Éireann. It was the first election held after the coming into force of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 December 1937. Fianna Fáil won the first overall majority in the history of the State.

The 10th Dáil met at Leinster House on 30 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by President Douglas Hyde and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland on the nomination of the Taoiseach. Outgoing Taoiseach Éamon de Valera was re-appointed leading a single-party Fianna Fáil government.

<text>The 1937 Irish general election to the 9th Dáil was held on Thursday, 1 July, following the dissolution of the 8th Dáil on 14 June by Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy on the direction of the Executive Council. The general election took place in 34 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Irish Free State for 138 seats in Dáil Éireann. The number of seats in the Dáil was reduced by 15, from 153 to 138 seats, under the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Act 1935.

A plebiscite on whether to approve the new Constitution of Ireland was held on the same day. It was approved with the support of 56.5% of voters and would come into operation on 29 December 1937.

The 9th Dáil met at Leinster House on 21 July 1937 to elect the President of the Executive Council and approve the appointment of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Outgoing president Éamon de Valera was re-elected leading a single-party Fianna Fáil government.

<text>The 1933 Irish general election to the 8th Dáil was held on Tuesday, 24 January following the dissolution of the 7th Dáil on 2 January by Governor-General Domhnall Ua Buachalla on the advice of the Executive Council. The general election took place in 30 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Irish Free State for 153 seats in Dáil Éireann.

The 8th Dáil met at Leinster House on 8 February to nominate the President and Executive Council of the Irish Free State for appointment by the Governor-General. Outgoing president Éamon de Valera was re-appointed leading a Fianna Fáil government, which fell one seat short of an overall majority.

<doc id="400177" wikidata="Q3568107" url="?curid=400177" title="Wild Bunch">
<text>The Wild Bunch, also known as the Doolin–Dalton Gang, or the Oklahombres, were a gang of American outlaws based in the Indian Territory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were active in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma Territory during the 1890s—robbing banks and stores, holding up trains, and killing lawmen. They were also known as The Oklahoma Long Riders because of the long dusters that they wore.

The gang formed in the last decade of the 19th century, and most of its members were killed before 1900. Only two of its eleven members survived into the 20th century, and all eleven met violent deaths in gun battles with lawmen.

==Members==
The gang was led by Bill Doolin and William Marion &quot;Bill&quot; Dalton; it included the following men at various times: William &quot;Tulsa Jack&quot; Blake, Dan &quot;Dynamite Dick&quot; Clifton, Roy Daugherty (a.k.a. &quot;Arkansas Tom Jones&quot;), George &quot;Bitter Creek&quot; Newcomb (a.k.a. &quot;Slaughter Kid&quot;), Charley Pierce, William F. &quot;Little Bill&quot; Raidler, George &quot;Red Buck&quot; Waightman, Richard &quot;Little Dick&quot; West, and Oliver &quot;Ol&quot; Yantis. Additionally, two teenaged girls, known as Little Britches and Cattle Annie, followed the gang, informing them of the movements of law enforcement officers whenever they pursued the criminals.

Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce had previously been members of the Dalton Gang, which had been dominated by Bill Dalton&#x27;s brothers. Bill Dalton had aided his brothers in their gang, but had never taken part in any of their robberies and did not get involved until after the deaths of two of them at a bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas. Doolin had worked as a cowboy in Kansas and the Cherokee Outlet. As a leader of the Wild Bunch, he had something of a Robin Hood image because he and his gang preyed on wealthy institutions. He and his gang received considerable aid from the general public in eluding the law (see Ingalls, Oklahoma).

==Origins==
What was known as the Dalton Gang had been dominated by several Dalton brothers, and led by Bob Dalton. Doolin, Newcomb, and Charley Pierce were also members. They took part in the botched train robbery in Adair, Oklahoma Territory, on July 15, 1892, in which two guards and two townsmen, both doctors, were wounded, one of the doctors dying the next day. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce complained that Bob Dalton was not dividing money fairly among the gang and left in protest, but would later return. According to some accounts, Bob Dalton told Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce that he no longer needed them. Doolin and his friends returned to their hideout in Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory. On October 5, four of the remaining five members of the Dalton Gang would be killed in Coffeyville, Kansas during a botched robbery.

For a time, Doolin and his partners operated under outlaw Henry Starr (Cherokee), hiding out about 75 miles northeast of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, from where they made several raids. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce visited the Daltons&#x27; mother in Kingfisher to console her after her sons&#x27; deaths. Brothers Lit and Bill Dalton were also visiting their mother, and Doolin proposed that they join him and his group to avenge their brothers. Bill Dalton agreed to join them and soon took part in several robberies, but Lit refused in disgust. Henry Starr was arrested in 1893 and held for trial at Fort Smith.

As Doolin and Dalton were accepted as leaders of the gang, it became known as the Doolin—Dalton Gang, and also as the Wild Bunch. They hid out in northeastern Payne County, and were obtaining ammunition and supplies at the little village of Ingalls.

==Career==
Doolin soon took action: On November 1, 1892, his new gang, the Wild Bunch, robbed the Ford County Bank at Spearville, Kansas, getting away with all the cash on hand and over $1,500 in treasury notes. From the postcard descriptions sent out, the city marshal of Stillwater, Oklahoma Territory recognized Ol&#x27; Yantis, the gang&#x27;s newest member. The marshal&#x27;s posse soon cornered and killed Yantis in a shootout.

On June 11, 1893, the Wild Bunch held up a Santa Fe train west of Cimarron, Kansas. They took $1,000 in silver from the California-New Mexico Express. A sheriff&#x27;s posse from old Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, caught up with the gang north of Fort Supply. The gang got away but, in the ensuing gunfight, Doolin was shot in the left foot. The injury gave him pain for the rest of his life.

On September 1, 1893, a posse organized by the new U.S. Marshal, Evett Dumas &quot;E.D.&quot; Nix, entered the outlaw town of Ingalls with the intent to capture the gang. In what would be remembered as the Battle of Ingalls, three of the fourteen lawmen were killed in the gunfire. Two town citizens also died; one was killed protecting the outlaws.

After a short break the gang continued its activities in Oklahoma Territory. On January 3, 1894, Pierce and Waightman held up the store and post office at Clarkson. On January 23, the gang robbed the Farmers Citizens Bank at Pawnee, and March 10, the Wild Bunch robbed the Santa Fe Railway station at Woodward of more than $6,000.

On March 20, Nix sent the Three Guardsmen with a directive to take care of the Wild Bunch. The directive stated in part, &quot;I have selected you to do this work, placing explicit confidence in your abilities to cope with those desperadoes and bring them in—alive if possible—dead if necessary.&quot;

On April 1, 1894, the gang attempted to rob the store of retired US Deputy Marshal W.H. Carr at Sacred Heart, Indian Territory. Although shot through the stomach, Carr shot Newcomb in the shoulder, and the gang fled without getting anything.

On May 10, 1894, the Wild Bunch robbed the bank at Southwest City, Missouri, of $4,000, wounding several townspeople and killing one.

On May 21, 1894, the jurors in the Roy Daugherty (a.k.a. &quot;Arkansas Tom Jones&quot;) trial found him guilty of manslaughter rather than murder in the killing of three Deputy US Marshals. Frank Dale, the territorial judge hearing the case, returned to Guthrie, the territorial capitol in Oklahoma, and told US Marshal E.D. Nix, &quot; ... you will instruct your deputies to bring them in dead.&quot;

Bill Dalton, meanwhile, had left Doolin to form his own Dalton Gang. On May 23, 1894, Dalton and his new gang robbed the First National Bank at Longview, Texas. This was the gang&#x27;s only job. Various posses would kill three of the members and sent the last one to life in prison.

On December 19, 1894, Doolin was reportedly one of six men who attempted to rob the J.R. Pearce store at Texana, Oklahoma Territory; they were driven off having looted with less than $20.00 worth of merchandise.

On April 3, 1895, the Wild Bunch, without Doolin, held up a Rock Island train at Dover, Oklahoma. Unable to open the safe containing the $50,000 army payroll, they robbed passengers of cash and jewelry. Deputy U.S. Marshal Chris Madsen and his posse took a special train to Dover and picked up the trail at daybreak, surprising the gang around noon. The marshals killed Blake and scattered the gang. This was the last robbery committed by the Wild Bunch as a gang, although some of its members kept up the robberies and killings for which they were known.

==Demise==


U.S. Marshal Evett &quot;E.D.&quot; Nix was appointed in 1893. He made his main priority the toppling of the Doolin-Dalton Gang. Nix appointed one hundred marshals to the task, insisting that they hunt down all outlaws, but making this gang a priority. Marshal Nix was staunchly supportive of his deputies and whatever they felt was necessary to bring down the gang. With him as their defender politically, his deputy marshals systematically hunted down the gang members.

<doc id="400179" wikidata="Q3077264" url="?curid=400179" title="Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch">
<text>Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch was one of the loosely organized outlaw gangs operating out of the Hole-in-the-Wall, near Kaycee in Wyoming, a natural fortress of caves, with a narrow entrance that was constantly guarded. In the beginning, the gang was referred to as the &quot;Hole in the Wall Gang&quot; during the Old West era in the United States. It was popularized by the 1969 movie, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, and took its name from the original Wild Bunch. The gang was led by Butch Cassidy, and it included his closest friends Elzy Lay, the Sundance Kid, Tall Texan, News Carver, Camilla &quot;Deaf Charley&quot; Hanks, Laura Bullion, Flat-Nose Curry, Kid Curry, and Bob Meeks. They were the most successful train-robbing gang in history.

==History==
The Wild Bunch gang claimed to make every attempt to abstain from killing people, and Cassidy boasted of having never killed a single man or woman in his entire career. These claims were false, however. Kid Curry, &quot;Flat-Nose&quot; Curry, Will &quot;News&quot; Carver, and other members of the gang killed numerous people during their flight from law enforcement. Kid Curry alone killed nine lawmen while with the gang, and another two civilians during shootouts, becoming the gang&#x27;s most feared member. Elzy Lay killed another two lawmen following a robbery, for which he was wounded, arrested, and sentenced to life imprisonment. George Curry killed at least two lawmen, before being killed by Grand County, Utah, lawmen.
The gang was also closely associated with female outlaws Ann Bassett and Josie Bassett, whose ranch near Browns Park supplied the gang often with fresh horses and beef. Both Bassett girls became romantically involved with several members of the gang, and both occasionally accompanied the gang to one of their hideouts, called &quot;Robbers Roost&quot;. Associations with ranchers like these in the area allowed the gang considerable mobility, giving them an easy resupply of fresh horses and supplies, and a place to hole up for a night or two.

At 1:00 am on June 2, 1899, Cassidy, Sundance Kid, Harvey Logan, and Lay robbed a Union Pacific train near Wilcox, Wyoming. They wore masks made from white napkins, possibly pilfered from a Harvey House restaurant. In the holdup, they stole between $30,000 and $60,000. The gang split up afterward, a common ploy to throw off pursuers, and several fled to New Mexico. On July 11, 1899, gang members robbed a train near Folsom, New Mexico, without Cassidy&#x27;s presence. The pursuit by a posse led by Sheriff Ed Farr culminated in two gun battles, during which Sheriff Farr and two deputies were killed. Gang member Sam Ketchum was wounded and died in custody. Elzy Lay, one of Cassidy&#x27;s closest friends and cofounder of the Wild Bunch gang, was wounded and also captured.

Cassidy and the other members regrouped in Wyoming. On August 29, 1900, Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, Kid Curry, and another unidentified gang member believed to have been Will Carver, held up another Union Pacific train at Tipton, Wyoming. Less than a month later, on September 19, 1900, they raided the First National Bank of Winnemucca, Nevada, stealing $32,640. These and other lucrative robberies led to much notoriety and fame.

===End of the Wild Bunch===

In early 1901, Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and Sundance&#x27;s girlfriend Etta Place relocated to Argentine Patagonia, where they spent time at La Leona, 110 km from El Calafate in the province of Santa Cruz, to escape the pursuit of Pinkerton detectives and other lawmen. That same year, Will Carver was wounded by lawmen on April 1 and died in May. Ben Kilpatrick and Laura Bullion were captured in Tennessee in December 1901; he received a 20-year prison sentence and she was sentenced to five years. Kid Curry killed two lawmen in Knoxville, Tennessee; he escaped capture and traveled to Montana, where he killed the rancher who had killed his brother Johnny years before. He was captured on his return to Tennessee, but escaped again. Kid Curry was claimed to have killed himself in Colorado in 1904 during a shootout with lawmen, for he had said that no lawman would ever take him alive. In November 1908, Cassidy and Sundance are believed to have been killed in a shootout with the Bolivian Army; the exact circumstances of their fate continue to be disputed.

Etta Place disappeared, her last known sighting was in San Francisco, 1909. She was suspected to have reinvented herself as a brothel and hotel owner named Eunice Gray, in Fort Worth, Texas; recent photographic evidence refutes this theory. Elzy Lay was released from prison in 1906, and after a brief visit to the Bassett ranch in Utah, he relocated to California, where he became a respected businessman; he died there in 1934. Ben Kilpatrick was released from prison in 1911, and was killed during a train robbery in Texas in 1912. Laura Bullion was released from prison in 1905, and lived the remainder of her life as a seamstress, dying in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1961, the last of the Wild Bunch.

===In popular culture===
*&quot;The Three Outlaws&quot; (1956), starring Neville Brand as Butch Cassidy and Alan Hale Jr as the Sundance Kid, is a fictional film of the duo&#x27;s exploits with Wild Bunch member William &quot;News&quot; Carver as the third outlaw in the title.
* &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969) was directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman (who won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film).
* &quot;Drifters&quot; (2009–?), is a manga featuring Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid as supporting characters to the protagonists. They are transported to a fantasy world after their deaths and help aid in the fight against the genocidal &quot;Black King&quot;.
*The Van der Linde gang from Rockstar Games&#x27; &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; is inspired by the Wild Bunch; in 1899, the gang robs a train by blowing up one of the cars which carries valuables, leading to the Pinkertons pursuing them. The gang&#x27;s leader then begins conspiring to escape to a tropical island. Rockstar recommended the film &quot;&#x27;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;&#x27; to their fans.

<doc id="400180" wikidata="Q5481257" url="?curid=400180" title="Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll">
<text>Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll (30 April 156416 July 1631) was a Scottish nobleman. A convert to Catholicism, he openly conspired with the king of Spain to try to unseat the Protestant Queen Elizabeth.

==Biography==
He was the son of Andrew Hay, 8th Earl of Erroll by his first wife, Lady Jean Hay, daughter of William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll. He was the second eldest son, but his older brother Alexander, who was a deaf-mute, was declared &quot;insane&quot; and skipped in the succession. Francis succeeded to the earldom upon the death of his father in 1585.

In 1587 he married Mary Stewart, sister of the Earl of Atholl. She died soon after, and it was alleged he was cruel to her. Her family withheld his dowry money, and her brother took revenge in 1589 when Erroll was declared a rebel.

Early in his life he converted to Roman Catholicism, and as the associate of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly joined in the Spanish conspiracies against the throne of Queen Elizabeth. In 1589, he began engaging in treasonous correspondence with King Philip II of Spain, who was also briefly King of England by his marriage to Queen Mary.

A letter he wrote to King Philip declaring his allegiance to Spain was intercepted and sent by Elizabeth to James VI. In February 1589, he was ordered to appear in front of the Privy Council. Failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel.

He engaged with Huntly and Crawford in a rebellion in the north of Scotland, but their forces surrendered at Aberdeen on the arrival of the king in April; and in July, Erroll gave himself up to James, who leniently refrained from exacting any penalty. Erroll submitted himself to the king&#x27;s mercy at Edzell Castle on 5 August 1589. In September of the same year he entered into a personal bond with Huntly for mutual assistance; and in 1590 displeased the king by marrying, in spite of his prohibition, Lady Elizabeth Douglas, daughter of the William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton. The marriage was arranged at the initiative of the Master of Glamis, to form a political faction. On 21 April 1590 the Earl of Montrose and others at Megginch Castle tried to persuade him not to marry her, but Erroll argued he could change his wife&#x27;s friends&#x27; alliances.

He was involved in a quarrel with the Earl of Atholl at Perth on 29 June 1591, when Anne of Denmark made a ceremonial entry to the town. Atholl was Provost of Perth and Errol was Constable and they argued over their precedence.

Erroll was imprisoned on suspicion of complicity in the attempt made by Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell and Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray to surprise the king at Falkland in June 1592; and though he obtained his release, he was again proclaimed a rebel on account of the discovery of his signature to two of the &quot;Spanish Blanks&quot;, unwritten sheets subscribed with the names of the chief conspirators in a plot for a Spanish invasion of Scotland, to be filled up later with the terms of the projected treaty. After a failure to apprehend him in March 1593, Erroll and his companions were sentenced to abjure Roman Catholicism or leave the kingdom; and on their non-compliance were in 1594 declared traitors.

At Midsummer 1594 the earl hosted his allies the earls of Angus and Huntly at Towie, and there were bonfires and drinking and dancing. On 3 October they defeated at Glenlivet a force sent against them under the Earl of Argyll. His men carried a banner showing a cross and the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots. Erroll himself was severely wounded by a bullet in the arm and an arrow in the thigh. It was falsely rumoured that he came south to Callendar House, the home of his sister Helenor Hay, Countess of Linlithgow, and died.

Old Slains Castle, his seat, was razed to the ground. The rebel lords left Scotland in 1595, and Erroll, on report of his further conspiracies abroad, was arrested by the states of Zeeland, but was afterwards allowed to escape. He returned to Scotland secretly in 1596. In March 1597 he was lodged in the Canongate of Edinburgh, and was in the especial favour of Anne of Denmark. On 20 June 1597 he abjured Roman Catholicism and made his peace with the Church of Scotland. He enjoyed the favour of the king, and in 1602 was appointed a commissioner to negotiate the union with England.

A letter from the Privy Council about a pension paid to the Earl of Erroll in January mentions that one of his daughters served Anne of Denmark.

His relations with the Kirk, however, were not so amicable. The reality of his conversion was disputed, and on 21 May 1608 he was confined to the city of Perth for the better resolution of his doubts, being subsequently declared an obstinate &quot;papist&quot;, excommunicated, deprived of his estate, and imprisoned at Dumbarton; and after some further vacillation was finally released in May 1611.

The dispute which began in his lifetime concerning the hereditary office of Lord High Constable between the families of Erroll and of the Earls Marischal was settled finally in favour of the former; thus establishing the precedence enjoyed by the earls of Erroll next after the royal family over all other subjects in Scotland.

==Marriage and issue==

He married:
#Mary, daughter of John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl and Margaret Fleming, in 1587
#Margaret, daughter of James Stewart, Earl of Moray
#Elizabeth, daughter of William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton

By his third wife Elizabeth Douglas he had five sons and eight daughters:

#William, 10th earl
#George
#Francis

#Lewis
#Anna, married George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton
#Jean, married John Erskine, Earl of Mar
#Mary, married Walter Scott, 1st Earl of Buccleuch
#Elizabeth, married Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill; secondly; James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington
#Sophia Hay, who married John, Viscount Melgum, son of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly
#Margaret, married John Seton, son of Sir John Seton of Barns
#Isabel, died unmarried
#Helen (died 1625, aged 10)

The earl died on 16 July 1631, and was buried in the church of Slains. The poet Arthur Johnston composed a poem in Latin for his funeral.

<doc id="400181" wikidata="Q13638428" url="?curid=400181" title="1932 Irish general election">
<text>The 1932 Irish general election to the 7th Dáil was held on Tuesday, 16 February, following the dissolution of the 6th Dáil on 29 January by Governor-General James McNeill on the advice of President of the Executive Council W. T. Cosgrave. The general election took place in 30 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Irish Free State for 153 seats in Dáil Éireann. It was the first election held in the Irish Free State since the Statute of Westminster 1931 removed almost all of the United Kingdom parliament to legislate for the Dominions, including the Irish Free State—effectively granting the Free State internationally recognised independence.

The 7th Dáil met at Leinster House on 9 March to nominate the President and Executive Council of the Irish Free State for appointment by the Governor-General. This resulted in the first change of government in the Irish Free State. Cumann na nGaedheal, which had been the governing party since 1922, was succeeded by Fianna Fáil, which became the largest party in the chamber and formed a government led by Éamon de Valera, with the support of the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil would be the largest party in Dáil Éireann at every general election thereafter until 2011.

==Campaign==
The election campaign between the two ideologically opposed parties was reasonably peaceful. However, during the campaign the government prosecuted de Valera&#x27;s newly established newspaper, &quot;The Irish Press&quot;. The editor was also brought before a military tribunal. This was seen by many as a major blunder and a serious infringement on the belief of freedom of speech. The &quot;red scare&quot; tactics also seemed to backfire on the government.

Two days before the election, Patrick Reynolds, a Cumann na nGaedheal TD was assassinated in Ballinamore. A garda detective was murdered in the same incident. The poll in Leitrim–Sligo was postponed and Reynolds&#x27; widow Mary was elected.

===Cumann na nGaedheal===

Cumann na nGaedheal fought the general election on its record of providing ten years of stable government. The party claimed to have brought stability following the chaos of the Irish Civil War and to have provided honest government. However, by 1932 this provision of solid government was wearing thin, particularly since the party had no solution to the collapse in trade which followed the depression of the early 1930s. Instead of offering new policies, the party believed that its record in government would be enough to retain power. Cumann na nGaedheal also played the &quot;red scare&quot; tactic, describing Fianna Fáil as communists and likening Éamon de Valera to Joseph Stalin.

===Fianna Fáil===
In comparison to Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil had an elaborate election programme, designed to appeal to a wide section of the electorate. It played down its republicanism to avoid alarm, but provided very popular social and economic policies. The party promised to free IRA prisoners, abolish the Oath of allegiance and reduce the powers of the Governor-General and the Senate. It also promised the introduction of protectionist policies, industrial development, self-sufficiency and improvements in housing and social security benefits.

===Seats summary===
==Government formation==
Fianna Fáil was five seats short of an overall majority, but it still looked like the only party capable of forming a government. Discussions began immediately after the election and an agreement was reached in which the Labour Party would support Fianna Fáil. The party now had the necessary votes to form a minority government. After the results were announced, newly elected Fianna Fáil TD Seán Moylan proclaimed that the election was a victory of &quot;the owners of the donkey and cart over the pony and trap class&quot;.

On 9 March 1932 the first change of government in the Irish Free State took place. Many in the country and abroad wondered if the true test of democracy would be passed, whether it would be possible for the men who won a civil war only ten years before to hand over power to their opponents. Similar to when the party first entered the Dáil in 1927, a number of Fianna Fáil TDs had guns in their pockets. It later emerged that Eoin O&#x27;Duffy, Commissioner of the , had urged a military coup. However, W. T. Cosgrave was determined to adhere to the principles of democracy that he had practised while in government. Likewise, the army, Garda and the civil service all accepted the change of government, despite the fact that they would now be taking orders from men who had been their enemies less than ten years previously. After a brief and uneventful meeting in the Dáil chamber, Éamon de Valera was nominated as President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. He was then formally appointed by the Governor-General, James McNeill, who had come to Leinster House to make the appointment rather than require de Valera travel to the Viceregal Lodge, formerly a symbol of British rule. He formed the 6th Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Fianna Fáil, a party led by many of the men most closely identified with opposing the existence of the state ten years earlier, were now the party of government. The 1932 general election was the beginning of a sixteen-year period in government for Fianna Fáil.

<text>United States Army Garrison Fort Buchanan, is a United States Army installation in Puerto Rico. It is located in the metropolitan area of the capital, San Juan.

==History==
Puerto Rico was part of the Spanish Empire from the time of Christopher Columbus until the Spanish–American War. United States forces landed in Guánica on July 25, 1898. The last Spanish unit left the island the following October, and the Department of Puerto Rico was established. Upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the Congress of the United States. In 1901 the island was designated to be an unincorporated United States territory by the Supreme Court of the United States in a controversial decision in the case of Downes Vs. Bidwell, the first of several Insular Cases.

===The Puerto Rico Regiment===
On July 1, 1899, “The Puerto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army” was created. On July 1, 1901, Lieutenant Colonel James Anderson Buchanan took command of the regiment. He was later promoted to colonel on July 21, 1902, and to brigadier general in 1905. Buchanan served in Puerto Rico from 1898 to 1903 and Fort Buchanan was named after him.

===Camp Buchanan===
The Puerto Rico Regiment was officially designated as the 65th Infantry Regiment in 1920, after defending the Canal Zone during World War I. A tract of approximately on the south shore of San Juan Bay was acquired to provide the regiment with a training area. The site was established in 1923 as Camp Buchanan. It served as a target range and maneuver area for the U.S. Army and National Guard troops from 1923 to 1939. The 1st Battalion 51st Coast Artillery Regiment was also assigned to Camp Buchanan in 1939.

===Fort Buchanan===

In May 1940 the location was renamed Fort Buchanan. It was eventually expanded to . During World War II, Fort Buchanan housed a depot supplying the Army Antilles Department. It also processed local troops through its replacement center. The industrial complex included pier facilities, ammunition storage areas and an extensive railroad network connecting the military installation to the Port of San Juan at San Juan Bay.

Puerto Rican soldiers being deployed during World War II and the Korean War were transported from the train station to the Army terminal at the Port of San Juan. At the time, Fort Buchanan served as a citizens training camp and soldier processing station.

After World War II the post was gradually reduced to its current size of . Fort Buchanan remained a command depot with post facilities, a personnel center, and a special training center until closure as an Army post in 1966. On December 31, 1966, with the deactivation of the Antilles Command, Fort Buchanan passed to the control of the United States Navy.

On December 7, 1971, the Third U.S. Army resumed control of Fort Buchanan, and in 1973 the post came under direct control of the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). Following the Department of Defense Unified Command Plan, Fort Buchanan came under control of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). From 1999 to 2003 it was occupied by United States Army South (USARSO).

In 2002 Fort Buchanan became part of the Southeast Regional Office of the Installation Management Agency (IMA), and in 2003 it became an IMA Reserve installation. In 2006 it became a garrison under United States Army Installation Management Command, Southeast Region (IMCOM-SE).

On October 1, 2008, the Commanding General of the 81st Readiness Division became Fort Buchanan&#x27;s Senior Mission Commander under the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC). Based on the December 2008 Unified Command Plan, Fort Buchanan currently falls under the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) area of operations, under the direct control of the Installation Management Command, Atlantic Region (IMCOM-Atlantic).

On October 23, 2009, an explosion at the nearby Caribbean Petroleum Corporation caused two people to suffer minor injuries at Fort Buchanan, and four other people sought help for respiratory problems. The explosion caused minor damages in some facilities of the military installation.

In 2017 after the wake of Hurricane Maria, Fort Buchanan served as a command center during the recovery efforts. Military active duty, reserve and National Guard units from the continental United States were mobilized from Fort Buchanan all over the island for the emergency. Thousands of these service members were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their disaster relief efforts. The United States Army Corps of Engineers also managed operations from Fort Buchanan.

<text>[[Henry Calderwood|Professor Henry Calderwood by [[William Hole (artist)|William Hole]] (1884)]]
Rev Henry Calderwood FRSE LLD (10 May 1830, Peebles – 19 November 1897, Edinburgh) was a Scottish minister and philosopher.

==Life==

He was born in Peebles on 10 May 1830, the son of William Calderwood, a corn merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Mitchell.

He was educated at the Edinburgh Institution and then the High School in Edinburgh, and later attended University of Edinburgh. He studied for the ministry of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and in 1856 was ordained pastor of the Greyfriars church, Glasgow. He also examined in mental philosophy for the University of Glasgow from 1861 to 1864, and from 1866 conducted the moral philosophy classes at that university, until in 1868 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh, holding this post until his death 29 years later. He was made LL.D. of Glasgow in 1865. At this point the family lived at 197 St Vincent Street.

In 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being John Hutton Balfour. His address was then given as &quot;Craigrowan&quot;, a large villa in Merchiston on the west side of the city.

His first and most famous work was &quot;The Philosophy of the Infinite&quot; (1854), in which he attacked the statement of Sir William Hamilton that we can have no knowledge of the Infinite. Calderwood maintained that such knowledge, though imperfect, is real and ever-increasing; that Faith implies Knowledge. His moral philosophy is in direct antagonism to Hegelian doctrine, and endeavours to substantiate the doctrine of divine sanction. Beside the data of experience, the mind has pure activity of its own whereby it apprehends the fundamental realities of life and combat. He wrote in addition &quot;A Handbook of Moral Philosophy&quot;, &quot;On the Relations of Mind and Brain&quot;, &quot;Science and Religion&quot;, &quot;The Evolution of Man&#x27;s Place in Nature&quot;.

Among his religious works the best-known is his &quot;Parables of Our Lord&quot;, and just before his death he finished a biography of David Hume in the &quot;Famous Scots Series&quot;. His interests were not confined to religious and intellectual matters; as the first chairman of the Edinburgh school board, he worked hard to bring the Education Act into working order. He published a well-known treatise on education. In the cause of philanthropy and temperance he was indefatigable. In politics he was at first a Liberal, but became a Liberal Unionist at the time of the Home Rule Bill.

Calderwood was an advocate of theistic evolution. In his book &quot;Evolution and Man&#x27;s Place in Nature&quot; he wrote that &quot;evolution stands before us as an impressive reality in the history of Nature.&quot;

He is buried in Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh, towards the south-west. His wife Anne Hutton Leadbetter (d.1912) lies with him.

==Family==

He married Anne Hutton Leadbetter in 1857.

Their children included the marine biologist William Leadbetter Calderwood FRSE (1865–1950).

<text>George Scarborough (October 2, 1859 – April 5, 1900) was a cowboy and lawman who lived during the time of the Wild West. He is best known for having killed outlaw John Selman, killer of John Wesley Hardin, and for his partnership with lawman Jeff Milton, with the pair bringing down several outlaws during their time together.

==Early life, controversial killing==
Scarborough was born in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. His family moved to Texas, where for a while he worked as a cowboy. In 1885, he was appointed sheriff for Jones County. He would later work as a Deputy US Marshal in and around El Paso, Texas. On June 21, 1895, while working alongside El Paso police chief Jeff Milton, Scarborough shot and killed Martin M&#x27;Rose, a Texas rustler. M&#x27;Rose is buried near John Wesley Hardin, and Texas Ranger Ernest St. Leon. Jeff Milton was Chief of Police in El Paso at that time, and Scarborough was a US Marshal. M&#x27;Rose had been captured, and was killed while being brought back from Mexico by the two lawmen on an outstanding warrant. Outlaw, gunman and paramour of Mrs. M&#x27;Rose, John Wesley Hardin, claimed that he had paid Scarborough and Milton to kill Martin M&#x27;Rose. Milton and Scarborough were arrested, but Hardin later withdrew his comments and the men were released.

Scarborough became well known for his unusual tactics when tracking a wanted outlaw. Often, he would drop himself down to the level of those he was pursuing. This tactic was extremely effective, and made him a hated and feared man among the outlaw element. There are many accusations that he was actively and ambitiously involved in outlaw gangs which he betrayed, but no one ever conclusively proved he was involved in unlawful actions. In July, 1898, Scarborough and Milton tracked, shot and captured outlaw &quot;Bronco Bill&quot; Walters, killing another member of Walters&#x27; gang, and scattering the rest from their hideout near Solomonville, Arizona. In late 1899 and into 1900, Scarborough pursued the Burt Alvord gang. The beginning of the gang&#x27;s end came during a February 15, 1900, gunfight between five of the gang members and Jeff Milton in Fairbank, Arizona, during which gang member &quot;Three Fingered Jack&quot; Dunlop was killed, and both gang member Bravo Juan Yaos as well as Milton were wounded.

==Killing of John Selman==
Scarborough had long feuded with lawman/outlaw Old John Selman. On April 5, 1894, acting as Constable of El Paso Selman shot and killed Scarborough&#x27;s close friend and former Texas Ranger Bass Outlaw. Selman was tried for the killing and found not guilty.

In reality, Bass Outlaw was not innocent in his own death. Intoxicated, he threatened to kill a local judge and was ordered by Selman to return home and sleep off his intoxication. Outlaw instead visited a brothel then a saloon. He argued with Texas Ranger Joe McKirdict, who attempted to talk him into leaving. Outlaw shot and killed Ranger McKirdict, then turned on Selman, who engaged him in a gunfight. Selman was wounded twice in the thigh. Outlaw was killed. The killing was found justified by the court.

On August 19, 1895, John Selman murdered John Wesley Hardin at the &quot;Acme Saloon Bar&quot; in El Paso. 

In 1896, on the second anniversary of his friend Outlaw&#x27;s death, Scarborough supposedly called Selman into the alley behind the &quot;Wigwam Saloon&quot; where two men argued and fought. Scarborough claimed both drew their guns so he fatally shot Selman; however, no gun was found on Selman&#x27;s body. Later a thief who claimed to have stolen Selman&#x27;s gun immediately after the gun fight was arrested before Scarborough&#x27;s trial. 

Scarborough was acquitted. He then moved to Deming, New Mexico, where he worked as a gunman for the Grant County Cattlemen&#x27;s Association. He was also associated with the arrest of Pearl Hart.

==Death==
On April 1, 1900, Scarborough was involved in a shootout with George Stevenson and James Brooks. He killed one of the men but was shot in the leg and was taken back to Deming where the leg was amputated. He died four days later – coincidentally six years to the day after the death of his friend Texas Ranger Bass Outlaw, and four years after he shot Outlaw&#x27;s killer, John Selman. An alternate story claims that on April 5, 1900, Scarborough and Walter Birchfield were tracking Harvey Logan (aka &quot;Kid Curry&quot;) near San Simon, Arizona, and trapped him near the Triangle Canyon. A gunfight ensued, in which Scarborough was mortally wounded by Curry.

<text>Weight loss, in the context of medicine, health, or physical fitness, refers to a reduction of the total body mass, by a mean loss of fluid, body fat (adipose tissue), or lean mass (namely bone mineral deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue). Weight loss can either occur unintentionally because of malnourishment or an underlying disease, or from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state. &quot;Unexplained&quot; weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or increase in exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition.
== Intentional ==
Intentional weight loss is the loss of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change appearance through slimming. Weight loss is the main treatment for obesity, and there is substantial evidence this can prevent progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes with a 7–10% weight loss and manage cardiometabolic health for diabetic people with a 5–15% weight loss.

Weight loss in individuals who are overweight or obese can reduce health risks, increase fitness, and may delay the onset of diabetes. It could reduce pain and increase movement in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Weight loss can lead to a reduction in hypertension (high blood pressure), however whether this reduces hypertension-related harm is unclear. Weight loss is achieved by adopting a lifestyle in which fewer calories are consumed than are expended. Depression, stress or boredom may contribute to unwanted weight gain or loss depending on the individual, and in these cases, individuals are advised to seek medical help. A 2010 study found that dieters who got a full night&#x27;s sleep lost more than twice as much fat as sleep-deprived dieters. Though hypothesized that supplementation of vitamin D may help, studies do not support this. The majority of dieters regain weight over the long term. According to the UK National Health Service and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, those who achieve and manage a healthy weight do so most successfully by being careful to consume just enough calories to meet their needs, and being physically active.

For weight loss to be permanent, changes in diet and lifestyle must be permanent as well. There is evidence that counseling or exercise alone do not result in weight loss, whereas dieting alone results in meaningful long-term weight loss, and a combination of dieting and exercise provides the best results. Meal replacements, orlistat, a very-low-calorie diet, and primary care intensive medical interventions can also support meaningful weight loss.

=== Techniques ===

==== Diet and exercise ====
The least intrusive weight loss methods, and those most often recommended, are adjustments to eating patterns and increased physical activity, generally in the form of exercise. The World Health Organization recommends that people combine a reduction of processed foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt, and reduced caloric intake with an increase in physical activity. Both long-term exercise programs and anti-obesity medications reduce abdominal fat volume.
Self-monitoring of diet, exercise, and weight are beneficial strategies for weight loss, particularly early in weight loss programs. Research indicates that those who log their foods about three times per day and about 20 times per month are more likely to achieve clinically significant weight loss.

Permanent weight loss depends on maintaining a negative energy balance and not the type of macronutrients (such as carbohydrate) consumed. High protein diets have shown greater efficacy in the short term (under 12 months) for people eating &quot;ad libitum&quot; due to increased thermogenesis and satiety, however this effect tends to dissipate over time.

==== Hydration ====
Increasing water intake can reduce weight by increasing thermogenesis, by reducing food intake, and by increasing fat oxidation. Persons dieting for weight loss have demonstrated the weight-reducing effects of increased water consumption. Among adults in the U.S. there is a significant association between inadequate hydration and obesity.

==== Medications ====

Other methods of weight loss include use of anti-obesity drugs that decrease appetite, block fat absorption, or reduce stomach volume. Obesity has been resistant to drug-based therapies, with a 2021 review stating that existing medications are &quot;often delivering insufficient efficacy and dubious safety&quot;. Semaglutide has also become popular recently as an aid in weight loss. It is particularly beneficial for those with type 2 diabetes and obesity.

==== Bariatric surgery ====
Bariatric surgery may be indicated in cases of severe obesity. Two common bariatric surgical procedures are gastric bypass and gastric banding. Both can be effective at limiting the intake of food energy by reducing the size of the stomach, but as with any surgical procedure both come with their own risks that should be considered in consultation with a physician.

=== Weight loss industry ===
There is a substantial market for products which claim to make weight loss easier, quicker, cheaper, more reliable, or less painful. These include books, DVDs, CDs, cremes, lotions, pills, rings and earrings, body wraps, body belts and other materials, fitness centers, clinics, personal coaches, weight loss groups, and food products and supplements. Dietary supplements, though widely used, are not considered a healthy option for weight loss, and have no clinical evidence of efficacy. Herbal products have not been shown to be effective.

In 2008, between US$33 billion and $55 billion was spent annually in the US on weight-loss products and services, including medical procedures and pharmaceuticals, with weight-loss centers taking between 6 and 12 percent of total annual expenditure. Over $1.6 billion per year was spent on weight-loss supplements. About 70 percent of Americans&#x27; dieting attempts are of a self-help nature.

In Western Europe, sales of weight-loss products, excluding prescription medications, topped €1,25 billion (£900 million/$1.4 billion) in 2009.

The scientific soundness of commercial diets by commercial weight management organizations varies widely, being previously non-evidence-based, so there is only limited evidence supporting their use, because of high attrition rates. Commercial diets result in modest weight loss in the long term, with similar results regardless of the brand, and similarly to non-commercial diets and standard care. Comprehensive diet programs, providing counseling and targets for calorie intake, are more efficient than dieting without guidance (&quot;self-help&quot;), although the evidence is very limited. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence devised a set of essential criteria to be met by commercial weight management organizations to be approved.

== Unintentional ==
=== Characteristics ===
Unintentional weight loss may result from loss of body fats, loss of body fluids, muscle atrophy, or a combination of these. It is generally regarded as a medical problem when at least 10% of a person&#x27;s body weight has been lost in six months or 5% in the last month. Another criterion used for assessing weight that is too low is the body mass index (BMI). However, even lesser amounts of weight loss can be a cause for serious concern in a frail elderly person.

Unintentional weight loss can occur because of an inadequately nutritious diet relative to a person&#x27;s energy needs (generally called malnutrition). Disease processes, changes in metabolism, hormonal changes, medications or other treatments, disease- or treatment-related dietary changes, or reduced appetite associated with a disease or treatment can also cause unintentional weight loss. Poor nutrient utilization can lead to weight loss, and can be caused by fistulae in the gastrointestinal tract, diarrhea, drug-nutrient interaction, enzyme depletion and muscle atrophy.

Continuing weight loss may deteriorate into wasting, a vaguely defined condition called &quot;cachexia&quot;. Cachexia differs from starvation in part because it involves a systemic inflammatory response. It is associated with poorer outcomes. In the advanced stages of progressive disease, metabolism can change so that they lose weight even when they are getting what is normally regarded as adequate nutrition and the body cannot compensate. This leads to a condition called anorexia cachexia syndrome (ACS) and additional nutrition or supplementation is unlikely to help. Symptoms of weight loss from ACS include severe weight loss from muscle rather than body fat, loss of appetite and feeling full after eating small amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness and fatigue.

Serious weight loss may reduce quality of life, impair treatment effectiveness or recovery, worsen disease processes and be a risk factor for high mortality rates. Malnutrition can affect every function of the human body, from the cells to the most complex body functions, including:
* immune response;
* wound healing;
* muscle strength (including respiratory muscles);
* renal capacity and depletion leading to water and electrolyte disturbances;
* thermoregulation; and
* menstruation.

Malnutrition can lead to vitamin and other deficiencies and to inactivity, which in turn may pre-dispose to other problems, such as pressure sores. Unintentional weight loss can be the characteristic leading to diagnosis of diseases such as cancer and type 1 diabetes. In the UK, up to 5% of the general population is underweight, but more than 10% of those with lung or gastrointestinal diseases and who have recently had surgery. According to data in the UK using the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (&#x27;MUST&#x27;), which incorporates unintentional weight loss, more than 10% of the population over the age of 65 is at risk of malnutrition. A high proportion (10–60%) of hospital patients are also at risk, along with a similar proportion in care homes.

=== Causes ===

==== Disease-related ====
Disease-related malnutrition can be considered in four categories:

Weight loss issues related to specific diseases include:
* As chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) advances, about 35% of patients experience severe weight loss called pulmonary cachexia, including diminished muscle mass. Around 25% experience moderate to severe weight loss, and most others have some weight loss. Greater weight loss is associated with poorer prognosis. Theories about contributing factors include appetite loss related to reduced activity, additional energy required for breathing, and the difficulty of eating with dyspnea (labored breathing).
* Cancer, a very common and sometimes fatal cause of unexplained (idiopathic) weight loss. About one-third of unintentional weight loss cases are secondary to malignancy. Cancers to suspect in patients with unexplained weight loss include gastrointestinal, prostate, hepatobiliary (hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer), ovarian, hematologic or lung malignancies.
* People with HIV often experience weight loss, and it is associated with poorer outcomes. Wasting syndrome is an AIDS-defining condition.
* Gastrointestinal disorders are another common cause of unexplained weight loss – in fact they are the most common non-cancerous cause of idiopathic weight loss. Possible gastrointestinal etiologies of unexplained weight loss include: celiac disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis), pancreatitis, gastritis, diarrhea, chronic mesenteric ischemia and many other GI conditions.
* Infection. Some infectious diseases can cause weight loss. Fungal illnesses, endocarditis, many parasitic diseases, AIDS, Whipple&#x27;s disease and some other subacute or occult infections may cause weight loss.
* Renal disease. Patients who have uremia often have poor or absent appetite, vomiting and nausea. This can cause weight loss.
* Cardiac disease. Cardiovascular disease, especially congestive heart failure, may cause unexplained weight loss.
* Connective tissue disease
* Oral, taste or dental problems (including infections) can reduce nutrient intake leading to weight loss.

==== Therapy-related ====
Medical treatment can directly or indirectly cause weight loss, impairing treatment effectiveness and recovery that can lead to further weight loss in a vicious cycle. Many patients will be in pain and have a loss of appetite after surgery. Part of the body&#x27;s response to surgery is to direct energy to wound healing, which increases the body&#x27;s overall energy requirements. Surgery affects nutritional status indirectly, particularly during the recovery period, as it can interfere with wound healing and other aspects of recovery. Surgery directly affects nutritional status if a procedure permanently alters the digestive system. Enteral nutrition (tube feeding) is often needed. However a policy of &#x27;nil by mouth&#x27; for all gastrointestinal surgery has not been shown to benefit, with some weak evidence suggesting it might hinder recovery. Early post-operative nutrition is a part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols. These protocols also include carbohydrate loading in the 24 hours before surgery, but earlier nutritional interventions have not been shown to have a significant impact.

==== Social conditions ====
Social conditions such as poverty, social isolation and inability to get or prepare preferred foods can cause unintentional weight loss, and this may be particularly common in older people. Nutrient intake can also be affected by culture, family and belief systems. Ill-fitting dentures and other dental or oral health problems can also affect adequacy of nutrition.

Loss of hope, status or social contact and spiritual distress can cause depression, which may be associated with reduced nutrition, as can fatigue.

== Myths ==
Some popular beliefs attached to weight loss have been shown to either have less effect on weight loss than commonly believed or are actively unhealthy. According to Harvard Health, the idea of metabolic rate being the &quot;key to weight&quot; is &quot;part truth and part myth&quot; as while metabolism does affect weight loss, external forces such as diet and exercise have an equal effect. They also commented that the idea of changing one&#x27;s rate of metabolism is under debate. Diet plans in fitness magazines are also often believed to be effective but may actually be harmful by limiting the daily intake of important calories and nutrients which can be detrimental depending on the person and are even capable of driving individuals away from weight loss.

== Health effects ==
Obesity is a risk factor for certain conditions, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Reduction of obesity lowers those risks. A loss of body weight has been associated with an approximate drop in blood pressure. Intentional weight loss is associated with cognitive performance improvements in overweight and obese individuals.

<text>George Montagu (1753 – 20 June 1815) was a British military officer and ornithologist. He was known for his pioneering &quot;Ornithological Dictionary&quot; of 1802, which for the first time accurately defined the status of Britain&#x27;s birds. He is remembered today for species such as the Montagu&#x27;s harrier, named after him.

==Life and work==
George Montagu was born to James Montagu (1713–1790), who was great-great-grandson of Lord James Montagu (d. 1665), who was younger son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester.

Montagu is best known for his &quot;Ornithological Dictionary&quot; (1802) and his contributions to early knowledge of British birds. He showed that many previously accepted species were invalid, either because they were birds in summer or winter plumage or males and females of the same species. His study of harriers resulted in the discovery that the Montagu&#x27;s harrier was breeding in southern England. He was also involved in the first British records of cirl bunting, whose breeding range in England is around his home in Devon, as well as of cattle egret, little gull and gull-billed tern, and the discovery and description of the roseate tern.

He was born at the family home of Lackham House in Wiltshire, some three miles south of Chippenham in the northwest of that county, and baptised at Lacock Church on 9 July 1753. In 1770 he joined the army as an Ensign in the 15th Regiment of Foot. He resigned his commission as a captain in 1777, but eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Wiltshire Militia. In August 1773 he married Ann Courtenay, niece of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. They settled at Alderton House in Wiltshire. In 1798 Montagu left his wife and moved to Prospect House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was here that he wrote his two-volume &quot;Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds&quot;. He subsequently entered a relationship with Elizabeth Dorville (daughter of Georg Wolff), who worked with him illustrating several of his scientific articles. They went on to have four children together.

Montagu had an interest in marine and freshwater natural history, and in 1803 published his &quot;Testacea Britannica, a History of British Marine, Land and Freshwater Shells&quot;. This described 470 species of molluscs, 100 of which were new to the British list, and many of which would later be classified as foraminifera. He supplied some new species of crustacean to William Elford Leach at the British Museum, and recorded some species of fish for the first time in English waters, as well as discovering new species including Montagu&#x27;s blenny and Montagu&#x27;s snapper (Lutjanidae). He also described the lesser horseshoe bat for the first time. Montagu&#x27;s ray, Montagu&#x27;s sucker and Montagu&#x27;s sea snail are also named after him.

He died of tetanus after stepping on a nail at Knowle House. He was buried at Kingsbridge Parish Church. Montagu&#x27;s collection of birds was bought by the British Museum, about 200 of which are now housed at the Tring Museum. His annotated copies of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Testacea&quot; were bequeathed to the Linnean Society. Montagu&#x27;s shell collection is held by the Royal Albert Memorial Museum &amp; Art Gallery in Exeter and the Natural History Museum in London.

<text>Harry Alonzo Longabaugh (1867 – November 7, 1908), better known as the Sundance Kid, was an outlaw and member of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch in the American Old West. He likely met Butch Cassidy (real name Robert LeRoy Parker) during a hunting trip in 1883 or earlier. The gang performed the longest string of successful train and bank robberies in American history.

Longabaugh fled the United States along with his consort Etta Place and Butch Cassidy to escape the dogged pursuit of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. The trio fled first to Argentina and then to Bolivia, where most historians believe Parker (Cassidy) and Longabaugh were killed in a shootout in November 1908.

== Early life ==
Longabaugh was born in Mont Clare, Pennsylvania, in 1867 to Pennsylvania natives Josiah and Annie G. () Longabaugh, the youngest of five children. At age 15, he traveled west in a covered wagon with his cousin George to help settle George&#x27;s homestead near Cortez, Colorado. While there, he found work as a wrangler at a neighboring ranch, and he learned to buy and breed horses. He left Cortez in 1886 and struck out on his own, drifting north and working on ranches. He found work on the N Bar N Ranch in Montana Territory, but the hard winter of 1886–1887 forced the ranch to lay off wranglers, including Longabaugh. Longabaugh drifted to the Black Hills before turning back to try to find work again at the N Bar N.

== Career ==
In 1887, while traveling across the Three V Ranch near Sundance, Wyoming, he stole a gun, horse, and saddle from a cowboy. He was captured by authorities in Miles City, Montana, and sentenced to 18 months in jail by Judge William L. Maginnis. He adopted the nickname &quot;Sundance Kid&quot; during this time in jail, having derived it from the Wyoming town of the same name and the fact that he left home at the age of 15. After his release, he went back to working as a ranch hand, and he worked at the Bar U Ranch in the North-West Territories of Canada in 1891, which was one of the largest commercial ranches of the time. He became joint owner of a saloon in the Grand Central Hotel in Calgary, but after quarreling with his partner, he headed south to Montana again. There, he took another job with the N Bar N and began rustling cattle and horses in Montana and Canada.

Longabaugh was suspected of taking part in a train robbery in 1892 and a bank robbery in 1897 with five other men. He became associated with a group known as the Wild Bunch, which included Robert Leroy Parker, better known as Butch Cassidy. Longabaugh was reportedly fast with a gun and was often referred to as a gunfighter. He became better known than Kid Curry, a member of his gang whose real name was Harvey Logan; Curry killed numerous men while with the gang. Longabaugh did participate in a shootout with lawmen who trailed a gang led by George Curry to the Hole-in-the-Wall hideout in Wyoming, and he was thought to have wounded two men in that shootout. Several people were killed by members of the gang, including five law enforcement officers killed by Logan. &quot;Wanted dead or alive&quot; posters were posted throughout the country, with rewards of as much as $30,000 for information leading to their capture or deaths.

Longabaugh and Logan used a log cabin at Old Trail Town in Cody, Wyoming, as a hide-out, as they planned to rob a bank in Red Lodge, Montana. They then began hiding out at Hole-in-the-Wall, located near Kaycee, Wyoming. From there, they could strike and retreat with little fear of capture, since it was situated on high ground with a view of the surrounding territory in all directions. Pinkerton detectives led by Charlie Siringo, however, hounded the gang for a few years.

== Escape to South America ==

Cassidy and Longabaugh fled to New York City, feeling continuous pressure from the numerous law enforcement agencies pursuing them and seeing their gang falling apart. They departed from there to Buenos Aires, Argentina, aboard the British steamer &quot;Herminius&quot; on February 20, 1901, along with Longabaugh&#x27;s companion Etta Place. Cassidy posed as James Ryan, Place&#x27;s fictitious brother. They settled in a four-room log cabin on a ranch that they purchased on the east bank of the Rio Blanco near Cholila, just east of the Andes in Chubut.

Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s &quot;In Patagonia&quot; references a letter Butch wrote from Cholila to Elzy Lay&#x27;s mother-in-law in Utah, dated August 10, 1902. The letter cites &quot;our little family of 3&quot; living in a 4 room house with 300 cattle, 1500 sheep, and 28 horses. Chatwin states the letter resides with the Utah State Historical Society.

=== 1905 ===
Two English-speaking bandits held up the Banco de Tarapacá y Argentino in Río Gallegos on February 14, 1905, south of Cholila near the Strait of Magellan, and the pair vanished north across the Patagonian grasslands. The pair might have been Cassidy and Longabaugh.

Fearing that law enforcement had located them, Cassidy and Longabaugh sold the Cholila ranch on May 1, 1905. The Pinkerton Agency had known their location for some time, but the snow and the hard winter of Patagonia had prevented their agent Frank Dimaio from making an arrest. Governor Julio Lezana issued an arrest warrant, but Sheriff Edward Humphreys, a Welsh-Argentine who was friendly with Cassidy and enamored of Place, tipped them off. The trio then fled north to San Carlos de Bariloche, where they embarked on the steamer &quot;Condor&quot; across Nahuel Huapí Lake and into Chile; they returned to Argentina by the end of the year.

A man going under the name Frank Boyd, who was in reality Sundance/Longabaugh, killed a police officer on August 21, 1905 in a shootout at the port town of Antofagasta, Chile. He was released on a bond (equivalent to US$50,000 in 2022) and then, assisted by the US vice-consul in Antofagasta, fled to Argentina and finally Bolivia. This was not known until 2022, when the old Antofagasta &quot;El Industrial&quot; newspaper was digitized. Cassidy, Longabaugh, Place, and an unknown male associate robbed the Banco de la Nación Argentina branch in Villa Mercedes, San Luis Province on December 19, 1905, which is west of Buenos Aires, taking 12,000 pesos. They fled across the Andes to reach the safety of Chile.

On June 30, 1906, Place decided that she had enough of life on the run, so Longabaugh took her back to San Francisco. Cassidy obtained honest work under the alias James &quot;Santiago&quot; Maxwell at the Concordia Tin Mine in the Santa Vera Cruz range of the central Bolivian Andes, where Longabaugh joined him upon his return. Their main duties included guarding the company payroll. The two traveled to Santa Cruz in late 1907, a frontier town in Bolivia&#x27;s eastern savannah, still wanting to settle down as respectable ranchers.

== Death ==
A courier was carrying the payroll for the Aramayo Franke and Cia Silver Mine on November 3, 1908, near the small mining town of San Vicente in southern Bolivia, when he was attacked by two masked American bandits believed to be Cassidy and Longabaugh. Witnesses saw them three days later in San Vicente, where they lodged in a small boarding house owned by miner Bonifacio Casasola. Casasola became suspicious of them because they had a mule from the Aramayo Mine, identifiable from the company&#x27;s brand. He notified a nearby telegraph officer, who notified the Abaroa cavalry regiment stationed nearby. The unit dispatched three soldiers under the command of Captain Justo Concha, and they notified the local authorities.

The soldiers, the police chief, the local mayor, and some of his officials all surrounded the lodging house on the evening of November 6, intending to arrest the Aramayo robbers. As they approached the house, the bandits opened fire, killing one of the soldiers and wounding another and starting a gunfight which lasted for several hours into the evening and the night. At around 2:00 am, during a lull in the fighting, the mayor heard a man scream three times inside the house, then two successive shots were fired from inside the house.

The authorities entered the house the next morning, where they found two bodies with numerous bullet wounds to the arms and legs. The man assumed to be Longabaugh had a bullet wound in the forehead, and the man thought to be Cassidy had a bullet hole in the temple. The local police report speculated that judging from the positions of the bodies, Cassidy had probably shot the fatally wounded Longabaugh to put him out of his misery, then killed himself with his final bullet. The Tupiza police identified the bandits as the men who robbed the Aramayo payroll transport, but the Bolivian authorities did not know their real names, nor could they positively identify them.

The two bodies were buried at the small San Vicente cemetery, near the grave of a German miner named Gustav Zimmer. American forensic anthropologist Clyde Snow and his researchers attempted to find the graves in 1991, but they did not find any remains with DNA matching the living relatives of Cassidy and Longabaugh. Snow&#x27;s search formed the basis of the British documentary &quot;Wanted - Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (Channel 4, April 22, 1993; later screened on &quot;Nova&quot;, October 12, 1993).

In 2017, a new search was launched for Cassidy&#x27;s grave, which zeroed in on a mine outside Goodsprings, Nevada. The dig found human remains, but they did not match the DNA provided.

=== Rumors of survival ===

Some have claimed that one or both men survived and returned to the United States. One of these claims was that Longabaugh lived under the name of William Henry Long in the small town of Duchesne, Utah. Long died in 1936, and his remains were exhumed in December 2008 and subjected to DNA testing. Anthropologist John McCullough stated Long&#x27;s remains did not match the DNA which they had obtained &quot;from a distant relative of the Sundance Kid.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
* Arthur Kennedy portrayed the Sundance Kid in the 1947 film &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Wyoming Kid&quot;).
* Longabaugh was portrayed by Robert Ryan in the 1948 film &quot;Return of the Bad Men&quot;, although the film is inaccurate in a number of points, not least of which are the cold-blooded killings by the character and his death at the end of the movie.
* He was depicted as a character in the 1951 film &quot;The Texas Rangers&quot; played by Ian MacDonald. The fictional tale has real-life outlaws Sam Bass, John Wesley Hardin, Butch Cassidy and Dave Rudabaugh and him forming a gang, then squaring off against two convicts recruited by John B. Jones to bring them to justice.
* He was portrayed by Alan Hale, Jr. in the 1956 film &quot;The Three Outlaws&quot;, with Neville Brand as Butch Cassidy.
* Scott Brady played him in the 1956 film &quot;The Maverick Queen&quot;.
* Robert Redford played him in the 1969 film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. Redford named the Sundance Film Festival after the Sundance Kid.
* Elizabeth Montgomery played his fugitive girlfriend in the 1974 film &quot;Mrs. Sundance&quot;.
* William Katt portrayed the Sundance Kid and Tom Berenger played Butch in &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot; (1979).
* Padraic Delaney portrayed him in the 2011 film &quot;Blackthorn&quot;.
* He is an antagonist in the video game &quot;Call of Juarez: Gunslinger&quot; (2013).
* Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid are supporting characters in the &quot;Drifters&quot; manga series by Kouta Hirano.

<doc id="400222" wikidata="Q2291413" url="?curid=400222" title="List of English words of Dutch origin">
<text>This is an incomplete list of Dutch expressions used in English; some are relatively common (e.g. &quot;cookie&quot;), some are comparatively rare. In a survey by Joseph M. Williams in &quot;Origins of the English Language&quot; it is estimated that about 1% of English words are of Dutch origin.

In many cases the loanword has assumed a meaning substantially different from its Dutch forebear. Some English words have been borrowed directly from Dutch. But typically, English spellings of Dutch loanwords suppress combinations of vowels of the original word which do not exist in English and replace them with existing vowel combinations respectively. For example, the oe in &quot;koekje&quot; or &quot;koekie&quot; becomes oo in &quot;cookie&quot;, the ij (considered a vowel in Dutch) and the ui in &quot;vrijbuiter&quot; becomes ee and oo in &quot;freebooter&quot;, the aa in &quot;baas&quot; becomes o in &quot;boss&quot;, the oo in &quot;stoof&quot; becomes o in &quot;stove&quot;.

As languages, English and Dutch are both West Germanic, and descend further back from the common ancestor language Proto-Germanic. Their relationship however, has been obscured by the lexical influence of Old Norse as a consequence of Viking expansion from the 9th till the 11th century, and Norman French, as a consequence of the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Because of their close common relationship - in addition to the large Latin and French vocabulary both languages possess - many English words are essentially identical to their Dutch lexical counterparts, either in spelling (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;begin&quot;, &quot;fruit&quot;), pronunciation (&quot;pool&quot; = &quot;pole&quot;, &quot;boek&quot; = &quot;book&quot;, &quot;diep&quot; = &quot;deep&quot;), or both (&quot;offer&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, &quot;lip&quot;) or as false friends (&quot;ramp&quot; = &quot;disaster&quot;, &quot;roof&quot; = &quot;robbery&quot;, &quot;mop&quot; = &quot;joke&quot;). These cognates or in other ways related words are excluded from this list.

Dutch expressions have been incorporated into English usage for many reasons and in different periods in time. These are some of the most common ones:

== From Old Dutch ==
* Many Latinate words in the English lexicon were borrowed from Latin. Quite a few of these words can further trace their origins back to a Germanic source - usually Old Low Franconian. Old Dutch is the western variant of this language. In cases it is not clear whether the loanword is from Old Dutch (Old West Low Franconian) or another Germanic language, they have been excluded from the list. &quot;See also: List of English Latinates of Germanic origin&quot;
* Since speakers of West Germanic languages spoken along the North Sea coast from the 5th to the 9th century lived close enough together to form a linguistic crossroads - water was the main way of transportation - Dutch and English share some traits that other West Germanic languages do not possess. Lexical examples are Dutch &quot;vijf&quot; / English &quot;five&quot; (compare German: &quot;Fünf&quot;) and Dutch &quot;leef&quot; / English &quot;live&quot; (compare German &quot;Leben&quot;). These words have been excluded from the list. &quot;See also: Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law&quot;
* Since the Norman conquest of 1066 many Latinate words entered the English lexicon via French, which has – via Old French – a substantial base of Old Dutch (or Old Low Franconian) and Middle Dutch. For instance, French &quot;boulevard&quot; comes from Dutch &quot;bolwerk&quot;. In cases it is not clear whether the loanword in French is from Dutch or another Germanic language, they have been excluded from the list. &quot;See also: Influence of Franconian language on French&quot;
For some loanwords stemming from this period it is not always clear whether they are of Old Dutch, Old Norse, another Germanic language or an unknown Old English origin. These words have been excluded from the list, or indicated as such.

== From Middle Dutch ==
* About one-third of the invading Norman army of 1066 came from Dutch speaking Flemish. Many Flemings stayed in England after the Conquest and influenced the English language.
* The main part of refugees to England, Wales and Scotland from the 11th till the 17th century were from the Low Countries; particularly Flemish skilled weavers and textile workers immigrated as a result of floods, overpopulation and warfare in Flanders. In 1527, when England&#x27;s population numbered 5 million, London alone had tens of thousands of Flemings, while an estimated third of the Scottish population has a Flemish background.
The Hanseatic League had in the late Middle Ages a trade network along the coast of Northern Europe and England, using to Dutch related Middle Low German as lingua franca. Some loanwords from this period could come from either language. These words have been excluded from the list, or indicated as such.

== From Modern Dutch ==
* In the Dutch Golden Age, spanning most of the 17th century, Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world, and many English words of Dutch origin concerning these areas are stemming from this period.
* English and Dutch rivalry at sea resulted in many Dutch naval terms in English.
* Via settlements in North America and elsewhere in the world Dutch language influenced English spoken there, particularly American English. That resulted also in numerous place names based on Dutch words and places. These are excluded from the list unless they are well known, like &quot;Brooklyn&quot; (from the Dutch town &quot;Breukelen&quot;) and &quot;Wall Street&quot; (from Dutch &quot;Walstraat&quot;). &quot;See also: List of place names of Dutch origin&quot;
* Due to contact between Afrikaans and English speakers in South Africa, many Dutch words entered English via Afrikaans, which has an estimated 90 to 95% vocabulary of Dutch origin. Only the words that entered &quot;standard&quot; English are listed here. Afrikaans words that do not stem from Cape Dutch but from an African, Indian or other European language, are not listed here. &quot;See also: List of English words of Afrikaans origin and List of South African slang words&quot;

; Yacht : from Dutch &quot;jacht&quot;, short for &quot;jachtschip&quot; (literally &quot;hunting ship&quot;)
; Yankee : from &quot;Jan Kees&quot;, a personal name, originally used mockingly to describe pro-French revolutionary citizens, with allusion to the small keeshond dog, then for &quot;colonials&quot; in New Amsterdam. This is not the only possible etymology for the word yankee, however; the Oxford English Dictionary has quotes with the term from as early as 1765, quite some time before the French Revolution. Nowadays it commonly refers to Americans from the United States.

<doc id="400223" wikidata="Q1107856" url="?curid=400223" title="Cold seep">
<text>A cold seep (sometimes called a cold vent) is an area of the ocean floor where seepage of fluids rich in hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other hydrocarbons occurs, often in the form of a brine pool. &quot;Cold&quot; does not mean that the temperature of the seepage is lower than that of the surrounding sea water; on the contrary, its temperature is often slightly higher. The &quot;cold&quot; is relative to the very warm (at least ) conditions of a hydrothermal vent. Cold seeps constitute a biome supporting several endemic species.

Cold seeps develop unique topography over time, where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs. These reactions may also be dependent on bacterial activity. Ikaite, a hydrous calcium carbonate, can be associated with oxidizing methane at cold seeps.

== Types ==


Types of cold seeps can be distinguished according to the depth, as shallow cold seeps and deep cold seeps. Cold seeps can also be distinguished in detail, as follows:

* oil/gas seeps
* gas seeps: methane seeps
* gas hydrate seeps
* brine seeps are formed in brine pools
* pockmarks
* mud volcanoes

== Formation and ecological succession ==

Cold seeps occur over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity. Oil and methane &quot;seep&quot; out of those fissures, get diffused by sediment, and emerge over an area several hundred meters wide.

Methane () is the main component of natural gas. But in addition to being an important energy source for humans, methane also forms the basis of a cold seep ecosystem. Cold seep biota below typically exhibit much greater systematic specialization and reliance on chemoautotrophy than those from shelf depths. Deep-sea seeps sediments are highly heterogeneous. They sustain different geochemical and microbial processes that are reflected in a complex mosaic of habitats inhabited by a mixture of specialist (heterotrophic and symbiont-associated) and background fauna.
=== Chemosynthetic communities ===

Biological research in cold seeps and hydrothermal vents has been mostly focused on the microbiology and the prominent macro-invertebrates thriving on chemosynthetic microorganisms. Much less research has been done on the smaller benthic fraction at the size of the meiofauna (&lt;1 mm).

A community composition&#x27;s orderly shift from one set of species to another is called ecological succession.

The first type of organism to take advantage of this deep-sea energy source is bacteria. Aggregating into bacterial mats at cold seeps, these bacteria metabolize methane and hydrogen sulfide (another gas that emerges from seeps) for energy. This process of obtaining energy from chemicals is known as chemosynthesis.

During this initial stage, when methane is relatively abundant, dense mussel beds also form near the cold seep. Mostly composed of species in the genus &quot;Bathymodiolus&quot;, these mussels do not directly consume food; Instead, they are nourished by symbiotic bacteria that also produce energy from methane, similar to their relatives that form mats. Chemosynthetic bivalves are prominent constituents of the fauna of cold seeps and are represented in that setting by five families: Solemyidae, Lucinidae, Vesicomyidae, Thyasiridae, and Mytilidae.

This microbial activity produces calcium carbonate, which is deposited on the seafloor and forms a layer of rock. During a period lasting up to several decades, these rock formations attract siboglinid tubeworms, which settle and grow along with the mussels. Like the mussels, tubeworms rely on chemosynthetic bacteria (in this case, a type that needs hydrogen sulfide instead of methane) for survival. True to any symbiotic relationship, a tubeworm also provides for its bacteria by appropriating hydrogen sulfide from the environment. The sulfide not only comes from the water, but is also mined from the sediment through an extensive &quot;root&quot; system that a tubeworm &quot;bush&quot; establishes in the hard, carbonate substrate. A tubeworm bush can contain hundreds of individual worms, which can grow a meter or more above the sediment.

Cold seeps do not last indefinitely. As the rate of gas seepage slowly decreases, the shorter-lived, methane-hungry mussels (or more precisely, their methane-hungry bacterial symbionts) start to die off. At this stage, tubeworms become the dominant organism in a seep community. As long as there is some sulfide in the sediment, the sulfide-mining tubeworms can persist. Individuals of one tubeworm species &quot;Lamellibrachia luymesi&quot; have been estimated to live for over 250 years in such conditions.

=== The Benthic Filter ===
The organisms living at cold seeps have a large impact on the carbon cycle and on climate. Chemosynthetic organisms, specifically methanogenic (methane-consuming) organisms, prohibit the methane seeping up from beneath the seafloor from being released into the water above. Since methane is such a potent greenhouse gas, methane release could cause global warming when gas hydrate reservoirs destabilized. The consumption of methane by aerobic and anaerobic seafloor life is called &quot;the benthic filter&quot;. The first part of this filter is the anaerobic bacteria and archaea underneath the seafloor that consume methane through the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). If the flux of methane flowing through the sediment is too large, and the anaerobic bacteria and archaea are consuming the maximum amount of methane, then the excess methane is consumed by free-floating or symbiotic aerobic bacteria above the sediment at the seafloor. The symbiotic bacteria have been found in organisms such as tube worms and clams living at cold seeps; these organisms provide oxygen to the aerobic bacteria as the bacteria provide energy they obtain from the consumption of methane. Understanding how efficient the benthic filter is can help predict how much methane escapes the seafloor at cold seeps and enters the water column and eventually the atmosphere. Studies have shown that 50–90% of methane is consumed at cold seeps with bacterial mats. Areas with clam beds have less than 15% of methane escaping. Efficiency is determined by a number of factors. The benthic layer is more efficient with low flow of methane, and efficiency decreases as methane flow or the speed of flow increases. Oxygen demand for cold seep ecosystems is much higher than other benthic ecosystems, so if the bottom water does not have enough oxygen, then the efficiency of aerobic microbes in removing methane is reduced. The benthic filter cannot affect methane that is not traveling through the sediment. Methane can bypass the benthic filter if it bubbles to the surface or travels through cracks and fissures in the sediment. These organisms are the only biological sink of methane in the ocean.

=== Comparison with other communities ===


Cold seeps and hydrothermal vents of deep oceans are communities that do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production. These systems are largely driven by chemosynthetic derived energy. Both systems share common characteristics such as the presence of reduced chemical compounds (H2S and hydrocarbonates), local hypoxia or even anoxia, a high abundance and metabolic activity of bacterial populations, and the production of , organic material by chemoautotrophic bacteria. Both hydrothermal vents and cold seeps show highly increased levels of metazoan biomass in association with a low local diversity. This is explained through the presence of dense aggregations of foundation species and epizoic animals living within these aggregations. Community-level comparisons reveal that vent, seep, and organic-fall macrofauna are very distinct in terms of composition at the family level, although they share many dominant taxa among highly sulphidic habitats.

However, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps also differ in many ways. Compared to the more stable cold seeps, vents are characterized by locally-high temperatures, strongly fluctuating temperatures, pH, sulfide and oxygen concentrations, often the absence of sediments, a relatively young age, and often-unpredictable conditions, such as waxing and waning of vent fluids or volcanic eruptions. Unlike hydrothermal vents, which are volatile and ephemeral environments, cold seeps emit at a slow and dependable rate. Likely owing to the cooler temperatures and stability, many cold seep organisms are much longer-lived than those inhabiting hydrothermal vents.

=== End of cold seep community ===
Finally, as cold seeps become inactive, tubeworms also start to disappear, clearing the way for corals to settle on the now-exposed carbonate substrate. The corals do not rely on hydrocarbons seeping out of the seafloor. Studies on &quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot; suggest they derive their nutrition primarily from the ocean surface. Chemosynthesis plays only a very small role, if any, in their settlement and growth. While deepwater corals do not seem to be chemosynthesis-based organisms, the chemosynthetic organisms that come before them enable the corals&#x27; existence. This hypothesis about establishment of deep water coral reefs is called hydraulic theory.

== Distribution ==

Cold seeps were discovered in 1983 by Charles Paull and colleagues on the Florida Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico at a depth of . Since then, seeps have been discovered in many other parts of the world&#x27;s oceans. Most have been grouped into five biogeographic provinces: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Mediterranean, East Pacific, and West Pacific, but cold seeps are also known from under the ice shelf in Antarctica, the Arctic Ocean, the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat, the Gulf of California, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, off southern Australia, and in the inland Caspian Sea. In the Pacific Northwest, a cold seep called Pythia&#x27;s Oasis was discovered in 2015. With the recent discovery of a methane seep in the Southern Ocean, cold seeps are now known in all major oceans. Cold seeps are common along continental margins in areas of high primary productivity and tectonic activity, where crustal deformation and compaction drive emissions of methane-rich fluid. Cold seeps are patchily distributed, and they occur most frequently near ocean margins from intertidal to hadal depths. In Chile, cold seeps are known from the intertidal zone, in Kattegat, the methane seeps are known as &quot;bubbling reefs&quot; and are typically at depths of , and off northern California, they can be found as shallow as . Most cold seeps are located considerably deeper, well beyond the reach of ordinary scuba diving, and the deepest seep community known is found in the Japan Trench at a depth of .

In addition to cold seeps existing today, the fossil remains of ancient seep systems have been found in several parts of the world. Some of these are located far inland in places formerly covered by prehistoric oceans.

=== In the Gulf of Mexico ===

==== Discoveries ====

The chemosynthetic communities of the Gulf of Mexico have been studied extensively since the 1990s, and communities first discovered on the upper slope are likely the best understood seep communities in the world. The history of the discovery of these remarkable animals has all occurred since the 1980s. Each major discovery was unexpected―from the first hydrothermal vent communities anywhere in the world to the first cold seep communities in the Gulf of Mexico.

Communities were discovered in the eastern Gulf of Mexico in 1983 using the crewed submersible &quot;DSV Alvin&quot;, during a cruise investigating the bottom of the Florida Escarpment in areas of &quot;cold&quot; brine seepage, where they unexpectedly discovered tubeworms and mussels. Two groups fortuitously discovered chemosynthetic communities in the central Gulf of Mexico nearly concurrently in November and December 1984. During investigations in late December on the research vessel R/V &quot;Gyre&quot; cruise 84-G-12, by Texas A&amp;M University, two bottom trawls were conducted to determine the effects of oil seepage on benthic ecology (until this investigation, all effects of oil seepage were assumed to be detrimental). Trawls unexpectedly recovered extensive collections of chemosynthetic organisms, including tubeworms and clams. a month earlier, LGL Ecological Research Associates was conducting a research cruise as part of the multiyear MMS Northern Gulf of Mexico Continental Slope Study (Gallaway et al., 1988). Bottom photography as part of this project obtained images from the end of a film roll of a deep-sea camera sled (processed on board the vessel November 14, 1984) that resulted in clear images of vesicomyid clam chemosynthetic communities (Rossman et al., 1987) coincidentally in the same manner as the first documentation of chemosynthetic communities at the Galapagos Rift investigating hot water plumes by camera sled in the Pacific in 1976 (Lonsdale 1977). Photography during the same LGL/MMS cruise also documented tube-worm communities in situ in the Central Gulf of Mexico for the first time (not processed until after the cruise; Boland, 1986) prior to the initial submersible investigations and firsthand descriptions of Bush Hill () in 1986. The Bush Hill site was targeted by acoustic &quot;wipeout&quot; zones or lack of substrate structure caused by seeping hydrocarbons. This was determined using an acoustic pinger system during the same cruise on the R/V &quot;Edwin Link&quot; (renamed from &quot;Sea Diver&quot; and only 113 ft (34 m)), which used one of the &quot;Johnson Sea Link&quot; submersibles. This site represents the first eyes-on human observations of chemosynthetic communities in the northern Gulf of Mexico and is characterized by dense tubeworm and mussel accumulations, as well as exposed carbonate outcrops with numerous gorgonian and &quot;Lophelia&quot; coral colonies. Bush Hill has become one of the most thoroughly-studied chemosynthetic sites in the world.

==== Distribution ====

There is a clear relationship between known hydrocarbon discoveries at great depth in the Gulf slope and chemosynthetic communities, hydrocarbon seepage, and authigenic minerals including carbonates at the seafloor. While the hydrocarbon reservoirs are broad areas several kilometers beneath the Gulf, chemosynthetic communities occur in isolated areas with thin veneers of sediment only a few meters thick.

The northern Gulf of Mexico slope includes a stratigraphic section more than 10 km (6 mi) thick and has been profoundly influenced by salt movement. Mesozoic source rocks from Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous generate oil in most of the Gulf slope fields. Migration conduits supply fresh hydrocarbon materials through a vertical scale of 6–8 km (4–5 mi) toward the surface. The surface expressions of hydrocarbon migration are called seeps. Geological evidence demonstrates that hydrocarbon and brine seepage persists in spatially discrete areas for thousands of years.

The time scale for oil and gas migration from source systems is on the scale of millions of years (Sassen, 1997). Seepage from hydrocarbon sources through faults towards the surface tends to be diffused through the overlying sediment, carbonate outcroppings, and hydrate deposits, so the corresponding hydrocarbon seep communities tend to be larger (a few hundred meters wide) than chemosynthetic communities found around the hydrothermal vents of the Eastern Pacific (MacDonald, 1992). There are large differences in the concentrations of hydrocarbons at seep sites. Roberts (2001) presented a spectrum of responses to be expected under a variety of flux rate conditions varying from very slow seepage to rapid venting. Very-slow-seepage sites do not support complex chemosynthetic communities; rather, they usually only support simple microbial mats (&quot;Beggiatoa&quot; sp.).

In the upper slope environment, the hard substrates resulting from carbonate precipitation can have associated communities of non-chemosynthetic animals, including a variety of sessile cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones. At the rapid flux end of the spectrum, fluidized sediment generally accompanies hydrocarbons and formation fluids arriving at the seafloor. Mud volcanoes and mud flows result. Somewhere between these two end members exists the conditions that support densely populated and diverse communities of chemosynthetic organisms (microbial mats, siboglinid tube worms, bathymodioline mussels, lucinid and vesicomyid clams, and associated organisms). These areas are frequently associated with surface or near-surface gas hydrate deposits. They also have localized areas of lithified seafloor, generally authigenic carbonates but sometimes more exotic minerals such as barite are present.
The widespread nature of Gulf of Mexico chemosynthetic communities was first documented during contracted investigations by the Geological and Environmental Research Group (GERG) of Texas A&amp;M University for the Offshore Operators Committee. This survey remains the most widespread and comprehensive, although numerous additional communities have been documented since that time. Industry exploration for energy reserves in the Gulf of Mexico has also documented numerous new communities through a wide range of depths, including the deepest-known occurrence in the Central Gulf of Mexico in Alaminos Canyon Block 818 at a depth of 2,750 m (9,022 ft). The occurrence of chemosynthetic organisms dependent on hydrocarbon seepage has been documented in water depths as shallow as 290 m (951 ft) and as deep as 2,744 m (9,003 ft). This depth range specifically places chemosynthetic communities in the deepwater region of the Gulf of Mexico, which is defined as water depths greater than 305 m (1,000 ft).

Chemosynthetic communities are not found on the continental shelf, although they do appear in the fossil record in water shallower than 200 m (656 ft). One theory explaining this is that predation pressure has varied substantially over the time period involved (Callender and Powell 1999). More than 50 communities are now known to exist in 43 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) blocks. Although a systematic survey has not been done to identify all chemosynthetic communities in the Gulf of Mexico, there is evidence indicating that many more such communities may exist. The depth limits of discoveries probably reflect the limits of exploration (lack of submersibles capable of depths over 1,000 m (3,281 ft)).

MacDonald et al. (1993 and 1996) have analyzed remote-sensing images from space that reveal the presence of oil slicks across the north-central Gulf of Mexico. Results confirmed extensive natural oil seepage in the Gulf of Mexico, especially in water depths greater than 1,000 m (3,281 ft). A total of 58 additional potential locations were documented where seafloor sources were capable of producing perennial oil slicks. Estimated seepage rates ranged from to compared to less than for ship discharges (both normalized for 1,000 mi2 (640,000 ac)). This evidence considerably increases the area where chemosynthetic communities dependent on hydrocarbon seepage may be expected.

The densest aggregations of chemosynthetic organisms have been found at water depths of around 500 m (1,640 ft) and deeper. The best known of these communities was named Bush Hill by the investigators who first described it. It is a surprisingly large and dense community of chemosynthetic tube worms and mussels at a site of natural petroleum and gas seepage over a salt diapir in Green Canyon Block 185. The seep site is a small knoll that rises about 40 m (131 ft) above the surrounding seafloor in about 580-m (1,903-ft) water depth.

==== Stability ====

According to Sassen (1997) the role of hydrates at chemosynthetic communities has been greatly underestimated. The biological alteration of frozen gas hydrates was first discovered during the MMS study entitled &quot;Stability and Change in Gulf of Mexico Chemosynthetic Communities&quot;. It is hypothesized that the dynamics of hydrate alteration could play a major role as a mechanism for regulation of the release of hydrocarbon gases to fuel biogeochemical processes and could also play a substantial role in community stability. Recorded bottom-water temperature excursions of several degrees in some areas such as the Bush Hill site (4–5 °C at 500-m (1,640-ft) depth) are believed to result in dissociation of hydrates, resulting in an increase in gas fluxes (MacDonald et al., 1994). Although not as destructive as the volcanism at vent sites of the mid-ocean ridges, the dynamics of shallow hydrate formation and movement will clearly affect sessile animals that form part of the seepage barrier. There is potential of a catastrophic event where an entire layer of shallow hydrate could break free of the bottom and considerably affect local communities of chemosynthetic fauna. At deeper depths (&gt;1,000 m, &gt;3,281 ft), the bottom-water temperature is colder (by approximately 3 °C) and undergoes less fluctuation. The formation of more stable and probably-deeper hydrates influences the flux of light hydrocarbon gases to the sediment surface, thus influencing the surface morphology and characteristics of chemosynthetic communities. Within complex communities such as Bush Hill, petroleum seems less important than previously thought (MacDonald, 1998b).

Through taphonomic studies (death assemblages of shells) and interpretation of seep assemblage composition from cores, Powell et al. (1998) reported that, overall, seep communities were persistent over periods of 500–1,000 years and probably throughout the entire Pleistocene. Some sites retained optimal habitat over geological time scales. Powell reported evidence of mussel and clam communities persisting in the same sites for 500–4,000 years. Powell also found that both the composition of species and trophic tiering of hydrocarbon seep communities tend to be fairly constant across time, with temporal variations only in numerical abundance. He found few cases in which the community type changed (from mussel to clam communities, for example) or had disappeared completely. Faunal succession was not observed. Surprisingly, when recovery occurred after a past destructive event, the same chemosynthetic species reoccupied a site. There was little evidence of catastrophic burial events, but two instances were found in mussel communities in Green Canyon Block 234. The most notable observation reported by Powell (1995) was the uniqueness of each chemosynthetic community site.

Precipitation of authigenic carbonates and other geologic events will undoubtedly alter surface seepage patterns over periods of many years, although through direct observation, no changes in chemosynthetic fauna distribution or composition were observed at seven separate study sites (MacDonald et al., 1995). A slightly longer period (19 years) can be referenced in the case of Bush Hill, the first Central Gulf of Mexico community described &quot;in situ&quot; in 1986. No mass die-offs or large-scale shifts in faunal composition have been observed (with the exception of collections for scientific purposes) over the 19-year history of research at this site.

All chemosynthetic communities are located in water depths beyond the effect of severe storms, including hurricanes, and there would have been no alteration of these communities caused from surface storms, including hurricanes.

==== Biology ====

MacDonald et al. (1990) has described four general community types. These are communities dominated by Vestimentiferan tube worms (&quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; c.f. &quot;barhami&quot; and &quot;Escarpia&quot; spp.), mytilid mussels (Seep Mytilid Ia, Ib, and III, and others), vesicomyid clams (&quot;Vesicomya cordata&quot; and &quot;Calyptogena ponderosa&quot;), and infaunal lucinid or thyasirid clams (&quot;Lucinoma&quot; sp. or &quot;Thyasira&quot; sp.). Bacterial mats are present at all sites visited to date. These faunal groups tend to display distinctive characteristics in terms of how they aggregate, the size of aggregations, the geological and chemical properties of the habitats in which they occur, and, to some degree, the heterotrophic fauna that occur with them. Many of the species found at these cold seep communities in the Gulf of Mexico are new to science and remain undescribed.

Individual lamellibrachid tube worms, the longer of two taxa found at seeps, can reach lengths of 3 m (10 ft) and live hundreds of years (Fisher et al., 1997; Bergquist et al., 2000). Growth rates determined from recovered marked tube worms have been variable, ranging from no growth of 13 individuals measured one year to a maximum growth of 9.6 cm/yr (3.8 in/yr) in a &quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; individual (MacDonald, 2002). Average growth rate was 2.19 cm/yr (0.86 in/yr) for the &quot;Escarpia&quot;-like species and 2.92 cm/yr (1.15 in/yr) for lamellibrachids. These are slower growth rates than those of their hydrothermal vent relatives, but &quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; individuals can reach lengths 2–3 times that of the largest known hydrothermal vent species. Individuals of &quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; sp. in excess of 3 m (10 ft) have been collected on several occasions, representing probable ages in excess of 400 years (Fisher, 1995). Vestimentiferan tube worm spawning is not seasonal, and recruitment is episodic.

Tubeworms are either male or female. One recent discovery indicates that the spawning of female &quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; appears to have produced a unique association with the large bivalve &quot;Acesta bullisi&quot;, which lives permanently attached to the anterior tube opening of the tubeworm, and feeds on the periodic egg release (Järnegren et al., 2005). This close association between the bivalves and tubeworms was discovered in 1984 (Boland, 1986) but not fully explained. Virtually all mature &quot;Acesta&quot; individuals are found on female rather than male tubeworms. This evidence and other experiments by Järnegren et al. (2005) seem to have solved this mystery.

Growth rates for methanotrophic mussels at cold seep sites have been reported (Fisher, 1995). General growth rates were found to be relatively high. Adult mussel growth rates were similar to mussels from a littoral environment at similar temperatures. Fisher also found that juvenile mussels at hydrocarbon seeps initially grow rapidly, but the growth rate drops markedly in adults; they grow to reproductive size very quickly. Both individuals and communities appear to be very long-lived. These methane-dependent mussels have strict chemical requirements that tie them to areas of the most active seepage in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of their rapid growth rates, mussel recolonization of a disturbed seep site could occur relatively rapidly. There is some evidence that mussels also have some requirement of a hard substrate and could increase in numbers if suitable substrate is increased on the seafloor (Fisher, 1995). Two associated species are always found associated with mussel beds—the gastropod &quot;Bathynerita naticoidea&quot; and a small Alvinocarid shrimp—suggesting these endemic species have excellent dispersal abilities and can tolerate a wide range of conditions (MacDonald, 2002).

Unlike mussel beds, chemosynthetic clam beds may persist as a visual surface phenomenon for an extended period without input of new living individuals because of low dissolution rates and low sedimentation rates. Most clam beds investigated by Powell (1995) were inactive. Living individuals were rarely encountered. Powell reported that over a 50-year timespan, local extinctions and recolonization should be gradual and exceedingly rare. Contrasting these inactive beds, the first community discovered in the Central Gulf of Mexico consisted of numerous actively-plowing clams. The images obtained of this community were used to develop length/frequency and live/dead ratios as well as spatial patterns (Rosman et al., 1987a).

Extensive bacterial mats of free-living bacteria are also evident at all hydrocarbon seep sites. These bacteria may compete with the major fauna for sulfide and methane energy sources and may also contribute substantially to overall production (MacDonald, 1998b). The white, nonpigmented mats were found to be an autotrophic sulfur bacteria &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; species, and the orange mats possessed an unidentified non-chemosynthetic metabolism (MacDonald, 1998b).

Heterotrophic species at seep sites are a mixture of species unique to seeps (particularly molluscs and crustacean invertebrates) and those that are a normal component from the surrounding environment. Carney (1993) first reported a potential imbalance that could occur as a result of chronic disruption. Because of sporadic recruitment patterns, predators could gain an advantage, resulting in exterminations in local populations of mussel beds. It is clear that seep systems do interact with the background fauna, but conflicting evidence remains as to what degree outright predation on some specific community components such as tubeworms occurs (MacDonald, 2002). The more surprising results from this recent work is why background species do not utilize seep production more than seems to be evident. In fact, seep-associated consumers such as galatheid crabs and nerite gastropods had isotopic signatures, indicating that their diets were a mixture of seep and background production. At some sites, endemic seep invertebrates that would have been expected to obtain much if not all their diet from seep production actually consumed as much as 50 percent of their diets from the background.

=== In the Atlantic Ocean ===

Cold-seep communities in the western Atlantic Ocean have also been described from a few dives on mud volcanoes and diapirs between depth in the Barbados accretionary prism area and from the Blake Ridge diapir off North Carolina. More recently, seep communities have been discovered in the eastern Atlantic, on a giant pockmark cluster in the Gulf of Guinea near the Congo deep channel, and also on other pockmarks of the Congo margin, Gabon margin and Nigeria margin and in the Gulf of Cádiz.

The occurrence of chemosymbiotic biota in the extensive mud volcano fields of the Gulf of Cádiz was first reported in 2003. The chemosymbiotic bivalves collected from the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz were reviewed in 2011.

Cold seeps are also known from the Northern Atlantic Ocean, even ranging into the Arctic Ocean, off Canada and Norway.
Extensive faunal sampling has been conducted from in the Atlantic Equatorial Belt from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of Guinea including the Barbados accretionary prism, the Blake Ridge diapir, and in the Eastern Atlantic from the Congo and Gabon margins and the recently explored Nigeria margin during Census of Marine Life ChEss project. Of the 72 taxa identified at the species level, a total of 9 species or species complexes are identified as amphi-Atlantic.

The Atlantic Equatorial Belt seep megafauna community structure is influenced primarily by depth rather than by geographic distance. The bivalves Bathymodiolinae (within Mytilidae) species or complexes of species are the most widespread in the Atlantic. The &quot;Bathymodiolus boomerang&quot; complex is found at the Florida escarpment site, the Blake Ridge diapir, the Barbados prism, and the Regab site of Congo. The &quot;Bathymodiolus childressi&quot; complex is also widely distributed along the Atlantic Equatorial Belt from the Gulf of Mexico across to the Nigerian Margin, although not on the Regab or Blake Ridge sites. The commensal polynoid &quot;Branchipolynoe seepensis&quot; is known from the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Guinea, and Barbados. Other species with distributions extending from the eastern to western Atlantic are: gastropod &quot;Cordesia provannoides&quot;, the shrimp &quot;Alvinocaris muricola&quot;, the galatheids &quot;Munidopsis geyeri&quot; and &quot;Munidopsis livida,&quot; and probably the holothurid &quot;Chiridota heheva&quot;.

There have been found cold seeps also in the Amazon deepsea fan. High-resolution seismic profiles near the shelf edge show evidence of near-surface slumps and faulting in the subsurface and concentrations (about ) of methane gas. Several studies (e.g., Amazon Shelf Study—AMASEDS, LEPLAC, REMAC, GLORIA, Ocean Drilling Program) indicate that there is evidence for gas seepage on the slope off the Amazon fan based on the incidence of bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs), mud volcanoes, pockmarks, gas in sediments, and deeper hydrocarbon occurrences. The existence of methane at relatively shallow depths and extensive areas of gas hydrates have been mapped in this region. Also, gas chimneys have been reported, and exploratory wells have discovered sub-commercial gas accumulations and pockmarks along fault planes. A sound geological and geophysical understanding of the Foz do Amazonas Basin is already available and used by the energy companies.

Exploration of new areas, such as potential seep sites off of the east coast of the U.S. and the Laurentian fan where chemosynthetic communities are known deeper than , and shallower sites in the Gulf of Guinea are need to study in the future.

=== In the Mediterranean ===

The first biological evidence for reduced environments in the Mediterranean Sea was the presence of Lucinidae and Vesicomyidae bivalve shells cored on the top of the Napoli mud volcano (; &quot;Napoli&quot; is only a name of a seamount. It is located south of Crete), located at 1,900 m deep on the Mediterranean Ridge in the subduction zone of the African Plate. This was followed by the description of a new Lucinidae bivalve species, &quot;Lucinoma kazani&quot;, associated with bacterial endosymbionts. In the southeastern Mediterranean, communities of polychaetes and bivalves were also found associated with cold seeps and carbonates near Egypt and the Gaza Strip at depths of 500–800 m, but no living fauna was collected. The first in situ observations of extensive living chemosynthetic communities in the eastern Mediterranean Sea prompted cooperation between biologists, geochemists, and geologists. During submersible dives, communities comprising large fields of small bivalves (dead and alive), large siboglinid tube worms, isolated or forming dense aggregations, large sponges, and associated endemic fauna were observed in various cold seep habitats associated with carbonate crusts at 1,700–2,000 m depth. Two mud volcano fields were first explored, one along the Mediterranean Ridge, where most of them were partially (Napoli, Milano mud volcanoes) or totally (Urania, Maidstone mud volcanoes) affected by brines, and the other on the Anaximander mounds south of Turkey. The latter area includes the large Amsterdam mud volcano, which is affected by recent mudflows, and the smaller Kazan or Kula mud volcanoes. Gas hydrates have been sampled at the Amsterdam and Kazan mud volcanoes, and high methane levels have been recorded above the seafloor. Several provinces of the Nile deep-sea fan have been explored recently. These include the very active brine seepage named the Menes Caldera in the eastern province between 2,500 m and 3,000 m, the pockmarks in the central area along middle and lower slopes, and the mud volcanoes of the eastern province, as well as one in the central upper slope (North Alex area) at 500 m depth.

During these first exploratory dives, symbiont-bearing taxa that are similar to those observed on the Olimpi and Anaximander mud fields were sampled and identified. This similarity is not surprising, as most of these taxa were originally described from dredging in the Nile fan. Up to five species of bivalves harboring bacterial symbionts colonized these methane- and sulfide-rich environments. A new species of Siboglinidae polychaete, &quot;Lamellibrachia anaximandri&quot;, the tubeworm colonizing cold seeps from the Mediterranean ridge to the Nile deep-sea fan, has just been described in 2010. Moreover, the study of symbioses revealed associations with chemoautotrophic bacteria, sulfur oxidizers in Vesicomyidae and Lucinidae bivalves and Siboglinidae tubeworms, and highlighted the exceptional diversity of bacteria living in symbiosis with small Mytilidae. The Mediterranean seeps appear to represent a rich habitat characterized by megafauna species richness (e.g., gastropods) or the exceptional size of some species such as sponges (&quot;Rhizaxinella pyrifera&quot;) and crabs (&quot;Chaceon mediterraneus&quot;), compared with their background counterparts. This contrasts with the low macro- and mega-faunal abundance and diversity of the deep eastern Mediterranean. Seep communities in the Mediterranean that include endemic chemosynthetic species and associated fauna differ from the other known seep communities in the world at the species level but also by the absence of the large-size bivalve genera &quot;Calyptogena&quot; or &quot;Bathymodiolus&quot;. The isolation of the Mediterranean seeps from the Atlantic Ocean after the Messinian crisis led to the development of unique communities, which are likely to differ in composition and structure from those in the Atlantic Ocean. Further expeditions involved quantitative sampling of habitats in different areas, from the Mediterranean Ridge to the eastern Nile deep-sea fan. Cold seeps discovered in the Sea of Marmara in 2008 have also revealed chemosynthesis-based communities that showed a considerable similarity to the symbiont-bearing fauna of eastern Mediterranean cold seeps.

=== In the Indian Ocean ===
In the Makran Trench, a subduction zone along the northeastern margin of the Gulf of Oman adjacent to the southwestern coast of Pakistan and the southeastern coast of Iran, compression of an accretionary wedge has resulted in the formation of cold seeps and mud volcanoes.

=== In the West Pacific ===

Native aluminium has been reported also in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the South China Sea and Chen et al. (2011) have proposed a theory of its origin as resulting by reduction from tetrahydroxoaluminate Al(OH)4− to metallic aluminium by bacteria.

==== Japan ====

Deep sea communities around Japan are mainly researched by Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). DSV Shinkai 6500, Kaikō, and other groups have discovered many sites.

Methane seep communities in Japan are distributed along plate convergence areas because of the accompanying tectonic activity. Many seeps have been found in the Japan Trench, Nankai Trough, Ryukyu Trench, Sagami Bay, Suruga Bay, and the Sea of Japan.

Members of cold seep communities are similar to other regions in terms of family or genus, such as Polycheata, &quot;Lamellibrachia&quot;, Bivalavia, Solemyidae, &quot;Bathymodiolus&quot; in Mytilidae, Thyasiridae, Calyptogena in Vesicomyidae, and so forth. Many of the species in Japan&#x27;s cold seeps are endemic.

In Kagoshima Bay, there are methane gas seepages called &quot;tagiri&quot; (boiling). &quot;Lamellibrachia satsuma&quot; live around there. The depth of this site is only 80 m, which is the shallowest point where Siboglinidae are known to live. &quot;L. satsuma&quot; may be kept in an aquarium for a long period at 1 atm. Two aquariums in Japan are keeping and displaying &quot;L. satsuma&quot;. An observation method to introduce it into a transparent vinyl tube is being developed.

DSV Shinkai 6500 discovered vesicomyid clam communities in the Southern Mariana Forearc. They depend on methane, which originates in serpentinite. Other chemosynthetic communities would depend on hydrocarbon origins organic substance in crust, but these communities depend on methane originating from inorganic substances from the mantle.

In 2011, the area around the Japan Trench suffered from the Tōhoku earthquake. There are cracks, methane seepages, and bacterial mats which were probably created by the earthquake.

==== New Zealand ====
Off the mainland coast of New Zealand, shelf-edge instability is enhanced in some locations by cold seeps of methane-rich fluids that likewise support chemosynthetic faunas and carbonate concretions. Dominant animals are tubeworms of the family Siboglinidae and bivalves of families Vesicomyidae and Mytilidae (&quot;Bathymodiolus&quot;). Many of its species appear to be endemic. Deep bottom trawling has severely damaged cold seep communities, and those ecosystems are threatened. Cold seeps are found at depths down to 2,000 m, and the topographic and chemical complexity of the habitats are not yet mapped. The scale of new-species discovery in these poorly-studied or unexplored ecosystems is likely to be high.

=== In the East Pacific ===

In the deep sea, the COMARGE project has studied the biodiversity patterns along and across the Chilean margin through a complexity of ecosystems such as methane seeps and oxygen minimum zones, reporting that such habitat heterogeneity may influence the biodiversity patterns of the local fauna. Seep fauna include bivalves of families Lucinidae, Thyasiridae, Solemyidae (&quot;Acharax&quot; sp.), and Vesicomyidae (&quot;Calyptogena gallardoi&quot;) and polychaetes (&quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; sp. and two other polychaete species). Furthermore, in these soft reduced sediments below the oxygen minimum zone off the Chilean margin, a diverse microbial community composed by a variety of large prokaryotes (mainly large multi-cellular filamentous &quot;mega bacteria&quot; of the genera &quot;Thioploca&quot; and &quot;Beggiatoa&quot;, and of &quot;macrobacteria&quot; including a diversity of phenotypes), protists (ciliates, flagellates, and foraminifers), as well as small metazoans (mostly nematodes and polychaetes) has been found. Gallardo et al. (2007) argue that the likely chemolithotrophic metabolism of most of these mega- and macrobacteria offer an alternative explanation to fossil findings, in particular to those from obvious non-littoral origins, suggesting that traditional hypotheses on the cyanobacterial origin of some fossils may have to be revised.

Cold seeps (pockmarks) are also known from depths of 130 m in the Hecate Strait, British Columbia, Canada. Unobvious fauna (also unobvious for cold seeps) have been found there with these dominating species: sea snail &quot;Fusitriton oregonensis&quot;, anemone &quot;Metridium giganteum&quot;, encrusting sponges, and bivalve &quot;Solemya reidi&quot;.

Cold seeps with chemosynthetic communities along the USA Pacific coast occur in Monterey Canyon, just off Monterey Bay, California on a mud volcano. There have been found, for example, &quot;Calyptogena&quot; clams &quot;Calyptogena kilmeri&quot; and &quot;Calyptogena pacifica&quot; and foraminiferan &quot;Spiroplectammina biformis&quot;.
* map of cold seeps in the Monterey Bay
Additionally, seeps have been discovered offshore southern California in the inner California Borderlands along several fault systems including the San Clemente fault, San Pedro fault, and San Diego Trough fault. Fluid flow at the seeps along the San Pedro and San Diego Trough faults appears controlled by localized restraining bends in the faults.

=== In the Antarctic ===

The first cold seep from the Southern Ocean was reported in 2005. The relatively few investigations to the Antarctic deep sea have shown the presence of deep-water habitats, including hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and mud volcanoes. Other than the Antarctic Benthic Deep-Sea Biodiversity Project (ANDEEP) cruises, little work has been done in the deep sea. There are more species waiting to be described.

== Detection ==

With continuing experience, particularly on the upper continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico, the successful prediction of the presence of tubeworm communities continues to improve; however, chemosynthetic communities cannot be reliably detected directly using geophysical techniques. Hydrocarbon seeps that allow chemosynthetic communities (Guaymas Basin) to exist do modify the geological characteristics in ways that can be remotely detected, but the time scales of co-occurring active seepage and the presence of living communities is always uncertain. These known sediment modifications include (1) precipitation of authigenic carbonate in the form of micronodules, nodules, or rock masses; (2) formation of gas hydrates; (3) modification of sediment composition through concentration of hard chemosynthetic organism remains (such as shell fragments and layers); (4) formation of interstitial gas bubbles or hydrocarbons; and (5) formation of depressions or pockmarks by gas expulsion. These features give rise to acoustic effects such as wipeout zones (no echoes), hard bottoms (strongly reflective echoes), bright spots (reflection enhanced layers), or reverberant layers (Behrens, 1988; Roberts and Neurauter, 1990). Potential locations for most types of communities can be determined by careful interpretation of these various geophysical modifications, but to date, the process remains imperfect and confirmation of living communities requires direct visual techniques.

== Fossilized records ==

Cold seep deposits are found throughout the Phanerozoic geologic record, especially in the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Notable examples can be found in the Permian of Tibet, the Cretaceous of Colorado and Hokkaido, the Palaeogene of Honshu, the Neogene of Northern Italy, and the Pleistocene of California. These fossil cold seeps are characterized by mound-like topography (where preserved), coarsely crystalline carbonates, and abundant mollusks and brachiopods.

== Environmental impacts ==

Major threats that cold seep ecosystems and their communities face today are seafloor litter, chemical contaminants, and climate change. Seafloor litter alters the habitat by providing hard substrate where none was available before or by overlying the sediment, thereby inhibiting gas exchange and interfering with organisms on the bottom of the sea. Studies of marine litter in the Mediterranean include surveys of seabed debris on the continental shelf, slope, and bathyal plain. In most studies, plastic items accounted for much of the debris, sometimes as much as 90% or more of the total, owing to their ubiquitous use and poor degradability.

Weapons and bombs have also been discarded at sea, and their dumping in open waters contributes to seafloor contamination. Another major threat to the benthic fauna is the presence of lost fishing gear, such as nets and longlines, which contribute to ghost fishing and can damage fragile ecosystems such as cold-water corals.

Chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants, toxic metals (e.g., Hg, Cd, Pb, Ni), radioactive compounds, pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals are also accumulating in deep-sea sediments. Topography (such as canyons) and hydrography (such as cascading events) play a major role in the transportation and accumulation of these chemicals from the coast and shelf to the deep basins, affecting the local fauna. Recent studies have detected the presence of significant levels of dioxins in the commercial shrimp &quot;Aristeus antennatus&quot; and significant levels of persistent organic pollutants in mesopelagic and bathypelagic cephalopods.

Climate-driven processes and climate change will affect the frequency and intensity of cascading, with unknown effects on the benthic fauna. Another potential effect of climate change is related to energy transport from surface waters to the seafloor. Primary production will change in the surface layers according to sun exposure, water temperature, major stratification of water masses, and other effects, and this will affect the food chain down to the deep seafloor, which will be subject to differences in quantity, quality, and timing of organic matter input. As commercial fisheries move into deeper waters, all of these effects will affect the communities and populations of organisms in cold seeps and the deep sea in general.

<doc id="400224" wikidata="Q12252354" url="?curid=400224" title="JSL romanization">
<text>JSL is a romanization system for transcribing the Japanese language into the Latin script. It was devised by Eleanor Jorden for (and named after) her 1987 book &quot;&quot;. The system is based on Kunrei-shiki romanization. Japanese Yale is a less well-known alternative name for the JSL system.

It is designed for teaching spoken Japanese, and so, it follows Japanese phonology fairly closely. For example, different conjugations of a verb may be achieved by changing the final vowel (as in the chart on the right), thus &quot;bear[ing] a direct relation to Japanese structure&quot; (in Jorden&#x27;s words), whereas the common Hepburn romanization may require exceptions in some cases, to more clearly illustrate pronunciation to native English speakers.

JSL differs from Hepburn, particularly in that it uses doubled vowels, rather than macrons, to represent the long vowels and . Tokyo () and Osaka (), for instance, would be written () and () in JSL. Also, JSL represents , the syllabic n, as an &quot;n&quot; with a macron over it, (), to avoid the practice that other systems use of sometimes writing (n) and sometimes (n&#x27;) depending on the presence of a following vowel or (y).

There is a close tie between Japanese pronunciation and JSL, where one consistent symbol is given for each Japanese phoneme. This means that it does depart from Japanese orthography somewhat, as is romanized as () when it indicates a long , but as () when it indicates two distinct vowel sounds, such as in () for (). Similarly, () is reserved for the pronunciation [ei] only, whereas other romanization systems (including Hepburn) follow the hiragana orthography, therefore making it impossible to tell whether [eː] or [ei] are represented. It also distinguishes between (), which is used when only a sound is possible, and (), which is used when a velar nasal sound (the &quot;ng&quot; in the English word &quot;singer&quot;) is also possible. The particles は and へ are romanized () and (), by their pronunciation. However, like Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki, JSL does not distinguish between allophones in Japanese which are close to different phonemes in English.

JSL indicates the pitch accent of each mora. A vowel with an acute accent (´) denotes the first high-pitch mora, a grave accent (`) marks the last high-pitch mora, and a circumflex (ˆ) marks the only high-pitch mora in a word. In this system &#x27;Japan&#x27; would be written () and &#x27;two (sticks)&#x27; as (), &#x27;It&#x27;s the edge&#x27; would be () (standing for ]. (This is why doubled vowels must be used instead of macrons.)

<text>Fleet Prison was a notorious London prison by the side of the River Fleet. The prison was built in 1197, was rebuilt several times, and was in use until 1844. It was demolished in 1846.

== History ==
The prison was built in 1197 off what is now Farringdon Street, on the eastern bank of the River Fleet after which it was named. It came into particular prominence from being used as a place of reception for persons committed by the Star Chamber, and, afterwards, as a debtor&#x27;s prison and for persons imprisoned for contempt of court by the Court of Chancery. In 1381, during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, it was deliberately destroyed by Wat Tyler&#x27;s men.

During the 15th century, inmates were usually imprisoned here for civil rather than criminal cases, and the prison was considered at the time as more comfortable than Ludgate prison. Inmates had to pay for board and lodgings, provide tips for prison servants and pay a fee for when they entered and left the prison. Prison cells ranged from luxurious private rooms to inmates who slept two in a bed. The very poor in prison were even known to beg through a grate while in prison.

In 1666, during the Great Fire of London, it burned down on the third day of the fire, the prisoners fleeing in the last moments. After the fire, the warden of the prison, Sir Jeremy Whichcote, purchased Caron House in Lambeth in order to house the prison&#x27;s debtors. Whichcote then rebuilt the prison on the original site at his own expense.During the 18th century, Fleet Prison was mainly used for debtors and bankrupts. It usually contained about 300 prisoners and their families. Like the Marshalsea prison, it was divided into a restrictive and arduous &quot;common side&quot; and a more open &quot;master&#x27;s side&quot;, where rent had to be paid.
At that time, prisons were profit-making enterprises. Prisoners had to pay for food and lodging. There were fees for turning keys and for taking irons off, and Fleet Prison had the highest fees in England. There was even a grille built into the Farringdon Street prison wall, so that prisoners might beg alms from passers-by. But prisoners did not necessarily have to live within Fleet Prison itself; as long as they paid the keeper to compensate him for loss of earnings, they could take lodgings within a particular area outside the prison walls called the &quot;Liberty of the Fleet&quot; or the &quot;Rules of the Fleet&quot;. From 1613 on, there were also many clandestine Fleet Marriages. The boundary of the Liberties of the Fleet included the north side of Ludgate Hill, the Old Bailey to Fleet Lane and along it until the Fleet Market, and ran alongside the prison to Ludgate Hill.

The head of the prison was termed the warden, who was appointed by letters patent. It became a frequent practice of the holder of the patent to farm out the prison to the highest bidder. This custom made the prison long notorious for the cruelties inflicted on prisoners. One purchaser of the office, Thomas Bambridge, who became warden in 1728, was of particularly evil repute. He was guilty of the greatest extortions upon prisoners, and, according to a committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the state of English gaols, arbitrarily and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dungeons, and destroyed prisoners for debt, treating them in the most barbarous and cruel manner, in high violation and contempt of the laws. He was committed to Newgate Prison, and an act, the Warden of Fleet Prison Act 1728 (2 Geo. 2. c. 32), was passed to prevent his enjoying the office of warden.

During the Gordon Riots in 1780 Fleet Prison was again destroyed and rebuilt in 1781–1782. In 1842, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, by which inmates of the Marshalsea, Fleet and Queen&#x27;s Bench prisons were relocated to the Queen&#x27;s Prison (as the Queen&#x27;s Bench Prison was renamed), it was finally closed, and in 1844 sold to the Corporation of the City of London, by whom it was pulled down in 1846. The demolition yielded three million bricks, 50 tons of lead and of paving. After lying empty for 17 years the site was sold to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway and became the site of their new Ludgate station.

==Notable inmates==

In 1601, the poet John Donne was imprisoned until it was proven that his wedding to Anne Donne (née More) was legal and valid. The priest who married him (Samuel Brooke) and the man who acted as witness to the wedding were also imprisoned.

Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet John Byrom, was imprisoned for debt in 1725. In 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the Duke of Dorset, in which he raged against the injustices of the system:

Holland, the most unpolite Country in the World, uses Debtors with Mildness, and Malefactors with Rigour; England, on the contrary, shews Mercy to Murtherers and Robbers, but of poor Debtors Impossibilities are demanded ... if the Debtor is able to make up his Affairs with the Creditor, how many Hundreds are afterwards kept in Prison for Chamber-Rent, and other unjust Demands of the Gaolers? ... What Barbarity can be greater, than for Gaolers (without any Provocation) to load Prisoners with Irons, and thrust them into Dungeons, and manacle them, and deny their Friends to visit them, and force them to pay excessive Prices for their Chamber-Rent, their Victuals and Drink; to open their Letters and seize the Charity that is sent them; and, in short, by oppressing them by all the Ways that the worst of Tyrants can invent? Such Cruelty reduces the Prisoners to Despair, insomuch, that many choose rather to shoot, hang or throw themselves out of the Window, than to be insulted, beaten and imposed upon by the Gaolers ... if every Gaoler was allowed a yearly Sallary ... and no Gaoler suffered, under the severest of Penalties, to take either Bribe, Fee, or Reward, no Demand for Chamber-Rent, nor any Fees for Entrance or going out of Prison; in such a Case the Gaols would not swarm as they now do ... In foreign Countries, where the Romish Religion prevails, what Crowds of People of both Sexes, from the highest Prince to the meanest Peasant, thrust themselves into Religious Houses ... it is an apparent Injury to the Country ... too obvious to be denied, that the many Prisons in England, where so many Thousands of both Sexes are detained, is a greater Loss and Injury to the King and Country ...
Other notable inmates include:

* Christopher Billopp – Commander in the King&#x27;s Navy and landowner on Staten Island, New York died in Fleet Prison,1725.
* John Cleland – 18th century fighter for the freedom of speech in Great Britain

* Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet (founder to the lineage of the Dukes of Westminster) – spent almost 10 years in the prison after his brother-in-law, Peter Daniell, defaulted on his debts in 1629. Grosvenor was imprisoned because he had stood surety to Daniell.
* Charles Hall – a notable economic thinker, and early socialist.
* John Jones of Gellilyfdy – a Welsh antiquary and calligrapher who, repeatedly imprisoned between 1617 and the 1650s, used his time in prison to carry out work copying manuscripts.

<text>Ekaterina Karsten (née Khadatovich, Хадатовіч; , &quot;Kaciaryna Karsten&quot;; ; born 2 June 1972) is a Belarusian rower, a seven-time Olympian and the first medalist from the Republic of Belarus, a two-time Olympic champion and six-time World Champion in the single scull.

== Biography ==
At the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, under her maiden name of Khadatovich, she competed in her first Olympic Games in the women&#x27;s quadruple sculls as part of the Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics due to the recent Dissolution of the Soviet Union, winning the bronze medal.

Khadatovich began to concentrate her career as a single sculler and by the start of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, she had established herself as a major contender for the women&#x27;s Olympic single sculls. She claimed gold, winning the final in a time of 7:32.31.

She then won both World Championship gold medals in 1997 and 1999 and married a German, where she took the name &quot;Karsten&quot;. She competed at her third Olympic Games in 2000 in Sydney, where she won gold in the single sculls event by one hundredth of one second over Rumyana Neykova of Bulgaria.

In 2001, Karsten won the Princess Royal Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, rowing for the Minsk City Club and defeating German Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski in the final.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, she won a silver medal in the single sculls, and a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing in the same event. 

She also won the World Championships in the single sculls in 1997, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009, earned silver in 2002 and 2010, and bronze in 2001 and 2003. She won the European Championships in 2009 and 2010. She won the World Junior Championships in 1990.

She reached the final of the single sculls event at the 2012 Summer Olympics and made it to the semi-finals of the same event at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="400235" wikidata="Q2276893" url="?curid=400235" title="Fleet marriage">
<text>A Fleet marriage was a common example of an irregular or a clandestine marriage taking place in England before the Marriage Act 1753 came into force on March 25, 1754. Specifically, it was one which took place in London&#x27;s Fleet Prison or its environs during the 17th and, especially, the early 18th century.

==Irregular and clandestine marriages==
An &quot;irregular marriage&quot; was one that took place either away from the home parish of the spouses (but after banns or licence), or at an improper time. &quot;Clandestine&quot; marriages were those that had an element of secrecy to them: perhaps they took place away from a home parish, and without either banns or marriage licence.

It is often asserted that under English law of this period a marriage could be recognized in court if each spouse could provide evidence they had simply expressed (to each other) an unconditional consent to their marriage. With few local exceptions, earlier Christian marriages across Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties. By the 18th century, the earlier form of weddings (&quot;common-law marriages&quot; in modern terms) were the exception. Nearly all wedding ceremonies in England, including the &quot;irregular&quot; and &quot;clandestine&quot; ones, were performed by ordained clergy.

The Marriage Duty Act 1695 put an end to irregular marriages at parochial churches by penalizing clergy who married couples without banns or licence. By a legal quirk, however, clergy operating in the Fleet could not effectively be proceeded against, and the clandestine marriage business there carried on. In the 1740s, over half of all London weddings were taking place in the environs of the Fleet Prison. The majority of Fleet marriages were for honest purposes, when couples simply wanted to get married quickly or at low cost.

From 1742 to 1754 a large number of such marriages were also conducted at Keith&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster, by the Reverend Alexander Keith.

==Fleet Prison==
The earliest recorded date of a Fleet marriage is 1613 (although there were probably earlier ones), while the earliest recorded in a Fleet register took place in 1674. As a prison, the Fleet was claimed to be outside the jurisdiction of the church. The prison warders took a share of the profit, even though a statute of 1711 imposed fines upon them for doing so: it only moved the clandestine marriage trade outside the prison. There were, in fact, so many debtors that many lived in the area outside the prison (itself a lawless area which operated under the &quot;rules of the Fleet&quot;). Disgraced clergy (and many who pretended to be clergy) lived there, and marriage houses or taverns carried on the trade, encouraged by local tavern-keepers in the neighbourhood who employed touts to solicit custom for them. There were also many clerks who made money recording the ceremonies.

During the 1740s, up to 6,000 marriages a year were taking place in the Fleet area, compared with 47,000 in England as a whole. One estimate suggests that there were between 70 and 100 clergy working in the Fleet area between 1700 and 1753. It was not merely a marriage centre for criminals and the poor, however: both rich and poor availed themselves of the opportunity to marry quickly or in secret.

==Marriage Act 1753==

The scandal and abuses brought about by these clandestine marriages became so great that they became the object of special legislation. In 1753, Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s Marriage Act was passed, which required, under pain of annulment, that banns should be published or a licence obtained; that, in either case, the marriage should be solemnized in church by a recognised cleric; and that in the case of minors, marriage by licence must be by the consent of parent or guardian; and that at least two witnesses must be present. Jewish and Quaker ceremonies were exempt. Clergy conducting clandestine marriages were liable to transportation.

This act had the effect of putting a stop to these marriages, so far as England and Wales were concerned, and henceforth couples had to travel to Scotland, the nearest point being Gretna Green. This had substantial use until 1856, when Scottish law was changed to require 21 days&#x27; residence. The act did not extend to Scotland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. Similar legislation was passed in the Isle of Man in 1757.

<text>Umbanda () is a religion that emerged in Brazil during the 1920s. Deriving largely from Spiritism, it also combines elements from Afro-Brazilian traditions like Candomblé as well as Roman Catholicism. There is no central authority in control of Umbanda, which is organized around autonomous places of worship termed &quot;centros&quot; or &quot;terreiros&quot;, the followers of which are called &quot;Umbandistas&quot;.

A monotheistic religion, Umbanda believes in a single God who is distant from humanity. Beneath this entity are powerful non-human spirits called &quot;orixás&quot;. In the more Spiritist-oriented wing of the religion, White Umbanda, these are viewed as divine energies or forces of nature; in more Africanised forms they are seen as West African deities and are offered animal sacrifices. The emissaries of the &quot;orixás&quot; are the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; and &quot;caboclos&quot;, spirits of enslaved Africans and of indigenous Brazilians respectively, and these are the main entities dealt with by Umbandistas. At Umbandist rituals, spirit mediums sing and dance in the hope of being possessed by these spirits, through whom the congregations receive guidance, advice, and healing. Umbanda teaches a complex cosmology involving a system of reincarnation according to the law of karma. The religion&#x27;s ethics emphasise charity and social fraternity. Umbandistas also seek to reverse harm that they attribute to practitioners of a related tradition, Quimbanda.

Roman Catholicism was the dominant religion in early 20th-century Brazil, but sizeable minorities practiced Afro-Brazilian traditions or Spiritism, a French version of Spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec. Around the 1920s, various groups may have been combining Spiritist and Afro-Brazilian practices, forming the basis of Umbanda. The most important group was that established by Zélio Fernandino de Moraes and those around him in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. He had been involved in Spiritism but disapproved of the negative attitude that many Spiritists held towards contact with &quot;pretos velhos&quot; and &quot;caboclos&quot;. Reflecting Umbanda&#x27;s growth, in 1939 de Moraes formed an Umbandist federation and in 1941 held the first Umbandist congress. Umbanda gained increased social recognition and respectability amid the military dictatorship of 1964 to 1985, despite growing opposition from both the Roman Catholic Church and Pentecostal groups. Since the 1970s, Umbanda has seen some decline due to the resurgent popularity of Candomblé.

In Brazil, hundreds of thousands of people formally identify as Umbandistas, but the number who attend Umbandist ceremonies, sometimes on an occasional basis, is in the millions. In its heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, Umbanda was estimated to have between 10 and 20 million followers in Brazil. Reflecting a universalist attitude, practitioners are typically permitted to also follow other religious traditions. Umbanda is found primarily in urban areas of southern Brazil although has spread throughout the country and to other parts of the Americas.

==Definitions==
Formed in the state of Rio de Janeiro during the 1920s, Umbanda combines elements of Spiritism (&quot;Espiritismo&quot;) with ideas from Afro-Brazilian religions like Candomblé. Additional influences come from Roman Catholicism, as well as Asian religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. The religion&#x27;s practitioners are called &quot;Umbandistas&quot;, while the term &quot;Umbanda&quot; itself may derive from the Portuguese language terms &quot;uma banda&quot;, meaning &quot;one group&quot;.

Umbanda is not a unified religion, having no central institutional authority, and being transmitted in a largely oral manner. It displays considerable variation and eclecticism, being highly adaptable, and taking various different forms. Much of this variation is regional. Several scholars deem it appropriate to talk about &quot;Umbandas&quot;, in the plural, as much as a singular Umbanda. Reflecting a general universalist stance that encourages tolerance towards other traditions, Umbandistas are commonly permitted to also pursue other religions, with some also practising Roman Catholicism, Judaism, or Santo Daime.

Reflecting its Spiritist origins, Umbanda has been labelled a Western esoteric tradition. It has also been called an Afro-Brazilian religion, although the scholar of religion Steven Engler cautioned that Africanised ritual elements are not present in all Umbandist groups and that the Spiritist influence is more significant across Umbanda as a whole. There are also Umbandist groups that have adopted Kabbalah, or New Age practices.

===Relation to Afro-Brazilian religions===

Umbandist groups exist on a spectrum, from those emphasising Spiritist connections to those stressing links with Candomblé and related Afro-Brazilian religions. Groups taking the former position often refer to themselves as practicing &quot;Umbanda branca&quot; (&quot;White Umbanda&quot;), &quot;Umbanda pura&quot; (&quot;Pure Umbanda&quot;), or &quot;Umbanda limpa&quot; (&quot;Clean Umbanda&quot;). The anthropologist Lindsay Hale referred to the more Africanist wing as &quot;Afro-Brazilian Umbanda&quot;, while fellow anthropologist Diana Brown called it &quot;Africanized Umbanda&quot;. Most Umbandist groups exist at points between these two poles.

In practice, Afro-Brazilian religions often mix, rather than existing in pure forms, and thus scholars see them as existing on a continuum rather than being firmly distinct from each other. Brown noted that the boundary separating Umbanda from Candomblé was largely &quot;a matter of individual opinion&quot;. She added that there was &quot;no general consensus&quot; as to what exactly Umbanda is and what it is not. In Rio de Janeiro, a tradition called Omolocô was established as an intermediate religion between Candomblé and Umbanda. Groups combining elements of Umbanda and Candomblé are sometimes termed &quot;Umbandomblé&quot;, although this is rarely embraced by practitioners themselves. In the Porto Alegre area, it is common for groups to mix Umbanda with the Afro-Brazilian religion Batuque.

Outsiders sometimes refer to Umbanda as &quot;Macumba&quot;, a pejorative term for Afro-Brazilian religions. While some Umbandistas have referred to themselves as &quot;macumbeiros&quot;, often in jest due to the term&#x27;s negative connotations, Umbandist literature usually uses &quot;Macumba&quot; in a more restrictive sense to designate &quot;baixa espiritismo&quot; (low spiritism), traditions that work with lesser spirits for morally questionable purposes. Umbandistas often describe these practices as Quimbanda and emphasise their opposition to them, maintaining that Umbandistas work for good while Quimbandistas work for evil. The boundaries between Umbanda and Quimbanda are nevertheless not always clear, with various spirit mediums engaging or promoting practices associated with both. The anthropologist David J. Hess called the two religions &quot;siblings&quot;.

==Beliefs==

Various Umbandistas have claimed that theirs is not a new religion but an ancient tradition brought to Brazil from elsewhere. Some practitioners have claimed that it derives from ancient Egypt, India, or China, or from the Aztecs or Incas. Others have maintained that Umbanda&#x27;s origins are either extraterrestrial or from Atlantis. These sort of origin stories reflect the influence of Theosophy. Brown suggested that these explanations were adopted by Umbandistas eager to dismiss the possibility of their religion having Sub-Saharan African origin. In contrast, various practitioners of Africanised forms of Umbanda have maintained that the religion originally came from Africa.

===Theology and cosmology===

Umbanda is monotheistic. It believes in a single God who is the creator and controller of the universe, an entity that presides over the astral world but who is distant from humanity. He is sometimes called Olorun, a name of Yoruba origin. Beneath God is a pantheon of spirits that reflect syncretic origins, assembled into what Brown called &quot;a complex, impersonal bureaucracy&quot;, and it is these entities thought to intervene in humanity&#x27;s daily lives.

Although it has no authoritative source ensuring a standardised cosmological belief among practitioners, Umbanda has an elaborate cosmology. An important distinction is made between the material and the spiritual, with the latter considered far superior. Umbandist theology is largely Spiritist in basis, adopting the Spiritist emphasis on reincarnation and spiritual evolution, as well as the hierarchical ranking of spirits according to their &quot;degree of evolution&quot;.

Many Umbandistas believe in a three-part cosmos, divided between the astral spaces, the earth, and the underworld. The more highly evolved spirits dwell in the astral realm, spirits incarnated in physical form reside temporarily on earth, while malevolent and ignorant spirits inhabit the underworld. The barrier between these worlds is not impenetrable; spirits from both the astral and underworld realms can visit the earth. Umbandistas often refer to the &quot;plano astral&quot; (astral plane) as the &quot;além&quot; (beyond). Sometimes, the realm of the evolved spirits is also called &quot;Aruanda&quot;, a term that likely derives from Luanda, a port in modern Angola, but which in Umbanda has looser connotations of an area within the astral plane.

The astral world is deemed to be divided into a hierarchy of seven vertical levels, the &quot;Sête Linhas de Umbanda&quot; (Seven Lines of Umbanda), although the specific identity of each line varies among Umbandistas. This seven-fold division may derive from Theosophy. Each of the Seven Lines is governed by an &quot;orixá&quot;, a highly evolved spirit who will also have an identity as a Roman Catholic saint. The underworld is also divided into Seven Lines, each of which is led by an &quot;exú&quot; spirit. Each Line is also internally divided into seven sub-lines; each of these is then divided into seven legions; these divide into seven sub-legions; these into seven &quot;falanges&quot; (phalanges); and these into seven sub-&quot;falanges&quot;. Umbandistas often liken this cosmological structure to the organization of an army, and it may reflect the prominent role that various military figures have played in Umbanda&#x27;s history. The spirits inhabiting these groups are usually arranged on the basis of regional or racial origin.

===&quot;Orixás&quot;===

At the top of Umbanda&#x27;s hierarchy of spirits are the &quot;orixás&quot;, entities often regarded as deities. The term &quot;orixá&quot; derives from the Yoruba language of West Africa, as do the names of the various &quot;orixás&quot; themselves, which in Brazil are also employed in the Nagô or Ketu tradition of Candomblé. Although the names of the &quot;orixás&quot; are drawn from Candomblé, Umbandistas do not typically interpret these beings in the same way that Candomblé&#x27;s practitioners do. There is nevertheless variation according to group; African-oriented Umbandistas place particular emphasis on the &quot;orixás&quot;, while they remain far less important in the rituals of White Umbandist groups.

For Umbandistas, the &quot;orixás&quot; are God&#x27;s intermediaries, and represent elemental forces of nature as well as humanity&#x27;s primary economic activities. White Umbandist groups often perceive the &quot;orixás&quot; primarily as frequencies of spiritual energy, vibrations, or forces. They are regarded as beings so highly evolved that they have never incarnated in physical form. Like God, they are distant from humanity, permanently residing on the astral plane. Many Umbandistas rarely expect &quot;orixás&quot; to manifest during rituals, for the &quot;orixás&quot; are preoccupied with important spiritual matters. They are also thought too powerful for many humans to handle, meaning that their manifestation could be dangerous for the ritual&#x27;s participants. Instead, the &quot;orixás&quot; send their emissaries, the &quot;caboclos&quot; and &quot;pretos velhos&quot;, to appear in their place.

Nine &quot;orixás&quot; are commonly found in Umbanda, fewer than the 16 more usually present in Candomblé. The son of Olorun, Oxalá is associated with the sky and regarded as the creator of humanity. Iemanjá is a maternal figure associated with the sea. Nanã is also a maternal figure associated with water, but in her case the waters of the lake and swamp. Omolu is the &quot;orixá&quot; of sickness and healing. Xangô is linked to thunder and lightning, as well as to stone working and quarrying. Ogúm is the &quot;orixá&quot; of war, metalworking, agriculture, and transportation. Oxúm is associated with fertility and with flowing water, especially streams and waterfalls. Iansã is a female warrior who manifests in storms. Oxóssi is a hunter who lives in the forest. Exú is a trickster and the guardian of the crossroads, being the intermediary between the &quot;orixás&quot; and humanity. He will often be paid homage first during a ritual, to stop him being disruptive later in the rite.

Each of the &quot;orixás&quot; is deemed to have their own desires and emotions. The &quot;orixás&quot; are also associated with particular colors; Oxúm with blue, for instance, and Oxóssi with green. Each is also linked to particular days of the week; Iansã with Wednesday, and Nanã with Tuesday, for example. They are also associated with a particular celestial body, such as Xangô with the planet Jupiter and Iemanjá with the moon.

Each &quot;orixá&quot; is typically associated with a Roman Catholic saint. It is in this form that they are often represented on Umbandist altars, and these links are also reinforced in praise songs. Xangô, for instance, is often identified with Saint Geronimo, Nanã with Saint Anne, and Omolu with Saint Roch and Saint Lazarus. Many Umbandistas identify Exú with the Devil of Christian theology, and Oxalá with Jesus Christ. There is often regional variation in these associations; in Rio de Janeiro, Iemanjá is typically linked to Our Lady of Glory, while in Salvador she is associated with Our Lady of the Conception. There are nevertheless differences of opinion among Umbandistas as to the nature of the relationship between &quot;orixás&quot; and saints. Many Umbandistas regard the &quot;orixás&quot; and saints as manifestations of the same spiritual force rather than being exactly the same figure; some practitioners believe that these saints were once humans who were physical manifestations of the &quot;orixás&quot;.

====Relationships with the &quot;orixás&quot;====

Umbanda often teaches that each person has a &quot;coroa&quot; (crown) of protective spirit entities. The most important of these is the &quot;orixá da frente&quot; (&quot;the front &quot;orixá&quot;&quot;), an &quot;orixá&quot; deemed to be that individual&#x27;s spiritual parent. These entities are a person&#x27;s protectors and patrons. They are also deemed to influence that individual&#x27;s personality traits. Umbandistas believe that these entities are deserving of respect and that treating them well will improve a person&#x27;s life. In Umbanda, it is usual for a medium to personally determine the identity of a person&#x27;s spirit patrons. This is different from Candomblé, where the identity is more often ascertained through forms of divination; divination in general plays much less of a role in Umbanda than in Candomblé. Knowing the identity of these &quot;orixás&quot; is deemed to offer a person insights about themselves.

===Lesser evolved spirits===

Although very different in tone from one another, the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; and the &quot;caboclos&quot; are together the most important spirit types in Umbanda. Umbanda departs from Spiritism over the value placed on these entities, with Umbandistas believing that Spiritists often negatively misjudge the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; and the &quot;caboclos&quot; because of their appearance. For Umbandistas, the &quot;caboclos&quot; and &quot;pretos velhos&quot; are &quot;beings of light&quot;, entities who inhabit the lower echelons of the Seven Lines of the astral plane. In emphasising the spirits of these socially marginalised groups, Umbanda is sometimes characterised as having an egalitarian nature.

Although they are only the emissaries of the &quot;orixás&quot;, the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; and &quot;caboclos&quot; take centre stage in Umbandist rituals. They are particularly prominent during rituals in which practitioners seek assistance with their problems, with Umbandistas approaching these entities in the hope of receiving advice and protection. In practice, Umbanda strongly emphasises practitioner&#x27;s personal relationships with these spirit beings, with ritual homage given to them in exchange for cures and advice. This relationship bears similarities with that between devotees and the saints in popular Catholicism.

====&quot;Pretos Velhos&quot;====

The &quot;pretos velhos&quot; (&quot;old blacks&quot;) are usually, although not always, regarded as the spirits of deceased African slaves. They are usually conceived as being elderly, and thus referred to with respectful terms like &quot;vovô&quot; (&quot;grandfather&quot;) and &quot;vovó&quot; (&quot;grandmother&quot;). The &quot;pretos velhos&quot; are deemed to be kind, patient, and wise. Despite the suffering they endured in life, they are thought to preach forgiveness and love. They are regarded as healers and counsellors, spirits to whom Umbandistas can bring their problems. When a medium deems themselves possessed by one of the &quot;pretos velhos&quot;, they will often smoke a pipe.

The names of these &quot;pretos velhos&quot; often reflect Catholic forenames followed by an African national affiliation, as with Maria Congo or Maria d&#x27;Aruanda. They will sometimes be addressed collectively as the &quot;povo de Bahia&quot; (people from Bahia) or as members of a particular nation, such as the &quot;povo da Congo&quot; (people from Congo). These spirits are commemorated on the feast of the old slaves, held on May 13, marking the day in 1888 when slavery was abolished in Brazil. Wayside shrines dedicated to the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; can be found in various places in Brazil, although in parts of Amazonia, Umbandist groups have often ignored the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; or subsumed them as a type of &quot;caboclo&quot;.

Brown suggested that the portrayal of the &quot;pretos velhos&quot; reflected the stereotype of the &quot;faithful slave&quot; common in the writings of Brazilians like Castro Alves and Artur Azevedo. This literary trope had in turn been influenced by the popularity of Portuguese translations of the 1852 American novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

====&quot;Caboclos&quot;====

&quot;Caboclos&quot; are usually the spirits of indigenous Brazilians, especially those of the Amazon Rainforest. In Umbanda, they are regarded as hunters and warriors who are highly intelligent and brave, but also vain and arrogant. Their power comes from the forces of nature, including the sun and moon, waterfalls, and the forest. Their individual names often reflect these links to nature, for instance Caboclo Mata Virgem (Caboclo Virgin Forest) or Caboclo Coral (Caboclo Coral Snake). They are often described as living in the forest, or alternatively in a paradisiacal city in the forest called Jurema.

These spirits often have snakes as their companions, something alluded to in the songs sung about them, and which may derive from certain Afro-Brazilian traditions from northeast Brazil. The &quot;caboclos&quot; are deemed to have been people who roamed free, and thus can be contrasted with the &quot;pretos velhos&quot;, who in life were held in bondage. When mediums believe themselves possessed by &quot;caboclos&quot;, they often adopt stern expressions and make loud, piercing cries, also smoking and drinking alcohol. When these &quot;caboclo&quot;-possessed individuals perform healing on clients, they often blow cigar smoke over the latter as a means of cleansing and curing them.

The &quot;caboclos&quot; do not derive from any prolonged contact that Umbanda&#x27;s founders had with indigenous peoples, but instead reflect the popular &quot;Indianismo&quot; of Brazilian culture. Their portrayal often draws on the stereotype of Brazil&#x27;s indigenous peoples being &quot;noble savages&quot;, and reflect the heroic depiction of indigenous Brazilians that developed in the country&#x27;s Romantic literature from the mid-19th century. The term &quot;caboclo&quot; may derive from the Tupi language term &quot;kari&#x27;boka&quot; (&quot;deriving from the white&quot;). Although associated primarily with indigenous spirits, the term &quot;caboclo&quot; is also sometimes used for the spirits of cowboys or frontiersmen, or—in parts of northeast Brazil—Turkish kings.

====Other evolved spirits====

Below the &quot;caboclos&quot; and &quot;pretos velhos&quot; in the Seven Lines of the astral realm are a large number of unidentified &quot;guias&quot; (spirit guides) and &quot;espíritos pretetores&quot; (spirit protectors). Other types of spirit found in Umbanda include the &quot;boiadeiros&quot; (cowboys), &quot;crianças&quot; (children), &quot;marinheiros&quot; (sailors), &quot;malandros&quot; (rogues), &quot;ciganos&quot; (gypsies) and &quot;sereias&quot; (mermaids).

The &quot;crianças&quot; are spirits of children and are valued largely for the joy and humor that they bring. Thought to be pure and innocent, they are deemed to enjoy sweets and toys just like living children. In Umbandist rites they are thought to often appear towards the end of proceedings, after tiring adult issues have been dealt with. Those mediums possessed by the &quot;crianças&quot; often giggle, sing nursery rhymes, and perform in a child-like fashion. Umbandistas often hold an annual birthday party for these spirits on the Roman Catholic feast day of the child martyr saints Cosmas and Damian. It is possible that the &quot;crianças&quot; derive in part from beliefs about the Ibeji twins, spirits venerated in parts of West Africa.

===&quot;Exús&quot; and &quot;pombagiras&quot;===

In Umbanda, the &quot;exús&quot; are spirits yet to complete the process of karmic evolution. They are unevolved spirits of darkness which, by working for good, can gradually become spirits of light. Interpretations of these &quot;exús&quot; nevertheless differ among Umbandistas, with more African-oriented practitioners often taking a more positive attitude towards them. &quot;Exús&quot; are associated with Friday, and with the colors red and black. They are also linked to the obtaining of power, money, and sex. The term &quot;exú&quot; derives from the name of a Yoruba &quot;orisha&quot; spirit regarded as a trickster.

&quot;Exús&quot; fall into two main categories. The &quot;exús da luz&quot; (&quot;exús&quot; of the light) or &quot;exús batizados&quot; (baptised &quot;exús&quot;) have repented for their sins and seek redemption and karmic advancement by serving the &quot;orixás&quot;. In life, the &quot;exús da luz&quot; were often sinners who performed immoral acts through noble intentions. The other type of &quot;exús&quot; are the &quot;exús das trevas&quot; (&quot;exús&quot; of the shadows), spirits who are unrepentant and who afflict and torment the living. They may act as &quot;obsessors&quot;, finding a human victim and &quot;leaning&quot; (&quot;encostado&quot;) on them, causing the latter problems such as bad luck, compulsive behaviours, or addiction. The &quot;exús das trevas&quot; may do this due to their resentment of the living, or because they have been commanded to do so by a &quot;feiticeiro&quot; (sorcerer) practicing Quimbanda. These negative &quot;exús&quot; are sometimes also called &quot;Exú pagão&quot; (pagan &quot;exú&quot;), reflecting the influence of Christian thought. In Umbanda, the &quot;exús&quot; are often referred to with Christian-derived names like the Devil, Satan, or Lucifer, and are portrayed as being red with horns and tridents, reflecting Christian iconographical influence.

The female counterparts of the &quot;exús&quot;, &quot;pombagiras&quot; are regarded as being the spirits of immoral women, such as prostitutes. Linked to marginal and dangerous places, they are associated with sexuality, blood, death, and cemeteries. They are often presented as being ribald and flirty, speaking in sexual euphemisms and double entendres. They wear red and black clothing, and only possess women and gay men, who will then often smoke or drink alcohol, using obscene language and behaving lasciviously. The term &quot;pombagira&quot; may derive from the Bantu word &quot;bombogira&quot;, the name of a male &quot;orixá&quot; in Candomblé&#x27;s Bantu tradition. In Brazilian Portuguese, the term &quot;pomba&quot; is a euphemism for the vulva. When rituals focus on the &quot;exús&quot; and &quot;pombagiras&quot;, some Umbandistas will say that it constitutes Quimbanda.

===Mediumship===

Central to Umbanda are the spirit mediums, individuals responsible for contacting the good spirits. According to Brown, these mediums represent &quot;a sort of intermediate category of semi-specialists&quot; within the religion. Umbandistas believe that the skill of mediumship, or &quot;mediunidade&quot;, is innate to certain individuals, those capable of &quot;vidéncia&quot; (seeing) spirit or sensing the spirits&#x27; presence through intuition. Umbandist mediums are typically called &quot;filhas&quot; and &quot;filhos de santo&quot; (daughters and sons of the saint). Several scholars who have studied the religion have noted that women predominate as spirit mediums. From her research in the late 1960s and 1970s, Brown found that around two-thirds of Umbandist mediums were female and a third were male. She noted that while a few were under the age of 18, this was generally discouraged.

Most Umbandist mediums take on this role as a result of an initial personal crisis, often physical illness or emotional distress, that they come to believe is being caused by spirits as a means of alerting them. Often, they report that they initially resisted the call to become a medium but that the problems faced became too much and so they relented. Developing one&#x27;s innate mediumistic abilities then takes training; in Umbanda, it may take seven years or more to train, a process known as &quot;desensolver mediunidade&quot; (&quot;to develop mediumistic abilities&quot;). While a novice, the medium may be called a &quot;cambona&quot; or &quot;cambono&quot;. They will often be tasked with assisting established mediums during Umbandista rituals, for instance as ushers or scribes, writing down the messages from the spirits. Novice mediums may find their early possession experiences uncontrollable, but over time they learn to control it. To mark completion of this training, the medium may be given a necklace, the &quot;guia&quot; (&quot;guide&quot;); henceforth, they are a &quot;medium con guia&quot; (&quot;medium with a guide&quot;). 

Each of a medium&#x27;s spirits will often have their own unique character. Expert mediums are thought to work with spirits from each of the Seven Lines. A medium&#x27;s relationship with their &quot;exú&quot; or &quot;pombagira&quot; is considered close, and is mediated through the giving of gifts. Reciprocity is expected when engaging with the spirits, with those seeking their services often providing them with gifts. A person&#x27;s misfortunes may be interpreted as a reminder that obligations to the spirits have not been met.
Many Umbandistas believe that a good medium should maintain a healthy and pure body, for this reason avoiding smoking, over-eating, or drinking alcohol, especially on the night of an Umbandista session. Some Umbandista mediums operate out of their home, rather than running a centre.

===Reincarnation===
Umbanda teaches that everyone has a spirit that survives bodily death. Umbandistas sometimes refer to living people as &quot;espíritos enćarnados&quot; (incarnate spirits). Like Spiritists, Umbandistas typically believe that each person has a &quot;perispirit&quot;, a transparent membrane around the body that mediates between the body and soul. They believe that disturbances is either body and soul can impact the &quot;perispirit&quot;.

From Spiritism, Umbanda takes the ideas of reincarnation and karmic evolution; the terms &quot;reincarnacâo&quot; and &quot;karma&quot; were largely introduced to Brazilian Portuguese via the ideas of Spiritism&#x27;s French founder, Allan Kardec. Umbandistas believe that the spirit survives bodily death and goes on successive reincarnations, seeking ever higher levels of spiritual evolution. Everyone is subject to karma, and a person can spiritually evolve through their incarnations.

Reincarnation is a central idea for many Umbandistas. Practitioners believe that by serving the spirits and assisting the living they can build up their karmic credit. The higher a person&#x27;s karmic credit, the higher their level on the astral plane, and then the better the status of their next incarnation. Umbandistas believe that disincarnate spirits can also build up karmic credit. Practitioners sometimes believe that the events of previous incarnations can influence a person, for instance generating certain irrational fears. Some Umbandistas think that the same spirits can meet repeatedly over successive incarnations.

===Morality, ethics, and gender roles===
Umbandist morality places key emphasis on &quot;caridade&quot; (charity), something also evident in Spiritism, and which for both religions may derive ultimately from Roman Catholicism. As in Spiritism, for Umbandistas charity is regarded as a key motor for spiritual evolution. Practitioners for instance may give gifts and food to poor children to mark the festival of the &quot;crianças&quot;. Umbandistas also place value on humility. Umbandistas often believe that things happen for a reason, rather than being mere coincidence, and are part of a person&#x27;s path in life. Brown suggested that Umbanda was &quot;an essentially conservative religion&quot;, for it does not challenge the socio-economic status quo, and encourages &quot;individual rather than collective responsibility and action&quot;.

Brown argued that Umbanda inherited the Roman Catholic view that the world was a battleground between good and evil. Umbandistas often embody all the things that they oppose in the term &quot;Quimbanda&quot;. In the Umbandist view, Quimbanda is associated with evil, immorality, and pollution, and particularly with the use of &quot;exús&quot;. Given that Umbanda places focus on combating the harmful influences of &quot;exús&quot;, a common saying among Umbandistas is that &quot;if it weren&#x27;t for Quimbanda, Umbanda would have no reason to exist&quot;. Brown noted that Quimbanda represented &quot;a crucial negative mirror image against which to define Umbanda,&quot; suggesting that it could also serve as an &quot;ideological vehicle for expressing prejudices&quot; towards African-derived and lower class religions. In Brazil, there are also individuals who call themselves &quot;Quimbandeiros&quot; and openly practice Quimbanda.

Noting the predominance of women as spirit mediums, the scholar Patricia Lerch suggested that Umbanda offered Brazilian women a level of prestige and influence otherwise not offered by the low-paying jobs available to them.
Engler noted that Umbanda, like Candomblé, offers &quot;scope for the performance of alternative sexualities in a society governed by very conservative heterosexual gender roles.&quot; Afro-Brazilian religions are often stereotyped as attracting gay men, and to avoid this stereotype some male Umbandistas refuse to be possessed by female spirits. Based on research in the late 1960s and 1970s, Brown noted that a few &quot;centros&quot; had &quot;an openly gay orientation&quot; with a largely gay clientele, and in the 21st century some Umbandist priests have conducted same-sex marriages. The &quot;orixá&quot; Oxumaré, as an entity that spends six months being male and six months being female, is sometimes cited as a patron of gay and bisexual people.

==Practices==
Umbandist practices often revolve around clients who approach practitioners seeking assistance, for instance in diagnosing a problem, healing, or receiving a blessing. In Umbanda, spiritual knowledge and ethical behaviour are generally seen as being more important than ritual action.

===Houses of Worship===

Umbandist places of worship are termed &quot;centros&quot;, or alternatively &quot;tendas&quot; (tents). Those adopting a more African-orientation are sometimes called &quot;terreiros&quot;; this term comes from Candomblé, and so is avoided by some practitioners of White Umbanda. Each &quot;centro&quot; will typically have its own &quot;Padroeiro&quot;, or patron spirit. They are often totally autonomous, although some are members of larger Umbandist federations.

A &quot;centro&quot; may occupy a purpose-built structure although may be based out of someone&#x27;s home. Sometimes several &quot;centros&quot; will share the same structure, arranging their services at different times from each other. An insignia, the &quot;ponto riscado&quot; (sacred sign) may be on the exterior of the building to identify its function. Certain rituals may also be held outdoors, for instance beside a stream or the sea if that location is deemed particularly appropriate to the rite.

The main ritual space is called the &quot;barracão&quot;. Often this will face east, a direction deemed most conducive to astral forces. Sacred objects will often be buried beneath the floor, and these are termed &quot;axés&quot;. This main room will typically have paintings of the spirits on the walls, a space for practitioners to dance, and an altar. The altar will often have figurines of the &quot;caboclos&quot;, &quot;preto velhos&quot;, and &quot;orixás&quot;, the latter often in their form as Roman Catholic saints. Flowers and glasses of water are also often present to attract good forces, the latter a direct influence from Spiritism. Seating in rows to face the main ritual area is also common. Afro-Brazilian oriented &quot;terreiros&quot; may also have multiple outdoor shrines to different &quot;orixás&quot;.

&quot;Centros&quot; have both formal and informal hierarchies. Each is typically led by an individual called the &quot;chefe&quot; (&quot;chief&quot;), a term borrowed from Spiritism, or alternatively the &quot;mãe-de-santo&quot; (&quot;mother-of-saint&quot;) or &quot;pai-de-santo&quot; (&quot;father-of-saint&quot;), terms from Candomblé. In some groups, leaders may be called a &quot;babalaô&quot;, a term that may be borrowed from the Yoruba word &quot;babalawo&quot;, a diviner in the Ifá system. A &quot;chefe&quot; is usually a medium who receives the highest ranking spirits, and they will often lead group prayers and deliver sermons during services. Their leadership is often rooted in their individual charisma, and most have full-time jobs other than their role at the &quot;centro&quot;. Brown noted that, although women predominate as Umbandist mediums, most &quot;chefes&quot; were men. The second-in-command is the &quot;mãe pequena&quot; (&quot;little mother&quot;). A &quot;centro&quot; may close on the death of this leader; alternatively, their leadership role will often be passed to a family member or, more rarely, to a non-related senior initiate.

The &quot;chefe&quot; may refer to those under them as &quot;meus filhos do centros&quot; (my children of the centre), reflecting that they constitute a ritual godparent to them. Under the &quot;chefe&quot; will be the &quot;corpo mediúnico&quot; (ritual corps), the group of mediums active at that &quot;centro&quot;. These in turn divide into the &quot;médiums de consulta&quot; (consulting mediums) and the &quot;médiums em desenvolvimento&quot; (mediums in training). The latter are often expected to attend training sessions, the &quot;sessões de desenvolvimento&quot;, and to learn their ritual obligations to different spirits as well as the necessary ritual songs and the Umbandist cosmology. Advancement within the &quot;centro&quot; often relies on a person&#x27;s development as a medium. In smaller &quot;centros&quot;, there may be between 10 and 60 members of the &quot;corpo mediúnico&quot;, while at larger &quot;centros&quot; there can be several hundred. These larger &quot;centros&quot; may therefore have further subdivisions within the &quot;corpo mediúnico&quot; as well as multiple sub-&quot;chefes&quot;. Mediums are often expected to abstain from alcohol or sex prior to a ceremony. The congregation of lay Umbandists who attend services at the &quot;centro&quot; are called the &quot;assistência&quot;.

Some &quot;centros&quot; will also have a place for the mediums to change clothing, a kitchen, and an office. There is much work involved in running a Umbanda &quot;centro&quot;, for instance overseeing maintenance and paying bills. To gain legal registration with the Brazilian state, &quot;centros&quot; require an administrative system, often consisting of a board of directors, president, vice president, secretaries, and treasurers, although the size of this administration varies by &quot;centro&quot;. The &quot;centro&quot; is financed largely by its members, who consist of both its ritual corps and its regular lay attendees; they are expected to pay an initial registration and a monthly membership fee. &quot;Centros&quot; will sometimes also operate in a manner akin to mutual aid societies, offering their members social welfare services such as access to doctors and dentists or burial funds. The social activities common among Brazil&#x27;s Christian churches, such as picnics, dances, and coffee mornings, are largely absent from Umbandist &quot;centros&quot;.

===Rituals and ceremonies===

Umbandistas typically hold public ceremonies called &quot;sessões&quot; (sessions) several times a week. These take place in the &quot;centro;&quot; if an Umbandist group lacks one, it will instead be in rented premises or a private home. The purpose of these rituals is to invoke spirits to come to earth, where they may take possession of the mediums and thus offer spiritual consultations to the congregation. Brown described these Umbandist rituals as being livelier than Catholic or Spiritist ceremonies, but less so than those of Afro-Brazilian traditions or Quimbanda.

Mediums and others engaged in Umbandist rituals typically wear white clothing; for men this often means white tee-shirts and trousers, for women layered white skirts, singlets, or blouses. This uniformity conveys an impression of equality among practitioners, and also distinguishes them from Candomblé practitioners, who may wear more complex and colorful attire. Umbandistas also usually remove their shoes on entering the ritual space, before genuflecting to the altar. To start a ceremony, a ritual purification using incense, the &quot;defumacão&quot;, is used to banish harmful spirits, with the &quot;exús&quot; often being placated and asked to remain absent. Offerings of food may be given to the spirits, typically consisting of fruit, rice, and coconut milk.

A session may be begun with the recitation of a Roman Catholic prayer or the reading of passages from Kardec&#x27;s writing. Singing often opens a session, with a song sung at such ceremonies being called a &quot;ponto&quot;, &quot;curimba&quot;, or &quot;ponto cantado&quot;. Usually sung in Portuguese, they typically involve &quot;strophic song forms, couplets and quatrains with &quot;abeb&quot; rhyming schemes&quot;. The &quot;pontos&quot; celebrate the powers and exploits of the spirits, thereby inviting them to attend the ritual, where they can then engage in spirit possession. In a ritual, &quot;pontos&quot; will often be sung in honor of the leader of each of the Seven Lines. In White Umbandist groups, the singing will be accompanied by hand clapping, while more African-influenced groups often also employ drumming.

Umbandist practice can often incorporate Roman Catholic elements. In São Paulo, for instance, it is common for Umbandist groups to recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer or Hail Mary during their rituals. Many Umbandist groups have also embraced New Age practices such as aromatherapy, crystal healing, numerology, tarot cartomancy, reiki, and chakra realignment. The ethnomusicologist Marc Meistrich Gidal suggested that Umbanda embraced change and innovation in liturgy and ritual much more readily than Afro-Brazilian religions like Candomblé and Batuque.

====Possession and consultations====

The &quot;gira&quot; is a dance to celebrate the &quot;orixás&quot;; the members of the ritual corps will often dance in a procession. During the &quot;gira&quot;, some participants will become possessed, ceasing to dance and instead swaying and jerking rapidly. In Umbanda, the term &quot;incorporação&quot; (incorporation) is usually used to describe this possession. While possessed, the medium is considered a &quot;cavalos&quot; (horse), or sometimes an &quot;aparelhos&quot; (vehicle), for the possessing spirit. Their first act will sometimes be to bow before the altar to display respect for the &quot;orixás&quot;. The possessed medium&#x27;s facial expressions and demeanour may change to reflect the entity within them, while attendants may dress them in a manner suited to this spirit, for instance with the giving of feathered headdresses to those possessed by &quot;caboclos&quot;. A possessing spirit may then &quot;open the way&quot; for others to follow it.

Once all of the spirits are believed to have arrived, the singing and dancing will stop and the &quot;consultas&quot; (consultations) will begin. These &quot;consultas&quot; typically take up over half the ceremony&#x27;s length. Those clients awaiting a consultation with the mediums will often have a numbered &quot;ficha&quot; (token), and will sit waiting until their number is called, at which they can approach a medium. The individual guiding the client to the medium in question may be called a &quot;porteiro&quot; (&quot;usher&quot;) and in some cases is a medium-in-training. The possessed mediums will provide each client with a message, often in a coded ritual language; this message will then be written down by an assistant, the &quot;escrevedor&quot; (scribe), who may also interpret it for the client. &quot;Consultas&quot; form the principal link between Umbandist mediums and lay followers, and it is as a client at a session that most people first engage with Umbanda. Successful &quot;consultas&quot; attract converts and are a &quot;centro&quot;&#x27;s main means of recruitment. Mediums who gain reputations to successful consultations gain prestige; in doing so, they may end up challenging the head of the &quot;centro&quot;. Such mediums might also split off to form their own &quot;centro&quot;.

If &quot;exús&quot; possess a medium during the session, they will generally be exorcised. If a client is diagnosed as being harassed by &quot;exús&quot;, efforts will be made to &quot;tirar&quot; (pull out) this entity from the person&#x27;s body. Sometimes, multiple mediums will do so, placing their hands on the patient and absorbing the &quot;exú&quot; into themselves; it is believed that they have the ability to defend themselves from its influence. In some instances, clients have also reported being possessed during the ceremony. Once the &quot;consultas&quot; are over, services often end with prayers and &quot;pontos&quot;. The practitioners will then change out of their ceremonial clothing and leave. Mediums who were possessed often report no memory of the events that transpired during the possession.

In White Umbanda, consultations generally always take place as part of the public ceremony, thus emphasizing the idea that they are being offered to clients as a form of charity, rather than as a means of earning money. Umbandist mediums generally do not charge for working with the spirits, but clients will typically support them with material gifts. In more Africanised forms of Umbanda, as in Candomblé, private consultations will also be held outside of public ceremonies.

====&quot;Obrigações&quot;====

A particular &quot;orixá&quot; will be paid ritual homage on the saint&#x27;s day that correlates with them. These acts of ritual homage are called &quot;obrigações&quot; (obligations) and will usually take place at a place in the natural environment associated with the &quot;orixá&quot; in question, for instance a pile of rocks for Xangô, at fresh water for Oxúm, or at salt water for Iemanjá. Ritual homage will also sometimes be made to &quot;exús&quot;, in which case it is usually done at the crossroads. Offerings to the &quot;exús&quot; typically include candles, cachaça, cigarettes, and sacrificed black chickens. Many Umbandists believe that performing a homage to these entities goes beyond the bounds of Umbanda and becomes Quimbanda.

There are also specific festivals in the Umbandist calendar devoted to particular &quot;orixá&quot;. December 31 is for instance the &quot;Dia de Iemanjá&quot;, and sees thousands of Umbandistas and other participants amass on Rio&#x27;s beaches. Umbandistas often also associate Brazil&#x27;s Abolition Day, celebrated on May 13, as a reference to their &quot;pretos velhos&quot;. Certain Umbandist groups, particularly those of a more Africanist-orientation, have also organised public processions on the Catholic saint days that correspond to particular &quot;orixás&quot;. These processions are similar to those also held by Catholics.

====In Afro-Brazilian Umbanda====

In Africanized Umbandista &quot;terreiros&quot;, ceremonies tend to take place on Saturday nights, beginning around 10pm and continuing until dawn. In contrast to the white clothing of White Umbandista groups, practitioners at these ceremonies will often be colorfully dressed. More African-oriented Umbandista groups will often feature practices like animal sacrifice, dancing, and drumming which are found in Afro-Brazilian religions like Candomblé. These are typically avoided by White Umbanda traditions, the practitioners of which sometimes regard such practices as primitive.

The drumming is performed to summon the spirits to appear at the ceremony; different rhythms are often selected for different &quot;orixás&quot;. Amid the drumming, singing, and dancing in a circle, Umbandistas believe that the &quot;caboclos&quot;, as representatives of the &quot;orixás&quot;, will appear and possess one of the participants. Later in the ceremony, other &quot;caboclos&quot;, as well as &quot;pretos velhos&quot;, &quot;exús&quot;, and &quot;pomba giras&quot;, will appear and possess people to offer advice, protection, and healing.

Animals sacrificed in these African-oriented &quot;terreiros&quot; are usually chickens, although sometimes guinea fowl, sheep, goats, or more rarely, bulls. Typically, the animal&#x27;s throat will be cut, after which its corpse may be butchered and body parts placed on the altar. In White Umbanda, these sacrifices are deemed misguided, unnecessary, and cruel, with White Umbandistas believing that blood sacrifice attracts the lowest types of spirits and generate bad karma for those engaging in the sacrifice. Various White Umbandistas have also questioned why spiritual beings would require nourishment from physical blood.

===Healing===

Clients typically approach Umbanda seeking assistance for problems to do with relationships, family, employment, finances, and especially health. Clients&#x27; problems are often, although not always, attributed to a spiritual cause; Umbandist healers then claim to treat the spiritual cause of the ailment, not just its biological symptoms. Common causes of harm can include malevolent and ignorant spirits from the underworld, karmic retribution from previous lifetimes, spiritual disequilibrium (&quot;desequilíbrio&quot;), a neglect of the &quot;orixás&quot;, or the curses of living humans, including from the evil eye. Sometimes, the client&#x27;s problems are diagnosed as evidence that they are ignoring their own undeveloped powers as a medium.

One treatment, &quot;descarrêgo&quot;, involves discharging negative energy from around the patient using the healer&#x27;s hands, a technique deriving from the Spiritist &quot;passe&quot;. If a person believes they are being tormented by a malevolent spirit. Umbandist mediums will then cajole the spirit to leave. If a person is repeatedly attacked by spirits, Umbandistas may deem that individual to be especially sensitive to spirits and recommend that they become a medium themselves so as to learn to control the issue. To deal with harmful spirits, the medium may encourage their client to create an Umbandist altar in their home, or to light candles intended to dispel harmful spirits and attract good ones.

Umbandist mediums may prescribe herbal or homeopathic remedies for their clients. Umbandistas often employ herbal baths or washes called &quot;banhos&quot; to cleanse and fortify themselves. Another type of herbal infusion, &quot;amacis&quot;, are more commonly found in Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and are often rooted in Afro-Brazilian medicinal traditions. Herbs used may be collected on specific days based on their astrological associations. Also found in Afro-Brazilian Umbandist groups is a complex healing rite termed the &quot;sacudimento&quot; (shaking), in which offerings are given to the spirits and prayers and songs are offered. There are also Umbandist groups that offer spiritual surgeries, in which tumours and other problems are allegedly cut from the body using etheric means.

The use of spiritual healing does not mean that Umbandists dismiss mainstream medicine; 
practitioners of White Umbanda generally place great faith in the latter, reflecting the ideological positivism inherited from Spiritism. Umbandist mediums have for instance been involved in biomedical HIV prevention programs in Brazilian &quot;favelas&quot;. Practitioners will often see the two methods of healing as complementary, with the spirits dealing primarily with the spiritual aspects of illness rather than the physical ones. Umbandistas have sometimes explained that they are capable of offering certain levels of healing, for instance helping patients to better cope with their ailment, even if they cannot enact a total cure.

==History==

=== Background ===

Umbanda derives from the combination of Afro-Brazilian religions with Spiritism. Amid the Atlantic slave trade, between 3.5 and 4 million enslaved Africans were transported to Brazil, with the numbers reaching their highest levels in the 19th century. The trade continued until 1851, with slavery ultimately being abolished in the country in 1888. In Brazil, enslaved Africans were allowed to join Roman Catholic religious brotherhoods, and it was within these that they privately continued the practice of African-derived religious traditions. Different names for Afro-Brazilian traditions arose in different parts of the country; in Salvador, Bahia, these traditions became Candomblé. The 19th century saw Rio de Janeiro become Brazil&#x27;s economic hub, resulting in growing numbers of Afro-Brazilians moving there. Afro-Brazilian religious groups were first recorded in Rio de Janeiro in the early 20th century, although were probably present in the city beforehand. Candomblé was likely introduced to the city by migrants from Bahia. In the early decades of the 20th century, Candomblé was subject to considerable disapproval from the bourgeoise classes and the dominant Roman Catholic Church, with its &quot;terreiros&quot; often experiencing police repression. Umbanda departed from Candomblé in various ways; it reduced the pantheon of &quot;orixás&quot; found in Candomblé, dropped the practice of animal sacrifice, and simplified the initiation process.

A variant of the American religion of Spiritualism, Spiritism was developed by the Frenchman Allan Kardec. Kardec&#x27;s Spiritism combined Spiritualism&#x27;s general emphasis on spirit mediumship with the Hindu ideas of karma and reincarnation, Christian ethical systems, and the social evolutionism and positivism of Auguste Comte. It placed emphasis on the idea of spirits progressing on a path of moral and intellectual evolution, meaning that there is a distinction between higher, or &quot;evolved&quot; spirits, as well as lesser ones. Spiritism arrived in Brazil , where it was often called &quot;Kardecismo&quot; or &quot;Espiritismo&quot;. Brazil&#x27;s Spiritists still often regarding themselves as Roman Catholics. Spiritism proved popular among the largely white Brazilian bourgeoisie, with Rio becoming the hub for Brazilian Spiritist activity. The first Brazilian Spiritist Federation forming in 1884 as an attempt to unify the movement. Throughout Latin America, Spiritism often hybridised with other religious traditions from the 1860s on. Brown noted that Umbanda was &quot;deeply influenced&quot; by Spiritism but &quot;diverged from it in many important ways&quot;. Umbanda would make the spirits of African and Indigenous American people central to many of its rituals, but in Spiritism these entities were often perceived as being low on the level of spiritual evolution and thus avoided.

===Foundation===
Umbanda is generally regarded as having emerged in the area around Rio de Janeiro during the 1920s. There is a lack of clear evidence regarding Umbanda&#x27;s foundations and it is possible that it emerged from multiple origins around the same time, with various early 20th-century groups having combined Spiritist and Afro-Brazilian religious practices.

A key figure was Zélio Fernandino de Moraes, founder of the first Umbandist group, the Centro Espírita Nossa Senhora da Piedade (Spiritism Center of Our Lady of Mercy). This initially operated in Niterói from the mid-1920s before moving to the centre of Rio de Janeiro in 1938. According to claims that gained prominence in the 1970s, in 1908, when he was 17 years old, Moraes had been cured of an illness by a highly evolved spirit. His parents then took him to a Spiritist ritual, where the spirit Caboclo Seven Crossroads (&quot;Caboclo das Sete Encruzilhadas&quot;) incorporated into him. This spirit defended the appearance of African and indigenous spirits that then incorporated in other mediums, despite the Spiritist prejudice towards them.

Umbanda&#x27;s founders were Kardecist Spiritists disappointed with Spiritist orthodoxy, and who were interested in the country&#x27;s Afro-Brazilian religious traditions, which they deemed more exciting and dramatic than those of the Spiritists. They were mostly white men, largely occupied in middle-class professions involving commerce, government bureaucracy, and the military. Most were sympathetic to the reforms of President Getúlio Vargas, with de Moraes being a local pro-Vargas politician. Brown suggested that Umbanda could be seen as an attempt by middle-class white Brazilians to exert control over the popular religion of the lower classes, drawing comparison with how other lower class practices like samba, capoeira, and Carnival were also embraced as symbols of Brazilian national culture in the early 20th century. By combining Afro-Brazilian and European ideas, Umbanda was presented as a national religion for Brazil at a time when the country was increasingly being presented as a cultural melting pot.

In 1939, Zélio de Moraes formed the first Umbandist federation, the Umbandist Spiritist Union of Brazil. In 1941, the &quot;Primeiro Congresso do Espiritismo de Umbanda&quot; (First Congress of the Spiritism of Umbanda) was held in Rio de Janeiro, representing a collective attempt to codify Umbandist teaching. The congress&#x27; proceedings were published in 1942 and highlight Umbanda&#x27;s origins in Spiritism and the early Umbandistas&#x27; desire to distinguish themselves from Afro-Brazilian traditions. In turn, some Umbandist groups whose membership was predominantly Afro-Brazilian began maintaining that Umbanda was a religion with African origins, and that anyone not using drumming and animal sacrifice in their rites was not truly practicing Umbanda. In turn, White Umbandist leaders retorted that the Africanised traditions were in fact Quimbanda or Candomblé and were falsely using the term &quot;Umbanda&quot;. This confusion may be explained if the term &quot;Umbanda&quot; had been adopted independently both by Zélio de Moraes&#x27; group and by practitioners of various Afro-Brazilian groups.

===After the Second World War===

The collapse of Vargas&#x27; Estado Novo in 1945 allowed Umbanda to be practised more openly. Although it remained concentrated in the cities of southern Brazil, over the coming years Umbanda spread rapidly throughout the country, while in the 1950s and 1960s it also spread to Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina.

In response to the growth of Umbanda, Spiritism, and Pentecostalism, Brazil&#x27;s dominant Roman Catholic Church mounted a campaign against these minority religions, one later formally terminated due to the changes of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. In part to counter Catholic opposition, in the late 1950s Umbandistas began campaigns to get their co-religionists elected to office, typically rallying around Brazilian nationalism and calls for religious freedom. The first open Umbandista elected was Attila Nunes, who became a &quot;vereador&quot; (city councilman) in 1958 and Rio&#x27;s state deputy in 1960. From the 1950s on, six new Umbandist federations formed in Rio, three of them open to more Africanised elements. The most important of these was the more African-focused Umbandist Spiritist Federation, founded in 1952 by Tancredo da Silva Pinto. For the second congress of Umbandistas in 1961, several thousand attendees met in a Rio football stadium.

In 1964, a military dictatorship took power in Brazil. The military government largely protected Umbanda; many soldiers were Umbandistas and the military government regarded the religion as a counter to the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which they perceived as having grown increasingly sympathetic to the political left since the 1950s. From 1965, Umbandist &quot;centros&quot;/&quot;terreiros&quot; were permitted to secure legal recognition with just a civil registration, while Umbanda also gained recognition as a religion on the Brazilian census. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rapid growth of middle-class participation in Umbanda. After the 1960s and 1970s, the number of Umbandistas declined. During the 1970s, Candomblé spread from Bahia into São Paulo, where it grew rapidly, largely at the expense of Umbanda. Some Umbanda temples transformed into Candomblé temples. Conversely, Umbanda saw growth in northern Brazil during this period. The 1970s also saw the rise in attempts to &quot;re-Africanize&quot; Umbanda by emphasising African elements, reflecting a broader revival of interest in African cultural heritage among Afro-Brazilians.

==Demographics==
Diana Brown noted that by the 1970s, there were estimates that between 10 and 20 million people, as much as ten percent of Brazil&#x27;s population, were practicing Umbanda. In 1969, there were estimates that 100,000 Umbandist &quot;centros&quot; were then active in Brazil. The number of Umbandistas declined following the 1970s, although in 1986 Brown suggested that Umbanda still had millions of followers in Brazil. These numbers are not reflected in the census data; in the 2000 Brazilian census, only 397,000 people identified as Umbandistas.

These statistics do not account for those who attend Umbandist services but do not consider themselves Umbandistas. Brown noted that many who visit Umbandist centres do so only in emergencies, thus being &quot;casual participants&quot;, with Hale suggesting that it was these &quot;occasional participants&quot; who ran into the millions. Although originally concentrated in Brazil&#x27;s large southern cities, the religion has spread throughout the country. Brazilian immigrants have also taken the religion to other parts of Latin America like Uruguay as well as to the United States.

Umbandistas come from across Brazil&#x27;s racial and class spectrum, and &quot;centros&quot; vary in their racial and class demographic. Based on a research sample from different Rio de Janeiro &quot;centros&quot; in the late 1960s and 1970s, Brown found that 52 percent of practitioners were white, 29 percent &quot;mulatto&quot;, and 18 percent black. Conversely, writing in the early 21st century, Hale thought that most Umbandistas were people of color and were working or lower class. Brown also suggested that middle-class practitioners have been more influential in Umbanda&#x27;s history; middle-class Umbandistas have included high-ranking military figures, journalists, and politicians. Brown believed that White Umbandist &quot;centros&quot; typically had a diverse socio-economic membership, while Africanized Umbandist &quot;terreiros&quot; had particular appeal for &quot;people in the entertainment world and the arts,&quot; gay people, and those in &quot;the upper sectors&quot; of society who were interested in alternative lifestyles.

Many of those who come to Umbanda were raised in a different religion. Brown&#x27;s research found that most of those who started going to a &quot;centro&quot; learned of it through family or friends. The main reason that people get involved in Umbanda is because they have a problem and hope that the religion&#x27;s spirits will be able to identify the cause and provide a remedy. Health concerns are the primary reason, but other issues are to do with love, family problems, unemployment, finances, or alcoholism. For many clients, visiting the &quot;centro&quot; will be a last resort after they have tried other methods of dealing with their problem. In some instances they turn to Umbanda because medical professionals have been unable to successfully diagnose their problem; alternatively, they approach Umbanda because they cannot afford professional medical treatment. Those involved often keep their practice discreet, sometimes not informing family members that they are Umbandistas.

Some Umbandistas move on to join Candomblé, believing that the latter deals with more powerful supernatural forces and thus resolves problems more readily. Umbanda is sometimes described as an appropriate preparation for Candomblé, and the move from Umbanda to Candomblé can also bring greater prestige within Brazilian society. Umbandist mediums sometimes hold critical views of Candomblé, regarding it as authoritarian, and criticising the high prices charged for initiation into it. Other Umbandistas have left the religion for Pentecostalism.

==Reception and influence==

Umbanda has faced opposition from other religions in Brazil. Spiritists have often looked down upon Umbanda because it deals with what they regard as less developed spirits. From the 1950s, Brazil&#x27;s Roman Catholic establishment campaigned against Umbanda, portraying it as a primitive religion frequented by ignorant people. A 1961 book by the Franciscan friar Boaventura Kloppenburg, for instance, presented Umbanda as a heresy based on superstition which encouraged sexual permissiveness and harmed its practitioners&#x27; mental health. The religion has also been criticised by Protestant groups, which in Brazil are largely Pentecostal, and which see their own religion and Umbanda as mutually incompatible. Many Brazilian Pentecostals openly defined their religious identity in opposition to Umbanda and Candomblé, traditions they believe are associated with the Devil. Throughout much of the 20th century, Umbanda also faced hostility from Brazilian intellectuals on both the political left and right.

Scholarly research into Afro-Brazilian religions began in the late 19th century, although for much of the 20th century the focus was on Candomblé and other traditions deemed to have a &quot;purer&quot; African origin than the more syncretic Umbanda. In the early 1960s, a group of sociologists at the University of São Paulo began to study Umbanda, the most prominent being Roger Bastide, who saw the religion as an expression of urban industrial change. Over following decades, research focused primarily among Afro-Brazilian Umbandistas, rather than White Umbandist groups. In 2016, following a study by the Instituto Rio Patrimônio da Humanidade (Rio Heritage of Humanity Institute), Umbanda became one of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritages.

Umbanda has also influenced some practitioners of Santo Daime, and a tradition called Umbandaime has emerged as a hybridized religion combining elements of both. Umbandist trance states have also been studied by Heathens seeking to create new forms of &quot;seiðr&quot;.

<doc id="400246" wikidata="Q1507700" url="?curid=400246" title="Nihon-shiki romanization">
<text>(, romanized as in the system itself) is a romanization system for transliterating the Japanese language into the Latin alphabet. Among the major romanization systems for Japanese, it is the most regular one and has an almost one-to-one relation to the kana writing system.

==History==
It was invented by physicist Aikitsu Tanakadate (田中館 愛橘) in 1885, with the intention to replace the Hepburn system of romanization. Tanakadate&#x27;s intention was to replace the traditional kanji and kana system of writing Japanese completely by a romanized system, which he felt would make it easier for Japan to compete with Western countries. Since the system was intended for Japanese people to use to write their own language, it is much more regular than Hepburn romanization, and unlike Hepburn&#x27;s system, it makes no effort to make itself easier to pronounce for English-speakers.

Nihon-shiki was followed by Kunrei-shiki, which was adopted in 1937, after a political debate over whether Nihon-shiki or Hepburn-shiki should be used by the Japanese government. Kunrei-shiki is nearly identical to Nihon-shiki, but it merges syllable pairs di/zi ぢ/じ, du/zu づ/ず, dya/zya ぢゃ/じゃ, dyu/zyu ぢゅ/じゅ, dyo/zyo ぢょ/じょ, wi/i ゐ/い, we/e ゑ/え, kwa/ka くゎ/か, and gwa/ga ぐゎ/が, whose pronunciations in Modern Standard Japanese are now identical. For example, the word かなづかい, rendered &quot;kanadukai&quot; in Nihon-shiki, is pronounced as &quot;kanazukai&quot; in modern Japanese, and is romanized as such in Kunrei. The International Organization for Standardization has standardized Kunrei-shiki, under ISO 3602. The JSL system, which is intended for use instructing foreign students of Japanese, is also based on Nihon-shiki. However, some Japanese-speakers still distinguish di from zi and du from zu and so Nihon-shiki spelling is not entirely obsolete.

Nihon-shiki is considered the most regular of the romanization systems for the Japanese language because it maintains a strict &quot;one kana, two letters&quot; form. Because it has unique forms corresponding to each of the respective pairs of &quot;kana&quot; homophones listed above, it is the only formal system of romanization that can allow (almost) lossless (&quot;round trip&quot;) mapping, but the standard does not mandate the precise spellings needed to distinguish ô 王/おう, ou 追う/おう and oo 大/おお. (See the hiragana article for more details.)

===Notes===
*Letters in red are obsolete in modern Japanese.
*Even when &quot;he&quot; へ is used as a particle, it is written as &quot;he&quot;, not &quot;e&quot; (Kunrei-shiki/Hepburn).
*Even when &quot;ha&quot; は is used as a particle, it is written as &quot;ha&quot;, not &quot;wa&quot;.
*Even when &quot;wo&quot; を is used as a particle, it is written as &quot;wo&quot;, not &quot;o&quot;.
*Long vowels are indicated by a circumflex accent: long o is written &quot;ô&quot;, unlike Hepburn, which uses a macron.
*Syllabic n ん is written as &quot;n&quot; before consonants but as &quot;n″&quot; before vowels and &quot;y&quot;.
*Geminate consonants are always marked by doubling the consonant following the sokuon (っ).

<text>Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848 – January 13, 1929) was an American lawman in the American West, including Dodge City, Deadwood, and Tombstone. Earp was involved in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw Cochise County Cowboys. While Wyatt is often depicted as the key figure in the shootout, his brother Virgil was both Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone City Marshal that day and had considerably more experience in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal than did Wyatt. Virgil made the decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town and to disarm the Cowboys. Wyatt was only a temporary assistant marshal to his brother.

In 1874, Earp arrived in the boomtown of Wichita, Kansas, where his reputed wife opened a brothel. Wyatt was arrested more than once for his presence in a brothel where he may have been a pimp. He was later appointed to the Wichita police force and developed a solid reputation as a lawman but was fined and &quot;not rehired as a police officer&quot; after getting into a physical altercation with a political opponent of his boss. Earp immediately left Wichita, following his brother James to Dodge City, Kansas, where his brother&#x27;s wife Bessie and Earp&#x27;s common-law wife Sally operated a brothel. He later became an assistant city marshal. In late 1878, he went to Texas to track down an outlaw, Dave Rudabaugh, and met John &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday, whom Earp credited with saving his life.

Throughout his life, Earp moved between boom towns. He left Dodge in 1879 and moved with his brothers James and Virgil to Tombstone where a silver boom was underway. The Earps clashed with a group of outlaws known as the &quot;Cowboys&quot;. Wyatt, Virgil, and younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton, who threatened to kill the Earps on several occasions. The conflict escalated, culminating in the shootout at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, where the Earps and Doc Holliday killed three Cowboys. During the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was murdered. Wyatt, Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, and others formed a federal posse that killed three more Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, unlike his brothers Virgil and Morgan or Doc Holliday, which added to his mystique after his death.

After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco where he reunited with Josephine Marcus, and they lived as husband and wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining interests and a saloon. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match and called a foul, which led many to believe he fixed the fight. Earp and Marcus joined the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. He and Charlie Hoxie paid for a liquor license to open the Dexter, a two-story saloon, and made an estimated . But, Josephine had a notorious gambling habit and the money did not last. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to one of several small, modest cottages they rented in Los Angeles. He made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told, but he was portrayed during his lifetime only very briefly in one film: &quot;Wild Bill Hickok&quot; (1923).

Earp died on January 13, 1929. Known as a Western lawman, gunfighter, and boxing referee, he had earned notoriety for his handling of the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey fight and his role in the O.K. Corral gunfight. This changed only after his death when the extremely flattering biography &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; by Stuart N. Lake was published in 1931, becoming a bestseller and creating his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Earp&#x27;s fame and notoriety have been increased by films, television shows, biographies, and works of fiction. Long after his death, he has many devoted detractors and admirers.
==Early life==

Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp was born on March 19, 1848, in Illinois, the fourth child of Nicholas Porter Earp and his second wife, Virginia Ann Cooksey. He was named after his father&#x27;s commanding officer in the Mexican–American War, Captain Wyatt Berry Stapp, of the 2nd Company Illinois Mounted Volunteers. Some evidence supports Wyatt Earp&#x27;s birthplace as 406 S. 3rd St. in Monmouth, Illinois, though the street address is disputed by Monmouth College professor and historian William Urban. 

The Wyatt Earp Birthplace, Inc., 1986, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places 1999. The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency visited the home at 406 So. 3rd St. and submitted the nomination. Wyatt had seven full siblingsJames, Virgil, Martha, Morgan, Warren, Virginia, and Adeliaand an elder half-brother and half-sister, Newton and Mariah-Ann Earp, from his father&#x27;s first marriage.

In March 1849, or in early 1850, Nicholas Earp joined about a hundred other people in a plan to relocate to San Bernardino County, California, where he intended to buy farmland. Just west of Monmouth on the journey, their daughter Martha became ill. The family stopped and Nicholas bought a new farm northeast of Pella, Iowa. Martha died there on May 26, 1856.

Nicholas and Virginia Earp&#x27;s last child Adelia was born in June 1861 in Pella. Newton, James, and Virgil joined the Union Army on November 11, 1861. Their father was busy recruiting and drilling local companies, so Wyatt and his two younger brothers Morgan and Warren were left in charge of tending of corn. Wyatt was only 13 years old, too young to enlist, but he tried on several occasions to run away and join the army. Each time, his father found him and brought him home. James was severely wounded in Fredericktown, Missouri, and returned home in summer 1863. Newton and Virgil fought several battles in Missouri, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and later followed the family to California.

==Adult life==
===California===
On May 12, 1864, Nicholas Earp organized a wagon train and headed to San Bernardino, California, arriving on December 17. By late summer 1865, Virgil found work as a driver for Phineas Banning&#x27;s stage coach line in California&#x27;s Imperial Valley, and 16-year-old Wyatt assisted. In spring 1866, Wyatt became a teamster transporting cargo for Chris Taylor. From 1866 to 1868, he drove cargo over on the wagon road from Wilmington through San Bernardino, then Las Vegas, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory.

In spring 1868 Earp was hired to transport supplies needed to build the Union Pacific Railroad. He learned gambling and boxing while working on the rail head in the Wyoming Territory. He developed a reputation from officiating boxing matches and refereed a fight between John Shanssey and Prof. Mike Donovan on July 4, 1869, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in front of 3,000 spectators.

===Lawman and marriage===
In spring 1868 the Earps moved east again to Lamar, Missouri, where Wyatt&#x27;s father Nicholas became the local constable. Wyatt rejoined the family the next year. Nicholas resigned as constable on November 17, 1869, to become the Justice of the Peace. Wyatt was appointed constable in his place.

===First gunfight===
Virgil soon went to Missouri and Wyatt to Beardstown, Illinois, south, where he spent the summer of 1869. Beardstown was undergoing a boom thanks to a rail line being laid through town.

During that summer in Beardstown, a railroad brakeman named Tom Pinard mocked Wyatt, calling him &quot;the California boy&quot;, a euphemism for coward, implying that Wyatt had gone to California to avoid serving in the Civil War. Although Wyatt had attempted to join the army when he was 13 and been stopped by his father, he took offense at Piner&#x27;s remarks. They fought inside Walton&#x27;s Hotel, a brothel owned by John T. Walton, and Wyatt tossed Pinard outside. Pinard drew his gun and so did Wyatt. The two men exchanged shots; Wyatt wounded Pinard in the hip.

===Marriage to Urilla Sutherland===
In late 1869 Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland, daughter of William and Permelia Sutherland who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar, Missouri, the Barton County seat. They were married by Earp&#x27;s father on January 10, 1870. Wyatt bought a lot on the outskirts of town for $50 where he built a house in August 1870. Urilla was about to deliver their first child when she died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and house for $75.

=== Lawsuits and charges ===

Earp went through a downward spiral after Urilla&#x27;s death, and he had a series of legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against him in the amount of $200 (about $4,500 today) and his sureties which included his father. He was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which were designated to fund local schools, but had failed to turn the money over to the county.

On March 28, 1871, Earp, Edward Kennedy, and John Shown were charged with stealing two horses from William Keys while in the Indian country, &quot;each of the value of $100&quot;. Only three days later on March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against him alleging that he had erased and rewritten a dollar figure on a judgement against Cromwell and that Earp had collected and kept the difference. The court seized Cromwell&#x27;s mowing machine and sold it for $38 to make up the difference between what Earp turned in and what Cromwell owed. Cromwell&#x27;s suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine. 

On April 6, Deputy U.S. Marshal J. G. Owens arrested Earp for the horse theft. Commissioner James Churchill arraigned him on April 14 and set bail at $500. Wyatt was summoned to appear at a hearing on the matter. Before he could appear, Wyatt sold his property, escaped through the roof of the jail, and headed for Peoria, Illinois.

On May 15, an indictment was issued against Earp, Kennedy, and Shown. John Shown&#x27;s wife Anna claimed that Earp and Kennedy got her husband drunk and then threatened his life to persuade him to help steal the horses. On June 5, Kennedy was acquitted while the case remained against Earp and Shown. The new constable wrote that he had &quot;good reason to believe [and] does believe that Wyatt S. Earp def[initely] is not a resident of this state, that Wyatt S. Earp has absconded or absented himself from his usual place of abode in this state so that the ordinary process of law cannot be processed against him.&quot;

===Pimping arrests in Peoria===
Peoria had grown to a city of 22,000 in the 1870s and had earned a reputation as a wide-open city whose community leaders mostly ignored illegal alcohol use, gambling, prostitution, and other vices. But Peoria police raided a brothel on February 24, 1872, and arrested Wyatt and Morgan Earp, George Randall, and four women including Jane Haspel. The men were charged with &quot;keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame,&quot; and later fined $20 and court costs. In Root&#x27;s &quot;Peoria City Directory for 1872–73&quot;, published on March 1, 1872, Wyatt is a resident in the home of Jane Haspel at Washington Street near the corner of Hamilton. When he was arrested, he was not merely a customer.

Both Earps were arrested for the same crime again on May 11. &quot;Wyat Earp and his brother Morgan Earp were each fined $44.55 and as they had not the money and would not work, they languish in the cold and silent calaboose...&quot; They were freed in time for their sister Adelia&#x27;s eleventh birthday on June 16, 1872. Wyatt and Morgan visited her in the family home in Lamar, Missouri. Wyatt returned to the Peoria area.

On September 10, 1872, he was arrested aboard the &quot;Beardstown Gunboat&quot;, a 50-foot keelboat fitted with a ramshackle, eight-bedroom house and used as a floating brothel. To evade the local authorities, the boat picked up passengers and made slow runs along the Illinois River, tying up at various points along the way. It was owned by John T. Walton, the same man who three years earlier operated the brothel in Beardstown where Wyatt had his first gunfight. A prostitute named Sally Heckell was arrested with him, and she called herself his wife; she was likely the 16-year-old daughter of Jane Haspel.

The &quot;Peoria Daily National Democrat&quot; reported:

By calling Earp the &quot;Peoria Bummer,&quot; the newspaper put him in a class of &quot;contemptible loafers who impose on hard-working citizens&quot;, a &quot;beggar&quot; and worse than tramps. They were men of poor character who were chronic lawbreakers, and Peoria constables probably considered him to be a pimp. Earp and Walton were fined $44, more than any others who were arrested. The size of the fines may indicate that the judge considered them to be pimps and not merely customers. Wyatt soon left Peoria for Wichita, Kansas.

During a conversation with Earp years later, Stuart N. Lake took notes in which Earp claimed that he&#x27;d been hunting buffalo during the winter of 1871–1872. Earp told Lake that he &quot;arrived in Wichita direct from my buffalo hunt in &#x27;74,&quot; but there&#x27;s no evidence that he ever hunted buffalo. He may have made up the story to account for the time he was pimping in Illinois and Missouri.

===Wichita, Kansas===
In early 1874 Earp and Sally moved southwest to the growing cow town of Wichita where his brother James ran a brothel with his wife Nellie &quot;Bessie&quot; Ketchum. Local arrest records show that Sally and Nellie managed a brothel there from early 1874 to the middle of 1876. Wyatt was likely a pimp, although historian Gary L. Roberts believes that he was an enforcer or bouncer. When the Kansas state census was completed in June 1875, Sally was no longer living with Wyatt, James, and Bessie.

Wichita was a railroad terminal and a destination for cattle drives from Texas. The town would fill with drunken, armed cowboys celebrating the end of their long journey when the cattle drive arrived, and lawmen were kept busy. Most drovers arrived in town in June and completed shipping by early fall. When the annual cattle drive ended and the cowboys left, Earp searched for something else to do. The &quot;Wichita City Eagle&quot; reported on October 29, 1874, that he had helped an off-duty police officer find thieves who had stolen a man&#x27;s wagon. Earp officially joined the Wichita marshal&#x27;s office on April 21, 1875, after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal (or police chief), making $100 per month. He also dealt faro at the Long Branch Saloon. In late 1875 the Wichita Beacon published this story:

Earp&#x27;s stint as a Wichita deputy came to a sudden end on April 2, 1876, when former marshal Bill Smith accused him of using his office to hire his brothers as lawmen. Earp beat Smith in a fist-fight and was fined $30. The local newspaper reported, &quot;It is but justice to Earp to say he has made an excellent officer.&quot; Meagher won the election, but the city council voted against rehiring Earp. 

Texas Longhorn cattle carried a tick that spread Texas cattle fever to other cattle breeds. Alarmed Kansas farmers persuaded the Kansas State Legislature in 1866 to establish a quarantine line in central Kansas. This prohibited Texas Longhorns from entering the heavily settled, eastern portion of the state. In 1876, farmers in central Kansas renewed pressure on the Kansas State Legislature to move the quarantine line further west, eliminating Wichita and the other cowtowns from the cattle trade. As a result, Dodge City became the &quot;queen of the cow towns.&quot; Wyatt&#x27;s brother James and his wife moved in 1876 west to Dodge City and opened a new brothel, and Wyatt soon followed them.

===Dodge City and Deadwood===


After 1875 Dodge City, Kansas, became a major terminal for cattle drives from Texas along the Chisholm Trail. Earp was appointed assistant marshal in Dodge City under Marshal Lawrence Deger around May 1876. At some point he met prostitute Mattie Blaylock, who became his common-law wife until 1881. He and Morgan left Dodge for Deadwood in the Dakota Territory on September 9, 1876, with a team of horses only to find that all the land was already tied up in mining claims, so Morgan decided to return to Dodge. Earp remained and made a deal to buy all the wood that a local individual had cut and put his horses to work during the winter of 1876–1877 hauling firewood into camp. He made about $5,000 in profit but was unable to file any mining claims, so he returned to Dodge City in the spring.
On Sunday, January 9, 1876, while sitting in the back room of the Custom House saloon, Earp&#x27;s revolver slipped from his holster. He had left the hammer on a loaded chamber and when the gun hit his chair, a .45 caliber round discharged, leaving a hole in Earp&#x27;s coat. The shot &quot;got up a lively stampede from the room.&quot; Earp rejoined the Dodge City police in spring 1877 at the request of Mayor James H. Kelley. The Dodge City newspaper reported in July 1878 that he had been fined one dollar for slapping a muscular prostitute named Frankie Bell, who &quot;heaped epithets upon the unoffending head of Mr. Earp to such an extent as to provide a slap from the ex-officer,&quot; according to the account. Bell spent the night in jail and was fined $20, while Earp&#x27;s fine was the legal minimum.

In October 1877 outlaw Dave Rudabaugh robbed a Santa Fe Railroad construction camp and fled south. Earp was given a temporary commission as deputy U.S. Marshal and left Dodge City, following Rudabaugh over through Fort Clark, Texas, where the newspaper reported his presence on January 22, 1878, and then on to Fort Griffin, Texas.

In Fort Griffin, located between the military fort bearing the same name and the Clear Fork of the Brazos River, he went to the Bee Hive Saloon. It was the largest in town and owned by John Shanssey, whom Earp had known since he was 21. Shanssey told Earp that Rudabaugh had passed through town earlier in the week, but did not know where he was headed. Shanssey suggested that Earp ask gambler Doc Holliday, who played cards with Rudabaugh. Doc told Earp that Rudabaugh was headed back into Kansas.

By May 11, 1878, the Dodge newspapers reported that Earp had returned. The &quot;Dodge City Times&quot; noted on May 14 that he&#x27;d been appointed Assistant Marshal for $75 per month, serving under Charlie Bassett. Doc Holliday also showed up in Dodge City with his common-law wife Big Nose Kate during mid 1878. Ed Morrison and another two dozen cowboys rode into Dodge and shot up the town, galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door to find numerous guns pointing at him; another version of the story has it that only 3-5 cowboys were there. In both versions Holliday was playing cards in the back and he put his pistol at Morrison&#x27;s head, forcing him and his men to disarm. Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two became life-long friends.

While in Dodge City Earp became acquainted with brothers James and Bat Masterson and gambler Luke Short.

===George Hoyt shooting===
George Hoyt (spelled sometimes &quot;Hoy&quot;) and other drunken cowboys shot their guns wildly around 3:00 am on July 26, 1878, including three shots into Dodge City&#x27;s Comique Theater, causing comedian Eddie Foy, Sr. to throw himself to the stage floor in the middle of his act. Fortunately, no one was injured. Assistant Marshal Earp and policeman Bat Masterson responded, along with several citizens, and opened fire with their pistols at the fleeing horsemen. The riders crossed the Arkansas River bridge south of town but Hoyt fell from his horse, wounded in the arm or leg. Earp later told biographer Stuart Lake that he saw Hoyt through his gun sights, illuminated against the morning horizon, and he fired a fatal shot that killed him that day; but the &quot;Dodge City Times&quot; reported that Hoyt developed gangrene and died on August 21 after his leg was amputated.

==Move to Tombstone, Arizona==
Dodge City had been a frontier cowtown for several years, but by 1879 it had begun to settle down. Virgil Earp was the town constable in Prescott, Arizona Territory, and he wrote to Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. He later wrote, &quot;In 1879 Dodge was beginning to lose much of the snap which had given it a charm to men of reckless blood, and I decided to move to Tombstone, which was just building up a reputation.&quot;

Earp resigned from the Dodge City police force on September 9, 1879, and traveled to Las Vegas in New Mexico Territory with his common-law wife Mattie, his brother Jim, and Jim&#x27;s wife Bessie. There they reunited with Holliday and Big Nose Kate, and the six of them went on to Prescott. Virgil was appointed deputy U.S. marshal for the Tombstone mining district on November 27, 1879, three days before they left for Tombstone, by U.S. Marshal for the Arizona Territory Crawley P. Dake.

Virgil was to operate out of Tombstone, from Prescott. His territory included the entire southeast area of the Arizona Territory. Wyatt, Virgil, and James Earp traveled to Tombstone. Tombstone had been founded on March 5, 1879, with about a hundred people living in tents and a few shacks. The Earps arrived with their wives on December 1, 1879, while Doc Holliday remained in Prescott where the gambling afforded better opportunities.

Tombstone had already grown to about 1,000 residents. Wyatt brought horses and a buckboard wagon which he planned to convert into a stagecoach, but he found two established stage lines already running. He later said that he made most of his money in Tombstone as a professional gambler. The three Earps and Robert J. Winders filed a location notice on December 6, 1879, for the First North Extension of the Mountain Maid Mine. They also bought an interest in the Vizina mine and some water rights.

Jim worked as a barkeep, but none of their other business interests proved fruitful. Wyatt was hired in April or May 1880 by Wells Fargo agent Fred J. Dodge as a shotgun messenger on stagecoaches when they transported Wells Fargo strongboxes. In late July 1880 younger brother Morgan arrived, leaving his wife Lou in Temescal, California (near San Bernardino). Warren Earp moved to Tombstone. Doc Holliday arrived from Prescott in September with in gambling winnings in his pocket.

===First confrontation with the outlaw Cowboys===
On July 25, 1880, Army Captain Joseph H. Hurst asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to assist him in tracking outlaw Cowboys who had stolen six Army mules from Fort Rucker, Arizona. Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, and they found the mules at the McLaurys&#x27; ranch. McLaury was a &#x27;Cowboy,&#x27; a term in that region that generally referred to a loose association of outlaws, some of whom also were land-owners and ranchers. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers. They found a branding iron that the Cowboys had used to change the &quot;U.S.&quot; brand into &quot;D.8.&quot; Stealing mules was a federal offense because the animals were government property.

Cowboy Frank Patterson made an agreement with Captain Hurst, and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw, with the understanding that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and he charged McLaury with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the handbill in &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; on July 30, 1880. McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly &quot;Nuggett&quot;, calling Hurst &quot;unmanly,&quot; &quot;a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar,&quot; and accusing him of stealing the mules himself. Hurst later cautioned the Earp brothers that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that McLaury had accosted him and said, &quot;If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.&quot; A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him that they would kill him if he ever followed them as he had done before.

===Becomes deputy sheriff===
County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell appointed Virgil Earp as deputy sheriff for the eastern part of Pima County, Arizona, on July 28, 1880, which included Tombstone. The sheriff&#x27;s position was worth more than per year, because he was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid. Former Democrat state legislator Johnny Behan, a future rival of Wyatt&#x27;s, arrived in September 1880. Wyatt, appointed a deputy by his brother, then passed his Wells Fargo job as shotgun messenger to his brother Morgan. Wyatt did his job well, and his name was mentioned nearly every week from August through November in &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; or the &quot;Nugget&quot; newspapers.

===Town marshal shot===
On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White attempted to break up a group of five late-night, drunken revelers shooting at the moon on Allen Street. Deputy Sheriff Earp was in Owens Saloon a block away, though unarmed. Morgan and Fred Dodge were in a cabin nearby. Wyatt heard the shooting and ran to the scene. He borrowed a pistol from Fred Dodge and went to assist White. As he approached White, he saw White attempt to disarm Curly Bill Brocius and the gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Throughout the shooting Earp was standing by a chimney that was struck repeatedly by gunfire. He buffaloed Brocius, knocking him to the ground, then he grabbed Brocius by the collar and told him to get up. Brocius asked, &quot;What have I done?&quot; Fred Dodge recalled in a letter he wrote to Stuart Lake in 1928 what he had witnessed:
Earp altered his story later on, telling John H. Flood Jr. that he did not see Brocius&#x27;s pistol on the ground in the dark until afterward. The pistol contained one expended cartridge and five live rounds.

Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so that his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court, and Virgil and Wyatt escorted him to Tucson to stand trialpossibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting. On December 27, 1880, Earp testified that White&#x27;s shooting was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, saying that he had not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Brocius&#x27;s single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement was introduced, which White had made, stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge agreed and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Earp had pistol-whipped him, and became an enemy to the Earps.

===Shibell election===
On November 2, 1880, the Democratic incumbent Charles Shibell ran for re-election as county sheriff against Republican challenger Robert H. Paul. Initially, Shibell was declared the winner by a margin of 58 votes under suspicious circumstances. James C. Hancock reported that Cowboys Curly Bill Brocius and Johnny Ringo had served as election officials in San Simon Precinct, although biographer David Johnson places Ringo in New Mexico with Ike Clanton on November 1, the day before the election. 

Curly Bill had been arrested and jailed in Tucson on October 28 for shooting Marshal White, and he was still there on election day. The home of John Magill was used as the polling place. The precinct only contained about 10 eligible voters (another source says 50), but the Cowboys gathered non-voters such as the children and Chinese and had them cast ballots. They then gave names to all the dogs, donkeys, and poultry and cast ballots in their names for Shibell. Precinct 27 in the San Simon Valley in northern Cochise County, turned out 104 votes, 103 of them for Shibell. The election board met on November 14 and declared Shibell the winner.

Paul filed a lawsuit on November 19 contesting the election results, alleging that Shibell&#x27;s Cowboy supporters Ike Clanton, Curly Bill Brocius, and Frank McLaury had conspired in ballot stuffing. In late January 1881 Chief Justice of Arizona C. G. W. French ruled in Paul&#x27;s favor, but Shibell appealed. A recount found that Paul had 402 votes and Shibell had 354. In April 1881 the election commission found that a mysterious &quot;Henry Johnson&quot; was responsible for certifying the ballots. This turned out to be the same James K. Johnson who had been shooting up Allen Street on the night when Marshal White was killed. Moreover, he had testified at Curly Bill&#x27;s preliminary hearing after he had shot Fred White. Johnson later testified in the election hearing and said that the ballots had been left in the care of Ike Clanton&#x27;s brother Phineas. None of the witnesses during the election hearing reported any ballots being cast by dogs.

Paul was declared the winner of the Pima County sheriff election. However, the election was a moot point by then, as Paul could not replace Behan with Earp because Cochise County was created out of the eastern portion of Pima County on January 1, 1881.

===Earp loses reappointment===
Earp served as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County for only three months. The region was strongly Republican and Bob Paul had been expected to defeat Shibell. Earp was a Republican and believed that he would continue in the job. Given how fast eastern Pima County was growing, many expected that it would soon be split off into its own county, with Tombstone as its seat; Earp hoped to win the job as the new county sheriff and continue receiving ten percent of all tax money collected. Southern Pacific was the major landholder, so tax collection was a relatively easy process. In 1882 the Cochise County sheriff earned in fees.

Earp resigned from the sheriff&#x27;s office on November 9, 1880, and Shibell immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County. Behan had considerably more political experience than Earp, as he had served as Yavapai County sheriff from 1871 to 1873. He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice, representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879. Behan moved to the northwest Arizona Territory, where he served as the Mohave County recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet in 1879.

===Behan wins election===
Earp and Behan applied for the new position of Cochise County sheriff, which paid the office holder ten percent of the fees and taxes collected, as did the Pima County sheriff job. Earp thought that he had a good chance to win because he was the former undersheriff in the region and a Republican, like Arizona Territorial Governor John C. Fremont. However, Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott.

Earp later testified at the O.K. Corral hearing that he and Behan had made a deal. He said that Behan and he agreed that, if Earp withdrew his application, Behan would appoint him as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but he did not keep his end of the bargain and instead chose Harry Woods as undersheriff, who was a prominent Democrat. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted that he had lied. He said that he broke his promise to Earp because of an incident which occurred shortly before his appointment when Earp learned that Ike and Billy Clanton had one of his prize horses which had been stolen more than a year before. 

Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse and overtook Behan along the way, who was riding in a wagon. Behan also was heading to the ranch to serve an electioneering subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as to what happened next, but Earp testified that Billy Clanton gave up the horse when Earp arrived at the ranch, even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan&#x27;s testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. The incident embarrassed the Clantons and Behan, and Behan later testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.

===Relationship with Sadie Marcus===
Later in life, Josephine Sarah Marcus aggressively protected hers and Wyatt&#x27;s privacy while in Tombstone. Marcus was deliberately vague about this period, causing modern researchers to question what she was hiding. She said that she first visited Tombstone as part of the Pauline Markham Theater Troupe on December 1, 1879, for a one-week engagement, but modern researchers have not found any record that she was ever part of the theater company. The many contradictions in her story have led to considerable speculation about her past.

Researchers have identified two women with similar names in the same region of the Arizona Territory whose lives bear many striking parallels. Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus both made a stagecoach journey from San Francisco to Prescott, Arizona Territory; both traveled with a black woman named Julia; both were sexual partners with Behan; both were 19 years old, born in New York City, and had parents from Prussia. The only difference noted in the 1880 census is in their occupations: the Sadie who lived in San Francisco is listed as &quot;At home&quot;, while the Sadie in Tip Top is recorded as a &quot;Courtesan&quot;. Marcus said that her parents hid her activities, and they may have been covering for her when the census taker was a neighbor who knew the family.

Behan owned a saloon in Tip Top, Arizona, where he maintained a prostitute named Sadie Mansfield, and he moved to Tombstone in September 1880. &quot;Sadie&quot; was a popular nickname for &quot;Sarah&quot;, and prostitutes commonly changed their first names. Sadie Mansfield, the Tip Top prostitute, may have returned to San Francisco and then rejoined Behan in Tombstone in September 1880 as Sadie Marcus, where they continued their relationship.

In early 1881, Sadie found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she still used the Behan surname through mid-year. Wyatt was in a relationship with Mattie Blaylock, a former prostitute. Earp named a mining claim he filed on February 16, 1880 &quot;Mattie Blaylock&quot;. Modern researchers have found Blaylock listed as Earp&#x27;s wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used opiate and painkiller, and later committed suicide. When Marcus learned that Stuart Lake had discovered the existence of Blaylock, she successfully demanded that he omit her from his book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;.

After Marcus arrived in Tombstone with Behan, Earp apparently developed an interest in her, although there are no records in Tombstone of a relationship between them. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Sadie together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.

In April 1882, shortly after he left Tombstone, there is evidence that Earp had developed feelings for Marcus. The Earp posse, by that time on their vendetta ride, arrived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, intending to stay for two weeks. Wyatt and Holliday had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp&#x27;s life in Dodge City three years prior. Wyatt was staying with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of the local board of trade, and first Mayor of Albuquerque. Like Marcus, Jaffa was Jewish.

During their stay in Albuquerque, Earp and Holliday ate at the Retreat Restaurant owned by &quot;Fat Charlie&quot;. Former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero wrote in 1940 that &quot;Holliday said something about Earp becoming &#x27;a damn Jew-boy&#x27;. Earp became angry and left. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp&#x27;s woman was a Jewess. Earp did &quot;mezuzah&quot; when entering the house.&quot; The &quot;Albuquerque Evening Review&quot; reported that Doc Holliday &quot;became intoxicated and indiscreet in his remarks, which offended Wyatt and caused the party to break up, Holliday going with Tipton.&quot;

Earp&#x27;s anger at Holliday&#x27;s ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Marcus were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at that time in the 1940s, the possibility of a prior relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while in Tombstone was unknown. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the people involved.

Marcus went to great lengths to sanitize her own and Wyatt&#x27;s history. For example, as mentioned, she worked hard to keep her name and the name of Wyatt&#x27;s second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake&#x27;s 1931 book, &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;, and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp&#x27;s biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists.

===Interest in mining and gambling===
Losing the undersheriff position left Earp without a job in Tombstone; however, he and his brothers were beginning to make some money on their mining claims in the area. In January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Milt Joyce gave Earp a quarter-interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession at the time. Earp invited his friend Bat Masterson to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the saloon, and he telegraphed Luke Short in June 1881 to offer him a job as a faro dealer. Masterson remained until April 1881, when he returned to Dodge City to assist his brother Jim.

On October 8, 1881, Doc Holliday got into a dispute with Cowboy and outlaw John Tyler in the Oriental Saloon. A rival gambling concession operator hired someone to disrupt Wyatt&#x27;s business. When Tyler started a fight after losing a bet, Wyatt threw him out of the saloon. Holliday later wounded Oriental owners Milt Joyce and his partner William Parker and was convicted of assault.

===Facing down a lynch mob===
Michael O&#x27;Rourke killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company, and said that it was in self defense. Schneider was well liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered and threatened to lynch O&#x27;Rourke on the spot. Lake&#x27;s biography describes Earp single-handedly dispersing the mob, but the &quot;Epitaph&quot; gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for calming the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp and Johnny Behan. Nevertheless, Lake&#x27;s account added to Earp&#x27;s modern legend as a lawman.

===Stagecoach robbers kill two===
Tensions increased between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys through 1881. Three Cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear &amp; Company stagecoach on March 15, 1881, at 10:00pm, which was reportedly carrying in silver bullion. The amount of bullion that the stagecoach actually carried is questioned by modern researchers because it would have weighed about ; the value of silver at the time was $1 an ouncea significant weight for a team of horses. According to Wells Fargo agent John Q. Jackson, a stagecoach typically carried an Express Box containing bullion weighing only .

The holdup took place near Benson, during which the robbers killed driver Eli &quot;Budd&quot; Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig. The Earps and a posse tracked the men down and arrested Luther King, who confessed that he had been holding the reins while Bill Leonard, Harry &quot;The Kid&quot; Head, and Jim Crain robbed the stage. They arrested King, and Sheriff Johnny Behan escorted him to jail, but somehow King walked in the front door and out the back door.

During the hearing into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt testified that he offered Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury the $3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) in return for information about the identities of the three robbers. He testified that he had other motives for his plan; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. He told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Clanton from Wells Fargo, ensuring that the reward applied for capturing the killers dead or alive. According to testimony given by Wyatt and Virgil, both McLaury and Clanton agreed to provide information to assist in capturing Leonard, Head, and Crain, but they never had a chance to fulfill the agreement. All three suspects were killed when attempting other robberies.

In his testimony at the court hearing, Clanton said that Earp did not want to capture the men but to kill them. He told the court that Earp wanted to conceal his family&#x27;s involvement in the Benson stage robbery and had sworn him to secrecy, and that Morgan Earp had confided in him that he and Wyatt had &quot;piped off $1,400 to Doc Holliday and Bill Leonard&quot;, who were supposed to be on the stage the night when Bud Philpot was killed. Clanton told the court, &quot;I was not going to have anything to do with helping to capture...&quot; and then he corrected himself &quot;...kill Bill Leonard, Crane, and Harry Head.&quot; Clanton denied having any knowledge of the Wells Fargo telegram confirming the reward money.

===September stagecoach robbery===
Meanwhile, tensions increased between the Earps and the McLaurys when Cowboys robbed the passenger stage on the Sandy Bob Line in the Tombstone area on September 8, bound for nearby Bisbee, Arizona. The masked robbers robbed the passengers and the strongbox, but they were recognized by their voices and language. They were identified as Deputy Sheriff Pete Spence (an alias for Elliot Larkin Ferguson) and Deputy Sheriff Frank Stilwell, a business partner of Spence&#x27;s. Stilwell was fired a short while later as a deputy sheriff for Sheriff Behan (for county tax &quot;accounting irregularities&quot;).

Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with the sheriff&#x27;s posse to track the stage robbers, and Wyatt discovered an unusual boot heel print in the mud. The posse checked with a shoemaker in Bisbee and found a matching heel that he had just removed from Stilwell&#x27;s boot. A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell, who were arrested by sheriff&#x27;s deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel.

Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on the robbery charges before Justice Wells Spicer, who set their bail at $7,000 each. They were released after paying the bail, but they were rearrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later on October 13 on the new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery which occurred on October 8 near Contention City, Arizona, less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout, and this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing when Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.

==Gunfight at the O.K. Corral==

The tension came to a head between the Earps and the Cowboys on Wednesday, October 26, 1881. Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne, and other Cowboys had been threatening to kill the Earps for several weeks, and Tombstone city Marshal Virgil Earp learned that they were armed and had gathered near the O.K. Corral. He asked Wyatt and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday to assist him, as he intended to disarm them. Wyatt had been deputized by Virgil a few days prior as a temporary assistant marshal and Morgan was a deputy city marshal.

Around 3:00 pm the Earps and Holliday headed towards Fremont Street, where the Cowboys had been gathering. They found five Cowboys in a vacant lot adjacent to the O.K. Corral&#x27;s rear entrance on Fremont Street. The lot was narrow between the Harwood House and Fly&#x27;s Boarding House and Photography Studio; the two parties were initially only about apart. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne fled, but Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton stood their ground and were killed. Morgan was clipped by a shot across his back that nicked both shoulder blades and a vertebra. Virgil was shot through the calf, and Holliday was grazed by a bullet. Wyatt came through the shootout unharmed.

==Charged with murder==
Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday on October 30. Justice Wells Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine whether enough evidence existed to go to trial. In an unusual proceeding, he took written and oral testimony from about thirty witnesses over more than a month. Sheriff Behan testified that the Cowboys had not resisted but had thrown up their hands and turned out their coats to show that they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat to show that he was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Behan insisted that Holliday had fired first using a nickel-plated revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.

The Earps hired experienced trial lawyer Thomas Fitch as defense counsel. Since Virgil was confined to bed due to his wounds, Wyatt testified in a written statement that he drew his gun only after Clanton and McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps&#x27; previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they had intended to disarm the Cowboys, and that his party had fired in self defense. Fitch produced contradictory testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination, during which they appeared to dodge his questions or said that they could not remember.

Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He said that the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Virgil had deputized Holliday and Wyatt. The Earps and Holliday were free but their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.

===Cowboys&#x27; revenge===
Virgil was ambushed on December 28 while walking between saloons on Allen Street in Tombstone, and he was maimed by a shotgun blast that struck his left arm and shoulder. Ike Clanton&#x27;s hat was found in the back of the building across Allen Street from where the shots were fired. Wyatt wired U.S. Marshal Crawley P. Dake asking to be appointed deputy U.S. marshal with authority to select his own deputies. Dake granted the request in late January and provided the Earps with some funds that he borrowed from Wells Fargo, variously reported as between $500 and $3,000.

In mid-January Earp&#x27;s ally Rickabaugh sold the Oriental Saloon to Earp&#x27;s adversary Milt Joyce, and Wyatt sold his gambling concessions at the hotel. The Earps also raised some funds from sympathetic business owners in town. Wyatt and Virgil submitted their resignations to Dake on February 2, 1882, being tired of the criticism leveled against them, but he refused to accept them because their accounts had not been settled. That same day, Wyatt sent a message to Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused.

That day, Clanton was also acquitted of the charges against him in the shooting of Virgil. The defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston at the time of the shooting. The Earps needed more funds to pay for the extra deputies and associated expenses, as contributions from supportive business owners were not enough. On February 13, Wyatt mortgaged his home to lawyer James G. Howard for ; he was never able to repay the loan and Howard foreclosed on the house in 1884.

Morgan Earp was murdered on March 18 while playing billiards, shot by gunmen firing from a dark alley through a door window into the billiard room. He was struck in the right side; the bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry, while another round narrowly missed him. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch, while the murderers escaped in the dark. He died 40 minutes later. Wyatt felt that he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands and kill the murderers himself.

==Earp vendetta ride==

The day after Morgan&#x27;s murder, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp formed a posse made up of his brothers James and Warren, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, Jack &quot;Turkey Creek&quot; Johnson, Charles &quot;Hairlip Charlie&quot; Smith, Dan Tipton, and Texas Jack Vermillion to protect the family and pursue the suspects, paying them $5 a day. They took Morgan&#x27;s body to the railhead in Benson, and James accompanied it to the family home in Colton, California, where Morgan&#x27;s wife and parents waited to bury him. The posse guarded Virgil and Allie to Tucson, where they had heard that Frank Stilwell and other Cowboys were waiting to kill Virgil. The next morning, Frank Stilwell&#x27;s body was found alongside the tracks, with a shotgun bullet in his chest. Wyatt and 5 other federal lawmen were indicted for murdering him, and Tucson Justice of the Peace, Charles Meyer, issued warrants for their arrest.

The Earp posse briefly returned to Tombstone where Sheriff Behan tried to stop them, but was brushed aside. Hairlip Charlie and Warren remained in Tombstone, and the rest set out for Pete Spence&#x27;s wood camp in the Dragoon Mountains. Spence was absent, but they found and killed Florentino &quot;Indian Charlie&quot; Cruz. Two days later, they stumbled onto the wood camp of William Brocius, Pony Diehl, and other outlaw Cowboys near Iron Springs in the Whetstone Mountains. According to reports from both sides, the two sides immediately exchanged gunfire. The Earp party withdrew to find protection from the heavy gunfire, except for Wyatt and Texas Jack Vermillion, whose horse was shot.

Curly Bill fired at Wyatt with a shotgun but missed. 18 months earlier, Wyatt had protected Curly Bill against a lynch mob; he also provided testimony that helped spare Curly Bill a murder trial for killing Marshal Fred White. Wyatt returned Curly Bill&#x27;s gunfire with his own shotgun, hitting him in the chest from about 50 feet (15m) away, causing him to fall into the water&#x27;s edge of the spring and die. Wyatt then fired his revolver, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes in the chest and wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle that was wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys&#x27; gunfire, but Holliday helped him get to cover.

Earp told biographer Stuart Lake that both sides of his long coat were shot through, and another bullet struck his boot heel. Ed Colburn, in a letter published in the &quot;Ford County Globe&quot; on May 23, 1882, wrote that he&#x27;d visited with the brothers Earp in Gunnison, Colorado. He relayed Earp&#x27;s story about how his overcoat was hit on both sides of his body by a charge of buckshot and that his saddle horn was shot off. John Flood wrote:
Earp was finally able to get on his horse and retreat with the rest of the posse. Some modern researchers have found that most saddlehorns by this time were made of steel, not wood. Earp told several versions of the story in which he had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was never wounded in any of his confrontations, which added to his mystique.

The posse left the Cowboys behind and rode north to the Percy Ranch, but they weren&#x27;t welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; they left around 3:00am on March 27 after a meal and some rest. They arrived near Tombstone and met with supporters, including Hairlip Charlie and Warren Earp. That same day, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the stagecoach out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on killing Curly Bill, and Wyatt told him that he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran more than 500 brood mares, which produced horses renowned for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts but refused to take their money. Behan&#x27;s posse was then observed in the distance, and Hooker suggested that Earp make his stand there, but Earp moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill. Earp&#x27;s posse wasn&#x27;t found by the local posse, led by Cochise County Sheriff John Behan, although Behan&#x27;s party trailed them for many miles. In the middle of April 1882, the Earp posse left the Arizona Territory and headed east into New Mexico Territory and then into Colorado.

The coroner reports credited the Earp posse with killing Frank Stilwell, Curly Bill, Indian Charlie, and Johnny Barnes in their two-week-long ride. In 1888 Earp gave an interview to California historian Hubert Howe Bancroft, during which he claimed to have killed &quot;over a dozen stage robbers, murderers, and cattle thieves&quot; in his time as a lawman.

==Life after Tombstone==
The gunfight in Tombstone lasted only 30 seconds, but it ended up defining Earp for the rest of his life. His movements began to receive national press coverage after he killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson, and he left Arizona with his brother Warren, Holliday, McMaster, &quot;Turkey Creek&quot; Jack Johnson, and Texas Jack Vermillion. They stopped in Albuquerque, New Mexico where they met up with Earp&#x27;s friend Deputy U.S. Marshal Bat Masterson. Masterson went with them to Trinidad, Colorado, where he opened a faro game in a saloon and later became marshal.

Earp dealt faro at Masterson&#x27;s saloon for several weeks, then left for Gunnison, Colorado, in May 1882 with McMaster, Vermillion, and Warren Earp. The Earps and Texas Jack set up camp on the outskirts of Gunnison, where they remained quietly at first, rarely going into town for supplies. They reportedly pulled a &quot;gold brick scam&quot; in Gunnison on a German visitor named Ritchie by trying to sell him gold-painted rocks for $2,000. Earp and Holliday had a serious disagreement when Holliday accused him of becoming &quot;a damn Jew-boy&quot;, and they parted ways in Albuquerque. Holliday and Earp met again in June 1882 in Gunnison after Earp intervened to keep his friend from being arrested on murder charges which they all had pending against them for killing Frank Stillwell in Tucson. Earp saw Holliday for a final time in the late winter of 1886, where they met in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel. Josephine Marcus described the skeletal Holliday as having a continuous cough and standing on &quot;unsteady legs&quot;.

The &quot;San Diego Union&quot; printed a report from the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; on July 9, 1882, that Virgil Earp was in San Francisco (receiving treatment for his shattered arm) and that Wyatt was expected to arrive from Colorado that day. Wyatt took a job managing a horse stable in Santa Rosa. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman and gambler. He was reputed to own a six-horse stable in San Francisco, although it was learned later that the horses were leased.

Following Wyatt&#x27;s return to San Francisco, Josephine began using the name &quot;Josephine Earp&quot;. Josephine was Earp&#x27;s common-law wife for 46 years until his death. Wyatt and Josie remained in San Francisco for about nine months until early 1883, when they left for Silverton, Colorado, where silver and gold mining were flourishing. It was the first of many mining camps and boomtowns in which they lived. However, he still owned a house in Tombstone with his former common-law wife Mattie, who had waited for him in Colton, where his parents and Virgil were living. During mid-1882, she sent him a letter saying that she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he had asked her to marry him. Earp did not believe in divorce and therefore refused, but she ran away with the gambler anyway. The gambler abandoned her in Arizona, so she moved to Pinal City, Arizona, where she resumed life as a prostitute. She struggled with addictions and committed suicide by opium poisoning on July 3, 1888, at age 37–38.
Earp&#x27;s friend Luke Short was part owner of the Long Branch saloon in Dodge City, but the mayor tried to run him out of business and out of town during the Dodge City War. Short appealed to Masterson, and Masterson contacted Earp on May 31, 1883. Earp and Josephine went with Masterson, Johnny Millsap, Shotgun John Collins, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Johnny Green to Dodge City to help Short, and they were sworn in as deputies by constable Dave Marrow. Governor George W. Glick arranged a 10-day cooling-off period to allow Short to sell the saloon, but Short, Earp, and the others refused to compromise. Seeking to avoid a confrontation with the deputized gunmen, and under pressure from Governor Glick and the Santa Fe Railroad, which conducted a lot of business in Dodge, the mayor and city council backed down. They allowed the gambling halls, dance halls, and saloons to reopen, including the Long Branch, and the so-called Dodge City War ended without a shot being fired.

===Idaho mining venture===
Earp arrived in Eagle City, Idaho, in 1884 along with Josephine, his brothers Warren and James, and James&#x27;s wife Bessie. Eagle City was another new boomtown growing from the discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene area; it is now a ghost town in Shoshone County, Idaho. Earp joined the crowd looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district, and they paid $2,250 for a diameter white circus in which they opened a dance hall and saloon called The White Elephant.

Earp was named deputy sheriff in the area, including newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were a considerable number of disagreements over mining claims and property rights that Earp had a part in. On March 28 a miner named Bill Buzzard was constructing a building when Earp&#x27;s partner Jack Enright tried to stop him. Enright claimed that the building was on part of his property, and the two men began to argue. Buzzard fired several shots at Enright with his Winchester, then allies of both sides took defensive positions behind snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Earp and his brother James stepped into the middle of the fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt.

Around April 1885, Earp reportedly used his badge to join a band of claim jumpers in Embry Camp, later renamed Chewelah, Washington. Within six months, their substantial stake had run dry, and the Earps left the Murray-Eagle district. About 10 years later, a reporter hunted up Buzzard after the Fitzimmons-Sharkey fight and extracted a story from him that accused Earp of being the brains behind lot-jumping and real-estate fraud, further tarnishing his reputation.

===California===
The Coeur d&#x27;Alene mining venture died out by 1887, so Earp and Josephine went to San Diego, California, where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years, living most of the time in the Brooklyn Hotel. Earp speculated in San Diego&#x27;s booming real estate market, and he bought four saloons and gambling halls between 1887 and around 1896, all in the &quot;respectable&quot; part of town. They offered 21 games, including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, pedro, and monte. At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit. He also owned the Oyster Bar located in the first granite-faced building in San Diego, the four-story Louis Bank Building at 835 5th Avenue, one of the more popular saloons in the Stingaree district. One of the reasons it drew a good crowd was the Golden Poppy brothel upstairs, owned by Madam Cora. Each room was painted a different color, such as emerald green, summer yellow, or ruby red, and each prostitute was required to dress in matching garments.

Earp had a long-standing interest in boxing and horse racing, and he refereed boxing matches in San Diego, Tijuana, and San Bernardino. In the 1887 &quot;San Diego City Directory&quot; he was listed as a capitalist or gambler. He won a race horse named Otto Rex in a card game and began investing in race horses, and he also judged prize fights on both sides of the border; he was one of the judges at the county fair horse races held in Escondido, California, in 1889. The boom came to an end as rapidly as it had started, and the population of San Diego fell from a high of 40,000 in 1885 when Earp arrived to only 16,000 in 1890.

The Earps moved back to San Francisco in 1891 so that Josephine could be closer to half-sister Henrietta&#x27;s family, and Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman and a gambler. He held on to his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes and was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but he could no longer afford to own them by 1896, so he raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa which he managed. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race. From 1891 to 1897, the couple lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave., and 1004 Golden Gate Ave.

===Later relationship with Josephine===
Josephine wrote in her memoir that she and Earp were married in 1892 by the captain of multi-millionaire Lucky Baldwin&#x27;s yacht off the California coast. Raymond Nez wrote that his grandparents witnessed their marriage, but no public record has been found for the marriage. Baldwin was a horse breeder and racer who also owned the Santa Anita race track in Los Angeles which Earp frequented.

Earp&#x27;s relationship with Josephine was tempestuous at times. She gambled to excess and he had adulterous affairs. He knew that she preferred being called &quot;Josephine&quot; and detested &quot;Sadie&quot;, but he had a mischievous sense of humor and began calling her Sadie early in their relationship. Earp&#x27;s good friends in the Welsh family did not appreciate Josephine&#x27;s gambling habits, and they noted that she received an allowance from her half-sister Rebecca and gambled it away, often leaving her husband hungry.

In the 1920s Earp gave Josephine signed legal papers and filing fees to a claim for an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to him about what happened to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. He distrusted her ability to manage her finances and made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. He put oil leases in Henrietta&#x27;s name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Josephine after his death. In February 1926, the oil well was completed and producing 150 barrels a day, but Henrietta&#x27;s three children refused to keep the agreement after their mother&#x27;s death and kept the royalties to themselves. Josephine sued her sister&#x27;s estate in an attempt to collect the royalties.

Josephine later developed a reputation as a shrew who made life difficult for Earp. She frequently griped about his lack of work and financial success and even his character and personality, and he often went on long walks to get away from her. He was furious about her gambling habit, during which she lost considerable sums of money; each may have engaged in extramarital affairs. Josephine could also be controlling, and a relative of Wyatt joked that nobody could convict him of cold-blooded murder because he had lived with her for almost 50 years.

===Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight===

Earp was a last-minute choice as referee for a boxing match on December 2, 1896, which the promoters billed as the heavyweight championship of the world, when Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey at the Mechanics&#x27; Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.

Fitzsimmons dominated Sharkey throughout the fight, and he hit Sharkey with his famed &quot;solar plexus punch&quot; in the eighth round, an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. Then, at Fitzsimmons&#x27; next punch, Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas screaming foul. Earp stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey below the belt, but no one seemed to have witnessed the punch. Earp awarded the fight to Sharkey, whom attendants carried out &quot;limp as a rag&quot;. The 15,000 fans in attendance greeted his decision with loud boos and catcalls. It was widely believed that no foul had occurred and that Earp had bet on Sharkey. Several doctors verified afterward that Sharkey had been hit hard below the belt, but the public had bet heavily on Fitzsimmons and was livid at the outcome.

Fitzsimmons went to court to overturn Earp&#x27;s decision, and newspaper accounts and testimony over the next two weeks revealed a conspiracy among the boxing promoters to fix the fight&#x27;s outcome. Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; quoted a story from the &quot;New York Journal&quot; by Alfred H. Lewis, who accused the Earp brothers of being &quot;stage robbers&quot;, and Earp was parodied in editorial caricatures by newspapers across the country. Stories about the fight and Earp&#x27;s contested decision were distributed nationwide to a public that knew little of Wyatt Earp prior to that time.

On December 17 Judge Sanderson finally ruled that prize fighting was illegal in San Francisco and the courts would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona; afterward, his name was known from coast to coast. The boxing match left a smear on his public character that followed him until after he died. Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee was accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons, and Lee admitted that it was true. &quot;I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been fouled,&quot; he confessed. &quot;I got $1,000 for my part in the affair.&quot;

===Klondike Gold Rush===


While in Yuma, Wyatt heard of the gold rush in the Alaska Yukon. On August 5, 1897, Wyatt and Sadie left for San Francisco. Earp was reported to have secured the backing of a syndicate of sporting men to open a gambling house there. They intended to catch a ship to Alaska, but their departure was delayed for seven weeks when Wyatt fell while getting off the Market Street streetcar and bruised or broke his hip. Sadie got pregnant too, and she thought she could persuade Earp from heading to Alaska. He was in agreement, but Sadie, who was 37, miscarried soon after. They finally boarded the steamship &quot;Rosalie&quot; on September 21, 1897. They arrived in Dawson in the Yukon on late September, where Wyatt planned to open a faro game. Wyatt and Josephine spent only a month in Dawson.

When they returned north, Wyatt was offered a job as the marshal in Wrangell, Alaska, but he served for only ten days. Sadie learned she was pregnant again, and they returned to San Francisco on October 11 aboard the steamship &quot;City of Seattle&quot;. But Sadie miscarried again.

The Earps spent the winter in Wrangell before setting out in the spring for Dawson on board the &quot;Governor Pingree&quot; via the Yukon River. By the time they reached Rampart on the Yukon River, freeze-up had set in. The Earps rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898–1899 there.

In 1898 they got as far as Rampart before the Yukon River froze in place for the winter. Rampart was a friendly place, but far from the real action. They left with the spring thaw and headed for St. Michael, on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River. Wyatt managed a small store during the spring of 1899, selling beer and cigars for the Alaska Commercial Company. But Wyatt&#x27;s friend Tex Rickard sent him a number of letters belittling Wyatt&#x27;s steady but small income in St. Michael as &quot;chickenfeed&quot; and persuaded him to relocate to Nome.
At the time of the Earps&#x27; arrival, Nome was two blocks wide and five miles long. The best accommodation Wyatt and Sadie could find was a wooden shack a few minutes from the main street, only slightly better than a tent. The river was an open sewer. Typhoid, dysentery and pneumonia were common. In September, Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, the city&#x27;s first two-story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The second floor had 12 &quot;clubrooms&quot; decorated with fine mirrors, thick carpets, draperies, and sideboards. Trading on Earp&#x27;s name, the Dexter was a success. It was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: with ceilings. Earp used the club rooms upstairs as a brothel, another fact that Sadie worked hard to see omitted from stories about him. Sadie justified the services upstairs because the Dexter was a &quot;better class&quot; saloon and served an &quot;important civic purpose&quot;.

The Dexter drew anyone famous who visited Nome. Wyatt rubbed elbows with future novelist Rex Beach, writer Jack London, playwright Wilson Mizner, and boxing promoter Tex Rickard, with whom Earp developed a long-lasting relationship. Rickard was a partner in the Northern Saloon and gambling house in Nome. Both the Dexter and the Northern Saloon competed for business with more than sixty other saloons in town serving an estimated 20,000 residents. Wyatt told others he made his money by &quot;mining the miners&quot;.

He was arrested twice in Nome for minor offenses, including being drunk and disorderly, although he was not tried. Most members of law enforcement were corrupt or paid no-shows.


In November 1899 Earp left Alaska on the iron steamer &quot;Cleveland&quot;. The ship was infested with lice and was struck by a storm on the Bering Sea, making for a difficult trip. It took nine days to reach Seattle, Washington.

On July 6, 1900, Wyatt&#x27;s brother Warren was shot and killed in a saloon in Willcox, Arizona. Wyatt learned about his death soon after, and although some modern researchers believe he went to Arizona to avenge his brother&#x27;s death, the distance and time required to make the trip made it unlikely, and no contemporary evidence has been found to support that theory.

In 2018 archivists at the Alaska State Library digitized a collection of documents relating to Earp&#x27;s arrival and stay in Alaska.

===Saloon ownership and gambling===
Earp arrived in Seattle with a plan to open a saloon and gambling room. On November 25, 1899, the &quot;Seattle Star&quot; described him as &quot;a man of great reputation among the toughs and criminals, inasmuch as he formerly walked the streets of a rough frontier mining town with big pistols stuck in his belt, spurs on his boots, and a devil-may-care expression upon his official face&quot;. The &quot;Seattle Daily Times&quot; was less full of praise, announcing in a very small article that he had a reputation in Arizona as a &quot;bad man&quot;, which in that era was synonymous with &quot;villain&quot; and &quot;desperado&quot;.

He faced considerable opposition to his plan from John Considine, who controlled all three gaming operations in town. Although gambling was illegal, Considine had worked out an agreement with Police Chief C. S. Reed. Earp partnered with an established local gambler named Thomas Urguhart, and they opened the Union Club saloon and gambling operation in Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square. The &quot;Seattle Star&quot; noted two weeks later that Earp&#x27;s saloon was developing a large following. Considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Earp, but his saloon continued to prosper. After the city failed to act, on March 23, 1900, the Washington state attorney general filed charges against several gamblers, including Earp and his partner. The club&#x27;s furnishings were confiscated and burned. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but soon returned to Seattle.

Newspapers in Seattle and San Francisco falsely reported on Wyatt&#x27;s wealth which prompted a stampede to Nome to seek similar riches. Nome was advertised as an &quot;exotic summer destination&quot; and four ships a day left Seattle with passengers infected with &quot;gold fever&quot;.

On June 14, 1900, Wyatt and Sadie boarded the steamer SS &quot;Alliance&quot; in Seattle, bound for Nome. They brought many luxurious accessories with them to decorate The Dexter. Within weeks Nome had grown to a city of over 20,000. In 1900 the major business there &quot;was not mining, but gambling and saloon trade. There were 100 saloons and gambling houses, with an occasional restaurant.&quot; Losses of $10,000 per hand in poker were not extraordinary. Prize fighting became the sport of choice and Wyatt&#x27;s income soared with side bets. He often refereed bouts himself at The Dexter.

In November 1901, at age 40, Sadie got pregnant again, and she and Wyatt decided to leave Alaska. They sold their interest in the Dexter to their partner, Charlie Hoxie.

Wyatt and Sadie left Alaska on board the SS &quot;Roanoke&quot; and arrived in Los Angeles at the Hollenbeck Hotel on December 13, 1901. They had an estimated , a relative fortune. Sadie miscarried and lost the baby. 

Three months later, in February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, known as the &quot;Queen of the Silver Camps&quot;, where silver and gold had been discovered in 1900. When they arrived, they had to endure a two-week blizzard. They soon learned unemployment was high and many residents had already moved on.

Wyatt and Josie persevered and within a few months, he and Al Martin opened the Northern Saloon. Earp hauled ore and supplies for the Tonopah Mining Company to the Carson and Colorado Railroad depots at Sodaville and Candelaria. He was briefly appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in Tonopah under Marshal J.F. Emmitt but his duties were limited to serving papers to defendants in federal court cases. 

Disappointed with future prospects in Tonopah, they sold their interests in summer 1903. They prospected in the desert around Silver Peak, Esmeralda County, and wintered in Los Angeles. They staked three claims in the Palmetto Mountains but never found anything of value. They visited his brother Virgil and his wife in 1905 in Goldfield, Nevada where Virgil had been become an Esmeralda County deputy sheriff. Tex Rickard was also already there and had opened a second Northern Saloon. He briefly hired Wyatt as a pit boss. 

Wyatt also staked mining claims just outside Death Valley and elsewhere in the Mojave Desert. In 1906 he discovered several deposits of gold and copper in the Whipple Mountains near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims His saloon, oil, and copper mining interests produced some income for a period. While in Los Angeles, they lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly during the summer.

===Life in Los Angeles===
In 1910, when he was 62, the Los Angeles Police Department hired Wyatt and former Los Angeles detective Arthur Moore King at $10.00 per day to carry out various tasks &quot;outside the law&quot; such as retrieving criminals from Mexico, which he did very capably. This led to Wyatt&#x27;s final armed confrontation. In October 1910 he was asked by former Los Angeles Police Commissioner H. L. Lewis to head up a posse to protect surveyors of the American Trona Company . They were attempting to wrest control of mining claims for vast deposits of potash on the edge of Searles Lake that were held in receivership by the foreclosed California Trona Company.

Wyatt and the group he guarded were considered claim jumpers and were confronted by armed representatives of the other company. King wrote, &quot;It was the nerviest thing he had ever seen.&quot; With guns pulled, Wyatt came out of his tent with a Winchester rifle, firing a round at the feet of Federal Receiver Stafford W. Austin. &quot;Back off or I&#x27;ll blow you apart, or my name is not Wyatt Earp.&quot; The owners summoned the U.S. marshal, who arrested Earp and 27 others, serving them with a summons for contempt of court, sending them home. Earp&#x27;s actions did not resolve the dispute, which eventually escalated into the &quot;Potash Wars&quot; of the Mojave Desert.

On July 23, 1911, Earp was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with attempting to fleece J. Y. Peterson, a realty broker, in a fake faro game. Since money had not changed hands, the charge against Earp was reduced to vagrancy and he was released on $500 bail.

The Earps bought a small cottage in Vidal, the only home they ever owned. Beginning in 1911 and until Wyatt&#x27;s health began to fail in 1928, Wyatt and Sadie Earp summered in Los Angeles and spent the rest of the year in the desert working their claims. The &quot;Happy Days&quot; mine was located in the Whipple Mountains a few miles north of Vidal. Wyatt had some modest success with the Happy Days gold mine, and they lived on the slim proceeds of income from that and oil wells in Oakland and Kern County.

Around 1923 Charles Welsh, a retired railroad engineer and friend that Earp had known since Dodge City, frequently invited the Earps to visit his family in San Bernardino.

When the Welsh family moved to Los Angeles, the Earps accepted an invitation to stay with them for a while in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh&#x27;s daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, Sadie still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.

===Movie connections===
While living in Los Angeles, Earp became an unpaid film consultant for several silent cowboy movies. In 1915, Earp visited the set of director Allan Dwan&#x27;s movie, &quot;The Half-Breed&quot;, starring Douglas Fairbanks. In his autobiography, Dwan recalled, &quot;As was the custom in those days, he [Earp] was invited to join the party and mingle with our background action.&quot;
Earp became friends with William S. Hart and later Tom Mix, the two most famous movie cowboys of their era. Hart was a stickler for realism in his depictions of Western life, and may have relied on Earp for advice. Earp later frequently visited the sets of movie director John Ford, whose movies starred Harry Carey. Ford&#x27;s son Patrick later wrote, &quot;My dad was real friendly with Wyatt Earp, and as a little boy I remember him.&quot;

In 1916 Earp went with his friend Jack London, whom he knew from Nome, to visit the set of former cowboy, sailor, and movie actor-turned-film director Raoul Walsh, who was shooting at the studio of Mutual Film conglomerate in Edendale, California. Walsh took the two men to dinner at Al Levy&#x27;s Cafe on Main and Third Street. During the meal, the highest paid entertainer in the world, Charlie Chaplin, dropped by to greet Wyatt Earp. Chaplin was impressed by both men, but particularly the former Tombstone marshal.

In the early 1920s Earp was given the honorary title of deputy sheriff in San Bernardino County, California. On January 25, 1926, Wyatt&#x27;s brother James died of cerebral apoplexy in San Bernardino, California.

Earp tried to persuade his good friend, well-known cowboy movie star William S. Hart, to help set the record straight about his life and get a movie made. &quot;If the story were exploited on the screen by you,&quot; he wrote Hart, &quot;It would do much toward setting me right before a public which has always been fed lies about me.&quot; Hart encouraged Earp to first find an author to pen his story.

In 1925 Earp began to collaborate on a biography with his friend and former mining engineer John Flood to get his story told in a way that he approved. Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp&#x27;s life, based on Earp&#x27;s recollections. The two men sat together every Sunday in the kitchen of Earp&#x27;s modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp&#x27;s story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, &quot;You can&#x27;t write that! It needs to be clean.&quot; She also demanded that they add more &quot;pep&quot; to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word &quot;CRACK!&quot; in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of &quot;CRACK&quot;. She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled &quot;Conflagration&quot; in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.

Spolidora as a teenager had visited the Earps many times near her family home in Needles, California, and she sometimes went to San Diego with them. In an interview with the San Bernardino historical society in 1990, she attributed the highly exaggerated stories about Wyatt Earp to Josephine. Josephine &quot;would always interfere whenever Wyatt would talk with Stuart Lake. She always interfered! She wanted him to look like a church-going saint and blow things up. Wyatt didn&#x27;t want that at all!&quot;

Flood&#x27;s writing was &quot;stilted, corny, and one-dimensional&quot;, and the manuscript, completed some time in early 1926, never found a publisher. In February 1927 editor Anne Johnston of Bobbs Merrill wrote back and was highly critical of the &quot;stilted, florid, and diffuse&quot; writing. She wrote, &quot;Now one forgets what it&#x27;s all about in the clutter of unimportant details that impedes its pace, and the pompous manner of its telling.&quot;

Hart tried to help. In February 1926 he wrote &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and encouraged them to publish Flood&#x27;s biography so &quot;that... the rising generation may know the real from the unreal&quot;, but Flood was a horrendous writer, and publisher after publisher rejected the manuscript. Several copies were made and sold in 1981, and the original carbon copy of the typed manuscript, found among Josephine Earp&#x27;s papers, was given by Glenn Boyer to the Ford County Historical Society.

==Death==
Wyatt Earp was the last surviving Earp brother and the last surviving participant of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral when he died at home in the Earps&#x27; small rented bungalow at 4004 W 17th Street, in Los Angeles, of chronic cystitis on January 13, 1929, at the age of 80. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that he had been ill with liver disease for three years. His brother Newton had died almost a month prior on December 18, 1928. Wyatt was survived by Josephine and sister Adelia Earp Edwards. He had no children. Charlie Welsh&#x27;s daughter Grace Spolidora and his daughter-in-law Alma were the only witnesses to Wyatt&#x27;s cremation. Josephine was apparently too grief-stricken to assist.

===Hollywood pallbearers===
The funeral was held at the Congregational Church on Wilshire Boulevard. Earp&#x27;s pallbearers were William J. Hunsaker (Earp&#x27;s attorney in Tombstone and noted Los Angeles attorney), Jim Mitchell (&quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; reporter and Hollywood screenwriter), George W. Parsons (founding member of Tombstone&#x27;s &quot;Committee of Vigilance&quot;), Wilson Mizner (a friend of Wyatt&#x27;s during the Klondike Gold Rush), John Clum (a good friend from his days in Tombstone, former Tombstone mayor, and editor of &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot;), William S. Hart (good friend and Western actor and silent film star), and Tom Mix (friend and Western film star). Mitchell wrote Wyatt&#x27;s local obituary. The newspapers reported that Tom Mix cried during his friend&#x27;s service. When Josephine did not attend Wyatt&#x27;s funeral, Grace Spolidora was furious. &quot;She didn&#x27;t go to his funeral, even. She wasn&#x27;t that upset. She was peculiar. I don&#x27;t think she was that devastated when he died.&quot;

===Privately buried===
Josephine, who was Jewish, had Earp&#x27;s body cremated and secretly buried his remains in the Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity Memorial Park, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her body was buried alongside his ashes. She had purchased a small white marble headstone which was stolen shortly after her death in 1944. It was discovered in a backyard in Fresno, California. A second flat granite headstone was also stolen.

On July 7, 1957, grave robbers dug into the Earp&#x27;s grave in an apparent attempt to steal the urn containing his ashes. Unable to find his cremains, they stole the grave stone. Actor Hugh O&#x27;Brian, who was playing Earp in the 1955–1961 television series, &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, offered a reward for the stone&#x27;s return. It was located for sale in a flea market.

Cemetery officials reset the stone flush in concrete, but it was stolen again. Actor Kevin Costner, who played Earp in the 1994 movie &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, offered to buy a new, larger stone, but the Marcus family thought his offer was self-serving and declined. Descendants of Josie&#x27;s half-sister Rebecca allowed a Southern California group in 1998-99 to erect the stone currently in place. The earlier stone is on display in the Colma Historical museum.

In 1957 the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt&#x27;s ashes with the intention of having them relocated to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could or would tell them where they were buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt&#x27;s ashes in Colma, California. The Marcus family kept the location secret to avoid hordes of visitors from trampling the site. The Tombstone Commission decided it would not seek to relocate Earp&#x27;s remains. His and Josie&#x27;s gravesite is the most-visited resting place in the Jewish cemetery.

===No regrets===
Two years before his death, Earp defended his decisions before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and his actions afterward in an interview with Stuart Lake, author of the 1931 largely fictionalized biography &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;:
==Physical description==
Tall like his brothers, Wyatt Earp was about when the average height was about . He was described in 1887 by the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; as &quot;quiet, unassuming, broad-shouldered, with a large blonde mustache. He is dignified, self-contained, game and fearless, and no man commands greater respect.&quot; He weighed about , was long-armed, and muscular, and was very capable of using his fists instead of his weapon to control those resisting his authority.

At about the same time, &quot;The Mirror&quot;, a newspaper in Monroe, Iowa, printed a wire story originating in Denver. The anonymous reporter described Wyatt in detail:
In 1926 writer Adela Rogers St. Johns met the elderly Earp for the first time.
== Wyatt Earp&#x27;s reputation ==
Wyatt Earp&#x27;s fame and reputation has varied throughout the years. Among his peers near the time of his death, Earp was respected. Earp was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers&#x27; reputations. As media accounts of his life have changed over the years, public perception of his life has also varied.

<doc id="400248" wikidata="Q6540245" url="?curid=400248" title="Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet ( – 3 January 1645) of Scorborough Hall, near Driffield, Yorkshire, was an English Member of Parliament who was Governor of Hull in 1642 shortly before the start of the Civil War. He refused to allow King Charles I or any member of his entourage to enter the town, thereby depriving the king of access to the large arsenal contained within. Later in the Civil War he and his son John Hotham the younger were accused of treachery to the Parliamentarian cause, found guilty and executed on Tower Hill.

==Origins==
He was born in 1589 the second but only surviving son of John Hotham (1540–1609) of Scorborough, who in 1584 had been elected a Member of Parliament for Scarborough in Yorkshire. His mother has been variously given as Julian Stanhope, a daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope of Shelford, Nottinghamshire or as Jane Legard, a daughter of Richard Legard of Rysome, Yorkshire.

==Career==
He fought on the continent of Europe during the early part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1622 he was made a baronet. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Beverley in the five Parliaments between 1625 and 1640, and served as Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1634. In 1639 he was deprived by the king of his office of Governor of Hull, and joining the parliamentary party, he refused to pay ship-money. In January 1642 Hotham was ordered by Parliament to seize the town of Hull, where there was a large store of munitions of war; this was at once carried out by his son John Hotham the younger. Hotham senior took command of Hull and in April 1642 refused to admit King Charles I to the town. Later he promised his prisoner, George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, that he would surrender the town to the king, but when Charles appeared again he refused a second time and drove away the besiegers.

Meanwhile, Hotham the younger was taking an active part in the Civil War in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, but was soon at variance with other parliamentary leaders, especially with Lord Fairfax and his son Sir Thomas Fairfax, and complaints about his conduct and that of his troops were made by Oliver Cromwell and by Colonel John Hutchinson. Soon both the Hothams were corresponding with the Earl of Newcastle, and Hotham the younger was probably ready to betray Hull; these proceedings became known to Parliament, and in June 1643 father and son were captured and taken to London.

==Death and burial==

After a long delay, they were tried by court-martial, found guilty, and sentenced to death. The younger Hotham was beheaded at Tower Hill on 2 January 1645, and despite efforts made by the House of Lords and the Presbyterians to save him, his father suffered the same fate on the following day. Both were buried at the nearby church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower. A tomb monument was erected in his memory in St Mary&#x27;s Church, South Dalton. The baronetcy passed to Sir John&#x27;s grandson Sir John Hotham, 2nd Baronet, the son of Hotham the younger.

===Marriages and children===
Sir John married five times and had sixteen children of whom six sons and three daughters survived childhood.
*Firstly, on 16 February 1607, to Katherine Rodes, daughter of Sir John Rodes of Barlborough, Derbyshire. By Katherine, who brought a dowry of 1,000 marks, he had two sons and two daughters, who all predeceased their father, including:
**John Hotham the younger, eldest son and heir apparent, who with his father was accused of treachery, found guilty and executed.
*Secondly, on 16 July 1614 to Anne Rokeby—daughter and heiress of Ralph Rokeby (died 1595), Deputy Secretary of the Council in the North 1587–95—by whom he had three sons, including:
**Rev. Charles Hotham (1615– ), Rector of Wigan, a Cambridge scholar and author of &quot;Ad Philosophiam Teutonicam Manuductio&quot; (1648). He supported Parliament during the Civil War, and was ejected as a minister shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy.
**Durant Hotham (1617–1691), a lawyer, landowner, and East Riding magistrate, author of a &quot;Life&quot; of Jakob Boehme (1654).
*Thirdly he married Frances Legard, daughter of John Legard, of the City of London London and of Ganton, North Yorkshire, a member of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, by whom he had three daughters, who all predeceased their father. 
*Fourthly, on 27 October 1631, he married Katherine Bamburgh ( d. 31 August 1634), a daughter of Sir William Bamburgh, 1st Baronet of Howsham, Yorkshire, and widow of Sir Thomas Norcliffe of Langton, Yorkshire. By Katherine Bamburgh he had two daughters, one of whom predeceased their father.
*Fifthly, on 7 May 1635, he married Sarah Anlaby, a daughter of Thomas Anlaby of Etton, Yorkshire, by whom he had four daughters.

== Theatrical Representations ==
In 2017, a play called &quot;The Hypocrite&quot;, written by Richard Bean was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company at Hull Truck Theatre and Stratford. Sir John Hotham was played by Mark Addy and Lady Sarah Hotham played by Caroline Quentin.

<text>Paul Reynaud (; 15 October 1878 – 21 September 1966) was a French politician and lawyer prominent in the interwar period, noted for his economic liberalism and vocal opposition to Nazi Germany.

Reynaud opposed the Munich Agreement of September 1938, when France and the United Kingdom gave way before Hitler&#x27;s proposals for the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. 
After the outbreak of World War II, Reynaud became the penultimate Prime Minister of the Third Republic in March 1940. He was also vice-president of the Democratic Republican Alliance center-right party. Reynaud was Prime Minister during the German defeat of France in May and June 1940; he persistently refused to support an armistice with Germany and unsuccessfully attempted to save France from German occupation in World War II, and resigned on 16 June.

After unsuccessfully attempting to flee France, he was arrested by Philippe Pétain&#x27;s administration. Surrendering to German custody in 1942, he was imprisoned in Germany and later Austria until liberation in 1945, where he was released after the Battle of Itter Castle in which one of the leaders, German Major Josef Gangl, declared a hero by the Austrian resistance, took a sniper&#x27;s bullet to save Reynaud.

Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946, he became a prominent figure again in French political life, serving in several cabinet positions. He favoured a United States of Europe, and participated in drafting the constitution for the Fifth Republic, but resigned from government in 1962 after disagreement with President de Gaulle over changes to the electoral system.

==Early life and politics==
Reynaud was born in Barcelonnette, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, the son of Alexandre and Amelie (née Gassier) Reynaud. His father had made a fortune in the textile industry, enabling Reynaud to study law at the Sorbonne. He entered politics and was elected to the French Chamber of Deputies from 1919 to 1924, representing Basses-Alpes, and again from 1928, representing a Paris district. Although he was first elected as part of the conservative &quot;Blue Horizon&quot; bloc in 1919, Reynaud shortly thereafter switched his allegiance to the centre-right Democratic Republican Alliance party, later becoming its vice-president.

In the 1920s, Reynaud developed a reputation for laxity on German reparations, at a time when many in the French government backed harsher terms for Germany. In the 1930s during the Great Depression, particularly after 1933, Reynaud&#x27;s stance hardened against the Germans at a time when all nations were struggling economically. Reynaud backed a strong alliance with the United Kingdom and, unlike many others on the French Right, better relations with the Soviet Union as a counterweight against the Germans.

Reynaud held several cabinet posts in the early 1930s, but he clashed with members of his party after 1932 over French foreign and defense policy. In June 1934, Reynaud defended in the Chamber of Deputies the need to devalue the French franc, whose belonging to the gold standard was increasingly harmful for the French economy, but in those years French public opinion was opposed to any devaluation.

He was not given another cabinet position until 1938. Like Winston Churchill, Reynaud was a maverick in his party and often alone in his calls for rearmament and resistance to German aggrandizement. Reynaud was a supporter of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s theories of mechanized warfare in contrast to the static defense doctrines that were in vogue among many of his countrymen, symbolized by the Maginot Line. He strongly opposed appeasement in the run-up to the Second World War. He also clashed with his party on economic policy, backing the devaluation of the franc as a solution to France&#x27;s economic woes. Pierre Étienne Flandin, the leader of the Democratic Republican Alliance, agreed with several of Reynaud&#x27;s key policy stances, particularly on Reynaud&#x27;s defence of economic liberalism.
The franc was devalued, in a range between 25% and 34%, by the Popular Front government presided by Leon Blum on 1 October 1936.

==Return to government==
Reynaud returned to the cabinet in 1938 as Minister of Justice under Édouard Daladier. The Sudeten Crisis, which began not long after Reynaud was named Minister of Justice, again revealed the divide between Reynaud and the rest of the Alliance Démocratique; Reynaud adamantly opposed abandoning the Czechs to the Germans, while Flandin felt that allowing Germany to expand eastward would inevitably lead to a conflict with the Soviets that would weaken both. Reynaud publicly made his case, and in response Flandin pamphleted Paris in order to pressure the government to agree to Hitler&#x27;s demands. Reynaud subsequently left his party to become an independent. However, Reynaud still had the support of Daladier, whose &quot;politique de fermeté&quot; (&quot;policy of firmness&quot;) was very similar to Reynaud&#x27;s notion of deterrence.

Reynaud, however, had always wanted the Finance ministry. He endorsed radically liberal economic policies in order to draw France&#x27;s economy out of stagnation, centered on a massive program of deregulation, including the elimination of the forty-hour work week. The notion of deregulation was very popular among France&#x27;s businessmen, and Reynaud believed that it was the best way for France to regain investors&#x27; confidence again and escape the stagnation its economy had fallen into. The collapse of Léon Blum&#x27;s government in 1938 was a response to Blum&#x27;s attempt to expand the regulatory powers of the French government; there was therefore considerable support in the French government for an alternative approach like Reynaud&#x27;s.

Paul Marchandeau, Daladier&#x27;s first choice for finance minister, offered a limited program of economic reform that was not to Daladier&#x27;s satisfaction; Reynaud and Marchandeau swapped portfolios, and Reynaud went ahead with his radical liberalization reforms. Reynaud&#x27;s reforms were implemented, and the government faced down a one-day strike in opposition. Reynaud addressed France&#x27;s business community, arguing that &quot;We live in a capitalist system. For it to function we must obey its laws. These are the laws of profits, individual risk, free markets, and growth by competition.&quot;
With Reynaud as Minister of Finance, the confidence of the investors returned and the French economy recovered.
Reynaud&#x27;s reforms involved a massive austerity program (although armament measures were not cut). At the outbreak of war, however, Reynaud was not bullish on France&#x27;s economy; he felt that the massive increase in spending that a war entailed would stamp out France&#x27;s recovery.

The French Right was ambivalent about the war in late 1939 and early 1940, feeling that the Soviets rather than Nazi Germany were the greater long-term threat. Daladier regarded the war with Germany as the greater priority and so refused to send aid to the Finns, who were under attack from the USSR, then loosely allied to Germany, in the Winter War. News that the Finns had sued for peace in March 1940 prompted Flandin and Pierre Laval to hold secret sessions of the legislature that denounced Daladier&#x27;s actions; the government fell on 19 March. The government named Reynaud Prime Minister of France two days later.

==Prime minister, resignation, and arrest==
===Appointment===
Despite Reynaud&#x27;s growing popularity, the Chamber of Deputies elected him as Premier by a narrow margin of just one vote, with most of his own party abstaining. Notably, over half of the votes in Reynaud&#x27;s favour came from the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) party. Given the significant support from the left and opposition from many right-wing parties, Reynaud&#x27;s government faced considerable instability. Many on the right called for Reynaud to shift focus from Germany to the Soviet Union. Additionally, the Chamber mandated that Daladier, whom Reynaud personally blamed for France&#x27;s weaknesses, serve as Reynaud&#x27;s Minister of National Defence and War.

One of Reynaud&#x27;s initial actions was attending a meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme War Council in London on 28 March 1940. The meeting culminated in a declaration with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, stating that neither country would seek a separate peace. The joint communiqué asserted, &quot;Both Governments mutually undertake that during the present war they will neither negotiate nor conclude an armistice or treaty of peace except by mutual agreement. They undertake to maintain after conclusion of peace a community of action for so long as may be necessary&quot;.

On 15 June 1940, the French cabinet rejected a British proposal—conceived by Jean Monnet and supported by De Gaulle—for a union between France and Britain. Reynaud abandoned the idea of a &quot;long war strategy&quot; based on attrition. To divert German attention from France, Reynaud considered expanding the war to the Balkans or Northern Europe. He played a key role in initiating the Allied campaign in Norway, although it ended in failure. Following Britain&#x27;s decision to withdraw on 26 April, Reynaud travelled to London to personally urge the British to continue their fight in Norway.

===The German breakthrough===
The Battle of France began less than two months after Reynaud assumed office. The initial German attack in early May 1940 severely damaged French defences, and Paris was under threat. On 15 May, just five days after the invasion began, Reynaud reached out to Churchill and famously remarked, &quot;We have been defeated... we are beaten; we have lost the battle... The front is broken near Sedan.&quot; The dire state of French equipment and morale was underscored by a postcard found on the body of an officer who had committed suicide in Le Mans. The postcard read: &quot;I am killing myself Mr President to let you know that all my men were brave, but one cannot send men to fight tanks with rifles.&quot;

On 18 May, Reynaud dismissed Commander-in-Chief Maurice Gamelin and replaced him with Maxime Weygand.

On 26 May, Reynaud attended a meeting in London with Churchill. During the meeting, Churchill informed the War Cabinet that Reynaud had declared the French military situation as hopeless. Reynaud stated he had no intention of signing a separate peace with Germany but might be compelled to resign, leaving the possibility that others in the French government could sign such a treaty. Churchill also mentioned that he did not rule out talks with Mussolini, who was still neutral at that time. Later that day, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with Reynaud before his return to France. This marked the beginning of the British May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, where Halifax supported what was known as &quot;the Reynaud Option&quot;—exploring negotiations with the Italians for acceptable peace terms, potentially involving concessions in the Mediterranean. However, Churchill ultimately overruled Halifax.

On 28 May, Churchill sent a telegram to Reynaud confirming that there would be no immediate approach to Mussolini, although the option remained open. Mussolini had already rejected an overture by President Roosevelt based on suggestions from Britain and France. It was also revealed on 28 May that Italy was preparing to enter the war on Germany&#x27;s side, which would occur on 10 June.

In early June, Charles de Gaulle, whom Reynaud had long supported and one of the few French commanders to achieve success against the Germans in May 1940, was promoted to brigadier general and appointed undersecretary of war.

===Support for an armistice; Reynaud&#x27;s resignation===
Reynaud wavered somewhat upon his return from London on 26 May but remained committed to continuing the fight. However, he was unable to convince enough of his colleagues to support this stance. Italy entered the war on 10 June, and on the same day, General Weygand, the Commander-in-Chief, stormed into Reynaud&#x27;s office and demanded an armistice. That night, around 11 pm, Reynaud and de Gaulle left Paris for Tours, with the rest of the government following the next day. De Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to dismiss Weygand.

At the Anglo-French conference held at the Château du Muguet in Briare on 11–12 June, Churchill urged the French to continue fighting, either from Brittany, French North Africa, or through guerrilla warfare. However, he faced strong resistance from Deputy Prime Minister Marshal Pétain. By the Cabinet meeting on the evening of 12 June, it was evident that a significant faction was pushing for an armistice, leading to the decision to relocate the government to Bordeaux rather than retreat to a fortified Brittany.

During the subsequent Anglo-French conference in Tours on 13 June, Reynaud requested to be released from the agreement he had made with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1940, so that France could pursue an armistice. Churchill expressed understanding but did not agree with the request. That evening, Pétain, who strongly supported Weygand&#x27;s call for an armistice, announced his intention to remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and begin a national renewal. President Albert Lebrun refused Reynaud&#x27;s resignation on 13 June.

Edward Spears noted that Reynaud was under immense stress starting the evening of 13 June. Paul Baudouin and Marie-Joseph Paul de Villelume, along with Reynaud&#x27;s mistress, the Comtesse Hélène de Portes—a Fascist sympathizer—were pressuring him to seek an armistice. On 14 June, Villelume and de Portes met with American diplomat Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. and stated that France had no choice but to seek an armistice, although Biddle was sceptical of their claims. 

At the Cabinet meeting on 15 June, Reynaud proposed that France follow the Dutch example and lay down its arms to continue the fight from abroad. Pétain showed some sympathy for this idea, and he was sent to speak with General Weygand, who argued that this would be a dishonourable surrender. Chautemps then suggested a compromise of inquiring about terms, which the Cabinet approved by a vote of 13–6. Reynaud attempted to resign on the spot but was vehemently opposed by Lebrun. Admiral Darlan, who had previously opposed an armistice, agreed to it on the condition that the French fleet remained out of German hands. On the same day, Reynaud threw two glasses of water at de Portes during dinner after discovering a key telegram in her bed, which had gone missing.

On 16 June, de Portes was frequently seen at Reynaud&#x27;s office, leading US diplomats to suspect her presence was significant. President Roosevelt&#x27;s reply to Reynaud&#x27;s inquiry, indicating limited assistance without Congressional approval, was received that morning. Churchill&#x27;s telegram, also received on 16 June, proposed an armistice if the French fleet was moved to British ports—a condition unacceptable to Darlan, who feared it would leave France defenseless. That afternoon, de Gaulle was in London discussing a proposed Franco-British Union—a plan hastily put together by Churchill and his advisers to support Reynaud against those favouring an armistice and to keep France, especially its naval fleet, in the war alongside Britain. De Gaulle called Reynaud to inform him of the British Cabinet&#x27;s agreement to the proposal, reporting that &quot;a sensational declaration&quot; was imminent. Time was critical, and de Gaulle dictated the &quot;Declaration of Union&quot; to Reynaud over the phone, enabling him to present it to his Cabinet that afternoon in an attempt to counter the armistice faction. Unknown to Reynaud, General Weygand had ordered his phone to be tapped, depriving Reynaud of the element of surprise.

When the French Cabinet met in Bordeaux that afternoon, Reynaud presented the British union plan and, with Georges Mandel, declared his resolve to continue fighting. However, the proposal was no longer enough to sway the wavering ministers. Contrary to Lebrun&#x27;s later recollection, no formal vote taken that day. The outcome was unclear: ten ministers wanted to continue the fight, seven, including Deputy Prime Ministers Pétain and Chautemps, favoured an armistice, and eight were undecided but ultimately leaned towards accepting an armistice. Lebrun reluctantly accepted Reynaud&#x27;s resignation, and the French government, at this critical moment, fell into the hands of Pétain and those advocating for an armistice and collaboration with the German invader. De Gaulle later described Reynaud as &quot;a man of great worth unjustly crushed by events beyond measure&quot;.

===After resignation===
Julian Jackson notes that Reynaud felt a profound sense of guilt for 20 years over allowing Pétain to come to power and offered increasingly convoluted explanations for the events that transpired. Despite Reynaud&#x27;s own fighting spirit and a brief moment of indecision on 26 May, he regretted not being able to emulate Clemenceau, France&#x27;s great wartime Prime Minister from 1917 to 1918, and he never forgave himself for failing to be another de Gaulle. Reynaud later claimed he had hoped Pétain would resign if the armistice terms were too harsh; Jackson considers this to be wishful thinking. There were suggestions that Reynaud might have mustered a Cabinet majority for continuing the fight, but he later argued that he could not counter the political influence of the &quot;softs&quot;, particularly Pétain and Weygand, France&#x27;s leading military figures.

Spears observed that Reynaud seemed relieved to be free of his burden. In the immediate aftermath of his resignation, Reynaud appeared to be in denial, still hoping to meet Churchill at Concarneau on 17 June. However, Churchill, who was at Waterloo Station, had cancelled his travel plans upon learning of Reynaud&#x27;s resignation.

Jules Jeanneney and Édouard Herriot, Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, respectively, urged President Lebrun to reappoint Reynaud as Prime Minister, as all four men wanted to continue the war from North Africa. Lebrun felt compelled to appoint Pétain, who was prepared with a ministerial team, as Prime Minister. Pétain became the head of the new government—the last of the Third Republic—and signed the armistice on 22 June. De Gaulle returned to Bordeaux around 10 pm on 16 June and visited Reynaud, who still hoped to relocate to North Africa and declined to go to London. Reynaud retained control of secret government funds until the transfer of power the next day, and allocated money to de Gaulle. De Gaulle, accompanied by Edward Spears, flew to London at 9 a.m. on 17 June and made his famous broadcast the following day, declaring his intent to continue the fight. Although it has been suggested that Reynaud ordered de Gaulle to go to London, no written evidence has ever confirmed this.

Reynaud later tentatively accepted Pétain&#x27;s offer to become the French Ambassador to the US, but Lebrun refused to confirm the appointment, possibly because he admired Reynaud and wished to protect him from association with the Pétain government.

===Accident and arrest===

Reynaud and de Portes left the Hotel Splendid in Bordeaux, driving southeast to avoid the advancing German armies. They intended to stop at Reynaud&#x27;s holiday home in Grès, Hérault (some sources suggest they were heading for his daughter&#x27;s home in Sainte-Maxime) before fleeing to North Africa. On 28 June, while Reynaud was driving their Renault Juvaquatre, the car veered off the road and crashed into a plane tree at La Peyrade, near Sète. De Portes was killed (and almost decapitated) in the accident, while Reynaud sustained relatively minor head injuries. While hospitalized in Montpellier, Reynaud reportedly told Bill Bullitt, the American ambassador, &quot;I have lost my country, my honour, and my love.&quot;

Upon his discharge, Reynaud was arrested on Pétain&#x27;s orders and imprisoned at Fort du Portalet. Although Pétain chose not to charge Reynaud during the Riom Trial of 1942, he handed him over to the Germans. Reynaud was initially sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and later transferred to Itter Castle near Wörgl, Austria. There, he remained with other high-profile French prisoners until the castle was liberated by Allied troops on 7 May 1945. During the Battle for Castle Itter on 5 May 1945, Major Josef Gangl, a Wehrmacht officer who had joined the anti-Nazi Austrian resistance, was killed by a sniper&#x27;s bullet while attempting to protect Reynaud and other prisoners.

==Postwar career==
After the war, Reynaud was elected in 1946 as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. He was appointed to several cabinet positions in the post-war period and remained a prominent figure in French politics. His attempts to form governments in 1952 and 1953 in the turbulent politics of the French Fourth Republic were unsuccessful.

Reynaud supported the idea of a United States of Europe, along with a number of prominent contemporaries. He was a member of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe for ten years, from 1949 to 1959, where he worked alongside his old wartime allies Churchill, Spaak and others to build a united Europe as a way of preventing future wars and a recurrence of the Nazi atrocities. Reynaud presided over the consultative committee that drafted the constitution of France&#x27;s (current) Fifth Republic. In 1962, he denounced his old friend de Gaulle&#x27;s replacement of the electoral college system by a direct public vote for the Presidency. Reynaud left office the same year.

==Appearance and private life==
Reynaud was a physically small man, with &quot;the countenance of a samurai who had been educated at Cambridge&quot;. His head was set deep between his shoulders, and he had &quot;a sharp, nasal, metallic voice&quot; and &quot;mechanical&quot; bearing.

By his first marriage in 1912 to Jeanne Anne Henri-Robert, he was the father of a daughter, Collette, born in 1914. At some time in the early 1920s, Reynaud was introduced to Hélène Rebuffel by André Tardieu, a friend of her father&#x27;s. Rebuffel&#x27;s father, however, was displeased at her relationship with a married man, actively seeking other suitors for her, and she was eventually persuaded to marry Comte Henri de Portes. After she had borne him two children, the marriage failed, and when Reynaud and his wife separated in 1938, Hélène de Portes was his mistress until her death in the 
road accident at Frontignan in 1940. Reynaud and his first wife were finally divorced in 1949. Reynaud then married Christiane Mabire (one of his former office assistants, who had voluntarily joined him at the Castle Itter in 1943) at Versailles in the same year, at the age of 71. Mabire had already borne him a son, Serge Paul-Reynaud, in 1945; they had two more children, Evelyne, in 1949, and Alexandre in 1954.

Reynaud died on 21 September 1966 at Neuilly-sur-Seine, leaving a number of writings.
