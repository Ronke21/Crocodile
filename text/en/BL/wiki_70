<text>Control reversal is an adverse effect on the controllability of aircraft. The flight controls reverse themselves in a way that is not intuitive, so pilots may not be aware of the situation; to roll to the left, they have to push the control stick to the right, the opposite of the normal direction.

==Causes==
There are several causes for this problem, pilot error, effects of high-speed flight, incorrectly connected controls and various coupling forces on the aircraft.

===Equipment malfunction===
Equipment failure may cause flight controls to behave unexpectedly, for example the possible rudder reversal experienced on board United Airlines Flight 585.

===Pilot error===
Pilot error is the most common cause of control reversal. In unusual attitudes it is not uncommon for the pilot to become disoriented and make incorrect control movements to regain level flight. This is particularly common when using helmet-mounted display systems, which introduce graphics that remain steady in the pilot&#x27;s view, notably when using a particular form of attitude display known as an &quot;inside-out&quot;.

===Incorrectly connected controls===
Incorrectly connected controls are another common cause of this problem. It is a recurring problem after maintenance on aircraft, notably home built designs that are being flown for the first time after some minor work. It is not entirely uncommon on commercial aircraft, and has been the cause of several accidents including the crash of the Short Crusader before the 1927 Schneider Trophy and the 1947 death of Avro designer Roy Chadwick.

===Wing twist===

Another manifestation of the problem occurs when the amount of airflow over the wing becomes so great that the force generated by the ailerons is enough to twist the wing itself, due to insufficient torsional stiffness of the wing structure. For instance when the aileron is deflected upwards to make that wing move down, the wing twists in the opposite direction. The net result is that the airflow is directed down instead of up and the wing moves upward, opposite of what was expected. This form of control reversal is often lumped in with a number of &quot;high speed&quot; effects as compressibility.

==Examples==

===Wright Brothers glider===
The Wright Brothers suffered a form of control reversal, normally referred to as adverse yaw. In their 1902 glider they continued to encounter a problem where the glider would roll in one direction but yaw in the reverse direction, then spin into the ground. They eventually cured the problem by adding a movable rudder system, now found on nearly all aircraft.

The root cause of the problem was dynamic. Warping the wing did what was expected in terms of lift, thereby rolling the plane, but also had an effect on drag. The result was that the upward-moving wing was dragged backwards, yawing the glider. If this yaw was violent enough, the additional speed on the lower wing as it was driven forward would make it generate more lift, and reverse the direction of the roll.

===Supermarine Spitfire===
Due to the high speeds at which the Supermarine Spitfire could dive, this problem of aileron reversal became apparent when it was wished to increase the lateral maneuverability (rate of roll) by increasing the aileron area. The aircraft had a wing designed originally for an aileron reversal airspeed of 580 mph, and any attempt to increase the aileron area would have resulted in the wing twisting when the larger ailerons were applied at high speed, the aircraft then rolling in the opposite direction to that intended by the pilot. The problem of increasing the rate of roll was temporarily alleviated with the introduction of &quot;clipped&quot; wing tips (to reduce the aerodynamic load on the tip area, allowing larger ailerons to be used) until a new, stiffer wing could be incorporated.
This new wing was introduced in the Mk 21 and had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of .

===Boeing B-47===
The Boeing B-47 was speed limited at low altitudes because the large, flexible wings would cancel out the effect of the control surfaces under some circumstances.

===Gossamer Condor===
Control reversal also affected the Gossamer Condor, the Kremer Prize-winning human-powered airplane. When a wing warping mechanism was tried as a solution to a long-running turning problem, the effect was to turn the airplane in the opposite direction to that expected by conventional airplane knowledge. When the Condor was rigged &quot;conventionally&quot;, the inside wing slowed down so much that it settled to the ground. By employing &quot;backwards&quot; wired wing-warping, the inside wingtip angle of attack was increased so that the added drag slowed that wing while the added lift allowed the airfoil to stay aloft at a slower speed. The tilted canard could then complete the turn.

<text>Paschal Beverly Randolph (October 8, 1825 – July 29, 1875) was an American medical doctor, occultist, spiritualist, trance medium, and writer. He is notable as perhaps the first person to introduce the principles of erotic alchemy to North America, and, according to A. E. Waite, establishing the earliest known Rosicrucian order in the United States.

== Early life ==
Born in New York City, Randolph grew up in New York City and was baptized at the Church of the Transfiguration, Episcopal (Manhattan). He was a free black man, a descendant of William Randolph. His father was a nephew of John Randolph of Roanoke and his mother was Flora Beverly, whom he later described as being of mixed English, French, German, Native American and African ancestry. His mother died when he was young, leaving him homeless and penniless; he ran away to sea in order to support himself. From his adolescence through to the age of twenty, he worked as a sailor.

As a teen and young man, Randolph traveled widely, due to his work aboard sailing vessels. He journeyed to England, through Europe, and as far east as Persia, where his interest in mysticism and the occult led him to study with local practitioners of folk magic and various religions. On these travels he also met and befriended occultists in England and Paris, France.

== Career ==
Returning to New York City in September 1855, after &quot;a long tour in Europe and Africa,&quot; he gave a public lecture to African Americans on the subject of emigrating to India. Randolph believed that &quot;the Negro is destined to extinction&quot; in the United States.

After leaving the sea, Randolph embarked upon a public career as a lecturer and writer. By his mid-twenties, he regularly appeared on stage as a trance medium and advertised his services as a spiritual practitioner in magazines associated with Spiritualism. Like many Spiritualists of his era, he lectured in favor of the abolition of slavery; after emancipation, he taught literacy to freed slaves in New Orleans.

In addition to his work as a trance medium, Randolph trained as a doctor of medicine and wrote and published both fictional and instructive books based on his theories of health, sexuality, Spiritualism and occultism. He wrote more than fifty works on magic and medicine, established an independent publishing company, and was an avid promoter of birth control during a time when it was largely against the law to mention this topic.

Having long used the pseudonym &quot;The Rosicrucian&quot; for his Spiritualist and occult writings, Randolph eventually founded the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis in 1858, and their first lodge in San Francisco in 1861, the oldest Rosicrucian organization in the United States. This group, still in existence, today avoids mention of Randolph&#x27;s interest in sex magic, but his magico-sexual theories and techniques formed the basis of much of the teachings of another occult fraternity, the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, although it is not clear that Randolph himself was ever personally associated with the Brotherhood.

== Belief and teaching ==
Randolph described himself as a Rosicrucian. He had worked &quot;largely alone&quot;, producing &quot;his own synthesis&quot; of &quot;esoteric teachings&quot;.

=== Sex and gender ===

The manner in which Randolph incorporated sex into his occult system was considered uncharacteristically bold for the period in which he lived. He believed that sex magic could lead to increased health, love, the empowerment of women, and children of superior intelligence. In his more underground publications, he wrote that church and marriage were oppressive forces that could be overthrown with the power of love in a world-wide revolution.

Randolph held an unusually expansive view of gender identity, considering earthly gender to be &quot;provisional,&quot; and referring to God as both male and female. In a book on love he wrote:

I believe in love, all the way through. And while I live will help every man, woman, and the betweenities to win, obtain, intensify, deepen, purify, strengthen and keep it, and I will help all others to do the same. There! That’s me! I mean it!
In the spirit world that Randolph wrote of in elaborate detail, human bodies are filled with electric current instead of blood and saliva. People move by magnetism. They have art, schools, and cities as terrestrial humans do, but their lives are more enjoyable and sex is better. Spirit-world marriages &quot;last just so long as the parties thereto are agreeably and mutually pleased with, and attracted, to each other, and no longer&quot;

=== Pre-Adamism ===
Randolph was a believer in pre-Adamism (the belief that humans existed on earth before the biblical Adam) and wrote the book &quot;Pre-Adamite Man: demonstrating the existence of the human race upon the earth 100,000 thousand years ago!&quot; under the name of Griffin Lee in 1863. His book was a unique contribution towards pre-Adamism because it wasn&#x27;t strictly based on biblical grounds. Randolph used a wide range of sources to write his book from many different world traditions, esoterica and ancient religions. Randolph traveled to many countries of the world where he wrote different parts of his book. In the book he claims that Adam was not the first man and that pre-Adamite men existed on all continents around the globe 35,000 years to 100,000 years ago. His book was different from many of the other writings from other pre-Adamite authors because in Randolph&#x27;s book he claims the pre-Adamites were civilized men while other pre-Adamite authors argued that the pre-Adamites were beasts or hominids.

== Personal life ==
A peripatetic man, he lived in many places, including New York State, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Toledo, Ohio. He married his first wife, Mary Jane, in 1850; she was African (or possibly mixed-race). Together, they had three children, only one of whom (Cora, born 1854) survived to adulthood. They owned a farm in Stockbridge, New York during the 1850s, but sold it in April 1860 for one dollar. They later lived in Utica, New York, where Mary Jane worked as &quot;a healer and dispenser of Native american remedies,&quot; in addition to helping Paschal publish and sell several books. They divorced in January 1864.

Later in life he married his second wife, Kate Corson, an Irish-American woman, with whom he had one child, Osiris Budh (or Buddha) Randolph (1874–1929). Corson acted as a medium and a seer in collaboration with Randolph, and published several of his books, but their relationship appears to have been conflicted for its duration. He is reported to have discovered that she was having an affair shortly before his apparent death by suicide in 1875. After his death, Corson continued publishing his works under the Randolph Publishing Company imprint until the early 1900s.

== Death ==
Randolph died in Toledo, Ohio, at the age of 49, under disputed circumstances. According to biographer Carl Edwin Lindgren, many questioned the newspaper article &quot;By His Own Hand&quot; that appeared in &quot;The Toledo Daily Blade&quot;. According to this article, Randolph had died from a self-inflicted wound to the head. However, many of his writings express his aversion to suicide. R. Swinburne Clymer, a later Supreme Master of the &quot;Fraternitas&quot;, stated that years after Randolph&#x27;s demise, in a death-bed confession, a former friend of Randolph had conceded that in a state of jealousy and temporary insanity, he had killed Randolph. Lucus County Probate Court records list the death as accidental. Randolph was succeeded as Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas, and in other titles, by his chosen successor Freeman B. Dowd.

== Influence and legacy ==
Randolph influenced both the Theosophical Society and—to a greater degree—the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor.

In 1994, the historian Joscelyn Godwin noted that Randolph had been largely neglected by historians of esotericism. In 1996, a biography was published, &quot;Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician&quot; by John Patrick Deveney and Franklin Rosemont.

== Published works ==
Randolph also edited the &quot;Leader&quot; (Boston) and the &quot;Messenger of Light&quot; (New York) between 1852 and 1861 and wrote for the &quot;Journal of Progress&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Telegraph&quot;.

Also attributed to Randolph is &quot;Affectional Alchemy and How It Works&quot; (c. 1870).

<doc id="406239" wikidata="Q1456685" url="?curid=406239" title="Treaty of Tripoli">
<text>The Treaty of Tripoli (&quot;Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary&quot;) was signed in 1796. It was the first treaty between the United States and Tripoli (now Libya) to secure commercial shipping rights and protect American ships in the Mediterranean Sea from local Barbary pirates.

It was authored by Joel Barlow, an ardent Jeffersonian republican, and signed in Tripoli on November 4, 1796, and at Algiers (for a third-party witness) on January 3, 1797. It was ratified by the United States Senate unanimously and without debate on June 7, 1797, taking effect June 10, 1797, with the signature of President John Adams. 

Succeeding Adams as president, Thomas Jefferson refused to continue paying Tripolitania the tributes stipulated by this treaty, partially leading to the First Barbary War. A superseding treaty, the Treaty of Peace and Amity, was signed on June 4, 1805.

The treaty is often cited in discussions regarding the role of religion in United States government due to a clause in Article 11 of the English language translation that was ratified by the Senate and signed by the president, which states, &quot;[t]he Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.&quot; However, modern translations of the official Arabic treaty confirm that no such phrase exists in the text. 

== Barbary pirates ==

For three centuries up to the time of the treaty, the Mediterranean Sea lanes had been preyed on by the North African Muslim states of the Barbary Coast (Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco, and Tunis) through privateering (government-sanctioned piracy). Hostages captured by the Barbary pirates were either ransomed or forced into slavery, contributing to the greater Ottoman slave trade (of which the Barbary states were a segment). Life for the captives often was harsh, especially for Christian captives, and many died from their treatment.

Before the American Revolution (1775–1783), the British colonies in North America were protected from the Barbary pirates by British warships of the Royal Navy and treaties. During the Revolution, the Kingdom of France formed an alliance with the former British colonies in 1778, now the proclaimed independent United States of America and assumed the responsibility of providing protection of U.S. merchant ships in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic Ocean against the Barbary pirates with the French Navy. After the Revolutionary War ended and the new United States won its independence with the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783), it had to face the threat of the Barbary pirates on its own. Two American ships were captured by Algerian pirates in July 1785 and the survivors forced into slavery, their ransom set at $60,000. A rumor that Benjamin Franklin, who was en route from France to Philadelphia about that time, had been captured by Barbary pirates, caused considerable upset in the U.S. With the disbanding of the former Continental Navy and the selling of its last warship by the Confederation Congress in 1785, now without a standing navy, much less a navy capable of projecting force across an ocean, the U.S. was forced to pay tribute monies and goods to the Barbary nations for the security of its ships and the freedom of its captured citizens. As Lieutenant and consul William Eaton informed newly appointed Secretary of State John Marshall in 1800, &quot;It is a maxim of the Barbary States, that &#x27;The Christians who would be on good terms with them must fight well or pay well.&#x27;&quot;

Soon after the formation of the United States, privateering in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the nations of the Barbary Coast prompted the U.S. to initiate a series of so-called peace treaties, collectively known as the Barbary Treaties. Individual treaties were negotiated with Morocco (1786), Algiers (1795), Tripoli (1797), and Tunis (1797), all of them more than once. The United States consul-general to the Barbary states of Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis was Joel Barlow, who dealt with the text of various treaties (including the Treaty of Tripoli) and supported U.S. diplomatic efforts on the Barbary Coast. Commissioner Plenipotentiary (and Minister to the Kingdom of Spain in Madrid) of the United States, David Humphreys, was given the right to establish a treaty with Tripoli and assigned Joel Barlow and Joseph Donaldson to broker it. It was Joel Barlow who certified the signatures on the Arabic original and the English copy provided to him. Later, Captain Richard O&#x27;Brien, USN, established the original transport of the negotiated goods along with the treaty, but it was the American Consul James Leander Cathcart who delivered the final requirements of payment for the treaty.

== Signing and ratification ==

The first U.S. president, George Washington, appointed his old colleague David Humphreys as Commissioner Plenipotentiary on March 30, 1795, in order to negotiate a treaty with the Barbary powers. On February 10, 1796, Humphreys appointed Joel Barlow and Joseph Donaldson as &quot;Junior Agents&quot; to forge a &quot;Treaty of Peace and Friendship&quot;. Under Humphreys&#x27; authority, the treaty was signed at Tripoli on November 4, 1796, and certified at Algiers on January 3, 1797. Humphreys reviewed the treaty and approved it in Lisbon on February 10, 1797.

The official treaty was in Arabic, and a translated version by Consul-General Barlow was ratified by the United States on June 10, 1797. Article 11 of the treaty was said to have not been part of the original Arabic version of the treaty; in its place is a letter from the Dey of Algiers to the Pasha of Tripoli. However, it is the English text that was ratified by Congress. Miller says, &quot;the Barlow translation is that which was submitted to the Senate (American State Papers, Foreign Relations, II, 18–19) and which is printed in the Statutes at Large and in treaty collections generally; it is that English text which in the United States has always been deemed the text of the treaty.&quot;

The treaty had spent seven months traveling from Tripoli to Algiers to Portugal and, finally westward across the North Atlantic Ocean, to the United States, and had been signed by officials at each stop along the way. There is no record of discussion or debate of the Treaty of Tripoli at the time that it was ratified. However, there is a statement made by President John Adams on the document that reads: 

Now be it known, That I John Adams, President of the United States of America, having seen and considered the said Treaty do, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, accept, ratify, and confirm the same, and every clause and article thereof. And to the End that the said Treaty may be observed, and performed with good Faith on the part of the United States, I have ordered the premises to be made public; And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office civil or military within the United States, and all other citizens or inhabitants thereof, faithfully to observe and fulfill the said Treaty and every clause and article thereof.

Official records show that after President John Adams sent the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification in May 1797, the entire treaty was read aloud on the Senate floor, and copies were printed for every senator. A committee considered the treaty and recommended ratification. Twenty-three of the thirty-two sitting senators were present for the June 7 vote that unanimously approved the ratification recommendation.
However, before anyone in the United States saw the treaty, its required payments, in the form of goods and money, had been made in part. As Barlow declared: &quot;The present writing done by our hand and delivered to the American Captain O&#x27;Brien makes known that he has delivered to us forty thousand Spanish dollars,-thirteen watches of gold, silver &amp; pinsbach,-five rings, of which three of diamonds, one of saphire and one with a watch in it, One hundred &amp; forty piques of cloth, and four caftans of brocade,-and these on account of the peace concluded with the Americans.&quot; However, this was an incomplete amount of goods stipulated under the treaty (according to the Pasha of Tripoli) and an additional $18,000 had to be paid by the American Consul James Leander Cathcart at his arrival on April 10, 1799.
It was not until these final goods were delivered that the Pasha of Tripoli recognized the treaty as official. In &quot;Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America&quot; by David Hunter Miller, which is regarded as an authoritative collection of international agreements of the United States between 1776 and 1937, Hunter Miller describes, &quot;While the original ratification remained in the hands of Cathcart ... it is possible that a copy thereof was delivered upon the settlement of April 10, 1799, and further possible that there was something almost in the nature of an exchange of ratifications of the treaty on or about April 10, 1799, the day of the agreed settlement.&quot; It is then that the Pasha declares in a Letter to John Adams on April 15, 1799, &quot;Whereby we have consummated the Peace which shall, on our side, be inviolate, provided You are Willing to treat us as You do other Regencies, without any difference being made between Us. Which is the whole of what We have, at present, to say to You, wishing you at the same time the most unlimited prosperity.&quot;

=== Article 11 ===
Article 11 has been and is a point of contention in popular culture disputes on the doctrine of separation of church and state as it applies to the founding principles of the United States. Despite ratification by the U.S. Senate of the text in English which contained —the page containing Article 11 is missing from the Arabic version of the treaty. The contemporaneous purpose of Article 11 was to make clear that the United States was a secular state, and to reassure the Muslims that the agreement was not with an extension of earlier Christian nations that took part in the Crusades.

 Article 11 reads:

Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen (Muslims); and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan (Mohammedan) nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at Purdue University, the assurances in Article 11 were &quot;intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.&quot; Lambert writes,

By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom, not the advancement of a state religion. Individuals, not the government, would define religious faith and practice in the United States. Thus the Founders ensured that in no official sense would America be a Christian Republic. Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state, and that its negotiations would adhere to the rule of law, not the dictates of the Christian faith. The assurances were contained in the Treaty of Tripoli of 1797 and were intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced. John Adams and the Senate made clear that the pact was between two sovereign states, not between two religious powers.

The treaty was printed in the &quot;Philadelphia Gazette&quot; and two New York papers, with only scant public dissent (most notably from William Cobbett).

=== Later dissent ===
A prominent member of Adams&#x27; cabinet, Secretary of War James McHenry, claimed that he protested the language of Article 11 before its ratification. He wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr., September 26, 1800: &quot;The Senate, my good friend, &quot;and I said so at the time&quot;, ought never to have ratified the treaty alluded to, with the declaration that &#x27;the government of the United States, is not, &quot;in any sense&quot;, founded on the Christian religion.&#x27; What else is it founded on? This act always appeared to me like &quot;trampling upon the cross&quot;. I do not recollect that Barlow was even reprimanded for this outrage upon the government and religion.&quot;

=== Translation and Article 11 ===

The translation of the Treaty of Tripoli by Barlow has been questioned, and it has been disputed whether Article 11 in the English version of the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate corresponds to anything of the same purport in the Arabic version.

In 1931 Hunter Miller completed a commission by the United States government to analyze United States treaties and to explain how they function and what they mean to the United States legal position in relationship with the rest of the world. According to Hunter Miller&#x27;s notes, &quot;the Barlow translation is at best a poor attempt at a paraphrase or summary of the sense of the Arabic&quot; and &quot;Article 11 ... does not exist at all.&quot;

After comparing the English language version by Barlow with the Arabic and the Italian version, Miller continues by claiming that:

The Arabic text which is between Articles 10 and 12 is in form a letter, crude and flamboyant and withal quite unimportant, from the Dey of Algiers to the Pasha of Tripoli. How that script came to be written and to be regarded, as in the Barlow translation, as Article 11 of the treaty as there written, is a mystery and seemingly must remain so. Nothing in the diplomatic correspondence of the time throws any light whatever on the point.

From this, Miller concludes: &quot;A further and perhaps equal mystery is the fact that since 1797 the Barlow translation has been trustfully and universally accepted as the just equivalent of the Arabic ... yet evidence of the erroneous character of the Barlow translation has been in the archives of the Department of State since perhaps 1800 or thereabouts ...&quot; However, as Miller noted:

It is to be remembered that the Barlow translation is that which was submitted to the Senate (American State Papers, Foreign Relations, II, 18–19) and which is printed in the Statutes at Large and in treaty collections generally; it is that English text which in the United States has always been deemed the text of the treaty.

However the Arabic and English texts differ, the Barlow translation (Article 11 included) was the text presented by the President and ratified unanimously in 1797 by the U.S. Senate following strict constitutional procedures. According to the American legal scholar Francis Wharton the original document was framed by an ex-Congregational preacher.

== Barbary wars ==

The treaty was broken in 1801 by Yusuf Karamanli, the Pasha of Tripoli, over President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s refusal to submit to the Pasha&#x27;s demands for increased payments.

Through subsequent battles, Tripoli eventually agreed to terms of peace with the United States. Tobias Lear negotiated a second &quot;Treaty of Peace and Amity&quot; with the Pasha Yusuf on June 4, 1805. To the dismay of many Americans, the new settlement included a ransom of $60,000 (equal to $ today) paid for the release of prisoners from the USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and several U.S. merchant ships. By 1807, Algiers had gone back to taking U.S. ships and seamen hostage. Distracted by the preludes to the War of 1812 and the war itself, the United States was unable to respond to the provocations until 1815, with the Second Barbary War, thereby concluding the First and the Second Barbary Wars (1800–1815).

<doc id="406240" wikidata="Q1951807" url="?curid=406240" title="Mugwumps">
<text>The Mugwumps were Republican political activists in the United States who were intensely opposed to political corruption. They were never formally organized. They famously switched parties from the Republican Party by supporting Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland in the 1884 United States presidential election. They switched because they rejected the long history of corruption associated with Republican candidate James G. Blaine. In a close election, the Mugwumps claimed they made the difference in New York state and swung the election to Cleveland. The jocular word &quot;mugwump&quot;, noted as early as 1832, is from Algonquian &quot;mugquomp&quot;, &quot;important person, kingpin&quot; (from &quot;mugumquomp&quot;, &quot;war leader&quot;), implying that Mugwumps were &quot;sanctimonious&quot;, or &quot;holier-than-thou&quot;, in holding themselves aloof from party politics.

After the election, &quot;mugwump&quot; survived for more than a decade as an epithet for a in American politics. Many Mugwumps became Democrats or remained independents, and most continued to support reform well into the 20th century. During the Third Party System, party loyalty was in high regard, and independents were rare. Theodore Roosevelt stunned his upper-class New York City friends by supporting Blaine in 1884; by rejecting the Mugwumps, he kept alive his Republican Party leadership, clearing the way for his own political aspirations.

New England and the Northeast had been a stronghold of the Republican Party since the Civil War era, but the Mugwumps considered Blaine to be an untrustworthy and fraudulent candidate. Their idealism and reform sensibilities led them to oppose the corruption in the politics of the Gilded Age.

== Patronage and politics ==
Political patronage, also known as the spoils system, was the issue that angered many reform-minded Republicans, leading them to reject Blaine&#x27;s candidacy. In the spoils system, the winning candidate would dole out government positions to those who had supported his political party prior to the election. Although the Pendleton Act of 1883 established the United States Civil Service Commission and made competency and merit the base qualifications for government positions, its effective implementation was slow. Political affiliation continued to be the basis for appointment to many positions.

In the early 1880s, the issue of political patronage split the Republican Party down the middle for several consecutive sessions of Congress. The party was divided into two warring factions, each with creative names. The side that held the upper hand in numbers and popular support were the Half-Breeds, led by Senator James Blaine of Maine. The Half-Breeds supported civil service reform and often blocked legislation and political appointments put forth by their main congressional opponents, the Stalwarts, led by Roscoe Conkling of New York.

Blaine was from the reform wing of his own party, but the Mugwumps rejected his candidacy. This division among Republicans may have contributed to the victory in 1884 of Grover Cleveland, the first President elected from the Democratic party since the Civil War. In the period from 1874 to 1894, presidential elections were closely contested at the national level, but the states themselves were mostly dominated by a single party, with Democrats prevailing in the South and the Republicans in the Northeast. Although the defection of the Mugwumps may have helped Cleveland win in New York, one of the few closely contested states, historians attribute Cleveland&#x27;s victory nationwide to the rising power of urban immigrant voters.

==Policies and laws==
In Massachusetts, Mugwumps were led by Richard Henry Dana III, (1851–1931), the editor of the &quot;Civil Service Record&quot;. They took credit for passing the state&#x27;s 1884 civil service law, which was a stronger version of the federal Pendleton Act of 1883. Both laws were enacted to limit the effect of political patronage, thus disrupting the spoils system. The goals were improved morality and increased efficiency. The 1884 law was also designed to contain the rising political power of the Irish Catholics.

James C. Carter (1827–1905) was a leading New York lawyer and an influential legal theorist among fellow Mugwumps. Carter distrusted politicians and elected officials. Instead he put his trust in disinterested experts, especially judges. He equated common law with custom, and his condemnation of legislation inconsistent with custom, reflected his Mugwumpism. He tried to synthesize traditional thinking with modernity. For example, Carter clung to support for active government intervention he learned from the antebellum Whigs, but he more and more embraced antigovernment positions typical of antebellum Jacksonians. He tried to synthesize traditional faith in timeless, objective moral principles with a more modern vision of evolving customary norms. Given growing problems of industrial urban society he saw the need for positive government but wanted judges to rule not politicians.

A new class of experts needed new modes of training, and those were provided by the new American graduate schools, built along German models. A leading organizer was the German-trained scholar Herbert Baxter Adams (1850–1901), head of the history and political science department at the Johns Hopkins University 1882–1901. He promoted mugwump reform at Hopkins and nationally. Under his direction, the faculty and advanced students worked for numerous reforms, including civil service reform in the Pendleton Act (1883), municipal reform with the New Charter of Baltimore (1895), the training of professional social workers, and efforts to solve labor unrest. Raymond Cunningham, argues that his reformism shows that the Mugwumps movement could attract affirmative and optimistic experts, rather than just suspicious or cautious patricians.

In Chicago, the Mugwump reformers worked through the Citizens&#x27; Association of Chicago, the Chicago Civic Federation, and the Municipal Voters&#x27; League. They opposed corruption, government subsidies, high taxes, and public enterprise. However they also wanted government to solve the problems of the rapidly growing metropolis. This was only possible if the voters were better informed. The newspapers adopted Mugwumpery as a way of building support for municipal reform among working-class voters in the two decades after the 1871 fire. The key leader was Joseph Medill, owner and editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune.&quot;

== Historical appraisals ==

Several historians of the 1950s through 1970s portrayed the Mugwumps as members of an insecure elite, one that felt threatened by changes in American society. These historians often focused on the social background and status of their subjects and the narratives they have written share a common outlook.

Mugwumps tended to come from old Protestant families of New York and New England and often from inherited wealth. They belonged to or identified with the emerging business and professional elite and were often members of the most exclusive clubs. Yet they felt threatened by the rise of machine politics, one aspect of which was the spoils system; and by the rising power of both immigrants and of multi-millionaires in American society. They excelled as authors and essayists, yet their writings indicated their social position and class loyalties. In politics, they tended to be ineffectual and unsuccessful, unable and unwilling to operate effectively in a political environment where patronage was the norm.

In his 1998 work, historian David Tucker attempts to rehabilitate the Mugwumps. According to Tucker, the Mugwumps embodied the liberalism of the 19th century and their rejection by 20th-century historians, who embraced the government intervention of the New Deal and the Great Society, is not surprising. To Tucker, their eloquent writings speak for themselves and are testament to a high minded civic morality.
== Etymology ==
Dictionaries report that &quot;mugguomp&quot; is an Algonquian word meaning &quot;person of importance&quot; or &quot;war leader&quot;. The Indianapolis &quot;Sentinel&quot; pinned the moniker on the Independents in 1872, but it was Charles Anderson Dana, the colorful newspaperman and editor of the now-defunct &quot;New York Sun&quot;, who revived it in March 1884, after which it achieved far wider currency. Dana made the term plural and derided them as amateurs and public moralists.

During the 1884 campaign, they were often portrayed as &quot;fence-sitters&quot;, with part of their body on the side of the Democrats and the other on the side of the Republicans. Their &quot;mug&quot; on one side of the fence, and their &quot;wump&quot; (comic mispronunciation of &quot;rump&quot;) on the other. Angry Republicans like Roscoe Conkling sometimes hinted they were homosexual, calling them &quot;man milliners&quot;.

The epithet &quot;goody-goody&quot; from the 1890s goo-goo, a corruption of &quot;good government&quot;, was used in a similar derogatory manner. Whereas &quot;mugwump&quot; has become an obscure and almost forgotten political moniker, &quot;goo-goo&quot; was revived, especially in Chicago, by the political columns of Mike Royko.

<doc id="406241" wikidata="Q58770" url="?curid=406241" title="Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Ernest I (; 2 January 178429 January 1844) served as the last sovereign duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (as Ernest III) from 1806 to 1826 and the first sovereign duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1826 to 1844. He was the father of Prince Albert, who was the husband of Queen Victoria. Ernest fought against Napoleon Bonaparte, and through construction projects and the establishment of a court theatre, he left a strong imprint on his residence town, Coburg.

==Early life==
Ernest was born on 2 January 1784. He was the eldest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf. His youngest brother, Leopold, was later elected the first king of Belgium.

On 10 May 1803, aged 19, Ernest was proclaimed an adult because his father had become gravely ill, and he was required to take part in the government of the duchy. When his father died in 1806, he succeeded in the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld as Ernest III. However, he could not immediately take over the formal government of his lands, because the duchy was occupied by Napoleonic troops and was under French administration. The following year, after the Peace of Tilsit (1807), the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was reunited (having previously been dissolved) and restored to Ernest. This occurred through Russian pressure, since his sister Juliane was married to the brother of the Russian Tsar.

==Marriages and children==

Ernest married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in Gotha on 31 July 1817. They had two children:
* Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (21 June 181822 August 1893), who married Princess Alexandrine of Baden on 3 May 1842.
* Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (26 August 181914 December 1861), who married Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom on 10 February 1840. They had nine children.

The marriage was unhappy because both husband and wife were promiscuous. As the biographer Lytton Strachey put it: &quot;The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and the Duchess followed her husband&#x27;s example. There were scandals: one of the Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction, was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.&quot; Ernest and Louise were separated in 1824 and were officially divorced on 31 March 1826. As heirs to Coburg, the children remained with their father. Louise died in 1831.

In Coburg on 23 December 1832, Ernest married his niece Duchess Marie of Württemberg, the daughter of his sister Antoinette. They had no children. This marriage made Marie both Prince Albert&#x27;s first cousin and his stepmother.

Ernest had three illegitimate children:
* Berta Ernestine von Schauenstein (26 January 1817Coburg, 15 August 1896), born to Sophie Fermepin de Marteaux. She married her first cousin Eduard Edgar Schmidt-Löwe von Löwenfels, the illegitimate son of her father&#x27;s sister, Juliane.
* Ernst Albert and Robert Ferdinand, twins born in 1838 to Margaretha Braun. They were created &quot;Freiherren von Bruneck&quot; in 1856.

== Estates ==
After 1813, Ernest was a Prussian general and participated in military actions against Napoleon. He fought in the battles of Lützen and Leipzig (1813), and drew in 1814 into the French fortress of Mainz. After the battle of Leipzig, he commanded the &quot;5. Armeekorps&quot;.

After the defeat of Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815 gave Ernest an area of 450 square kilometres with 25,000 inhabitants around the town of St. Wendel. Its area was somewhat augmented by the second Treaty of Paris. In 1816, this estate received the name of Principality of Lichtenberg. Ernest sold it to Prussia in 1834.

In 1825, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, who was the uncle of Ernest&#x27;s first wife Louise, died without an heir. This resulted in a rearrangement of the Ernestine duchies. It was only as a member of the Ernestine dynasty (and not as Louise&#x27;s husband) that Ernest had a claim on the late duke&#x27;s estates. However, he was at that time in the process of divorcing Louise, and the other branches used this as a leverage to drive a better bargain for themselves by insisting that he should not inherit Gotha. They reached a compromise on 12 November 1826: Ernest received Gotha, but had to cede Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen. He subsequently became &quot;Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&quot;. Although he had given a constitution to Coburg in 1821, he did not interfere in the system of government in Gotha.

At Coburg, Ernest was responsible for various construction projects, including the establishment of the &quot;Hoftheater&quot; in its new building. The &quot;Schlossplatz&quot; as it appears today is largely due to work under his rule. He is chiefly remembered for the economic, educational and constitutional development of his territories, and for the significant international position attained by the house of Coburg.

==Death and burial==
Ernest died on 29 January 1844 and was initially buried in the Morizkirche but later reinterred in the newly built mausoleum in &quot;&quot;.

He received the following awards:

<text>A block grant is a grant-in-aid of a specified amount from a larger government to a smaller regional government body. Block grants have less oversight from the larger government and provide flexibility to each subsidiary government body in terms of designing and implementing programs. Block grants, categorical grants, and general revenue sharing are three types of federal government grants-in-aid programs.

== Graphical representation ==
The figure demonstrates the impact of an education block grant on a town&#x27;s budget constraint. According to microeconomic theory, the grant shifts the town&#x27;s budget constraint outwards, enabling the town to spend more on both education and other goods, due to the income effect. While this increases the town&#x27;s utility, it does not maximize the town&#x27;s spending on education. Therefore, if the goal of a grant program is to encourage spending on a particular good, a categorical grant may be more effective in achieving this goal than a block grant, as most block grant critics would argue.

== By country ==
=== United States ===
A block grant in the United States is a grant-in-aid of a specified amount from the federal government of the United States to individual states and local governments to help support various broad purpose programs, such as law enforcement, social services, public health, and community development.

Through a block grant program for Medicaid, for example, each state would receive a set amount of money from the federal government. The block grants can be set based on &quot;per capita&quot; or on the needs of the state. Each state has to fill any funding gap if there is a difference between their spending and the amount set by the federal government.

Block grants are the topic of debate in the United States. According to the 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) advocates, who would like to see Medicaid converted into a block grant, say that block grants assist in reducing the federal deficit, increase government efficiency, redistribute power, improve accountability, and allow for flexibility. Critics, who are specifically against converting Medicaid into block grants, say that block grant &quot;undermine the achievement of national objectives&quot;, &quot;reduce government spending on domestic issues&quot; where, for example, the &quot;most vulnerable seniors, individuals with disabilities, and low-income children&quot; would lose their health care through deep cuts in Medicaid. Critics also say that because block grants are decentralized, it is more challenging to &quot;measure block grant performance and to hold state and local government officials accountable for their decisions&quot;.

In February 2017, the national debate in the United States regarding the effectiveness of block grants intensified as the United States Congress decided whether to convert Medicaid to a block grant program.

According to a January 11, 2019 &quot;Politico&quot; article, the Trump Administration was creating new guidelines to overhaul Medicaid in order to reduce health care costs for the poor through block grants, bypassing Congress. According to the same article, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma had mentioned using CMS&#x27; authority to &quot;pursue block grants during a meeting with state Medicaid directors in the fall&quot; of 2018. Verma promotes block grants but she has &quot;faced heavy scrutiny&quot; from CMS lawyers in her attempts to &quot;insert block grant language into federal guidance.&quot;

====Background====
The 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report says the first true block grant was in 1966. In 1949, first Hoover Commission&#x27;s 1949 report recommended the creation of &quot;a system of grants&quot; based &quot;upon broad categories—such as highways, education, public assistance, and public health—as contrasted with the present system of extensive fragmentation.&quot; The Eisenhower Administration (1953–1961) created &quot;block grants in the health and public welfare fields&quot;. In the 1950s, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) was able to consolidate &quot;child health and welfare, vocational education, and vocational rehabilitation areas&quot; into block grants for public health. But most proposals for block grants repeatedly met rejection in the 1950s. Reasons included a political misalignment between federal and state levels, concerns about a lack or reduction of federal controls, and that giving states wider latitude in spending would be a &quot;more effective and efficient use of public funds.&quot;

In the late 1960s, with both Congress and the White House under control of the Democratic Party, Congress enacted the 1966 Partnership for Health Act and the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act). In a March 16, 2017 &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; article, the authors provided background on health care provisions for the poor in the 1950s and 1960s. Prior to the creation of Medicaid in 1965, health providers were reimbursed directly on a per-capita basis. When the cap was spent, states were responsible for cutting health costs to make up the difference by restricting who, what and how much care one could access. As a result, only 3.4 million people in the US were able to access these benefits in the 1960s before Medicaid. According to an October 1977 U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations report, local government officials compared to federal government officials are &quot;closer to the people&quot; and therefore better able to identify local needs. According to the ACIR report, advocates say block grants allow local governments to experiment with new approaches to solving various problems that other state and local officials can learn from. Such innovation would not be possible if funding were provided through restrictive categorical grants.

During the Nixon Administration (1969–1974) a new strategy, called &quot;special revenue sharing&quot; was developed and implemented from 1972 to 1986, to replace block grants. Through revenue sharing, the United States Congress appropriated federal tax revenue to share with states, cities, counties and townships. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in FY 1986 the year before revenue sharing was eliminated by the Reagan administration, the federal government &quot;distributed $4.5 billion to 39,000 municipalities&quot;.

Revenue sharing lost federal support under Reagan and was replaced by block grants in smaller amounts in 1987. The 1981 Community Services Block Grant under President Reagan consolidated 77 existing anti-poverty grants into nine new block grants with a budget representing c.25% less than the programs they replaced. According to the General Accounting Office, from 1980 to 2001, the number of federal block grant programs went from 450 to 700. The grants were aimed at a wide range of activities from education to healthcare, transportation, housing and counterterrorism.

In 1996, HHS and education moved towards &quot;nationalizing trends&quot;, there was an attempt made towards devolution of welfare policy. In 1996, Congress &quot;replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant&quot;. The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), which provided federal intergovernmental expertise, &quot;played an important role in the design and creation of a host of intergovernmental policy initiatives, including block grants. ACIR was eliminated in 1996.

According to a 2017 CBPP study, since 2000, funding for the 13 major low-income health, housing, and social services block grants has fallen by 37%, after adjusting for inflation and population growth. This sharp reduction in funding can be attributed to the basic structure of block grants. Since block grants are designed to give local governments broad flexibility over their use of federal funds, recipients can turn these grants into savings, or spend them on other matters. As a result, it is often difficult to track in detail how these funds are being used, and what greater impact they have, thus making block grants very vulnerable to funding reductions or freezes.

In 2003, under the state Homeland Security Grant Program and Critical Infrastructure Protection, the least populous state, Wyoming received $17.5 million and the most populous state, California, received $164 million. In fiscal year 2004, Wyoming was guaranteed to receive at least $15 million, California $133 million. Wyoming thus received $35.3 per person, California only $4.7 per person. The formulas for how much money states receive favors small states. Most grant programs have a minimum amount per state, usually 0.5% or 0.75% of the total money given to states in the program. Similar patterns exist for other block grant formulas. An analysis exists in the book &quot;Sizing Up the Senate&quot;. Additionally, individual states may provide block grants to their political subdivisions, such as counties, towns, and school districts. Despite the various theoretical arguments in favor of block grants, existing research has mainly found that block grants are generally ineffective in achieving policy goals.

According to a 2004 book entitled &quot;Block Grants: Details of the Bush Proposals&quot;, critics of block grants argued that the flexibility block grant programs gave to local governments diminished the ability of federal administrators to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs, especially given that there were often no federal requirements for uniform program data collection across states. Opponents also said that the lack of restriction regarding where local officials spend block grant funding would enable them to retarget resources away from communities with the greatest need, to communities with the greatest political influence. Block grant critics said that the funding for block grants was prone to diminish over time because it was more difficult to regenerate political support for broad-purpose, state-run programs, than for categorical programs focusing on specific purposes.

The budget for FY 2005 under President Bush budget converted many federal programs into block grants to save $1.8 billion. Eighteen community development block grant programs were consolidated into one Commerce Department program.

In 2009, Carl Stenberg wrote that block grants &quot;could contribute a greater degree of flexibility to the intergovernmental system, but their potential [was] often overstated and difficult to realize.&quot; He said that there was no empirical evidence that block grants reduce administrative costs as these costs were transferred from the federal government to the recipient states.

According to a 2013 Center for American Progress, from 2008 through 2013, categorical grant funding decreased for 29 out of 50 states as did block grants.

According to a 2009 U.S. Office of Management and Budget report, in 2008 block grants received the lowest average score based on the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), a set of questionnaires developed by the George W. Bush Administration to assess the efficacy of various federal funding programs. Out of the seven PART program types in 2008, 30% of block grant programs were rated &quot;results not demonstrated&quot;, and 5% were rated &quot;ineffective&quot;. Block grant advocates said that PART&#x27;s strong weighting of program results in its calculations make it a poor measure for evaluating block grant performance. While PART examines how programs achieve a single outcome, many block grant programs contain multiple outcomes which are often contradictory to each other, and thus the overall impact of block grants may be underestimated.

A 2014 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report entitled &quot;Block Grants: Perspectives and Controversies&quot; said that there were &quot;21 funded block grants, totaling about $50.8 billion in FY2014&quot; which represented &quot;less than 10% of total federal grant-in-aid assistance.&quot; The CRS report provided arguments for both side of the debate on the use of block grants. Those who support block grants, say that they were more cost-effective because they reduce federal administrative costs related to state and local government paperwork requirements.

According to a June 2015 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, the amount of basic assistance that block grants provide has also fallen, as local governments spend their federal funds on other purposes. For example, in 2015, only half of the funds received from the TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) block grant were spent on core welfare reform activities such as cash assistance, work activities, and child care. The rest of the funds were spent on a variety of different matters unrelated to the program.

The CBPP study said that, &quot;Unlike block grants, entitlement programs such as Medicaid and SNAP are highly responsive to changes in need. They grow immediately and automatically when need rises. This growth is critically important during recessions...Programs like Medicaid and SNAP would lose this responsiveness if turned into block grants.&quot;

=== Denmark ===
Greenland receives a block grant from Denmark. The block grant equals about two-thirds of Greenland&#x27;s government budget or about one-quarter of the entire GDP of Greenland. Economic stability is seen as a basis for full political independence from Denmark. When Kim Kielsen was reelected with a strong majority as the leader of the largest Greenlandic pro-independence party Siumut in 2017, observers considered it a win for the &quot;slow-independence&quot; faction instead of the &quot;now-independence&quot; faction. (His opponent, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, had argued for independence even if it meant losing the large annual block grant from the Danish state.) If Greenland were to become an independent country, the annual block grant from Denmark to Greenland would cease.

=== United Kingdom ===
Since devolution in the United Kingdom was implemented in the late 1990s, creating the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly, the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been funded by block grants from the government of the United Kingdom because only a relatively small percentage of the tax revenue is collected by the devolved governments.

Westminster provides a block grant for Transport for London reflecting the expense of operating the London Underground and the fact the Greater London Authority is unable to raise a transport levy on council tax unlike other metropolitan counties in the UK (though since 2012 the Mayor of London&#x27;s Community Infrastructure Levy has been introduced, allowing the Mayor to attach a levy on property development to serve a similar function).

Under the terms of the Scotland Act 2012, the block grant from the United Kingdom government to Scotland will be cut, but the Scottish Government will be able to collect an equivalent amount of income tax.

=== Netherlands ===
On the other hand, there is limited research that suggests that block grants have a positive impact on policy outcomes. One study in the Netherlands evaluating the ADHA (Assistance in Daily Housekeeping Activities) block grant finds that for each additional euro of grant money given to local governments, 50 cents is spent on ADHA. Consequently, the authors argue that block grants can achieve important outcomes, and that categorical grants are not necessary to force spending on particular issues. However, block grant critics would likely argue that this 50% spending rate on ADHA is a sign of ineffectiveness, as it means that local governments are spending the rest of the funding on unrelated issues.

<doc id="406245" wikidata="Q178351" url="?curid=406245" title="Antonov An-225 Mriya">
<text>The Antonov An-225 Mriya (; NATO reporting name: Cossack) was a strategic airlift cargo aircraft designed and produced by the Antonov Design Bureau in the Soviet Union.

It was originally developed during the 1980s as an enlarged derivative of the Antonov An-124 airlifter for transporting &quot;Buran&quot; spacecraft. On 21 December 1988, the An-225 performed its maiden flight; only one aircraft was ever completed, although a second airframe with a slightly different configuration was partially built. After a brief period of use in the Soviet space programme, the aircraft was mothballed during the early 1990s. Towards the turn of the century, it was decided to refurbish the An-225 and reintroduce it for commercial operations, carrying oversized payloads for the operator Antonov Airlines. Multiple announcements were made regarding the potential completion of the second airframe, though its construction largely remained on hold due to a lack of funding. By 2009, it had reportedly been brought up to 60–70% completion.

With a maximum takeoff weight of , the An-225 held several records, including heaviest aircraft ever built and largest wingspan of any operational aircraft. It was commonly used to transport objects once thought impossible to move by air, such as 130-ton generators, wind turbine blades, and diesel locomotives. Additionally, both Chinese and Russian officials had announced separate plans to adapt the An-225 for use in their respective space programmes. The Mriya routinely attracted a high degree of public interest, attaining a global following due to its size and its uniqueness. 

The only completed An-225 was destroyed in the Battle of Antonov Airport in 2022 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced plans to complete the second An-225 to replace the destroyed aircraft.

==Development==
Work on the Antonov An-225 began in 1984 with a request from the Soviet government for a large airlifter as a replacement for the Myasishchev VM-T. The specifics of this request included the ability to carry a maximum payload of , both externally and internally, while operating from any runway of at least . As originally set out, the mission and objectives were broadly identical to that of the United States&#x27; Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, having been designed to airlift the Energia rocket&#x27;s boosters and the &quot;Buran&quot;-class orbiters for the Soviet space program. Furthermore, a relatively short timetable for the delivery of the completed aircraft meant that development would have to proceed at a rapid pace.
Accordingly, the Antonov Design Bureau produced a derivative of their existing Antonov An-124 Ruslan airlifter. The aircraft was stretched via the addition of fore and aft fuselage barrel sections, while a new enlarged wing centre was designed that facilitated the carriage of an additional pair of Progress D-18T turbofan engines, increasing the total from four to six powerplants. A completely new tail was also required to handle the wake turbulence generated by the bulky external loads that would be carried on the aircraft&#x27;s upper fuselage. Despite the novelty of its scale, the design of the An-225 was largely conventional. The lead designer of the An-225 (and the An-124) was Viktor Tolmachev.
On 21 December 1988, the An-225 performed its maiden flight. It made its first public appearance outside the Soviet Union at the 1989 Paris Air Show where it was presented carrying a Buran orbiter. One year later, it performed a flying display for the public days at the Farnborough Air Show. While two aircraft had been ordered, only a single An-225, (registration &quot;CCCP-82060&quot;, later &quot;UR-82060&quot;) was finished. It could carry ultra-heavy and oversized freight weighing up to internally or on the upper fuselage. Cargo on the upper fuselage can be up to in length.

A second An-225 was partially built during the late 1980s for the Soviet space program, however, work on the airframe was suspended following the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 2000, the need for additional An-225 capacity had become apparent; during September 2006, it was decided that the second An-225 would be completed, a feat that was at one point scheduled to occur around 2008. However, the work was subject to repeated delays. By August 2009, the aircraft had not been completed and work had been abandoned. In May 2011, the Antonov CEO reportedly stated that the completion of the second An-225, which would have a carrying capacity of 250 tons, requires at least $300 million; upon the provision of sufficient financing, its completion could be achieved in three years. According to different sources, the second aircraft was 60–70% complete by 2016.
The revival of space activities involving the An-225 was repeatedly announced and speculated upon throughout its life. During the early 2000s, studies were conducted into the production of an even larger An-225 derivative, the eight-engined Antonov An-325, which was intended to be used in conjunction with Russia&#x27;s in-development MAKS space plane. In April 2013, the Russian government announced plans to revive Soviet-era air launch projects that would use a purpose-built modification to the An-225 as a midair launchpad.

In May 2017, Airspace Industry Corporation of China (AICC)&#x27;s president, Zhang You-Sheng, informed a BBC reporter that AICC had first contemplated cooperation with Antonov in 2009 and made contact with them two years later. AICC intends to modernize the second unfinished An-225 and develop it into an air launch to orbit platform for commercial satellites at altitudes up to . The aviation media cast doubt on the production restart, speculating that the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war would prevent various necessary components that would have been sourced from Russia from being delivered; it may be possible that China could manufacture them instead. That project did not move forward but UkrOboronProm, the parent company of Antonov, had continued to seek partners to finish the second airframe.

On 25 March 2020, the first An-225 commenced a series of test flights from Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, after more than a year out of service, for the installation of a domestically designed power management and control system.

==Design==
The Antonov An-225 was a strategic airlift cargo aircraft that retained many similarities with the preceding An-124 airlifter that it was derived from. It had a longer fuselage and cargo deck due to the addition of fuselage barrel extensions that were fitted both fore and aft of the wings. The wings, which were anhedral, also received root extensions to increase their span. The flight control surfaces were controlled via fly-by-wire and powered by triple-redundant hydraulics. Furthermore, the empennage of the An-225 was a twin tail with an oversized, swept-back horizontal stabilizer, having been redesigned from the single vertical stabilizer of the An-124. The use of a twin tail arrangement was essential to enable the aircraft to carry its bulky external loads that would generate wake turbulence, disturbing the airflow around a conventional tail.

The An-225 was powered by a total of six Progress D-18T turbofan engines, two more than the An-124, the addition of which was facilitated by the redesigned wing root area. An increased-capacity landing gear system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable; these enable the airlifter to turn within a runway. Akin to its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 incorporated a nose gear designed to &quot;kneel&quot; so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded. Additional measures to ease loading and unloading activities included the four overhead cargo cranes that could move along the whole length of the cargo hold, each of which was capable of lifting up to . To facilitate the attachment of external loads, such as the Buran orbiter, various mounting points were present along the upper surface of the fuselage.

Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for tactical airlifting and was not designed for short-field operations. Accordingly, the An-225 does not have a rear cargo door or ramp, as are present on the An-124, these features having been eliminated in order to save weight. The cargo hold was in volume; wide, high, and long—longer than the first flight of the Wright Flyer. The cargo hold, which was pressurized and furnished with extensive soundproofing, could contain up to 80 standard-dimension cars, 16 intermodal containers, or up to of general cargo.

The flight deck of the An-225 was at the front of the upper deck, which was accessed via a ladder from the lower deck. This flight deck was largely identical to that of the An-124, save for the presence of additional controls to manage the additional pair of engines. To the rear of the flight deck was an array of compartments which, amongst other things, accommodated the crew stations for the aircraft&#x27;s two flight engineers, navigator, and communication specialist, along with off-duty rest areas, including beds, which facilitated long range missions to be flown. Even when fully loaded, the An-225 was capable of flying non-stop across great distances, such as between New York and Los Angeles.

As originally constructed, the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of , however, between 2000 and 2001, the aircraft received numerous modifications at a cost of million, such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to . Both the earlier and later takeoff weights establish the An-225 as the world&#x27;s heaviest aircraft, exceeding the weight of the double-deck Airbus A380 airliner. Airbus claims to have improved upon the An-225&#x27;s maximum landing weight by landing an A380 at during testing.

==Operational history==
The Antonov An-225 Mriya was originally operated between 1988 and 1991 as the prime method of transporting &quot;Buran&quot;-class orbiters for the Soviet space program. Its first pilot was Oleksandr Halunenko, who continued flying it until 2004. &quot;Antonov Airlines&quot; was concurrently founded in 1989 after it was set up as a holding company by the Antonov Design Bureau as a heavy airlift shipping corporation. This company was to be based in Kyiv, Ukraine, and operate from London Luton Airport in partnership with Air Foyle HeavyLift. While operations began with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three Antonov An-12s, the need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent by the late 1990s.

By this time, the Soviet Union was no longer in existence and the &quot;Buran&quot; program had been terminated; consequently, the sole completed An-225 was left unused and without a purpose. As early as 1990, Antonov officials were openly speaking on their ambitions for the aircraft to enter commercial use. Despite this, in 1994, it was decided to put the An-225 into long-term storage. During this time, all six of its engines were removed for use on various An-124s, while the second uncompleted An-225 airframe was also stored. As the 1990s progressed, it became clear that there was sufficient demand for a cargo liner even bigger than the An-124. Accordingly, it was decided that the first An-225 would be restored.

The aircraft was re-engined, received modifications to modernise and better adapt it to heavy cargo transport operations, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines. It became the workhorse of the Antonov Airlines fleet, transporting objects once thought impossible to move by air, such as 130-ton generators, wind turbine blades, and even diesel locomotives. It also became an asset to international relief organizations for its ability to quickly transport huge quantities of emergency supplies during multiple disaster-relief operations.

Under Antonov Airlines, the An-225 received its type certificate from the Interstate Aviation Committee Aviation Register (IAC AR) on 23 May 2001. The type&#x27;s first flight in commercial service departed from Stuttgart, Germany, on 3 January 2002, and flew to Thumrait, Oman, with 216,000 prepared meals for American military personnel based in the region. This vast number of ready meals was transported on 375 pallets and weighed 187.5 tons. The An-225 was later contracted by the Canadian and U.S. governments to transport military supplies to the Middle East in support of coalition forces. An example of the cost of shipping cargo by An-225 was over (about ) for flying a chimney duct from Billund, Denmark, to Kazakhstan in 2004.

During 2016, Antonov Airlines ceased cooperation with Air Foyle and partnered with Volga-Dnepr instead. This led to the An-225&#x27;s blue and yellow paint scheme, added in 2009. These matched the colors of the Ukrainian flag and led to the An-225 becoming &quot;Ukraine&#x27;s winged ambassador to the world,&quot; in the words of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

When the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world in early 2020, the An-225 participated in the relief effort by conducting flights to deliver medical supplies from China to other parts of the world.

The aircraft was popular with aviation enthusiasts, who frequently visited airports to view its scheduled arrivals and departures.

===Records===

On 11 August 2009, the heaviest single cargo item ever sent by air was loaded onto the An-225. At long and wide, its consignment, a generator for a gas power plant in Armenia along with its loading frame, represented a payload of , It also transported a total payload of on a commercial flight.

On 11 September 2001, carrying five main battle tanks at a record load of of cargo, the An-225 flew at an altitude of up to over a closed circuit of at a speed of . During 2017, the hired cost was () per hour.

On 11 June 2010, the An-225 carried the world&#x27;s longest piece of air cargo, two test wind turbine blades from Tianjin, China, to Skrydstrup, Denmark.

On 27 September 2012, the An-225 hosted the highest altitude art exhibition in the world at above sea level during the AviaSvit-XX1 Aerospace Show at Antonov Airport. The exhibition was part of the Globus Gallery based in Kyiv and consisted of 500 artworks by 120 Ukrainian artists.

In total, the An-225 has set 240 world records, which is unique in aviation.

===Destruction===

The aircraft&#x27;s last commercial mission was from 2 to 5 February 2022, to collect almost 90 tons of COVID-19 test kits from Tianjin, China, and deliver them to Billund, Denmark, via Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. From there, it returned on 5 February to its base at Antonov Airport in Hostomel, where it underwent an engine swap. On the advice of NATO it was prepared for evacuation, scheduled for the morning of 24 February, but on that day Russia invaded, with the airfield being one of their first targets. A ban on civilian flights was quickly enacted by Ukrainian authorities. During the ensuing Battle of Antonov Airport, the runway was rendered unusable.

On 24 February, the An-225 was said to be intact. On 27 February, a photo was posted on Twitter of an object tentatively identified as the An-225 on fire in its hangar. A report by the Ukrainian edition of Radio Liberty stated that the airplane was destroyed during the Battle of Antonov Airport, which was repeated by Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and by Ukroboronprom, Antonov&#x27;s parent organisation. The Antonov company initially refused to confirm or deny the reports, and said it was still investigating them.

Also on 27 February, a press release by Ukroboronprom stated that the An-225 had been destroyed by Russian forces. Several other aircraft were in the same hangar as the An-225 at the time of its destruction, and were also destroyed or damaged during the battle; these include a Hungarian-registered Cessna 152, which was crushed by the An-225&#x27;s left wingtip after the latter fell on top of it.

Ukroboronprom said that they planned to rebuild the plane at the Russians&#x27; expense. The statement said: &quot;The restoration is estimated to take over 3 billion USD and over five years. Our task is to ensure that these costs are covered by the Russian Federation, which has caused intentional damage to Ukraine&#x27;s aviation and the air cargo sector.&quot; The Ukrainian government also said that it would be rebuilt.

===Aftermath===
On 1 March, a new photograph, taken since the initial conflict, was tentatively identified as the tail of the aircraft protruding from its hangar, suggesting that it remained at least partly intact, however, further evidence proved to show that the aircraft is inoperable due to the extreme damage it sustained. On 3 March, a video circulated on social media, showing the aircraft burning inside the hangar alongside several Russian trucks, confirming its likely destruction. Nonetheless, Antonov stated again that until the aircraft is inspected by experts, its official status could not be fully known. On 4 March, footage on Russian state television Channel One showed the first clear ground images of the destroyed aircraft, with much of the front section missing. Following Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from northern Ukraine, the second unfinished aircraft airframe was reported to be intact, despite Russian artillery strikes on the hangar housing it at the Antonov factory at Sviatoshyn Airfield.

Major Dmytro Antonov, the pilot of the An-225, alleged on 19 March 2022 that Antonov Airlines knew that an invasion was imminent for quite some time, but did nothing to prevent the loss of the aircraft. On his YouTube channel, Antonov accused company management of not doing enough to prevent the destruction of the aircraft, after having been advised by NATO to move the aircraft (ready to fly status) to Leipzig, Germany, in advance. Multiple Antonov staff have denied his allegations.

On 1 April, drone footage of Hostomel Airport showed the destroyed Mriya, with the forward fuselage completely burned and destroyed, but with the wings partly intact. It was later revealed that the right wing had been broken, but was held up only by its engines resting on the ground.

Investigations into rebuilding the An-225 are being undertaken, including the possibilities of cannibalising the second, incomplete An-225, or salvaging the remnants of the first plane to finish the second. However, there are several obstacles to rebuilding. Many of the aircraft&#x27;s Soviet-made components were from the 1980s and are no longer made. Engineers quote a price of US$350–500 million, although there is uncertainty regarding whether or not it would be commercially viable and worth the cost. However, Andrii Sovenko, a former An-225 pilot and aviation author, said:
On 20 May 2022, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced his intentions to complete the second An-225, to replace the destroyed aircraft and as a tribute to all the Ukrainian pilots killed during the war. In November 2022, Antonov confirmed plans to rebuild the aircraft at an estimated cost of $500 million. At the time, the company did not state whether parts from the wrecked aircraft and the incomplete airframe would be combined to create a new flying aircraft or where funding might come from. Four months later, Antonov confirmed that parts had been removed from the wrecked aircraft for future mating to the unfinished fuselage.

In March 2023, the Ukrainian government announced that it detained two of three Antonov officials suspected of preventing the Ukrainian National Guard from setting up defenses at Hostomel Airport in anticipation of an invasion.

In April 2023, Ukrainian prosecutors charged the former head of Antonov, Serhii Bychkov, with &quot;official negligence&quot; for failing to order the aircraft flown to Leipzig, Germany, ahead of the Russian invasion. The Ukraine Security Service (SBU) who investigated the case stated, &quot;according to the investigation, on the eve of the full-scale invasion, the An-225 was in proper technical condition, which allowed it to fly outside Ukraine. Instead, the general director of the company did not give appropriate instruction regarding the evacuation of Mriya abroad. Such criminal actions of the official led to the destruction of the Ukrainian transport plane.&quot;

==Former operators==
;
* Antonov Airlines for Soviet &quot;Buran&quot; program, the company (and aircraft) passed to Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
* Antonov Airlines for commercial operations from 3 January 2002, until 24 February 2022, the sole aircraft was destroyed during the Battle of Antonov Airport.

==Variants==
;An-224
:Original proposal with a rear cargo door. Not built.

;An-225
:Variant without the rear cargo door. One built, second aircraft incomplete.

;An-225-100
:Designation applied to the An-225 after its 2000 modernization. Upgrades included a traffic collision avoidance system, improved communications and navigation equipment, and noise reduction features.

;An-325

:Proposed enlarged, eight-engined aircraft, specifically designed to launch spacecraft of various purposes into orbit. Initially designed for the MAKS program, the An-325 eventually evolved to a joint cooperation between British Aerospace and the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry as a part of the Interim HOTOL program. It remains unbuilt.

;AKS
:Intended to carry the Tupolev OOS air-launch-to-orbit spaceplane; a twin-fuselage design consisting of two An-225 fuselages, with the OOS to be carried under the raised center wing. Multiple engine configurations were proposed, ranging from 18 Progress D-18T turbofans to as many as 40 engines, with placements both above and below the wings. An alternative design for the AKS was to use entirely new fuselages, each with a single tail. The AKS was deemed unfeasible, and no prototypes were ever built.

<doc id="406258" wikidata="Q2299801" url="?curid=406258" title="Leo I, Prince of Armenia">
<text>Leo I (), also Levon I or Leon I, (unknown – Constantinople, February 14, 1140) was the fifth lord of Armenian Cilicia (1129/1130–1137).

He expanded his rule over the Cilician plains and even to the Mediterranean shores. In his time, relations between the Armenians and the Franks (the Crusaders), two former allies, were not always as courteous as before: a major cause of dissension between them was the ownership of the strongholds of the southern Amanus, and on the neighboring coasts of the Gulf of Alexandretta.

Leo was captured after being invited to a meeting by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus, who had sworn a false promise of peace.

==His early life==
Leo&#x27;s father was Constantine I, lord of Armenian Cilicia.

After the death of Constantine I, Leo&#x27;s brother Thoros I became the ruler. Sometime between 1100 and 1103, Leo married

==His rule==

Other authors (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Jacob G. Ghazarian, Vahan M. Kurkjian) suggest that Thoros I was directly succeeded by Leo.

===Conflicts with the Franks===
Leo paid 60,000 gold pieces and gave his son as a hostage. An alliance was then formed against the Emperor John II Comnenus, who was then pressing his claims against Antioch as well as Cilicia.

===The (re-)occupation of Cilicia by the Byzantines===
Eventually, John invited Leo to a meeting under a false promise of peace, where the prince was captured. Leo and two of his sons, Roupen and Thoros, were subsequently taken prisoner.

==His last years in exile==
Leo and his two sons were sent to prison in Constantinople. They were soon allowed to live in the court under surveillance and John acted more honorably towards Leo, with the two dining and going on hunting parties together. Leo&#x27;s son Roupen was later murdered by Byzantine grandees that were envious of his strength.

Leo died in Constantinople.

==Marriage and children==
Orderic Vitalis states that Leo was &quot;uncle to the wife of Bohemond II of Antioch&quot;. On this basis, some authors have proposed that Hugh I of Rethel or Gabriel of Melitene was her father.

<doc id="406259" wikidata="Q335746" url="?curid=406259" title="Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo">
<text>The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo () is a human rights organization with the goal of finding the children stolen and illegally adopted during the 1976–1983 Argentine military dictatorship. The president is Estela Barnes de Carlotto.

The organization was founded in 1977 to locate children kidnapped during the repression, some of them born to mothers in prison who later &quot;disappeared&quot;, and to return the children to their surviving biological families. Around 30,000 people between the ages of 16 and 35 are believed to have disappeared; around 30% were women, and of those women, around 3% were pregnant. The work of the Grandmothers, assisted by United States geneticist Mary-Claire King, has led to the location of about 25 percent of the estimated 500 children kidnapped or born in detention centers. During the military era they were illegally adopted, with their original identities hidden.

By 1998 the identities of about 71 missing children had been documented. Of those, 56 were located alive and 7 others had died. The Grandmothers&#x27; work led to the creation of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team and the establishment of the National Bank of Genetic Data. Aided by breakthroughs in genetic testing, the Grandmothers succeeded in returning 31 children to their biological families. In 13 other cases, adoptive and biological families agreed to jointly raise the children after they had been identified. The remaining cases are bogged down in court custody battles between families. As of July 2023, their efforts have resulted in finding 133 grandchildren.

The kidnapped babies were part of a systematic government plan during the &quot;Dirty War&quot; to pass the children for adoption by military families and allies of the regime and thereby avoid raising another generation of subversives. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the junta feared that &quot;the anguish generated in the rest of the surviving family because of the absence of the disappeared would develop, after a few years, into a new generation of subversive or potentially subversive elements, thereby not permitting an effective end to the Dirty War&quot;.

As an offshoot of the Silvia Quintela case, former dictator Jorge Videla was detained under house-arrest in 2010 on multiple charges of kidnapping children. In July 2012 he was convicted and sentenced to fifty years in prison for the systematic stealing of babies.

On 14 September 2011 the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo received the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize in Paris for their work in defense of Human Rights.

== The Dirty War and methodology ==

The war began in 1976 under the government of Lieutenant General Jorge Rafaél Videla. It was a period of state-sponsored violent purges directed towards everyone deemed to be a leftist supporter. Part of Videla&#x27;s campaign aimed to deter the possibility of a new generation growing up subversive. Although men and women were abducted, children were of higher value and importance in shaping the future of Argentina. There was a waiting list of military families who wanted to adopt the trafficked children. These families specified ideal physical characteristics such as sex, hair and eye color. The children who were not chosen by new families were placed in orphanages and adopted later in their lives. It was not until almost a decade later that general elections resumed and democracy was restored to the country with the election of democrat and leader of the Radical Civic Union Raúl Alfonsín .

The Dirty War is considered an infamous period of time in Latin America for the disappearance of almost 30,000 people. No one demographic of people were abducted. Any person suspected as a threat to the dictatorship would be taken; this includes men and women, young and old, pregnant women, students, middle class workers, lawyers, scientists etc. The military tactics such as Operation Condor and a &quot;night and fog&quot; regime allowed the Argentine government along with other countries surrounding it to deny its actions. While hundreds of people were taken and placed into detention centers that were widely scattered across South America, the government could say that it had never heard of such allegations. With these tactics, the government was able to carry out mass executions. Victims were also thrown from airplanes into the sea, died in captivity or were killed by other torture methods.

== The legacy of the war ==
Following the military dictatorship, psychologists and other mental health workers have determined that the damages of the war have had long-term effects on three generations of Argentines: the first category being the parents of those who had disappeared under Operation Condor, the second being the children of those who disappeared, and the last of course being the disappeared themselves. Each generation suffering from some sort of long-term psychological harm due to living through a time that legitimized crime. Studies have also noticed that there is conflict in human rights to privacy.

The purpose of the grandmothers forming their organization was to find those who went missing during the war as well as provide rehabilitation to those they are able to identify, a cause that is still being fulfilled. However, even today there is a conflict with that aim because on one hand, the grandmothers deserve to know what happened to their loved ones. On the other hand, the children sometimes refuse identification methods such as DNA testing and refuse to reunite with their biological family. The refusal has both been voluntary and involuntary; voluntary if the children truly do not want to reunite with their biological family, involuntary if the children have been threatened or intimidated out of reuniting, most likely by the government or other military personnel who had adopted the children at the time of the kidnappings. Many of the children who were abducted decline the option to meet their biological family because they believe that they are not their true relatives due to the fact that the children were deprived of being raised by their biological parents. Meeting with relatives such as the grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo may open up dark memories that the children cannot handle. Whatever the circumstance of the child, the organization still believes in providing the abducted the opportunity to learn more about themselves and their family history no matter how tragic it is, which is why the grandmothers have continued their movement, periodically protesting to gain more followers. They make sure to continue to protest at the plaza to remind the people of Argentina that their work is not finished.

== Formation ==
The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo was founded in 1977 to protect children&#x27;s rights as a response to state sponsored terrorism. Initially they were known as Argentine Grandmothers with Disappeared Little Grandchildren (&quot;Abuelas Argentinas con Nietitos Desaparecidos&quot;), but later adopted the name The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo (&quot;Las Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo&quot;). In 1983 the constitutional government was re-established and the grandmothers searched for missing children using anonymous tips and conducted their own investigations, but were unable to prove the children&#x27;s identities. Geneticists from the United States worked with the Grandmothers and were able to store blood samples from family members in the National Genetic Data Bank until the grandchildren could be located and could confirm the relatedness with an accuracy rate of 99.99%. The Grandmothers fought through the court systems to annul the unlawful adoptions. By the mid 1990s legal battles of custody were no longer appropriate because the missing grandchildren were now legal adults. The grandmothers adapted their strategy and started public awareness campaigns to direct the missing grandchildren to contact the organization. As of 2008, their efforts had resulted in finding 97 grandchildren.

== Work with Identity Archive ==
In 2000, the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo partnered with the Identity Archive to provide collections of photos, films, audiotapes, diaries, significant objects, and personal stories from families whose children and grandchildren had disappeared. This was done because some of the grandparents were aging and dying without finding their grandchildren and the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo wanted to provide these accounts if children were found in the future.

== Public awareness campaigns ==
In the mid to late 1990s, the missing grandchildren that the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo sought became legal adults. The Grandmothers then turned to public awareness campaigns to achieve their goals. The difference between Argentina&#x27;s case and other child trafficking cases is that the disappeared children likely did not know that they were adopted. The organization turned to a commercial campaign and joined with actors to appeal to younger audiences. Their goal was to use popular culture to create doubt within the minds of a group of people who would have never questioned their family.

Besides the public protests at the time of the trafficking, the grandmothers have continued to put their efforts into locating more people to this day. Today, the women are known for providing other services such as legal counseling, assistance in investigations, as well as certain forms of psychological support for other women and their families. With these resources, families are able to receive comfort and rehabilitation. The women of the organization also provide training and seminars to teach new volunteers how to assist in rehabilitation services as well as learn more on human rights work.

Remediation may be required by regulations before development of land revitalization projects. Developers who agree to voluntary cleanup may be offered incentives under state or municipal programs like New York State&#x27;s Brownfield Cleanup Program. If remediation is done by removal the waste materials are simply transported off-site for disposal at another location. The waste material can also be contained by physical barriers like slurry walls. The use of slurry walls is well-established in the construction industry. The application of (low) pressure grouting, used to mitigate soil liquefaction risks in San Francisco and other earthquake zones, has achieved mixed results in field tests to create barriers, and site-specific results depend upon many variable conditions that can greatly impact outcomes.

Remedial action is generally subject to an array of regulatory requirements, and may also be based on assessments of human health and ecological risks where no legislative standards exist, or where standards are advisory.

==Remediation standards==
In the United States, the most comprehensive set of Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &quot;Regional Screening Levels&quot; (RSLs). A set of standards used in Europe exists and is often called the Dutch standards. The European Union (EU) is rapidly moving towards Europe-wide standards, although most of the industrialised nations in Europe have their own standards at present. In Canada, most standards for remediation are set by the provinces individually, but the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment provides guidance at a federal level in the form of the &quot;Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines&quot; and the &quot;Canada-Wide Standards|Canada-Wide Standard for Petroleum Hydrocarbons in Soil&quot;.

==Site assessment==
Once a site is suspected of being contaminated there is a need to assess the contamination. Often the assessment begins with preparation of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment. The historical use of the site and the materials used and produced on site will guide the assessment strategy and type of sampling and chemical analysis to be done. Often nearby sites owned by the same company or which are nearby and have been reclaimed, levelled or filled are also contaminated even where the current land use seems innocuous. For example, a car park may have been levelled by using contaminated waste in the fill. Also important is to consider off site contamination of nearby sites often through decades of emissions to soil, groundwater, and air. Ceiling dust, topsoil, surface and groundwater of nearby properties should also be tested, both before and after any remediation. This is a controversial step as:
# No one wants to have to pay for the cleanup of the site;
# If nearby properties are found to be contaminated it may have to be noted on their property title, potentially affecting the value;
# No one wants to pay for the cost of assessment.

Often corporations which do voluntary testing of their sites are protected from the reports to environmental agencies becoming public under Freedom of Information Acts, however a &quot;Freedom of Information&quot; inquiry will often produce other documents that are not protected or will produce references to the reports.

==Funding remediation==
In the US there has been a mechanism for taxing polluting industries to form a Superfund to remediate abandoned sites, or to litigate to force corporations to remediate their contaminated sites. Other countries have other mechanisms and commonly sites are rezoned to &quot;higher&quot; uses such as high density housing, to give the land a higher value so that after deducting cleanup costs there is still an incentive for a developer to purchase the land, clean it up, redevelop it and sell it on, often as apartments (home units).

==Mapping remediation==
There are several tools for mapping these sites and which allow the user to view additional information. One such tool is TOXMAP, a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) Superfund and Toxics Release Inventory programs.

==Technologies==
Remediation technologies are many and varied but can generally be categorized into ex-situ and in-situ methods. Ex-situ methods involve excavation of affected soils and subsequent treatment at the surface as well as extraction of contaminated groundwater and treatment at the surface. In-situ methods seek to treat the contamination without removing the soils or groundwater. Various technologies have been developed for remediation of oil-contaminated soil/sediments.

Traditional remediation approaches consist of soil excavation and disposal to landfill and groundwater &quot;pump and treat&quot;. In-situ technologies include but are not limited to: solidification and stabilization, soil vapor extraction, permeable reactive barriers, monitored natural attenuation, bioremediation-phytoremediation, chemical oxidation, steam-enhanced extraction and in situ thermal desorption and have been used extensively in the USA.

===Barriers===

Contaminants can be removed from a site or controlled. One option for control are barrier walls, which can be temporary to prevent contamination during treatment and removal, or more permanent. Techniques to construct barrier walls are deep soil mixing, jet grouting, low pressure grouting with cement and chemicals, freezing and slurry walls. Barrier walls must be constructed of impermeable materials and resistant to deterioration from contact with waste, for the lifespan of the barrier wall. It wasn&#x27;t until the use of newer polymer and chemical grouts in the 1950s and 1960s that Federal agencies of the US government recognized the need to establish a minimum project life of 50 years in real world applications.

The Department of Energy is one US government agency that sponsors research to formulate, test and determine use applications for innovative polymer grouts used in waste containment barriers. Portland cement was used in the past, however cracking and poor performance under wet-dry conditions at arid sites need improved materials to remedy. Sites that need remediation have variable humidity, moisture and soil conditions. Field implementation remains challenging: different environmental and site conditions require different materials and the placement technologies are specific to the characteristics of the compounds used which vary in viscosity, gel time and density:

&quot;The selection of subsurface barriers for any given site which needs remediation, and the selection of a particular barrier technology must be done, however, by means of the Superfund Process, with special emphasis on the remedial investigation and feasibility study portions. The chemical compatibility of the material with the wastes, leachates and geology with which it is likely to come in contact is of particular importance for barriers constructed from fluids which are supposed to set in-situ. EPA emphasizes this compatibility in its guidance documents, noting that thorough characterization of the waste, leachate, barrier material chemistry, site geochemistry, and compatibility testing of the barrier material with the likely disposal site chemical environment are all required.&quot;

These guidelines are for all materials - experimental and traditional.

===Thermal desorption===
Thermal desorption is a technology for soil remediation. During the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants (e.g. oil, mercury or hydrocarbon) to separate them from especially soil or sludge. After that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system.

===Excavation or dredging===

&quot;Excavation&quot; processes can be as simple as hauling the contaminated soil to a regulated landfill, but can also involve aerating the excavated material in the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants (including sewage sludge with harmful microorganisms) may be conducted.
Recently, ExSitu Chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process involves the excavation of the contaminated area into large bermed areas where they are treated using chemical oxidation methods.

===Surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR)===
This is used in removing non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) from aquifer. This is done by pumping surfactant solution into contaminated aquifer using injection wells which are passed through contaminated zones to the extraction wells. The Surfactant solution containing contaminants is then captured and pumped out by extraction wells for further treatment at the surface. Then the water after treatment is discharged into surface water or re-injected into groundwater.

In geologic formations that allow delivery of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants, this approach provides a cost-effective and permanent solution to sites that have been previously unsuccessful utilizing other remedial approaches. This technology is also successful when utilized as the initial step in a multi-faceted remedial approach utilizing SEAR then In situ Oxidation, bioremediation enhancement or soil vapor extraction (SVE).

===Pump and treat===
&quot;Pump and treat&quot; involves pumping out contaminated groundwater with the use of a submersible or vacuum pump, and allowing the extracted groundwater to be purified by slowly proceeding through a series of vessels that contain materials designed to adsorb the contaminants from the groundwater. For petroleum-contaminated sites this material is usually activated carbon in granular form. Chemical reagents such as flocculants followed by sand filters may also be used to decrease the contamination of groundwater. Air stripping is a method that can be effective for volatile pollutants such as BTEX compounds found in gasoline.

For most biodegradable materials like BTEX, MTBE and most hydrocarbons, bioreactors can be used to clean the contaminated water to non-detectable levels. With fluidized bed bioreactors it is possible to achieve very low discharge concentrations which will meet or exceed discharge requirements for most pollutants.

Depending on geology and soil type, pump and treat may be a good method to quickly reduce high concentrations of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the hydraulic gradient and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction (DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calcium oxy-hydroxide).

=== Solidification and stabilization ===

Solidification and stabilization work has a reasonably good track record but also a set of serious deficiencies related to durability of solutions and potential long-term effects. In addition CO2 emissions due to the use of cement are also becoming a major obstacle to its widespread use in solidification/stabilization projects.

Stabilization/solidification (S/S) is a remediation and treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop/prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants.
* Stabilization involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material (e.g. soil or sludge) to produce more chemically stable constituents; and
* Solidification involves the addition of reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical/dimensional stability to contain contaminants in a solid product and reduce access by external agents (e.g. air, rainfall).

Conventional S/S is an established remediation technology for contaminated soils and treatment technology for hazardous wastes in many countries in the world. However, the uptake of S/S technologies has been relatively modest, and a number of barriers have been identified including:
* the relatively low cost and widespread use of disposal to landfill;
* the lack of authoritative technical guidance on S/S;
* uncertainty over the durability and rate of contaminant release from S/S-treated material;
* experiences of past poor practice in the application of cement stabilization processes used in waste disposal in the 1980s and 1990s (ENDS, 1992); and
* residual liability associated with immobilized contaminants remaining on-site, rather than their removal or destruction.

===In situ oxidation===
New &quot;in situ oxidation&quot; technologies have become popular for remediation of a wide range of soil and groundwater contaminants. Remediation by chemical oxidation involves the injection of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone gas, potassium permanganate or persulfates.

Oxygen gas or ambient air can also be injected to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage of this approach is the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance anaerobic bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general, aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted.

The injection of gases into the groundwater may also cause contamination to spread faster than normal depending on the hydrogeology of the site. In these cases, injections downgradient of groundwater flow may provide adequate microbial destruction of contaminants prior to exposure to surface waters or drinking water supply wells.

Migration of metal contaminants must also be considered whenever modifying subsurface oxidation-reduction potential. Certain metals are more soluble in oxidizing environments while others are more mobile in reducing environments.

===Soil vapor extraction===
&quot;Soil vapor extraction&quot; (SVE) is an effective remediation technology for soil. &quot;Multi Phase Extraction&quot; (MPE) is also an effective remediation technology when soil and groundwater are to be remediated coincidentally. SVE and MPE utilize different technologies to treat the off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated after vacuum removal of air and vapors (and VOCs) from the subsurface and include granular activated carbon (most commonly used historically), thermal and/or catalytic oxidation and vapor condensation. Generally, carbon is used for low (below 500 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams, oxidation is used for moderate (up to 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration streams, and vapor condensation is used for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. Below is a brief summary of each technology.

# Granular activated carbon (GAC) is used as a filter for air or water. Commonly used to filter tap water in household sinks. GAC is a highly porous adsorbent material, produced by heating organic matter, such as coal, wood and coconut shell, in the absence of air, which is then crushed into granules. Activated carbon is positively charged and therefore able to remove negative ions from the water such as organic ions, ozone, chlorine, fluorides and dissolved organic solutes by adsorption onto the activated carbon. The activated carbon must be replaced periodically as it may become saturated and unable to adsorb (i.e. reduced absorption efficiency with loading). Activated carbon is not effective in removing heavy metals.
# Thermal oxidation (or incineration) can also be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV.
* Thermal oxidation which uses a system that acts as a furnace and maintains temperatures ranging from .
* Catalytic oxidation which uses a catalyst on a support to facilitate a lower temperature oxidation. This system usually maintains temperatures ranging from .
# Vapor condensation is the most effective off-gas treatment technology for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers. The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression (C3-Technology).

===Nanoremediation===
Using nano-sized reactive agents to degrade or immobilize contaminants is termed nanoremediation. In soil or groundwater nanoremediation, nanoparticles are brought into contact with the contaminant through either &quot;in situ&quot; injection or a pump-and-treat process. The nanomaterials then degrade organic contaminants through redox reactions or adsorb to and immobilize metals such as lead or arsenic. In commercial settings, this technology has been dominantly applied to groundwater remediation, with research into wastewater treatment. Research is also investigating how nanoparticles may be applied to cleanup of soil and gases.

Nanomaterials are highly reactive because of their high surface area per unit mass, and due to this reactivity nanomaterials may react with target contaminants at a faster rate than would larger particles. Most field applications of nanoremediation have used nano zero-valent iron (nZVI), which may be emulsified or mixed with another metal to enhance dispersion.

That nanoparticles are highly reactive can mean that they rapidly clump together or react with soil particles or other material in the environment, limiting their dispersal to target contaminants. Some of the important challenges currently limiting nanoremediation technologies include identifying coatings or other formulations that increase dispersal of the nanoparticle agents to better reach target contaminants while limiting any potential toxicity to bioremediation agents, wildlife, or people.

===Bioremediation===
Bioremediation is a process that treats a polluted area either by altering environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms or through natural microorganism activity, resulting in the degradation of the target pollutants. Broad categories of bioremediation include biostimulation, bioaugmentation, and natural recovery (natural attenuation). Bioremediation is either done on the contaminated site (in situ) or after the removal of contaminated soils at another more controlled site (ex situ).

In the past, it has been difficult to turn to bioremediation as an implemented policy solution, as lack of adequate production of remediating microbes led to little options for implementation. Those that manufacture microbes for bioremediation must be approved by the EPA; however, the EPA traditionally has been more cautious about negative externalities that may or may not arise from the introduction of these species. One of their concerns is that the toxic chemicals would lead to the microbe&#x27;s gene degradation, which would then be passed on to other harmful bacteria, creating more issues, if the pathogens evolve the ability to feed off of pollutants.

====Entomoremediation====
Entomoremediation is a variant of bioremediation in which insects decontaminate soils. Entomoremediation techniques engage microorganisms, collembolans, ants, flies, beetles, and termites. It is dependent on saprophytic insect larvae, resistant to adverse environmental conditions and able to bioaccumulate toxic heavy metal contaminants.

&quot;Hermetia illucens&quot; (black soldier fly - BSF) is an important entomoremediation participant. &quot;H. illucens&quot; has been observed to reduce polluted substrate dry weight by 49%. &quot;H. illucens&quot; larvae have been observed to accumulate cadmium at a concentration of 93% and bioaccumulation factor of 5.6, lead, mercury, zinc with a bioaccumulation factor of 3.6, and arsenic at a concentration of 22%. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have also been used to monitor the degradation and reduction of anthropogenic oil contamination in the environment.

Entomoremediation is considered viable as an accessible low-energy, low-carbon, and highly renewable method for environmental decontamination.

===Collapsing air microbubbles===
Cleaning of oil contaminated sediments with self collapsing air microbubbles have been recently explored as a chemical free technology. Air microbubbles generated in water without adding any surfactant could be used to clean oil contaminated sediments. This technology holds promise over the use of chemicals (mainly surfactant) for traditional washing of oil contaminated sediments.

==Community consultation and information==
In preparation for any significant remediation there should be extensive community consultation. The proponent should both present information to and seek information from the community. The proponent needs to learn about &quot;sensitive&quot; (future) uses like childcare, schools, hospitals, and playgrounds as well as community concerns and interests information. Consultation should be open, on a group basis so that each member of the community is informed about issues they may not have individually thought about. An independent chairperson acceptable to both the proponent and the community should be engaged (at proponent expense if a fee is required). Minutes of meetings including questions asked and the answers to them and copies of presentations by the proponent should be available both on the internet and at a local library (even a school library) or community centre.

==Incremental health risk==
Incremental health risk is the increased risk that a receptor (normally a human being living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist at the same time causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.

==Emissions standards==
Standards are set for the levels of dust, noise, odour, emissions to air and groundwater, and discharge to sewers or waterways of all chemicals of concern or chemicals likely to be produced during the remediation by processing of the contaminants. These are compared against both natural background levels in the area and standards for areas zoned as nearby areas are zoned and against standards used in other recent remediations. Just because the emission is emanating from an area zoned industrial does not mean that in a nearby residential area there should be permitted any exceedances of the appropriate residential standards.

Monitoring for compliance against each standards is critical to ensure that exceedances are detected and reported both to authorities and the local community.

Enforcement is necessary to ensure that continued or significant breaches result in fines or even a jail sentence for the polluter.

Penalties must be significant as otherwise fines are treated as a normal expense of doing business. Compliance must be cheaper than to have continuous breaches.

==Transport and emergency safety assessment==
Assessment should be made of the risks of operations, transporting contaminated material, disposal of waste which may be contaminated including workers&#x27; clothes, and a formal emergency response plan should be developed. Every worker and visitor entering the site should have a safety induction personalised to their involvement with the site.

==Impacts of funding remediation==
Local communities and government often resist the rezoning because of the adverse effects of the remediation and new development on the local amenities. The main impacts during remediation are noise, dust, odour, and incremental health risk. Then there is the noise, dust, and traffic of developments. Then, there is the impact on local traffic, schools, playing fields, and other public facilities due to the increased population.

==Examples of major remediation projects==

===Homebush Bay, New South Wales, Australia===

Dioxins from Union Carbide used in the production of now-banned pesticide 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid and defoliant Agent Orange polluted Homebush Bay. Remediation was completed in 2010, but fishing will continue to be banned for decades.

===Bakar, Croatia===

An EU contract for immobilization of a polluted area of 20,000 m3 in Bakar, Croatia based on solidification/stabilization with ImmoCem is currently in progress. After three years of intensive research by the Croatian government, the EU funded the immobilization project in Bakar. The area is contaminated with large amounts of TPH, PAH, and metals. For the immobilization, the contractor chose to use the mix-in-plant procedure.

<text>In a restaurant, the menu is a list of food and beverages offered to the customer. A menu may be à la carte – which presents a list of options from which customers choose, often with prices shown – or table d&#x27;hôte, in which case a pre-established sequence of courses is offered. Menus may be printed on paper sheets provided to the diners, put on a large poster or display board inside the establishment, displayed outside the restaurant, or put on a digital screen. Since the late 1990s, some restaurants have put their menus online.

Menus are also often a feature of very formal meals other than in restaurants, for example at weddings. In the 19th and 20th centuries printed menus were often used for society dinner-parties in homes; indeed this was their original use in Europe.

==History==
Menus, as lists of prepared foods, have been discovered dating back to the Song dynasty in China. In the larger cities of the time, merchants found a way to cater to busy customers who had little time or energy to prepare an evening meal. The variation in Chinese cuisine from different regions led caterers to create a list or menu for their patrons.

The word &quot;menu&quot;, like much of the terminology of cuisine, is French in origin. It ultimately derives from Latin &quot;minutus&quot;, something made small; in French, it came to be applied to a detailed list or &quot;résumé&quot; of any kind. The original menus that offered consumers choices were prepared on a small chalkboard, in French a &quot;carte&quot;; so foods chosen from a bill of fare are described as &quot;à la carte&quot;, &quot;according to the board&quot;.

The earliest European menus, several of which survive from 1751 onwards, appear to have been for the relatively intimate and informal &quot;soupers intimes&quot; (&quot;intimate suppers&quot;) given by King Louis XV of France at the Château de Choisy for between 31 and 36 guests. Several seem to have been placed on the table, listing four courses, each with several dishes, plus dessert.

During the second half of the 18th century, and especially after the French Revolution in 1789, they spread to restaurants. Before then, eating establishments or &quot;tables d&#x27;hôte&quot; served dishes chosen by the chef or proprietors. Customers ate what the house was serving that day, as in contemporary banquets or buffets, and meals were served from a common table. The establishment of restaurants and restaurant menus allowed customers to choose from a list of unseen dishes, which were produced to order according to the customer&#x27;s selection. A &quot;table d&#x27;hôte&quot; establishment charged its customers a fixed price; the menu allowed customers to spend as much or as little money as they chose.

===Price-less===
Menus for private functions, pre-paid meals and the like do not have prices. In normal restaurants, there are two types of menus without prices that were mostly used until the 1970s and 1980s: the &quot;blind menu&quot; and the &quot;women&#x27;s menu&quot;. These menus contained all of the same items as the regular menu, except that the prices were not listed. The &quot;blind menu&quot; was distributed to guests at business meals where the hosts did not want the diners to see the prices, or to any type of dinner where the host felt that having the prices not listed would make the guests feel more comfortable ordering.

Until the early 1980s, some high-end restaurants had two menus divided by gender: a regular menu with the prices listed for men and a second menu for women, which did not have the prices listed (it was called the &quot;ladies&#x27; menu&quot;), so that the female diner would not know the prices of the items. In 1980, Kathleen Bick took a male business partner out to dinner at L&#x27;Orangerie in West Hollywood; after Bick got a women&#x27;s menu without prices and her guest got the menu with prices, Bick hired lawyer Gloria Allred to file a discrimination lawsuit, on the grounds that the women&#x27;s menu went against the California Civil Rights Act. Bick stated that getting a women&#x27;s menu without prices left her feeling &quot;humiliated and incensed&quot;. The owners of the restaurant defended the practice, saying it was done as a courtesy, like the way men would stand up when a woman enters the room. Even though the lawsuit was dropped, the restaurant ended its gender-based menu policy. While price-less menus for women generally disappeared after the 1980s, in 2010, Tracey MacLeod reported that Le Gavroche in London (UK) still had a price-less women&#x27;s menu for women who eat at tables booked by men, with tables booked by women getting a regular menu for the woman.

==Economics of menu production==
As early as the mid-20th century, some restaurants have relied on &quot;menu specialists&quot; to design and print their menus. Prior to the emergence of digital printing, these niche printing companies printed full-color menus on offset presses. The economics of full-color offset made it impractical to print short press runs. The solution was to print a &quot;menu shell&quot; with everything but the prices. The prices would later be printed on a less costly black-only press. In a typical order, the printer might produce 600 menu shells, then finish and laminate 150 menus with prices. When the restaurant needed to reorder, the printer would add prices and laminate some of the remaining shells.

With the advent of digital presses, it became practical in the 1990s to print full-color menus affordably in short press runs, sometimes as few as 25 menus. Because of limits on sheet size, larger laminated menus were impractical for single-location independent restaurants to produce press runs of as few as 300 menus, but some restaurants may want to place far fewer menus into service. Some menu printers continue to use shells. The disadvantage for the restaurant is that it is unable to update anything but prices without creating a new shell.

During the economic crisis in the 1970s, many restaurants found it costly to reprint the menu as inflation caused prices to increase. Economists noted this, and it has become part of economic theory, under the term &quot;menu costs&quot;. In general, such &quot;menu costs&quot; may be incurred by a range of businesses, not just restaurants; for example, during a period of inflation, any company that prints catalogs or product price lists will have to reprint these items with new price figures.

To avoid having to reprint the menus throughout the year as prices changed, some restaurants began to display their menus on chalkboards, with the menu items and prices written in chalk. This way, the restaurant could easily modify the prices without going to the expense of reprinting the paper menus. A similar tactic continued to be used in the 2000s with certain items that are sensitive to changing supply, fuel costs, and so on: the use of the term &quot;market price&quot; or &quot;Please ask the server&quot; instead of stating the price. This allows restaurants to modify the price of lobster, fresh fish and other foods subject to rapid changes in cost.

The latest trend in menus is to display them on handheld tablets; customers can browse through these and look at the photographs of the dishes.

==Writing style==
The main categories within a typical menu in the US are appetizers, &quot;side orders and à la carte&quot;, entrées, desserts and beverages. Sides and à la carte may include such items as soups, salads, and dips. There may be special age-restricted sections for &quot;seniors&quot; or for children, presenting smaller portions at lower prices. Any of these sections may be pulled out as a separate menu, such as desserts and/or beverages, or a wine list. A children&#x27;s menu may also be presented as a placemat with games and puzzles, to help keep children entertained.

Menus can provide other useful information to diners. Some menus describe the chef&#x27;s or proprietor&#x27;s food philosophy, the chef&#x27;s résumé (British: CV), or the mission statement of the restaurant. Menus often present a restaurant&#x27;s policies about ID checks for alcohol, lost items, or gratuities for larger parties. In the United States, county health departments frequently require restaurants to include health warnings about raw or undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood.

===Puffery===
As a form of advertising, the prose found on printed menus is famous for the degree of its puffery. Menus frequently emphasize the processes used to prepare foods, call attention to exotic ingredients, and add French or other foreign language expressions to make the dishes appear sophisticated and exotic. &quot;Menu language, with its hyphens, quotation marks, and random outbursts of foreign words, serves less to describe food than to manage your expectations&quot;; restaurants are often &quot;plopping in foreign words (80 percent of them French) like &quot;spring mushroom civet&quot;, &quot;pain of rabbit&quot;, &quot;orange-jaggery gastrique&quot;.

Part of the function of menu prose is to impress customers with the notion that the dishes served at the restaurant require such skill, equipment, and exotic ingredients that the diners could not prepare similar foods at home. In some cases, ordinary foods are made to sound more exciting by replacing everyday terms with their French equivalents. For example, instead of stating that a pork chop has a dollop of apple sauce, a high-end restaurant menu might say &quot;Tenderloin of pork &quot;avec compote de Pommes&quot;.&quot; Although &quot;avec compote de Pommes&quot; translates directly as &quot;with apple sauce&quot;, it sounds more exotic—and more worthy of an inflated price tag. Menus may use the culinary terms &quot;concassé&quot; to describe coarsely chopped vegetables, &quot;coulis&quot; to describe a purée of vegetables or fruit, or &quot;au jus&quot;, to describe meat served with its own natural gravy of pan drippings.

==Types==
===Paper===
Menus vary in length and detail depending on the type of restaurant. The simplest hand-held menus are printed on a single sheet of paper, though menus with multiple pages or &quot;views&quot; are common. In some cafeteria-style restaurants and chain restaurants, a single-page menu may double as a disposable placemat. To protect a menu from spills and wear, it may be protected by heat-sealed vinyl page protectors, lamination or menu covers. Restaurants consider their positioning in the marketplace (e.g. fine dining, fast food, informal) in deciding which style of menu to use.

Some restaurants use a single menu as the sole source of information about the food for customers, but in other cases, the main menu is supplemented by ancillary menus, such as:
* An appetizer menu (nachos, chips and salsa, vegetables and dip, etc.)
* A wine list
* A liquor and mixed drinks menu
* A beer list
* A dessert menu (which may also include a list of tea and coffee options)

Some restaurants use only text in their menus. In other cases, restaurants include illustrations and photos, either of the dishes or of an element of the culture which is associated with the restaurant. For instance a Lebanese kebab restaurant might decorate its menu with photos of Lebanese mountains and beaches. Particularly with the ancillary menu types, the menu may be provided in alternative formats, because these menus (other than wine lists) tend to be much shorter than food menus. For example, an appetizer menu or a dessert menu may be displayed on a folded paper table tent, a hard plastic table stand, a flipchart style wooden &quot;table stand&quot;, or even, in the case of a pizza restaurant with a limited wine selection, a wine list glued to an empty bottle.

Take-out restaurants often leave paper menus in the lobbies and doorsteps of nearby homes as advertisements. The first to do so may have been New York City&#x27;s Empire Szechuan chain, founded in 1976. The chain and other restaurants&#x27; aggressive menu distribution in the Upper West Side of Manhattan caused the &quot;Menu Wars&quot; of the 1990s, including invasions of Empire Szechuan by the &quot;Menu Vigilantes&quot;, the revoking of its cafe license, several lawsuits, and physical attacks on menu distributors.

===Menu board===

Some restaurants – typically fast-food restaurants and cafeteria-style establishments – provide their menu in a large poster or display board format up high on the wall or above the service counter. This way, all of the patrons can see all of the choices, and the restaurant does not have to provide printed menus. This large format menu may also be set up outside (see the next section). The simplest large format menu boards have the menu printed or painted on a large flat board. More expensive large format menu boards include boards that have a metal housing, a translucent surface, and a backlight (which facilitates the reading of the menu in low light) and boards that have removable numbers for the prices. This enables the restaurant to change prices without having to have the board reprinted or repainted.

Some restaurants such as cafes and small eateries use a large chalkboard to display the entire menu. The advantage of using a chalkboard is that the menu items and prices can be changed; the downside is that the chalk may be hard to read in lower light or glare, and the restaurant has to have a staff member who has attractive, clear handwriting.

A high-tech successor to the chalkboard menu is the &quot;write-on wipe-off&quot; illuminated sign, using LED technology. The text appears in a vibrant color against a black background.

===Outdoor===

Some restaurants provide a copy of their menu outside the restaurant. Fast-food restaurants that have a drive-through or walk-up window will often put the entire menu on a board, lit-up sign, or poster outside so that patrons can select their meal choices. High-end restaurants may also provide a copy of their menu outside the restaurant, with the pages of the menu placed in a lit-up glass display case; this way, prospective patrons can see if the menu choices are to their liking. Also, some mid-level and high-end restaurants may provide a partial indication of their menu listings–the &quot;specials&quot;–on a chalkboard displayed outside the restaurant. The chalkboard will typically provide a list of seasonal items or dishes that are the specialty of the chef which is only available for a few days.

===Digital displays===
With the invention of LCD and Plasma displays, some menus have moved from a static printed model to one which can change dynamically. By using a flat LCD screen and a computer server, menus can be digitally displayed allowing moving images, animated effects and the ability to edit details and prices.

For fast food restaurants, a benefit is the ability to update prices and menu items as frequently as needed, across an entire chain. Digital menu boards also allow restaurant owners to control the day parting of their menus, converting from a breakfast menu in the late morning. Some platforms support the ability allow local operators to control their own pricing while the design aesthetic is controlled by the corporate entity.
Various software tools and hardware developments have been created for the specific purpose of managing a digital menu board system. Digital menu screens can also alternate between displaying the full menu and showing video commercials to promote specific dishes or menu items.

===Online menu===
Websites featuring online restaurant menus have been on the Internet for nearly a decade. In recent years, however, more and more restaurants outside of large metropolitan areas have been able to feature their menus online as a result of this trend.

Several restaurant-owned and startup online food ordering websites already included menus on their websites, yet due to the limitations of which restaurants could handle online orders, many restaurants were left invisible to the Internet aside from an address listing. Multiple companies came up with the idea of posting menus online simultaneously, and it is difficult to ascertain who was first. Menus and online food ordering have been available online since at least 1997. Since 1997, hundreds of online restaurant menu web sites have appeared on the Internet. Some sites are city-specific, some list by region, state or province.
===Digital menu===
The idea of the digital menu is very new and differs from an online menu. An online menu is a website presenting a food menu on an e-commerce platform but has no interface with meal production except sometimes receiving the order. A digital menu is a fully integrated food menu where the front-end is presented online as a web application, but as well as facilitating orders it is also linked to the kitchen or other production facility. A digital menu can generate a variety of reports and is connected with the finance/point of sale system. It may also be integrated with inventory and accounting software.

===Secret menu===
Another phenomenon is the so-called secret menu where some fast food restaurants are known for having unofficial and unadvertised selections that customers learn by word of mouth, or by looking them up online. Fast food restaurants will often prepare variations on items already available, but to have them all on the menu would create clutter. This can also occur in high-end restaurants, which may be willing to prepare certain items which are not listed on the menu (e.g., dishes that have long been favorites of regular clientele). Sometimes restaurants may name foods often ordered by regular clientele after them, for either convenience or prestige. At some fast food restaurants, &quot;secret menu&quot; items exist which were once part of the regular menu but are no longer advertised. These items may still be rung up as a regular menu item, and are assembled from ingredients that are still in use in other menu items.

<doc id="406269" wikidata="Q920641" url="?curid=406269" title="Old Europe and New Europe">
<text>Old Europe and New Europe are terms used to contrast parts of Europe with each other in a rhetorical way. In the 21st century, the terms have been used by conservative political analysts in the United States to describe post-Communist era countries in Central and Eastern Europe as &#x27;newer&#x27; and parts of Western Europe as &#x27;older&#x27;, suggesting that the latter were less important. The term &quot;Old Europe&quot; attracted attention when it was used by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in January 2003 to refer to democratic European countries before the fall of Communism in Europe, after which a significant number of new members have eventually joined NATO, the European Union and other European bodies.

Old Europe can mean – in a wider sense – Europe of an older historical period, as opposed to a newer historical period. Before Rumsfeld’s use, the term had been used in various historical contexts to refer to Europe as the &quot;Old World&quot; as opposed to America as the &quot;New World&quot;; or, in Marxist usage, to Europe in the expectation of Communist revolutions.

==Rumsfeld&#x27;s term==

On January 22, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld answered a question from Dutch journalist Charles Groenhuijsen about a potential U.S. invasion of Iraq:

The expression was interpreted as a dig against a &quot;sclerotic&quot; and old-fashioned Western Europe. Those countries, Rumsfeld added on the same occasion, were &quot;of no importance.&quot; It became a potent symbol, especially after division emerged over Iraq between France and Germany and some of the new Central and Southeastern European entrants and applicants to NATO and the European Union.

Rumsfeld would later claim his comment was &quot;unintentional,&quot; and that he had meant to say &quot;old NATO&quot; instead of &quot;old Europe;&quot; during his time as ambassador to NATO, there were only fifteen alliance members, and France and Germany had played a much larger role than after the admission of many new (particularly Eastern European) countries. Nonetheless, he claims he &quot;was amused by the ruckus&quot; when the term became debated.

Further diplomatic tension built up when Rumsfeld pointed out in February 2003, that Germany, Cuba and Libya were the only nations completely opposing a possible war in Iraq (a statement that was formally correct at the time). This was interpreted by many that he would put Germany on a common level with dictatorships violating human rights.

==Later developments==
The German translation &quot;altes Europa&quot; was the word of the year for 2003 in Germany, because German politicians and commentators responded by often using it in a sarcastic way. It was frequently used with pride and a reference to a perceived position of greater moral integrity. The terms &quot;altes Europa&quot; and &quot;Old Europe&quot; have subsequently surfaced in European economic and political discourse. For example, in a January 2005 unveiling for the new Airbus A380 aircraft, German chancellor Gerhard Schröder said, &quot;There is the tradition of good old Europe that has made this possible.&quot; A BBC News article about the unveiling said Schröder &quot;deliberately redefined the phrase previously used by... Rumsfeld.&quot;

Outside of Rumsfeld&#x27;s usage of &quot;Old Europe&quot;, the term New Europe (and &quot;neues Europa&quot;) also appeared, indicating either the European states that supported the war, the Central European states that had been newly accepted to the EU, or a new economically and technologically dynamic and liberal Europe, often including the United Kingdom.

Rumsfeld made fun of his statement shortly before a 2005 diplomatic trip to Europe. &quot;When I first mentioned I might be travelling in France and Germany it raised some eyebrows. One wag said it ought to be an interesting trip after all that has been said. I thought for a moment and then I replied: &#x27;Oh, that was the old Rumsfeld.&#x27;&quot;

The phrase continued to be used after Rumsfeld&#x27;s tenure. In a March 2009 speech to the United States Congress, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said &quot;There is no old Europe, no new Europe. There is only your friend Europe,&quot; which &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;an oblique shot at&quot; Rumsfeld. The next month, speaking in Prague, U.S. President Barack Obama, echoing Brown&#x27;s words, said, &quot;in my view, there is no old Europe or new Europe. There is only a united Europe.&quot;

==Earlier uses==
The &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels starts with the words:

When Marx used the term in 1848, the year of failed liberal revolutions across Europe, he was referring to the restoration of &quot;Ancien régime&quot; dynasties, following the defeat of Napoleon. Of his three sets of pairs, each pair links figures who might on the surface be considered adversaries, in alliances that he clearly sees as &quot;un&quot;holy. An &quot;Old Europe&quot; must find a mental contrast with a posited &quot;New Europe&quot;.

In his ultra-nationalistic, anti-European book of 1904, &quot;America Rules the World&quot;, E. David used &#x27;Old Europe&#x27; in the following context:

In his book &quot;La Hora de los Pueblos&quot; (1968), Argentine politician Juan Perón used the phrase when he enunciated the main principles of his purported new &quot;tricontinental&quot; political vision:

<text>Space Adventures, Inc. is an American space tourism company founded in 1998 by Eric C. Anderson. Its offerings include zero-gravity atmospheric flights, orbital spaceflights (with the option to participate in a spacewalk), and other spaceflight-related experiences including cosmonaut training, spacewalk training, and launch tours. Plans announced thus far include sub-orbital and lunar spaceflights, though these are not being actively pursued at present. Nine of its clients have participated in the orbital spaceflight program with Space Adventures, including one who took two separate trips to space.

== History ==
Space Adventures was founded in 1998 by Eric C. Anderson — president and CEO — with several other entrepreneurs from the aerospace, adventure travel and entertainment industries. The company is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, with an office in Moscow.

Space Adventures offers a variety of programs, such as orbital spaceflight missions to the International Space Station (ISS), circumlunar missions around the Moon, zero gravity flights, cosmonaut training programs, spaceflight qualification programs, and reservations on future suborbital spacecraft.

Since 2001, Space Adventures has launched seven clients on eight successful missions to the ISS. In April 2001, the company sent American businessman Dennis Tito for a reported US$20 million payment, making him the first space tourist. South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth did the same in April 2002, becoming the first African in space. Gregory Olsen became the third private citizen to travel to the ISS in October 2005, followed by the first female space tourist, Anousheh Ansari, who completed her 10-day orbital mission in September 2006. Charles Simonyi, an ex-executive at Microsoft, became the fifth space tourist who visited the ISS in April 2007, then again in March 2009. He is the world&#x27;s first private space explorer who launched to space twice. In 2008, game developer Richard Garriott, the first second-generation U.S. astronaut, became the sixth client to travel to the ISS. In October 2009, Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté became the first Canadian space tourist to have launched into space.

, the company&#x27;s advisory board included Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, Space Shuttle astronauts Sam Durrance, Tom Jones, Byron Lichtenberg, Norm Thagard, Kathy Thornton, Pierre Thuot, and Charles Walker, Skylab/Shuttle astronaut Owen Garriott, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Usachev.

In January 2008, Space Adventures acquired Zero Gravity Corporation, which is the first and only FAA-approved provider of weightless flights to the general public.

In 2015, English soprano Sarah Brightman had been expected to become the eighth client of Space Adventures to visit the ISS, paying US$52 million for her flight, but the company announced that Brightman had postponed her trip &quot;for personal family reasons&quot;. Brightman was initially expected to be replaced by another Space Adventures client, Japanese advertisement entrepreneur Satoshi Takamatsu; however, in June 2015, the company announced that Takamatsu had elected to postpone his flight to prepare for &quot;art projects that [he] would like to perform in space [that] require cutting-edge technology both in hardware and software&quot;. The spot was eventually taken by Kazakh government cosmonaut Aidyn Aimbetov.

Due to the retirement of the Space Shuttle, from 2011 to 2020, NASA contracted with the Russian space agency Roscosmos to purchase a large number, the majority, of seats on the Soyuz. Space tourism transport to the ISS became possible once again after NASA signed contracts with two commercial carriers in 2020, and by mid-2020, Space Adventures had contracted for two of the available Soyuz seats in 2021.

== Orbital commercial space business ==
=== Clients who have flown in space ===
==== Dennis Tito ====
Space Adventures&#x27; first orbital spaceflight client, and the world&#x27;s first private space explorer, launched to the ISS in April 2001 on Soyuz TM-32. American businessman Dennis Tito received training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City in Russia. Tito participated in Space Adventures&#x27; other programs, including a zero-gravity flight, centrifuge training, and a supersonic jet flight before his orbital flight.

==== Mark Shuttleworth ====
Mark Shuttleworth spent 10 days in space. He launched with two crewmates, Russian commander Yuri Gidzenko and Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori. They launched on Soyuz TM-34 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on 25 April 2002. Before his flight, Shuttleworth completed Space Adventures&#x27; Orbital Pre-Qualification Program and underwent almost eight months of training and medical exams, including a one-week orientation program at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. A zero-gravity flight, centrifuge training, and spacecraft communication, guidance, and control system lessons for the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and ISS were also part of his training. Shuttleworth dedicated his flight to educating South African youth and conducting scientific research.

==== Gregory Olsen ====
Gregory Olsen completed over 900 hours of training in Star City, Russia, in preparation for his mission. He and his crewmates launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on 1 October 2005, aboard Soyuz TMA-7. While aboard the ISS, he participated in a research program prepared by the European Space Agency (ESA) that studied the human body&#x27;s response to the microgravity environment. Through Amateur Radio on the ISS, Dr. Olsen contacted high school students in New Jersey and New York.

==== Anousheh Ansari ====
Anousheh Ansari lifted off on Soyuz TMA-9 on 18 September 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. During her eight-day stay onboard the ISS, Ansari conducted four experiments for the European Space Agency, including researching the mechanisms behind anemia, how changes in muscles influence lower back pain, consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members, and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

==== Charles Simonyi ====
Charles Simonyi is the first repeat orbital spaceflight client of Space Adventures. His first spaceflight mission was in 2007 aboard Soyuz TMA-10, and his second was in 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-14. Simonyi&#x27;s goals for both of his missions were to advance civilian spaceflight, assist space station research and involve the world&#x27;s youth in the science of space travel.

==== Richard Garriott ====
Richard Garriott became the first American, and second second-generation space traveler, following his astronaut father Owen Garriott into space in 2008. He is also the second person to wear the British flag in space. He launched for the ISS on 12 October 2008, aboard Soyuz TMA-13. Richard&#x27;s main objective for his mission was to encourage commercial participation. By fostering the involvement of individuals, companies, and organizations in his spaceflight, Richard hoped to demonstrate that there is commercial potential in private space exploration while furthering the understanding of space. One of his crewmates on his return journey to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-12 was Sergey Volkov, the first second-generation space traveler, who followed his father, cosmonaut Aleksandr Volkov into space.

==== Guy Laliberté ====
Guy Laliberté is the first Canadian space tourist, reaching orbit on 30 September 2009, aboard Soyuz TMA-16. While in orbit, Laliberté promoted the One Drop Foundation and proclaimed his mission as a &quot;Poetic Social Mission&quot;. He also conducted the first-ever artistic and social event, &quot;Moving Stars and Earth for Water&quot;, to originate from space that took place on 9 October 2009. It was a two-hour event that was hosted by Laliberté and many celebrities such as Salma Hayek, Shakira, and Bono, who participated from Earth. He returned to Earth onboard Soyuz TMA-14.

====Yusaku Maezawa and Yozo Hirano====

Yusaku Maezawa and his assistant Yozo Hirano flew to space in December 2021, on Soyuz MS-20. While in space, Hirano helped document Maezawa&#x27;s experiences for his social media. The mission was unusual for a Soyuz flight in that it did not deliver any ISS Expedition crew members or serve as a lifeboat, and was entirely devoted to space tourism. Maezawa, who paid for both his and Hirano&#x27;s seats, also financed the DearMoon project, in which he and several other people will fly on a circumlunar trajectory onboard SpaceX&#x27;s Starship later in the decade, though it was later cancelled.

=== Clients who participated in training only ===
* Lance Bass
* Esther Dyson (Investor in Space Adventures)&lt;ref name=&quot;spacenews.com/briefs-147&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sarah Brightman
* Satoshi Takamatsu

=== Orbital Mission Explorers Circle ===
A program was originally set up to allow individuals to reserve seats on future orbital spaceflights and then retain the option to fly to orbit as their schedule allowed with preferential access to mission seats, or they can opt to sell their seat to another private astronaut. Sergey Brin, co-founder and president of technology for Google Inc., became the founding member of the &quot;Founding Explorer&quot; group by placing a US$5 million deposit on a future orbital spaceflight in 2009. As of 2021, Brin has never exercised his option to fly on one of the available seats.

In 2010, Space Adventures established the Orbital Mission Explorers Circle to build a definitive consortium of future private space explorers who share a lifetime goal of orbital spaceflight or the investment therein. Space Adventures has initially created six &quot;Founding Explorer&quot; positions in the Orbital Mission Explorers Circle, each of whom was intended to have priority access to participate in future orbital space missions.

=== Spacewalk ===
In 2006, the company announced that it would begin offering a spacewalk option to its clients traveling to the ISS. The spacewalk would allow participants to spend up to 1.5 hours outside the space station and costs about US$15 million. It would lengthen the orbital mission by approximately six to eight days. The spacewalk would be completed in the Russian designed Orlan space suit. The training for the spacewalk would also require an extra month of training on top of the six months already required. As of October 2021, no clients have actually contracted for this service.

== Lunar mission ==
Space Adventures is offering advance booking for a future lunar mission involving travel to circumnavigate the Moon, on a circumlunar trajectory. Pricing was announced at US$100 million per seat, .

This mission will utilize two Russian launch vehicles. A Soyuz capsule being launched into low Earth orbit by a Soyuz launch vehicle. Once in orbit, the crewed capsule will dock with a second, uncrewed, lunar-propulsion module which will then power the circumlunar portion of the trip. v The mission will last 8–9 days, including (approximately) 2½ days in Earth orbit docking with the propulsion stage, 5 days to reach lunar orbit, a 45-minute observation of the Moon from as low as , and 2½ days to return to Earth. In 2011, Space Adventures announced that they had sold one of the seats on the lunar voyage for US$150 million, and are in negotiations for selling a second seat. They wouldn&#x27;t reveal the name of the person to whom the ticket was sold but claim he or she is well known. By 2014, they claimed to have found two people willing to spend US$150 million and it could happen within three years. Space Adventures have subsequently amended their website to say they expect the first circumlunar voyage will occur before the end of the decade.

== Low Earth orbit mission ==
In February 2020, the company announced plans to fly private citizens into orbit on Crew Dragon. The SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle would launch from LC-39A with up to four tourists on board, and spend up to five days in a low Earth orbit with an apogee of over . In October 2021, Space Adventures stated that the mission contract had expired, but left open the possibility of a partnership with SpaceX in the future.

== Suborbital initiatives ==
=== Explorer suborbital vehicle ===
The company, along with Prodea and the Federal Space Agency of Russia, began in the mid-2000s to develop a suborbital space transportation system, called Explorer. The vehicle was to be designed by Myasishchev Design Bureau, a Russian aerospace organization which had developed other aircraft and space systems.

By 2006, the Explorer aerospace system would consist of a flight-operational carrier aircraft, the M-55X, and a rocket spacecraft, having the capability to transport up to five people to space. Space Adventures abandoned the Explorer project in 2010 because &quot;it got too expensive&quot;.

=== Armadillo suborbital rocket ===
In 2010, Armadillo Aerospace was working on a suborbital commercial launch vehicle that was to have been marketed through Space Adventures. The per-passenger price point was announced in April 2010 to be US$102,000 for a flight to altitude, above the Karman line.

The Armadillo-developed technology was to have been a vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) suborbital vehicle carrying space tourists to at least altitude, with Space Adventures selling the seats. The spacecraft development effort was jointly funded by both Armadillo and Space Adventures.

The project did not advance very far before the assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to Exos Aerospace in May 2014.

== Lawsuit ==
Japanese businessman Daisuke Enomoto sued Space Adventures in 2008 as his trip was canceled by the company for medical reasons after he paid US$21 million and no refund was given.

<text>Filmi () music soundtracks are music produced for India&#x27;s mainstream motion picture industry and written and performed for Indian cinema. In cinema, music directors make up the main body of composers; the songs are performed by playback singers and the genre represents 72% of the music sales market in India.

Filmi music tends to have appeal across India, Nepal, Pakistan and overseas, especially among the Indian diaspora. Songs are often in different languages depending on the target audience, for example in Hindi or Tamil. Playback singers are usually more noted for their ability to sing rather than their charisma as performers. Filmi playback singers&#x27; level of success and appeal is tied to their involvement with film soundtracks of cinema releases with the highest box office ratings.

At the &quot;Filmi Melody: Song and Dance in Indian Cinema&quot; archive presentation at UCLA, filmi was praised as a generally more fitting term for the tradition than &quot;Bombay melody&quot;, &quot;suggesting that the exuberant music and melodrama so closely identified with the Hindi commercial cinema produced in Bombay (Mumbai) is truly pan-Indian.&quot;

==Origins==
In the earliest years, filmi music was generally Indian (classical Carnatic, Hindustani, and village folk) in inspiration; over the years, Western elements have increased significantly. However, film soundtracks continue to be very diverse, sometimes fusing genres or reverting to entirely classical music. Examples of this can be found throughout the history of filmi music.

==Music directors==

R. C. Boral, Harishchandra Bali, Pankaj Mullick, Anil Biswas, Naushad Ali, Khwaja Khurshid Anwar and S. Rajeswara Rao were noteworthy music directors of the 1940s. Rao, who scored the 1948 Tamil &quot;Chandralekha&quot;, the first all-India hit, continued music directing in Chennai until the 1980s. The 1950s and 1960s, included music composers like Shankar Jaikishan, S. D. Burman, O. P. Nayyar, Madan Mohan, Hemant Kumar, C. Ramchandra, Roshan, Vasant Desai, Kalyanji–Anandji and Khayyam in Hindi film music. K. V. Mahadevan, Vishwanathan-Ramamoorthy, Laxmikant–Pyarelal, G. Devarajan, V. Dakshinamoorthy and M. S. Viswanathan were active music directors for more than 35 years from the 1950s.

As Indian cinema segued into the 1960s and 1970s, pop artists like R. D. Burman, Bappi Lahiri and duos like Nadeem–Shravan and Jatin–Lalit gave filmi a stronger western flavor with composers Ilaiyaraaja and Raveendran who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s in Tamil film music.

Major musical forces in the 1990s and 2000s have included A. R. Rahman, Nadeem–Shravan, Pritam, Himesh Reshammiya, Harris Jayaraj, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, Vishal–Shekhar, Vidyasagar, Ramesh Narayan, M. Jayachandran, Yuvan Shankar Raja, Deepak Dev, Johnson, Anu Malik, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Salim–Sulaiman, Devi Sri Prasad etc. A. R. Rahman, who was described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;India&#x27;s most prominent movie songwriter&quot;, is widely accepted to be the most internationally recognized Indian musician.

==Playback singers==
A playback singer is a singer who pre-records songs for use in films. The singer records the song and the actors or actresses lip-sync the song in front of the cameras, a form of singing that is characteristic of the Indian subcontinent. The songs of a film, the quality of the music and its music director (composer), lyricist and singer have often determined the success of a film. Film soundtracks are sometimes released before the film itself, resulting in a disparity between the soundtrack and the songs appearing in the film.

Kundan Lal Saigal was one of the earliest playback singers in the Indian music industry. Notable playback singers include Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, K. J. Yesudas, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, K. S. Chithra, MG Sreekumar, Udit Narayan, Amit Kumar, Alka Yagnik, Sujatha, Hemlata (singer), Kumar Sanu, Armaan Malik, 
Sonu Nigam, Shaan, KK, Shreya Ghoshal, Arijit Singh, Mohit Chauhan, Javed Ali, Neha Kakkar, Priyadarshini and many others.

==Lyricists==
In the 1950s and 1960s, lyricists like Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Sahir Ludhianvi, Raja Mehdi Ali Khan, Rajendra Krishan, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Bharat Vyas, Shakeel Badayuni, Qamar Jalalabadi, Anand Bakshi, Jan Nisar Akhtar and S. H. Bihari wrote lyrics of many classic filmi songs. Lyrics tended towards the literary and drew heavily on contemporary Urdu and Hindi poetry. The south has seen poets like Kannadasan, Vairamuthu and Vaali rise to prominence, in Tamil poetry and literature alongside Vayalar Ramavarma, P. Bhaskaran, O. N. V. Kurup in the Malayalam music industry.

Nowadays, some famous lyricists are Rashmi Virag, Kunaal Vermaa, Manoj Muntashir, Rakesh Kumar, Irshad Kamil, Sayeed Quadri, Armaan Malik etc.

==Popularity ratings==
Binaca Geetmala, Ameen Sayani&#x27;s popular Hindi language radio show before satellite television took over in India sometime in the 1990s, gave weekly popularity ratings of Hindi film songs (akin to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 list of songs). It ran in various incarnations from 1952 to 1993, and annual lists of the most popular songs were played at year-end. The list was compiled on the basis of record sales in India. Currently, Hindi filmi songs are sold on tape and CD compilations, played as promos and in programs on various television channels and radio stations, with different popularity ratings claiming different songs as being on the top. In an annual exercise, a net-based effort RMIM Puraskaar lists all important Hindi film songs of the year, in addition to awarding songs for various categories.

==Accusations of plagiarism==
Because popular music directors score a great many films over the course of a year, accusations of plagiarizing abound. For example, one production number in &quot;Dil&quot; (1990) is based on Carl Perkins&#x27; &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, sung with Hindi lyrics. Of late the Indian film industry has been gaining visibility outside India, and the legal risks of plagiarism have been gaining importance. Some producers have actually paid for the musical rights to popular Western songs, as in &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003) song, &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;. Plagiarism has also existed within India, with several music directors in Bombay cinema lifting tunes from other &quot;regional&quot; industries.

There have also been accusations of plagiarism against foreigner musicians borrowing from Hindi filmi songs. For example, &quot;Don&#x27;t Phunk with My Heart&quot; by The Black Eyed Peas was largely based on two 1970s filmi songs: &quot;Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana&quot; from &quot;Don&quot; (1978) and &quot;Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan&quot; from &quot;Apradh&quot; (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji and sung by Asha Bhosle. Another example is &quot;Addictive&quot; sung by Truth Hurts, which is lifted from Lata Mangeshkar&#x27;s &quot;Thoda Resham Lagta Hai&quot; from &quot;Jyoti&quot; (1981). This led to the copyright holders of the original song filing a lawsuit against DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, the producers of &quot;Addictive&quot;. Filmi music composed by A. R. Rahman (who would later win two Academy Awards for the &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; soundtrack) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the Singaporean artist Kelly Poon, the Uzbek artist Iroda Dilroz, the French rap group La Caution, the American artist Ciara, and the German band Löwenherz, among others.

==Wider success==
Filmi is also making exerting influence beyond the usual Desi audiences, with many Western music stores today carrying Indian music compilations. As early as 1978, the synthpop pioneers Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Yellow Magic Orchestra produced an electronic album &quot;Cochin Moon&quot; based on an experimental fusion between electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music. Later in 1988, Devo&#x27;s hit song &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; was inspired by the song &quot;I am a Disco Dancer&quot; from the Bollywood film &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982).

Baz Luhrmann showcases the song &quot;Chamma Chamma&quot; from &quot;China Gate&quot; (1998) in his 2001 movie &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. Another 2001 film &quot;Ghost World&quot; featured Mohammed Rafi&#x27;s song &quot;Jaan Pehechan Ho&quot; from the 1965 film &quot;Gumnaam&quot;. The 2002 song &quot;Addictive&quot;, sung by Truth Hurts and produced by DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, was lifted from Lata Mangeshkar&#x27;s &quot;Thoda Resham Lagta Hai&quot; from &quot;Jyoti&quot; (1981). The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; Grammy Award winning 2005 song &quot;Don&#x27;t Phunk with My Heart&quot; was inspired by two 1970s Bollywood songs: &quot;Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana&quot; from &quot;Don&quot; (1978) and &quot;Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan&quot; from &quot;Apradh&quot; (1972). Both songs were originally composed by Kalyanji Anandji, sung by Asha Bhosle, and featured the dancer Helen. The songs &quot;Mera Man Tera Pyasa&quot; from the movie &quot;Gambler&quot; (1971) performed by Mohammed Rafi, &quot;Tere Sang Pyar Main&quot; from the movie &quot;Nagin&quot; (1976) performed by Lata Mangeshkar, and &quot;Wada Na Tod&quot; also by Lata Mangeshkar from the movie &quot;Dil Tujhko Diya&quot; (1987) were featured in &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004). Scores from Chennai Tamil films have appeared in productions such as &quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Accidental Husband&quot; (2008). Ilaiyaraaja won the Gold Remi Award for Best Music Score jointly with film composer M. S. Viswanathan at the WorldFest-Houston Film Festival for the Tamil film &quot;Vishwa Thulasi&quot; (2005).

A. R. Rahman rose to fame from the Kollywood film industry to become one of the most popular international music directors and has had a musical&quot;Bombay Dreams&quot;, playing in London and New York, and scored several projects outside India. He has won two Academy awards and two Grammy awards, even numerous international awards and accolades. The song &quot;Chaiyya Chaiyya&quot;, originally composed by A. R. Rahman for &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998), has also been well received around the world, making several top 10 world music lists and has even been featured in several American movies. The song was in both the opening scene and credits of Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Inside Man&quot;. Rahman&#x27;s earlier soundtrack for &quot;Roja&quot; (1991) was included in &quot;Time&quot; 10 Best Soundtracks of all time in 2005. He has been regarded as the only composer from India to attain massive popularity and fame in the international arena. Hindi filmi music has reached an even wider global audience due to the success of the &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; soundtrack, also composed by Rahman. Singaporean-Indian singer Priyadarshini is regarded as the first Indian playback singer to carry out Ph.D. research in film music and document 100 years of music in Tamil cinema and 90 years in Kannada cinema

The first domain name ever registered related to filmi music and Indian entertainment media was indiamusic.com. The site further put filmi music on the map. Thereafter followed a flood of Indian and filmi music sites.

<doc id="406273" wikidata="Q1812824" url="?curid=406273" title="Changi">
<text>Changi () is a planning area located in the geographical region of Tanah Merah in the East Region of Singapore. Sharing borders with Pasir Ris and Tampines to the west, Changi Bay to the southeast, the South China Sea to the east and the Serangoon Harbour to the north. It is further divided into the subzones Changi Airport, Changi Point and Changi West. Changi, excluding the two water catchments and islands of Singapore, is the largest planning area by land size.

Today, Changi is an aviation hub. It is the location of both the Changi Airport and Changi Air Base. Also located within Changi is Singapore&#x27;s largest prison, Changi Prison. It was used as a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the occupation of Singapore in World War II. The prison is Singapore&#x27;s oldest operating internment facility.

==Etymology==
The early Malay place name of Changi was Tanjong Rusa (English: Deer cape), as written in the 1604 Godinho de Eredia map of Singapore.

The name Changi was known in the early 19th century. In the 1828 map by Franklin and Jackson, the extreme southeastern tip of the island is referred to as Tanjong Changi. Vessels using the Johor Straits would have to pass by Changi.

There are many versions of the etymological roots of the name Changi. The first director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens Henry Ridley suggested that it gets its name from a tall tree, &quot;Pokok Chengal&quot; or &quot;Cengal&quot; (Malay for &quot;Neobalanocarpus heimii&quot;, also known as &quot;Balanscorpus heimii&quot; or &quot;Balano scorpas&quot;), which was common in the area in the early nineteenth century. It is also written and pronounced as &quot;Chengai&quot;. Its heavy timber is commonly used for buildings and furniture and noted for its strength and deep rich colour. Other sources suggests that it comes from a climbing shrub found in the area, the &quot;changi ular&quot; (&quot;Hopea sangal&quot;), or &quot;chengal asir&quot; (&quot;Thottea piperiformis&quot;).

During the early surveys in the 1820s to 1830s of Singapore island, Changi was also named Franklin Point after Captain Franklin who was involved in these early surveys.

==History==
Early Changi was mostly a malaria mosquito infested swampland and jungle that had several kampongs spread across the vast area. Several of these kampongs included from north to south, Kampong Changi, Kampong Telok Paku, Kampong Ayer Gemuroh, Kampong Somapah, Kampong Mata Ikan and Kampong Padang Terbakar, although the exact founding dates of many of these kampongs are unknown. The place was first redeveloped by the British as a summer house and a getaway location from the city centre of Singapore in the 1890s, and was prized for its tranquillity and remoteness. The existence of the resorts there today still bear testament to the original redevelopments there.

Starting from the 1920s due to increasing tension across Asia and Europe in anticipation for war, the British starting building up its military presence at the area and this included the construction of military barracks and the infamous Changi Hospital, with Chinese and Indian labourers brought in from the city. Defences along Changi&#x27;s southern coast were also beefed up with the construction of machine-gun pillboxes in anticipation of the Imperial Japanese Army arrival by sea. Construction was briefly halted during the Great Depression but was subsequently resumed as these structures were considered vital for the defence of Singapore.

During World War II (WWII), the area saw mass mobilisation of Allied troops in anticipation of a Japanese invasion from the north-eastern coasts of Singapore as the Japanese had moved to capture the neighbouring Pulau Ubin from Malaysia. However it was a bluff that drew vital resources from the west of Singapore that was the eventual landing site used by the Japanese. The area also saw action of three giant artillery guns called the Johore Battery, though their usefulness in defending Singapore has been questionable.

In 1942, after the surrender of the British in Singapore, Allied Prisoners-of-Wars (POW) were made to march from the city to Changi Prison and the surrounding barracks where they were interned. The POW Camps were overcrowded and life as described by those who were interned there was unbearable, multiple incidents including the Selarang Barracks incident took place. Civilians were also not spared, the Sook Ching massacre which targeted mainly the Chinese population, took place at multiple locations in Changi, most notably at Changi Beach Park. Thousands were believed to have been executed in these areas. It was during this time too that the Japanese were also involved in the planning and construction of Changi Air Base.

After the war in 1945, the British continued to maintain Changi for military purposes, while rebuilding up the area to include accommodations, schools and resorts. They continued to do so even after the independence of Singapore in 1965, as with other areas like Seletar and Tengah. The coast along the eastern side of Changi also saw government bungalows and resorts opened for civil servants use. In 1971, because of the East of Suez policy that was announced by the British earlier in 1968, there was a sudden and large withdrawal of British troops from Changi. The vacated area saw many people whose livelihood and businesses depended on providing for the British forces becoming jobless and unsustainable. However, there were still contingents of ANZUK troops that were left in its place and the government of New Zealand even bolstered its presence in Singapore in the wake of the British withdrawal to maintain its interest in the region. The area then later became home to several of Singapore Armed Forces units too.

Changi was then revitalised with Changi Village and Somapah spruced up and Changi Airport being constructed in the area after land reclamation took place. However, this caused further disruptions to the livelihood of the residents as they had to make way for the airport and later the many other redevelopments in the area including high tech industrial estates. Finally in 1989, the last of New Zealand troops withdrew and all its remaining assets were handed over to the Singapore government. Redevelopment works continued into the 21st century with the progressive opening of the airport&#x27;s terminal 3, 4 in 2008 and 2017, and the new Changi Prison Complex in 2004. Despite the strong progress of these developments, there were several ventures that were eventually stalled, like the Changi Motorsports Hub, which was expected to open as Singapore&#x27;s first permanent motor racing circuit, but was halted in 2013.

Future development of Changi is in the pipelines with a mega-sized Terminal 5 and the Changi East Industrial Zone expected to be ready before 2030.

==Geography==
The terrain in Changi is generally flat because most of Changi today sits on reclaimed land, there are however three notable hills in the Changi Village area, Battery (Biggin) Hill, Fairy Point Hill and Temple Hill. The ground conditions on reclaimed land however were soft marine clay which could not support the runway and taxiways of the airport, and thus works had to carried out accordingly to drain the water and strengthen them. There are also two reservoirs located in Changi, the Changi Creek Reservoir and South End Reservoir which are located to the north and south of Changi Airport respectively. The Changi planning area as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority encompasses the subzone of Changi Airport, Changi Point and Changi West, although in comparison to the parliamentary electoral boundaries or the Changi Estate that is commonly known in public they all differ from one another slightly.

==Amenities==
There are numerous amenities spread around Changi. They include shopping malls like Changi City Point and even Changi Airport, which is considered to be a shoppers&#x27; paradise with duty-free shopping available inside the airport&#x27;s transit area. Besides those, the Changi Village hawker centre is renowned for its food options, with shophouses also found around the area for the convenience of its residents. Food and amenity centres are also found all around the industrial estates, including the airfreight centre.

Places of worship in the area include Changi Bethany Church, Maranatha Bible Presbyterian Church, Sree Ramar Hindu Temple and Yan Kit Village Chinese Temple.

===Education===
Currently the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore&#x27;s fourth autonomous university, is located at its permanent campus in Changi. Otherwise there are presently no public government schools in Changi but there were several that used to operate in its history. Additionally there are also several private and international schools operating in the area like BNP Paribus Campus, One World International School and Singapore Aviation Academy.

These were the schools that used to operate from Changi and most were cleared away for the construction of Changi Airport. All but one of them are now defunct, namely:
* Red Swastika Primary School, from 1951 to 1981, the site was near the present-day junction of Changi Business Park Vista and Changi South Avenue 1, it now stands at Bedok North
* Ayer Gemuroh Malay Primary School, from c.1949 to 1975, the site is now occupied by the south portion of Changi Airport
* Chong Sing Chinese School, from 1910 to 1974, it was reconstructed in 1941 and the site is now occupied by Singapore Aviation Academy
* Jeevanantham Tamil School/ Changi Tamil School, from 1946 to 1974, it was reconstructed twice in 1952 and 1966 with the site situated opposite the Japanese School
* Min Chong Chinese School, from 1945 to 1981, it was formed from a merge between Bo Wen, Pei Nan School and was reconstructed in 1948 and 1959, the site was near the present-day junction of Changi Business Park Vista and Changi Business Park Crescent
* Padang Terbakar Malay School, from 1883 to 1975, the site was approximately before the ECP slip road on Xilin Avenue
* Telok Paku Primary School, from 1951 to 1975, the site is now occupied by the Airline House
* Ting Ying Chinese School, from 1933 to c.1973, the site is now occupied by runway 02L/20R of Changi Airport

Additionally the British and later the Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) government opened schools for children of servicemen deployed in Singapore:
* British Army&#x27;s Children School (Selarang), from c.1950 to 1971, later converted to ANZ Primary School Selarang, which lasted from 1971 to 1973, the site was near Selarang Camp
* Changi Junior and Infant School, until 1971, the site is now occupied by the north portion of Changi Air Base West
* RAF Changi Grammar School, from 1963 to 1971, later converted to ANZ High School Changi, which lasted from 1971 to 1973, the site at 1800 Upper Changi Road North is now state property
* Changi Campus is located in Loyang on the outskirts of the Changi Estate.

===Leisure===
There are a number of leisure facilities in Changi, including resorts, nature and sports facilities. Such facilities generally cater to a weekend getaway for Singaporeans.

==Economy==
===Airlines===
Changi Airport is a hub for FedEx Express, Jetstar Asia Airways, Qantas, Scoot, Singapore Airlines, Singapore Airlines Cargo, Tiger Airways and Valuair. These airlines&#x27; head offices are located as follows: Singapore Airlines in Airline House, Singapore Airlines Cargo in the SATS Airfreight Cargo Terminal 5, Jetstar Asia, Scoot and Valuair in Terminal 1 of the airport.

===Airport industries===
The Changi Airfreight Centre (formerly known as Airport Cargo Complex) and the Airport Logistics Park (ALPS) Terminal are two main facilities that handle the airport-related goods and services daily. This may include inflown and outflown cargo, as well as aeroplane maintenance related services. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) also maintains its presence there to enforce customs, inspect and even quarantine goods entering Singapore. There are other smaller industries located nearer to the passenger terminals in Changi like the DNATA and SATS Inflight Catering Centre which also cater to the airports&#x27; needs, which may include aeroplane food catering, providing manpower and goods for operation as well as the maintenance of the airport itself. By 2030 the construction of Changi East Industrial Zone is also expected to be completed on par with the opening of Terminal 5 to be able to handle the increase in cargo volume.

===Other industries===
Changi Business Park and Changi North Industrial Park are industrial estates located within Changi that have aeroplane related businesses housed in them, like Collins Aerospace, but the industrial parks also contain many other businesses that are unrelated to the operations of Changi Airport. The businesses there may range from logistical, to electronics and even banking. There is also the Singapore Expo which provides companies with a place to hold conventions and exhibitions.

==Security==
Changi, except for its airport, falls under the jurisdiction of the Bedok Police Division, and the Loyang Fire Post that is supplemented by the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ. Immigration and custom controls at all ferry terminals are controlled by ICA.

===Airport===
The Airport Police Division is responsible for the overall security of Changi Airport. It is supported by auxiliary police like AETOS, Certis CISCO and SATS Security, that are usually deployed as front line officers for baggage and personnel screening as well as controlling entry points into transit areas, including the airfreight centre. The airport police is further supported by the Police K9 Changi Base and the 9 SIR infantry soldiers to maintain protection of the airport. ICA works independently from the airport police and maintains control over immigration and customs in all terminals and air cargo entry points. It works with the Singapore Customs in customs and excise related issues. The airport has its own firefighting and rescue services, the Airport Emergency Service (AES) that operates two fire stations and one fire substation that are located around the airport&#x27;s runway. It also has two casualty clearance stations and one sea rescue base located at Changi Airport Fuel Hydrant Installation (CAFHI) Jetty. AES operates 18 firefighting vehicles, two hovercraft and two fire boats.

===Military===
Changi houses several military installations of all three branches of Singapore&#x27;s defence forces. Installations for the army in the area include Hendon Camp and the SAF Changi Ferry Terminal, while for the air force include, Changi Air Base East and West, and finally for the navy include Changi Naval Base. With plans to move Paya Lebar Air Base to Changi come 2030 and as well as the construction of Changi Airport Terminal 5, Changi Air Base is undergoing significant redevelopment works which include the lengthening of the runway. The SAF Ferry Terminal is also the starting point for the famous 24 km route march for new army recruits before they head in the direction of The Float @ Marina Bay for their passing out parade, besides being the typical connecting point for military personnel travelling between Pulau Tekong and Singapore.

===Prison===
Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is headquartered in Changi and most of its departments are located in the vicinity of its headquarters, like the Prison Logistics Branch. SPS operates two prisons in Changi, Changi Prison Complex and Tanah Merah Prison School. Changi Prison is the main premises for the incarcerated in Singapore. It is currently operating from a new building site with various clusters that hold offenders of various classification. Additionally, the Tanah Merah Prison School, which took over Kaki Bukit Prison School in 2011, is the only prison school in Singapore, where inmates can sit for either the GCE &#x27;O&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27; or &#x27;A&#x27; Levels Examinations. Besides prisons, Changi also has rehabilitation centres like the Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre, which recently saw the nearby Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre being relocated into it so that and the site can be redeveloped to a halfway house. Past prisons and rehabilitation centres in the area include Abingdon Prison/Drug Rehabilitation Centre and Changi Women&#x27;s Prison. The Changi Women&#x27;s Prison was merged into the new Changi Prison Complex in October 2017.

==Transportation==
===Air===
Changi is the home of Singapore Changi International Airport, which is considered to be the leading aviation hub in the region and serves many regional and international destinations. Most of Singapore&#x27;s international arrival and departure are made via this airport. It is one of two civilian airports in Singapore, the other being Seletar Airport.

===Land===
====Bus====
There are three bus terminals in Changi: Changi Airport Passenger Terminal Building Bus Terminal, Changi Business Park Bus Terminal and Changi Village Bus Terminal.

===== Changi Airport Passenger Terminal Building Bus Terminal =====
The main Changi Airport bus terminal is located in the basement of Terminal 2. However all bus services serving this bus terminal, namely 24, 27, 34, 36, 53, 110 and 858 serves the airport’s terminals 1, 2 and 3. Only bus services 24, 34, 36 and 110 operate from Terminal 4 of the airport.

Private buses and coaches also operate from the airport via dedicated coach boarding bays, including services such as Transtar Cross Border Service (TS1) to Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

=====Changi Business Park Bus Terminal=====
Changi Business Park Bus Terminal is located north of SUTD. Only two bus services, 47 and 118, serves this bus terminal. However, there are more bus services that ply within the Changi Business Park that do not call at this terminal, which include public bus service 20 and other private bus services.

=====Changi Village Bus Terminal=====
Changi Village Bus Terminal is located adjacent to Changi Village hawker centre. Bus services 2, 29, 59 and 109 operate from this bus terminal.

There was previously another bus terminal, the Somapah Bus Terminal located near the present-day Expo. It was opened in 1981 but demolished in 1989 to make way for redevelopments in the Expo area. Its bus services used to serve the east including the newly built Changi Airport which didn&#x27;t have a bus terminal then.

There are many more bus services that ply within the entire Changi Estate. Several notable locations with bus services running to them include the Changi Airfreight Centre, which has services 9, 19 and 89 operating within it. Access to the airfreight centre is restricted and all buses entering the centre are individually checked by auxiliary police officers to ensure that all passengers have valid passes. Commuters wishing to enter the airfreight centre and do not have the required passes are to alight at the Police Pass Office bus stop to obtain their passes. The ALPS Terminal, which is next to the airfreight centre, as well as the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal are only accessible via bus service 35. However access to both of the locations are not restricted.

====Train====
Changi is served by 3 MRT stations, Changi Airport on the East West MRT line, Upper Changi on the Downtown MRT line and Expo which is an interchange station for both lines. All of the stations are located in the south or central of Changi, hence there are no MRT stations in the vicinity of Changi Village or the airfreight centre, located in the north. Xilin MRT station is under construction as part of the Downtown line extension and would bring greater connectivity to Changi Business Park when it opens in 2026. There are however plans for the northern part of Changi as well as the upcoming Changi Airport Terminal 5 to be linked via the Cross Island MRT line and Thomson–East Coast MRT line.

Changi Airport is served internally by the Changi Airport Skytrain system that operates between Terminals 1, 2 and 3, both in the transit as well as public areas. Terminal 3 additionally has a Skytrain in the transit area that operates between the ends of the terminal for travellers convenience. The Skytrain is free of charge and is operationally between 5 am and 2.30 am, and at all other times travellers can take shuttle buses or travel on foot between terminals. Terminal 4 does not have a SkyTrain connection and the shuttle bus from Terminal 2 is available as a possible connection.

There exists the Changi Railway for a period of time in the 1930s to the 1940s which was used by the British prior to and during World War II, its primary function was to transport ammunition from the piers near Fairy Point Hill to the Johore batteries located around Changi. However they have since been dismantled.

====Road====
The East Coast Parkway (ECP), Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Tampines Expressway (TPE) all start from the end of Airport just south of the perimeter of the airport. Airport Boulevard is the only road available for travellers wishing to enter or exit Changi Airport via road and it branches out to all four terminals inside the airport. There are dedicated roads for arrival, departure, coaches, public buses and taxis within each terminal. Taxi surcharge to and from the airport is $3 per ride or $5 per ride on Friday to Sunday, between 5 pm and 12 am.

There are three major roads that head to Changi Village: Loyang Avenue and Upper Changi Road North, which is located to the west of Changi Airport, and Tanah Merah Coast Road which is located to the east of the airport. There is no expressway that heads for a similar direction.

===Sea===
There are multiple points of entry to Singapore via sea. The Changi Ferry Terminal, Changi Point Ferry Terminal, and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal are for civilian use while the CAFHI Jetty, Changi Naval Base, and SAF Changi Ferry Terminal are for private or military use and access is restricted. Destinations reachable from the Changi and Changi Point Ferry Terminals include Tanjung Belungkor on the eastern side of Johor, Malaysia, in addition, bumboat ferries operate to Pulau Ubin only from Changi Point. Batam and Bintan, Indonesia, are reachable via Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. All civilian ferry terminals are operated locally except for Changi Ferry Terminal which is managed by the Johor Port Authority.

====SAF Changi Ferry Terminal====
SAF Changi Ferry Terminal, also known as Singapore Armed Forces Ferry Terminal (SAFFT), is a jetty that provides ferry services between Singapore&#x27;s main island and Pulau Tekong, the site of SAF&#x27;s Basic Military Training Centre.

==Incidents==
* On 17 March 2012, a Malaysian Indian cleaner was killed when he was hit by a taxi hijacked by a Chinese national at Changi Airport Budget Terminal. Following his death, his widow and children received donations and insurance claims amounting to almost a million dollars. However, two years later it was reported his widow had spent all the money.
* On 29 November 2015, 97 passengers aboard a ferry heading from Batam to Singapore were evacuated onto life rafts after their ferry collided with an object in the water at about 7.40pm. However, their life rafts also began taking in water, and they were eventually brought back to the Indonesian shores by villagers&#x27; boats. The passengers finally arrived at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, their intended location, at 12.20am the next day.
* On 21 December 2017, 49 passengers on a ferry from Desaru, Malaysia were stranded at Changi Ferry Terminal for more than two hours after a contractor&#x27;s barge blocked the jetty. The police had to be called in to help the passengers to disembarking safely.

<text>Stephen of Armenia (, 1111 – 7 February 1165) was the Marshal of Armenia, the son of Leo I, Prince of Armenia and Beatrice de Rethel.

His father made him Marshal in 1138, due to the invasion of John II Comnenus, and escaped capture by sheltering in Edessa. In 1157, he began raiding Byzantine territories around Marash against his half-brother Thoros&#x27; will, although he failed to capture Marash itself. The Byzantine governor of Tarsus, Andronicus Euphorbenus, invited him to a banquet. Stephen&#x27;s corpse was found the next day and it was believed Andronicus murdered him. Thoros avenged his death with a massacre of Greeks within his territories, which would have led to war had not Amalric I of Jerusalem intervened to bring about a peace.

He had at least three children by his wife Rita of Barbaron: 
*Ruben III
*Leo II
*Dolete, who married Bertrand Embriaco

<doc id="406277" wikidata="Q4925477" url="?curid=406277" title="John (given name)">
<text>John ( ) is a common male name in the English language ultimately of Hebrew origin. The English form is from Middle English &quot;Ioon&quot;, &quot;Ihon&quot;, &quot;Iohn, Jan&quot; (mid-12c.), itself from Old French &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Jean&quot;, &quot;Jehan&quot; (Modern French &quot;Jean&quot;), from Medieval Latin &quot;Johannes&quot;, altered form of Late Latin &quot;Ioannes&quot;, or the Middle English personal name is directly from Medieval Latin, which is from the Greek name Ioannis (Ιωάννης), originally borne by Jews transliterating the Hebrew name &quot;Yochanan&quot; (), the contracted form of the longer name (), meaning &quot;YHWH is Gracious&quot; or &quot;YHWH is Merciful&quot;. There are numerous forms of the name in different languages; these were formerly often simply translated as &quot;John&quot; in English but are increasingly left in their native forms (see sidebar).

The names Jon/Jonathan and John should not be confused as they are based on an entirely different name in the Bible: Jonathan derives from the Hebrew Yonatan - “given by God”, whereas John comes from Yohanan - “graced by God”.

The name is among the most commonly given names in the Anglophone, Arabic, European, Latin American, Iranian, and Turkic countries. Traditionally in the Anglosphere, it was the most common, although it has not been since the latter half of the 20th century. 

John owes its unique popularity to two highly revered saints, John the Baptist (forerunner of Jesus Christ) and the apostle John (traditionally considered the author of the Gospel of John); the name has since been chosen as the regnal or religious name of many emperors, kings, popes and patriarchs. Initially, it was a favorite name among the Greeks, but it flourished in all of Europe after the First Crusade.

== Origins ==

The name John is a theophoric name originating from the Hebrew name (), or in its longer form (), meaning &quot;YHWH has been gracious&quot;. Several obscure figures in the Old Testament bore this name, and it grew in popularity once borne by the high priest Johanan and especially by King John Hyrcanus In the Second Temple period, it was the fifth most popular male name among Jews in Judaea and was borne by several important rabbis, such as Yochanan ben Zakai and Yochanan ben Nuri.

=== Germanic derivatives ===
The Germanic languages, including German, English and Scandinavian produced the masculine Johann 

* also Johan (Dutch)
* Joan, 
* Jan and Janke (Dutch)
* Jannis
* Jens (Danish and Frisian)
* Jóhannes
* Jóhann (Icelandic and Faroese)
* Jöns (Swedish)
* Hans (German, Dutch and Scandinavian).

== Name statistics ==
John was the most popular name given to male infants in the United States until 1924, and though its use has fallen off gradually since then, John was still the 20th most common name for boys on the Social Security Administration&#x27;s list of the names given in 2006.

&quot;John&quot; was also among the most common masculine names in the United Kingdom, but by 2004 it had fallen out of the top 50 names for newborn boys in England and Wales. 

By contrast Jack, which was a nickname for John but is now established as a name in its own right, was the most popular name given to newborn boys in England and Wales every year from 1995 to 2005. It is also the third most common name in the United States, with an estimated 3.18 million individuals as of 2021 according to the Social Security Administration.

<doc id="406281" wikidata="Q232061" url="?curid=406281" title="The Two Cultures">
<text>&quot;The Two Cultures&quot; is the first part of an influential 1959 Rede Lecture by British scientist and novelist C. P. Snow, which was published in book form as The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution the same year. Its thesis was that science and the humanities, which represented &quot;the intellectual life of the whole of western society&quot;, had become split into &quot;two cultures&quot; and that this division was a major handicap to both in solving the world&#x27;s problems.

==The lecture==
The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the Senate House, Cambridge, and subsequently published as &quot;The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&quot;. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; of 6 October 1956, also entitled &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;. Published in book form, Snow&#x27;s lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, &quot;The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&quot;.

Snow&#x27;s position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:
In 2008, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; included &quot;The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&quot; in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the Second World War.

Snow&#x27;s Rede Lecture condemned the British educational system as having, since the Victorian era, over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of scientific and engineering education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the Second World War for the Allies. This in practice deprived British elites (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries&#x27; rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of &quot;The Two Cultures&quot; tended to obscure Snow&#x27;s initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and social class) and those of competing countries.

== Implications and influence ==
The literary critic F. R. Leavis called Snow a &quot;public relations man&quot; for the scientific establishment in his essay &quot;Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow&quot;, published in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1962. The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine&#x27;s letters pages.

In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture. This concept was later picked up in John Brockman&#x27;s &quot;The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution&quot;.

Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister&#x27;s Pox&quot; provides a different perspective. Assuming the dialectical interpretation, it argues that Snow&#x27;s concept of &quot;two cultures&quot; is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.

Simon Critchley, in &quot;Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction&quot; suggests:
That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as &quot;a vicious &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack&quot;; going on to describe the debate as &quot;a familiar clash in English cultural history&quot; citing also T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold.

In his opening address at the Munich Security Conference in January 2014, the Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between &quot;the two cultures&quot;: &quot;Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it&#x27;s cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails.&quot;

==Antecedents==
Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the &quot;Methodenstreit&quot; of 1890 German universities. A quarrel in 1911 between Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile on the one hand and Federigo Enriques on the other one is believed to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of positivism versus interpretivism.

<text>In user interface design, a menu is a list of options presented to the user.

==Navigation==
A user chooses an option from a menu by using an input device. Some input methods require linear navigation: the user must move a cursor or otherwise pass from one menu item to another until reaching the selection. On a computer terminal, a reverse video bar may serve as the cursor.

Touch user interfaces and menus that accept codes to select menu options without navigation are two examples of non-linear interfaces.

Some of the input devices used in menu interfaces are touchscreens, keyboards, mice, remote controls, and microphones. In a voice-activated system, such as interactive voice response, a microphone sends a recording of the user&#x27;s voice to a speech recognition system, which translates it to a command.

== Types of menus ==

A computer using a command line interface may present a list of relevant commands with assigned short-cuts (digits, numbers or characters) on the screen. Entering the appropriate short-cut selects a menu item. A more sophisticated solution offers navigation using the cursor keys or the mouse (even in two dimensions; then the menu items appear or disappear similarly to the menus common in GUIs). The current selection is highlighted and can be activated by pressing the enter key.

A computer using a graphical user interface presents menus with a combination of text and symbols to represent choices. By &quot;clicking&quot; on one of the symbols or text, the operator is selecting the instruction that the symbol represents. A context menu is a menu in which the choices presented to the operator are automatically modified according to the current context in which the operator is working.

A common use of menus is to provide convenient access to various operations such as saving or opening a file, quitting a program, or manipulating data. Most widget toolkits provide some form of pull-down or pop-up menu. Pull-down menus are the type commonly used in menu bars (usually near the top of a window or screen), which are most often used for performing actions, whereas pop-up (or &quot;fly-out&quot;) menus are more likely to be used for setting a value, and might appear anywhere in a window.

According to traditional human interface guidelines, menu names were always supposed to be &quot;verbs&quot;, such as &quot;file&quot;, &quot;edit&quot; and so on. This has been largely ignored in subsequent user interface developments. A single-word verb however is sometimes unclear, and so as to allow for multiple word menu names, the idea of a vertical menu was invented, as seen in NeXTSTEP.

Menus are now also seen in consumer electronics, starting with TV sets and VCRs that gained on-screen displays in the early 1990s, and extending into computer monitors and DVD players. Menus allow the control of settings like tint, brightness, contrast, bass and treble, and other functions such as channel memory and closed captioning. Other electronics with text-only displays can also have menus, anything from business telephone systems with digital telephones, to weather radios that can be set to respond only to specific weather warnings in a specific area. Other more recent electronics in the 2000s also have menus, such as digital media players.

== Submenus ==
Menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. Selecting a menu entry with an arrow will expand it, showing a second menu (the submenu) with options related to the selected entry.

Usability of submenus has been criticized as difficult, because of the narrow height that must be crossed by the pointer. The steering law predicts that this movement will be slow, and any error in touching the boundaries of the parent menu entry will hide the submenu. Some techniques proposed to alleviate these errors are keeping the submenu open while moving the pointer in diagonal, and using &quot;mega menus&quot; designed to enhance scannability and categorization of its contents. Negative user experience with submenus is referred to as &quot;menu diving&quot;.

== Usage of attached ellipses ==
In computer menu functions or buttons, an appended ellipsis (&quot;…&quot;) means that upon selection, another dialog will follow, where the user can or must make a choice. If the ellipse is missing, the function will be executed upon selection.

* &quot;Save&quot;: the file will be overwritten without further input.
* &quot;Save as ...&quot;: in the following dialog, the user can, for example, select another location or file name or other file format.

== Touchscreens ==

Displays with touchscreen functionality, e.g. modern cameras and printers, also have menus: these are not drop-down menus but buttons.

<text>Thoros II (; died 6 February 1169), also known as Thoros the Great, was the sixth lord of Armenian Cilicia from the Rubenid dynasty from 1144/1145 until 1169.

Thoros (together with his father, Leo I and his brother, Roupen) was kidnapped in 1137 by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus during his campaign against Cilicia and the Principality of Antioch. All of Cilicia remained under Byzantine rule for eight years.

Whatever the conditions in which Thoros entered Cilicia, he found it occupied by many Greek garrisons.

==Early life==
Thoros was the second son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia.

In 1136, Leo I (Thoros&#x27;s father) was arrested by Baldwin of Marash. After two months of confinement, Leo I obtained his liberty by consenting to harsh terms.

Leo I took refuge in the Taurus Mountains, but at last found the situation hopeless, and surrendered himself to the conqueror; Thoros was kidnapped with his father and his youngest brother, Roupen. They were dragged away to Constantinople, where Leo I died in imprisonment in 1141. Roupen, after being blinded, was assassinated by the Greeks.

Other view is that after the battle Raynald was forced to return home, covered with humiliation; and later on, Thoros voluntarily surrendered to the brethren the fortresses in question, and the Knights in turn took oath &quot;“to assist the Armenians on all occasions where they needed help.”&quot;&quot;

The Armenians attacked the few remaining Byzantine fortresses in Cilicia.

===The sack of Cyprus===
==Last years==
After his abdication, he was a monk.

He died in 1169. He was buried in the monastery of Drazark.

==Marriages and children==

<doc id="406287" wikidata="Q14692538" url="?curid=406287" title="Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness">
<text>The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW or BWCA) comprises of pristine forests, glacial lakes, and streams in the Superior National Forest. Located entirely within the U.S. state of Minnesota at the Boundary Waters, the wilderness area is under the administration of the United States Forest Service. Efforts to preserve the primitive landscape began in the 1900s and culminated in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act of 1978. The area is a popular destination for canoeing, hiking, and fishing, and is the most visited wilderness in the United States.

== Geography ==
The BWCAW extends along of the Canadian border in the Arrowhead Region of Minnesota. The combined region of the BWCAW, Superior National Forest, Voyageurs National Park, and Ontario&#x27;s Quetico and La Verendrye provincial parks make up a large area of contiguous wilderness lakes and forests called the &quot;Quetico-Superior country&quot;, or simply the Boundary Waters. Lake Superior lies to the south and east of the Boundary Waters.

Nearly 20% of the BWCAW&#x27;s total area, or , is water. Within the borders of the area are over 1,100 lakes and hundreds of miles of rivers and streams. Much of the other 80% of the area is forest. The BWCAW contains the largest remaining area of uncut forest in the eastern portion of the United States.

The Laurentian Divide between the watersheds of the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay runs northeast–southwest through the east side of the BWCAW, following the crest of the Superior Upland and Gunflint Range. The crossing of the divide at Height of Land Portage was an occasion for ceremony and initiation rites for the fur-trading Voyageurs of the 18th and early 19th centuries. The wilderness also includes the highest peak in Minnesota, Eagle Mountain (), part of the Misquah Hills.

Located around the perimeter of the BWCAW are six ranger stations: in Cook, Aurora, Ely, Isabella, Tofte and Grand Marais. The two nearby communities with most visitor services are Ely and Grand Marais. Several historic roads such as the Gunflint Trail, Echo Trail (County Road 116) and Fernberg Road (County Road 18) allow access to many wilderness entry points.

===Climate===
The weather station Ely 25E is on the southern edge of Snowbank Lake (Minnesota), a lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has a dry winter humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwb&quot;), bordering on a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).
== Natural history ==
=== Geology ===
The lakes of the BWCAW are located in depressions formed by differential erosion of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape. The last glacial period ended with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from the Boundary Waters about 17,000 years ago. The resulting depressions in the landscape later filled with water, becoming today′s lakes.

Many varieties of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, as well as metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7 billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils have been found in the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.

=== Forest ecology ===
The Boundary Waters area is near the border of the true boreal forest and the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province (commonly called the &quot;North Woods&quot;), a transitional zone between the boreal forest to the north and the temperate hardwood forest to the south that contains characteristics of each. Trees found within the wilderness area include conifers such as red pine, eastern white pine, jack pine, balsam fir, white spruce, black spruce, and white-cedar, as well as deciduous birch, aspen, ash, and maple. Blueberries and raspberries can be found in cleared areas. The BWCAW is estimated to contain of old growth forest, woods that may have burned but have never been logged. Before fire suppression efforts began during the 20th century, forest fires were a natural part of the Boundary Waters ecosystem, with recurrence intervals of 30 to 300 years in most areas.
On July 4, 1999, a powerful wind storm, or derecho, swept across Minnesota, central Ontario, and southern Quebec. Winds as high as knocked down millions of trees, affecting about within the BWCAW and injuring 60 people. This event became known officially as the Boundary Waters–Canadian derecho, commonly referred to as &quot;the Boundary Waters blowdown&quot;. Although campsites and portages were quickly cleared after the storm, an increased risk of wildfire due to the large number of downed trees became a concern. The U.S. Forest Service undertook prescribed burns to reduce the forest fuel load in the event of a wildfire.
The first major wildfire within the blowdown area occurred in August 2005, burning between Alpine Lake and Seagull Lake in the northeastern BWCAW. In 2006, two fires at Cavity Lake and Turtle Lake burned more than . In May 2007, the Ham Lake Fire started near the location of the Cavity Lake fire, eventually covering in Minnesota and Ontario and becoming the most extensive wildfire in Minnesota in 90 years. In 2011, the Pagami Creek Fire grew to over , spreading beyond the wilderness boundary to threaten homes and businesses. Smoke from the Pagami Creek Fire drifted east and south as far as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Ontario, Chicago, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. In 2021, it was closed due to wildfire for the first time since the 1970s, as the Greenwood Fire threatened access and spread rapidly to the south of its origin, and other smaller fires were burning within the wilderness.

=== Wildlife ===
Animals found in the BWCAW include deer, moose, beaver, timber wolves, black bears, bobcats, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and loons. It is within the range of the largest population of wolves in the contiguous United States, as well as an unknown number of Canada lynx. It has also been identified by the American Bird Conservancy as a globally important bird habitat.

Woodland caribou once inhabited the region but have disappeared due to encroachment by deer, and the effects of a brainworm parasite carried by deer which is harmful to both caribou and moose populations. Very rare sightings have been reported in nearby areas as recently as the 1980s.

== Human history ==

=== Native Americans ===
The north country was inhabited by the Paleo Indian culture circa 8000 BC. Limited artifacts have been found in the BWCAW from that era and the subsequent Archaic period circa 6000 years ago. Artifacts from the Early Woodland Era (circa 1300 years ago) have not been found there, but pottery and clay pipes from the Later Woodland Indians have been found there.

The area was then sparsely populated by the Sioux. Then the Ojibwe arrived and the Sioux migrated westward. The area then became a part of the homeland of the Ojibwe people, who traveled the waterways in canoes made of birch bark. Within the BWCAW are hundreds of prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs on rock ledges and cliffs. It is thought that the Hegman Lake Pictograph located on a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake was most likely created by the Ojibwe. The pictograph appears to represent Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening, knowledge of which may have been useful for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season. The Grand Portage Indian Reservation, just east of the BWCAW at the community of Grand Portage, is home to a number of Ojibwe to this day.

=== European exploration and development ===

In 1688 the French explorer Jacques de Noyon became the first European known to have traveled through the BWCAW area. Later, during the 1730s, La Vérendrye and others opened the region to trade, mainly in beaver pelts. By the end of the 18th century, the fur trade had been organized into groups of canoe-paddling voyageurs working for the competing North West and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Companies, with a North West Company fort located at the Grand Portage on Lake Superior. The final rendezvous was held at Grand Portage in 1803, after which the North West Company moved its operations further north to Fort William (now Thunder Bay). In 1821 the North West Company merged with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the center of the fur trade moved even further north to the posts around Hudson Bay.

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the area&#x27;s legal and political status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified the border between the United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW&#x27;s northern border).

The BWCAW area remained largely undeveloped until gold, silver and iron were found in the surrounding area during the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. Logging in the area began around the same time to supply lumber to support the mining industries, with production peaking in the late 1910s and gradually trailing off during the 1920s and 1930s.

=== Protection ===
In 1902, Minnesota&#x27;s Forest Commissioner Christopher C. Andrews persuaded the state to reserve of land near the BWCAW from being sold to loggers. In 1905 he visited the area on a canoe trip and was impressed by the area&#x27;s natural beauty. He was able to save another from being sold for development. He soon reached out to the Ontario government to encourage them to preserve some of the area&#x27;s land on their side of the border, noting that the area could be &quot;an international forest reserve and park of very great beauty and interest&quot;. This collaboration led to the creation of the Superior National Forest and the Quetico Provincial Park in 1909.

The BWCAW itself was formed gradually through a series of actions. By the early 1920s, roads had begun to be built through the Superior National Forest to promote public access to the area for recreation. In 1926 a section of within the Superior National Forest was set aside as a roadless wilderness area by Secretary of Agriculture William Marion Jardine. This area became the nucleus of the BWCAW. In 1930, Congress passed the Shipstead-Newton-Nolan Act, which prohibited logging and dams within the area to preserve its natural water levels. Through additional land purchases and shifts in boundaries, the amount of protected land owned by the government in the area grew even further. In 1938, the area&#x27;s borders were expanded and altered (roughly matching those of the present day BWCAW), and it was renamed the Superior Roadless Primitive Area.

Additional laws focused on protecting the area&#x27;s rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized the government to purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as a unit of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area. That same year the Forest Service began referring to it as &quot;BWCAW&quot; to recognize its wilderness character.

===Land use disputes===

Some aspects of the BWCAW&#x27;s management and conservation have been controversial. A 1971 rule limiting visitors to &quot;designated campsites&quot; on heavy-use routes is instituted by the U.S. Forest Service. Cans and glass bottles are prohibited from the Boundary Waters. According to the U.S. Forest Service, the measure is expected to reduce refuse by , saving $90,000 per year on cleanup.

October 1975, Eighth District Representative James Oberstar (D-MN) introduced a bill that if passed would have established a Boundary Waters Wilderness Area of and a Boundary Waters National Recreation Area (NRA) of , permitting logging and mechanized travel in the latter area and removing from wilderness designation a number of large scenic lakes such as La Croix, Basswood, Saganaga, and Seagull. The bill was strongly opposed by environmentalists.

October 21, 1978, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, U.S. Public Law 95-495, was signed by President Jimmy Carter. The act added to the Boundary Waters, to then encompass , and extended greater wilderness protection to the area. The name was changed from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The Act banned logging, mineral prospecting, and mining, and all but bans snowmobile use (two snowmobile routes remain to access Canada). The act limited motorboat use to about two dozen lakes, limited the size of motors, and regulated the number of motorboats and long established motorized portages. It called for limiting the number of motorized lakes to 16 in 1984, and 14 in 1999, totaling about 24% of the area&#x27;s water acreage.

1989 Truck portage testing. According to the 1978 BWCAW Act: Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to require the termination of the existing operation of motor vehicles to assist in the transport of boats across the portages from Sucker Lake to Basswood Lake, from Fall Lake to Basswood Lake, and from Lake Vermilion to Trout Lake, during the period ending January 1, 1984. Following said date, unless the Secretary determines that there is no feasible non-motorized means of transporting boats across the portages to reach the lakes previously served by the portages listed above, he shall terminate all such motorized use of each portage listed above.

1989 – U S Forest Service with the University of MN conduct feasibility tests on the three truck portages. It is determined that trucks should remain.

1990 – Friends of the Boundary Waters, Sierra Club and six other environmental groups sue to have trucks removed; CWCS joins the U S Forest Service as intervenors.

1992 – Appeals court sides with U S Forest Service that trucks should remain. Friends of the Boundary Waters and coalition appeal to 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Trucks are removed from the three truck portages.

1994 – As a result of the Friends of the Boundary Waters lawsuit against the 1992 BWCAW Management Plan, canoe rests, pontoon boats and sailboats are banned from the Boundary Waters.

1999 – As a result of the Friends of the Boundary Waters lawsuit against the 1992 BWCAW Management Plan, the courts redefined the phrase ‘that particular lake’ and exempt permits were eliminated for property owners, resorts and outfitters on the Moose, Farm and Seagull Chain of Lakes.

1999 – Trucks return to two of the three truck portages, Prairie and Trout Lake portages, as a result of Congressman Oberstar including this provision in his 1998 Transportation Bill.

A snowmobile trail located from the border provoked a lawsuit in 2006. In 2015, a judge ruled that the snowmobile trail did not violate the Wilderness Act.

====Proposed Twin Metals Mine====

It has been known for decades that there are about four billion tons of copper and nickel ore, &quot;one of the world&#x27;s largest undeveloped mineral deposits&quot;, in the Duluth Complex, which underlies part of northeastern Minnesota. Resource companies have proposed mines south and west of the BWCAW upstream of the wilderness and within its watershed, leading to concerns that surface runoff could damage the wilderness. In December 2016 the federal government proposed banning mining for 20 years while the subject was studied. The Trump administration cancelled the study in September 2018, clearing the way for mining leases in the national forest. The Antofagasta PLC subsidiary Twin Metals Minnesota would operate a proposed mine. In October 2021, the Biden administration filed an application for a &quot;mineral withdrawal&quot; that will put a hold on the development of the mine proposal while the environmental impacts are studied. The completed study could lead to a 20-year ban on mining upstream from the BWCAW.

== Recreation ==
The BWCAW attracts over 150,000 visitors per year. It contains more than 2,000 backcountry campsites, of canoe routes, and 12 different hiking trails and is popular for canoeing, canoe touring, fishing, backpacking, dog sledding, and enjoying the area&#x27;s remote wilderness character.

Permits are required for all overnight visits to the BWCAW. Quota permits are required for groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW entry points. From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.

=== Hiking ===

The BWCAW contains a variety of hiking trails. Shorter hikes include the trail to Eagle Mountain (). Loop trails include the Pow Wow Trail, the Snowbank Trail, and the Sioux-Hustler Trail. The Border Route Trail and Kekekabic Trail are the two longest trails running through the BWCAW. The Border Route Trail runs east–west for over through the eastern BWCAW, beginning at the northern end of the Superior Hiking Trail and following ridges and cliffs west until it connects with the Kekekabic Trail. The Kekekabic Trail continues for another , beginning near the Gunflint Trail and passing through the center of the BWCAW before exiting it near Snowbank Lake. Both the Border Route and the Kekekabic Trail are part of the longer North Country National Scenic Trail and together these represent the most remote segment of the NCT&#x27;s 4,800 miles.

=== Canoeing ===
Canoeing or other non-motorized boating is the most popular method of exploring the BWCAW. A 2007 study found more than 94% of overnight visitors used a non-motorized boat to travel through the park. The BWCAW&#x27;s size and abundance of campsites, lakes, rivers and portage trails allow for almost countless options for different routes. Many online maps and guidebooks offer suggested routes based on entry point, duration and difficulty.

=== Fishing ===
Fishing is a popular activity in the BWCAW. Game species include northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and occasional panfish. Trout including brook trout, lake trout, rainbow trout and splake are also found. White sucker, burbot, and whitefish also occur. Limited stocking of walleye and lake trout is done on some lakes where natural recruitment is limited. The wilderness contains one of the largest concentrations of native lake trout lakes in the lower 48 states.

===Night sky viewing===
In 2020 the BWCA became a designated Dark Sky Sanctuary, one of 20 in the world. &quot;It differs from other Dark Sky designations in that sanctuaries are the most remote and often darkest places in the world whose conservation state is &#x27;most fragile&#x27;.&quot; The U.S. Forest Service had been working towards gaining this status for the BWCAW since 2008. According to the US forest service &quot;This designation confirms what people in the area have enjoyed for thousands of years. Dark skies, starry nights, and astonishing northern lights displays have been part of the experience long before the area was designated wilderness...&quot;

<text>Mleh I (), also Meleh I, (before 1120 – Sis, May 15, 1175) was the eighth lord of Armenian Cilicia (1170–1175).

Soon after the death of Nur ed-Din (the &quot;emir&quot; of Aleppo), Mleh was overthrown by his nephew, Roupen III.

==His early life==
Mleh was the fourth son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. The name and the origin of his mother are not known with certainty. It is possible that she was a daughter of Count Hugh I of Rethel, or she might have been the daughter of Gabriel of Melitene.

All Cilicia remained under Byzantine rule for eight years.

==In the service of Nur ed-Din==
Mleh converted to Islam from Armenian Apostolic Christianity. Afterwards, he ruled Cyrrhus.

==His rule==
On March 10, 1171, Amalric I left Acre for Constantinople where he made a treaty with the Emperor Manuel I Comnenos.

During 1171, Mleh attacked Count Stephen I of Sancerre in Cilicia while he travelled from the Holy Land to Constantinople. 

He was buried in Medzkar.

==Marriage and child==
Mleh married an unnamed daughter of Vasil of Gargar (a sister of the &quot;Catholicos&quot; Gregory).

He had one illegitimate child by his unknown mistress:
*Grigor (? – January 28, 1209/January 27, 1210 or after)

<doc id="406293" wikidata="Q837985" url="?curid=406293" title="Middle High German">
<text>Middle High German (MHG; or ; , shortened as &quot;Mhdt.&quot; or &quot;Mhd.&quot;) is the term for the form of High German spoken in the High Middle Ages. It is conventionally dated between 1050 and 1350, developing from Old High German (OHG) into Early New High German (ENHG). High German is defined as those varieties of German which were affected by the Second Sound Shift; the Middle Low German (MLG) and Middle Dutch languages spoken to the North and North West, which did not participate in this sound change, are not part of MHG.

While there is no &quot;standard&quot; MHG, the prestige of the Hohenstaufen court gave rise in the late 12th century to a supra-regional literary language () based on Swabian, an Alemannic dialect. This historical interpretation is complicated by the tendency of modern editions of MHG texts to use &quot;normalised&quot; spellings based on this variety (usually called &quot;Classical MHG&quot;), which make the written language appear more consistent than it actually is in the manuscripts. Scholars are uncertain as to whether the literary language reflected a supra-regional &quot;spoken&quot; language of the courts.

An important development in this period was the , the eastward expansion of German settlement beyond the line which marked the limit of Old High German. This process started in the 11th century, and all the East Central German dialects are a result of this expansion.

&quot;Judeo-German&quot;, the precursor of the Yiddish language, is attested in the 12th–13th centuries, as a variety of Middle High German written in Hebrew characters.

==Periodisation==


The Middle High German period is generally dated from 1050 to 1350. An older view puts the boundary with (Early) New High German around 1500.

There are several phonological criteria which separate MHG from the preceding Old High German period:
* the weakening of unstressed vowels to : OHG , MHG (&quot;days&quot;)
* the full development of umlaut and its use to mark a number of morphological categories
* the devoicing of final stops: OHG &gt; MHG (&quot;day&quot;)

Culturally, the two periods are distinguished by the transition from a predominantly clerical written culture, in which the dominant language was Latin, to one centred on the courts of the great nobles, with German gradually expanding its range of use. The rise of the Hohenstaufen dynasty in Swabia makes the South West the dominant region in both political and cultural terms.

Demographically, the MHG period is characterised by a massive rise in population, terminated by the demographic catastrophe of the Black Death (1348). Along with the rise in population comes a territorial expansion eastwards (), which saw German-speaking settlers colonise land previously under Slavic control.

Linguistically, the transition to Early New High German is marked by four vowel changes which together produce the phonemic system of modern German, though not all dialects participated equally in these changes:
* Diphthongisation of the long high vowels &gt; : MHG &gt; NHG (&quot;skin&quot;)
* Monophthongisation of the high centering diphthongs &gt; : MHG &gt; NHG (&quot;hat&quot;)
* lengthening of stressed short vowels in open syllables: MHG &gt; NHG (&quot;say&quot;)
* The loss of unstressed vowels in many circumstances: MHG &gt; NHG (&quot;lady&quot;)

The centres of culture in the ENHG period are no longer the courts but the towns.

==Dialects==

The dialect map of Germany by the end of the Middle High German period was much the same as that at the start of the 20th century, though the boundary with Low German was further south than it now is:

Central German (&quot;Mitteldeutsch&quot;)
*West Central German (&quot;Westmitteldeutsch&quot;)
**Central Franconian (&quot;Mittelfränkisch&quot;)
***Ripuarian (&quot;Ripuarisch&quot;)
***Moselle Franconian (&quot;Moselfränkisch&quot;)
**Rhine Franconian (&quot;Rheinfränkisch&quot;)
**Hessian (&quot;Hessisch&quot;)
*East Central German (&quot;Ostmitteldeutsch&quot;)
**Thuringian (&quot;Thüringisch&quot;)
**Upper Saxon (&quot;Obersächsisch&quot;)
**Silesian (&quot;Schlesisch&quot;)
**High Prussian (&quot;Hochpreußisch&quot;)
Upper German (&quot;Oberdeutsch&quot;)
*East Franconian (&quot;Ostfränkisch&quot;)
*South Rhine Franconian (&quot;Süd(rhein)fränkisch&quot;)
*Alemannic (&quot;Alemannisch&quot;)
**North Alemannic (&quot;Nordalemannisch&quot;)
***Swabian (&quot;Schwäbisch&quot;)
***Low Alemannic (&quot;Niederalemannisch/Oberrheinisch&quot;)
**High Alemannic/South Alemannic (&quot;Hochalemannisch/Südalemannisch&quot;) )
*Bavarian (&quot;Bairisch&quot;)
**Northern Bavarian (&quot;Nordbairisch&quot;)
**Central Bavarian (&quot;Mittelbairisch&quot;)
**Southern Bavarian (&quot;Südbairisch&quot;)
With the exception of Thuringian, the East Central German dialects are new dialects resulting from the &quot;&quot; and arise towards the end of the period.

== Writing system==

Middle High German texts are written in the Latin alphabet. There was no standardised spelling, but modern editions generally standardise according to a set of conventions established by Karl Lachmann in the 19th century. There are several important features in this standardised orthography which are not characteristics of the original manuscripts:
*the marking of vowel length is almost entirely absent from MHG manuscripts.
*the marking of umlauted vowels is often absent or inconsistent in the manuscripts.
*a curly-tailed z ( or ) is used in modern handbooks and grammars to indicate the or -like sound which arose from Germanic in the High German consonant shift. This character has no counterpart in the original manuscripts, which typically use or to indicate this sound.
*the original texts often use and for the semi-vowels and .

A particular problem is that many manuscripts are of much later date than the works they contain; as a result, they bear the signs of later scribes having modified the spellings, with greater or lesser consistency, in accord with conventions of their time. In addition, there is considerable regional variation in the spellings that appear in the original texts, which modern editions largely conceal.

===Vowels===

The standardised orthography of MHG editions uses the following vowel spellings:
* Short vowels: and the umlauted vowels 
* Long vowels: and the umlauted vowels 
* Diphthongs: ; and the umlauted diphthongs 

Grammars (as opposed to textual editions) often distinguish between and , the former indicating the mid-open which derived from Germanic , the latter (often with a dot beneath it) indicating the mid-close which results from primary umlaut of short . No such orthographic distinction is made in MHG manuscripts.

===Consonants===
The standardised orthography of MHG editions uses the following consonant spellings:
* Stops: 
* Affricates: 
* Fricatives: 
* Nasals: 
* Liquids: 
* Semivowels: 

==Phonology==
The charts show the vowel and consonant systems of classical MHG. The spellings indicated are the standard spellings used in modern editions; there is much more variation in the manuscripts.

===Vowels===
====Short and long Vowels====

Notes:
# Not all dialects distinguish the three unrounded mid front vowels.
# It is probable that the short high and mid vowels are lower than their long equivalents, as in Modern German, but that is impossible to establish from the written sources.
# The found in unstressed syllables may indicate or schwa .

====Diphthongs====
MHG diphthongs are indicated by the spellings , , , and , , , and they have the approximate values of , , , , , , , respectively.

===Consonants===
# Precise information about the articulation of consonants is impossible to establish and must have varied between dialects.
# In the plosive and fricative series, if there are two consonants in a cell, the first is fortis and the second lenis. The voicing of lenis consonants varied between dialects.
# There are long consonants, and the following double consonant spellings indicate not vowel length, as they do in Modern German orthography, but rather genuine double consonants: &quot;pp&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;tt&quot;, &quot;dd&quot;, &quot;ck&quot; (for ), &quot;gg&quot;, &quot;ff&quot;, &quot;ss&quot;, &quot;zz&quot;, &quot;mm&quot;, &quot;nn&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;rr&quot;.
# It is reasonable to assume that has an allophone after back vowels, as in Modern German.
# The original Germanic fricative &quot;s&quot; was in writing usually clearly distinguished from the younger fricative &quot;z&quot; that evolved from the High German consonant shift. The sounds of both letters seem not to have merged before the 13th century. Since &quot;s&quot; later came to be pronounced before other consonants (as in &quot;Stein&quot; , &quot;Speer&quot; , &quot;Schmerz&quot; (original &quot;smerz&quot;) or the southwestern pronunciation of words like &quot;Ast&quot; ), it seems safe to assume that the actual pronunciation of Germanic &quot;s&quot; was somewhere between and , most likely about , in all Old High German until late Middle High German. A word like &quot;swaz&quot;, &quot;whatever&quot;, would thus never have been but rather , later (13th century) , .

==Grammar==

=== Pronouns ===
Middle High German pronouns of the first person refer to the speaker; those of the second person refer to an addressed person; and those of the third person refer to a person or thing of which one speaks.
The pronouns of the third person may be used to replace nominal phrases. These have the same genders, numbers and cases as the original nominal phrase.

==== Personal pronouns ====
==== Possessive pronouns ====
The possessive pronouns &quot; are used like adjectives and hence take on adjective endings following the normal rules. 
===Articles===
The inflected forms of the article depend on the number, the case and the gender of the corresponding noun. The definite article has the same plural forms for all three genders.

Definite article (strong)

The instrumental case, only existing in the neuter singular, is used only with prepositions: &#x27;, &#x27;, etc. In all the other genders and in the plural it is substituted with the dative: &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;.

===Nouns===
Middle High German nouns were declined according to four cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative), two numbers (singular and plural) and three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), much like Modern High German, though there are several important differences.

====Strong nouns====


====Weak nouns====

===Verbs===

Verbs were conjugated according to three moods (indicative, subjunctive (conjunctive) and imperative), three persons, two numbers (singular and plural) and two tenses (present tense and preterite) There was a present participle, a past participle and a verbal noun that somewhat resembles the Latin gerund, but that only existed in the genitive and dative cases.

An important distinction is made between strong verbs (that exhibited ablaut) and weak verbs (that didn&#x27;t).

Furthermore, there were also some irregular verbs.

====Strong verbs====

The present tense conjugation went as follows:
* Imperative: 2.sg.: &#x27;, 2.pl.: &#x27;
* Present participle: &quot;
* Infinitive: &quot;
* Verbal noun: &quot;genitive&quot;: &#x27;, &quot;dative&quot;: &#x27;

The bold vowels demonstrate umlaut; the vowels in brackets were dropped in rapid speech.

The preterite conjugation went as follows:
* Past participle: &quot;

====Weak verbs====

The present tense conjugation went as follows:
* Imperative: 2.sg: &#x27;, 2.pl: &#x27;
* Present participle: &quot;
* Infinitive: &quot;&quot;
* Verbal noun: &quot;genitive&quot;: &#x27;, &quot;dative&quot;: &#x27;

The vowels in brackets were dropped in rapid speech.

The preterite conjugation went as follows:
* Past participle: &quot;

==Vocabulary==
In the Middle High German period, the rise of a courtly culture and the changing nature of knighthood was reflected in changes to the vocabulary. Since the impetus for this set of social changes came largely from France, many of the new words were either loans from French or influenced by French terms.

The French loans mainly cover the areas of chivalry, warfare and equipment, entertainment, and luxury goods:

*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;, &quot;adventure&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;prize, reward&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;lance&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;palace&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;festival, feast&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;paint brush&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;velvet&quot;) 
*MHG &#x27; &lt; OF &#x27; (NHG &quot;&quot;, &quot;raisin&quot;)

Two highly productive suffixes were borrowed from French in this period:

*The noun suffix - is seen initially in borrowings from French such as &#x27; (&quot;retinue, household&quot;) and then starts to be combined with German nouns to produce, for example, (&quot;hunting&quot;) from (&quot;huntsman&quot;), or (&quot;medicine &quot;) from (&quot;doctor&quot;). With the Early New High German diphthongization the suffix became /ai/ (spelling &lt;ei&gt;) giving NHG &#x27;, &quot;&quot;.

*The verb suffix - resulted from adding the German infinitive suffix &quot;-en&quot; to the Old French infinitive endings &quot;-er/ir/ier&quot;. Initially, this was just a way of integrating French verbs into German syntax, but the suffix became productive in its own right and was added to non-French roots: MHG &#x27; is based on OF &#x27; (&quot;to ride a horse&quot;), but &quot;&quot; (&quot;to cut in half&quot;) has no French source.

==Sample texts==
===&quot;Iwein&quot;===

The text is the opening of Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Iwein&quot; ()
Commentary: This text shows many typical features of Middle High German poetic language. Most Middle High German words survive into modern German in some form or other: this passage contains only one word (&#x27; &#x27;say&#x27; 14) which has since disappeared from the language. But many words have changed their meaning substantially. &#x27; (6) means &#x27;state of mind&#x27; (cognates with &quot;mood&quot;), where modern German &#x27; means courage. &#x27; (3) can be translated with &#x27;honour&#x27;, but is quite a different concept of honour from modern German &quot;&quot;; the medieval term focuses on reputation and the respect accorded to status in society.

===&quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;===

The text is the opening strophe of the ().
Middle High German
&lt;poem lang=&quot;gmh&quot;&gt;Uns ist in alten mæren    wunders vil geseit
von helden lobebæren,    von grôzer arebeit,
von freuden, hôchgezîten,    von weinen und von klagen,
von küener recken strîten    muget ir nu wunder hœren sagen.&lt;/poem&gt;

Modern German translation
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;In alten Erzählungen wird uns viel Wunderbares berichtet
von ruhmreichen Helden, von hartem Streit,
von glücklichen Tagen und Festen, von Schmerz und Klage:
vom Kampf tapferer Recken: Davon könnt auch Ihr nun Wunderbares berichten hören.&lt;/poem&gt;

English translation
&lt;poem&gt;In ancient tales many marvels are told us
of renowned heroes, of great hardship
of joys, festivities, of weeping and lamenting
of bold warriors&#x27; battles — now &quot;you&quot; may hear such marvels told!&lt;/poem&gt;
Commentary: All the MHG words are recognizable from Modern German, though (&quot;tale&quot;) and (&quot;warrior&quot;) are archaic and (&quot;praiseworthy&quot;) has given way to . Words which have changed in meaning include , which means &quot;strife&quot; or &quot;hardship&quot; in MHG, but now means &quot;work&quot;, and (&quot;festivity&quot;) which now, as , has the narrower meaning of &quot;wedding&quot;.

===&quot;Erec&quot;===
The text is from the opening of Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Erec&quot; (). The manuscript (the Ambraser Heldenbuch) dates from 1516, over three centuries after the composition of the poem.

<doc id="406300" wikidata="Q628509" url="?curid=406300" title="Oshin, King of Armenia">
<text>Oshin () (1282 – 20 July 1320) was king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, ruling from 1307 to 1320. He was a member of the House of Lampron, the son of Leo II, King of Armenia and Queen Keran.

Oshin became king after the murder of his nephew Leo III and brother Hethum II at a feast at the hands of the Mongol general Bilarghu. He was supported by the Mongol Ilkhan Oljeitu, who had ordered the execution of Bilarghu in response to their assassinations. Oshin then ascended to the throne of Cilician Armenia and initiated his reign by raising an army and driving out the Mongols. He did this as retribution for the murder of his nephew and brother at the hands of the Mongol governor general of Cilicia, Bilarghu. Mongol general Bilarghu, in charge of the Mongol garrison in Cilicia and a devout Muslim, indicated his intention to build a mosque in the capital Sis. Hethum II complained to Öljeitü Khan (1304-1316) in a letter. On 17 November 1307, Bilarghu summoned the regent and the king to his encampment near Anazarbus and had them assassinated with their retinue. Oshin immediately marched against Bilarghu and defeated him, forcing him to leave Cilicia. He was crowned king and supported by Öljeitü, who had Bilarghu executed for his crime. Öljeitü then supported Oshin to become king of Cilician Armenia and Oshin was crowned and ascended to the throne.

Like his brother Hethum II, Oshin favored a union of the Armenian and Roman churches, which aroused no little popular discontent. The unification of these churches was a precondition to obtain help from Europe, but also a matter of huge popular discontent as the Catholic Crusader states had previously been involved in a number of deadly border clashes with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Nevertheless, Oshin appealed to Christian Europe as by his reign, the kingdom of Armenian Cilicia to protect his regions against the Muslim Mamluk Empire and the Ilkhanate . The Mongols were no longer a reliable ally as they were themselves weakened by this point due to constant wars with the Mamluks and infighting within the state. In 1309, he had his wife&#x27;s uncle Oshin, Marshal of Armenia, executed for the murder of his brother Thoros III.

His sister Isabella of Armenia had married Amalric of Tyre, and when Amalric usurped the government of Cyprus from his brother Henry II of Cyprus, Henry was held in Armenia by Oshin. He was, however, released and returned to Cyprus on the assassination of Amalric in 1310.

Oshin was married three times:

* First to his cousin, Isabel of Korikos, by whom he had one son, Leo IV (born 1309). She died in 1310.
* Second to Isabelle of Lusignan, daughter of the King Hugh III of Cyprus and widow of Constantine of Neghir, Lord of Partzerpert. Oshin divorced her before 1316. Isabelle died in 1319.
* Third to Joan of Taranto on February 1316 in Tarsus. She had one son with him, George (1317 – after 1323).

On his death on 20 July 1320, Oshin was succeeded by his minor son Leo IV (sometimes referred to as Leo V). It was popularly believed that Oshin was poisoned by his cousin (and brother-in-law) Oshin of Korikos.

<doc id="406302" wikidata="Q1472199" url="?curid=406302" title="Early New High German">
<text>Early New High German (ENHG) is a term for the period in the history of the German language generally defined, following Wilhelm Scherer, as the period 1350 to 1650, developing from Middle High German and into New High German.

The term is the standard translation of the German (Frnhd., Fnhd.), introduced by Scherer. The term &quot;Early Modern High German&quot; is also occasionally used for this period (but the abbreviation EMHG is generally used for &quot;Early Middle High German&quot;).

==Periodisation==

The start and end dates of ENHG are, like all linguistic periodisations, somewhat arbitrary. In spite of many alternative suggestions, Scherer&#x27;s dates still command widespread acceptance. Linguistically, the mid-14th century is marked by the phonological changes to the vowel system that characterise the modern standard language; the mid-17th sees the loss of status for regional forms of language, and the triumph of German over Latin as the dominant, and then sole, language for public discourse.

Scherer&#x27;s dates also have the merit of coinciding with two major demographic catastrophes with linguistic consequences: the Black Death, and the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Arguably, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, by ending religious wars and creating a Germany of many small sovereign states, brought about the essential political conditions for the final development of a universally acceptable standard language in the subsequent New High German period.

Alternative periodisations take the period to begin later, such as the invention of printing with moveable type in the 1450s.

==Geographical variation==
There was no standard Early New High German, and all forms of language display some local or regional characteristics. However, there was increasing harmonisation in the written and printed word, the start of developments towards the unified standard which was codified in the New High German period.

===Dialects===
With the end of eastward expansion, the geographical spread and the dialect map of German in the ENHG period remained the same as at the close of the MHG period.
===, &quot;printers&#x27; languages&quot;===

Since the printers had a commercial interest in making their texts acceptable to a wide readership, they often strove to avoid purely local forms of language. This gave rise to so-called (&quot;printers&#x27; languages&quot;), which are not necessarily identical to the spoken dialect of the town where the press was located. The most important centres of printing, with their regional are:
*West Central German: Frankfurt, Mainz, Worms, Cologne
*East Central German: Wittenberg, Erfurt, Leipzig
*Swabian: Augsburg, Ulm, Tübingen
*Alemannic: Basel, Strassburg, Zürich
*East Franconian: Nuremberg, Bamberg, Würzburg
*Austro-Bavarian: Ingolstadt, Vienna.

===Chancery languages===
While the language of the printers remained regional, the period saw the gradual development of two forms of German (one Upper German, one Central German), which were supra-regional: the (&quot;written languages&quot;, &quot;documentary languages&quot;) of the chanceries of the two main political centres.
* The (&quot;common German&quot;) of the Chancery of the Emperor Maximilian I and his successors in Prague and then Vienna.
* The East Central German of the Chancery of the Electorate of Saxony in Meissen
The language of these centres had influence well beyond their own territorial and dialect boundaries.

Emperor Maximilian&#x27;s chancery was the first concerted and successful effort to introduce a standardised form of German for all German chanceries, and hence avoided the most idiosyncratic features of Austrian Upper German standards in favour of Central German alternatives. Emperor Maximilian&#x27;s Prague Chancery and the Saxon Chancery used similar standards of German as they were bordering each other, both dialects originating from the linguistic admixture in the course of eastward German settlement. In addition, many Bohemians had fled to Saxony during the Hussite Wars, reinforcing the similarities between the dialects.

The influence of the Saxon Chancery was due in part to its adoption for his own published works by Martin Luther, who stated, &quot;&quot; (&quot;My language is based on that of the Saxon Chancery, which is followed by all the princes and kings in Germany&quot;).

He also recognized the standardising force of the two chanceries: &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Emperor Maximilian and Duke Frederick, Elector of Saxony etc., have drawn the languages of Germany together&quot;).

===Low German===
Middle Low German, spoken across the whole of Northern Germany north of the Benrath Line in the Middle Ages, was a distinct West Germanic language. From the start of the 16th century, however, High German came increasingly to be used in this area not only in writing but also in the pulpit and in schools. By the end of the ENHG period, Low German had almost completely ceased to be used in writing or in formal and public speech and had become the low-status variant in a diglossic situation, with High German as the high-status variant.

==Phonology and orthography==
For a number of reasons it is not possible to give a single phonological system for ENHG:
* dialectal variation
* the differing times at which individual dialects introduced even shared sound changes
* the lack of a prestige variant (such as the &quot;Dichtersprache&quot; provides for Middle High German)
Also, the difficulty of deriving phonological information from the complexity of ENHG orthography means that many reference works do not treat orthography and phonology separately for this period.

===Vowels===
The MHG vowel system undergoes significant changes in the transition to ENHG and their uneven geographical distribution has served to further differentiate the modern dialects.

====Diphthongization====

The long high vowels , and (spelt , and ) are diphthongized to , and , spelt , and . In many dialects they fall together with the original MHG diphthongs , and , which are all lowered.

Examples:
*MHG &quot;snîden&quot; (&quot;to cut&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;schneiden&quot;
*MHG &quot;hût&quot; (&quot;skin&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Haut&quot;
*MHG &quot;liute&quot; (&quot;people&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Leute&quot;.

This change started as early as the 12th century in Upper Bavarian, and only reached Moselle Franconian in the 16th century. It does not affect Alemannic (apart from Swabian) or Ripuarian dialects, which still retain the original long vowels. The map shows the distribution and chronology of this sound change. In Bavarian, the original diphthongs are monophthongized, avoiding a merger with the new diphthongs.

====Monophthongisation====
The MHG falling diphthongs , and (spelt , and ) are monophthongised, replacing the long high vowels lost in the diphthongisation. In the case of &gt; the MHG spelling is retained and in Modern German indicates the long vowel.

Examples:
*MHG &quot;liebe&quot; (&quot;love) &gt; NHG &quot;Liebe&quot; 
*MHG &quot;bruoder&quot; (&quot;brother&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Bruder&quot; 
*MHG &quot;brüeder&quot; (&quot;brothers&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Brüder&quot; 

This change, sometimes called the Central German Monophthongisation, affects mainly the Central German dialects, along with South Franconian and East Franconian. The other Upper German dialects largely retain the original diphthongs.

====Changes in vowel quantity====
There are two changes in vowel quantity in ENHG, the lengthening of short vowels and the shortening of long vowels. Both show wide variation between dialects but appear earlier and more completely in Central German dialects. Many individual words form exceptions to these changes, though the lengthening is carried out more consistently.

1. Lengthening: MHG short vowels in open syllables (that is, syllables that end in a vowel) tend to be lengthened in the ENHG period. This is not reflected directly in spelling, but it is the source of the Modern German spelling convention that a vowel ending a syllable is always long.

Examples:
*MHG &quot;sagen&quot; (&quot;to say&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;sagen&quot; 
*MHG &quot;übel&quot; (&quot;evil&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Übel&quot; 

2. Shortening: MHG long vowels tend to be shortened in the ENHG period before certain consonants (, and others) and before certain consonant combinations (, , and , , , followed by another consonant).

Examples:
*MHG &quot;hât&quot; (&quot;has&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;hat&quot;
*MHG &quot;dâhte&quot; (&quot;thought&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;dachte&quot;
*MHG &quot;lêrche&quot; (&quot;lark&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Lerche&quot;
*MHG &quot;jâmer&quot; (&quot;suffering&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Jammer&quot;
This shortening seems to have taken place later than the monophthongisation, since the long vowels which result from that change are often shortened.

Examples:
*MHG &quot;muoter&quot; (&quot;mother&quot; &gt; NHG &quot;Mutter&quot; (via )
*MHG &quot;lieht&quot; (&quot;light&quot; &gt; NHG &quot;Licht&quot; (via )

===Consonants===
The overall consonant system of German remains largely unchanged in the transition from MHG to Modern German. However, in many cases sounds changed in particular environments and therefore changed in distribution. Some of the more significant are the following. (In addition, there are many other changes in particular dialects or in particular words.)
#MHG had two sibilants, written / and /. The difference between these is uncertain, but in ENHG both fell together in . (The affricate , for which is also used, remained unchanged.)
#Before vowels this becomes voiced to , e.g. MHG &quot;sehen&quot; (&quot;to see&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;sehen&quot; .
#Initially before consonants becomes , indicated by the grapheme &lt;sch&gt;, e.g. MHG &quot;snîden&quot; (&quot;to cut&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;schneiden&quot; . Before and this is not indicated in spelling, e.g. MHG &quot;stein&quot; (&quot;stone&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Stein&quot; .
#In initial position the bilabial fricative becomes the labio-dental , though this is not reflected in any change in spelling, e.g. MHG &quot;wil&quot; (&quot;want to&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;will&quot; . In a few words, this also takes place between vowels, e.g. &quot;ewig&quot; (&quot;eternal&quot;).
#Otherwise it is either lost, e.g. MHG &quot;snėwes&quot; (&quot;of the snow&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Schnees&quot;, or forms a diphthong with a neighbouring vowel (e.g. MHG &quot;brâwe&quot; (&quot;brow&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;Braue&quot;.
#Medial is lost, though it remains in spelling to indicate the length of the preceding vowel, e.g. MHG &quot;sehen&quot; (&quot;to see&quot;) &gt; NHG &quot;sehen&quot; .

The loss of and the : contrast are the only structural changes to the consonant system.

==Morphology==
As with phonology, the range of variation between dialects and time periods makes it impossible to cite a unified morphology for ENHG.
The sound changes of the vowels had which brought consequent changes to
* verb conjugations
* further simplification of the noun declensions

==Syntax==
The following are the main syntactical developments in ENHG:
*Noun phrase
**Increasing complexity: in chancery documents noun phrases increasingly incorporate prepositional and participial phases, and this development spreads from there to other types of formal and official writing.
**Attributive genitive: the so-called &quot;Saxon genitive&quot;, in which the genitive phrase precedes the noun (e.g. &quot;der sunnen schein&quot;, literally &quot;of-the-sun shine&quot;) increasingly makes way for the now standard, post-nominal construction (e.g. &quot;der schein der sonne&quot;, literally &quot;the shine of the sun&quot;), though it remains the norm where the noun in the genitive is a proper noun (&quot;Marias Auto&quot;).
*Verb phrase
**Increasing complexity: more complex verbal constructions with participles and infinitives.
**Verb position: the positioning of verbal components characteristic of NHG (finite verb second in main clauses, first in subordinate clauses; non-finite verb forms in clause-final position) gradually becomes firmly established.
**Decline of the preterite: an earlier development in the spoken language (especially in Upper German), the replacement of simple preterite forms by perfect forms with an auxiliary verb and the past participle becomes increasingly common from the 17th century.
**Negation: double negation ceases to be acceptable as an intensified negation; the enclitic negative particle &quot;ne/en&quot; falls out of use and an adverb of negation (&quot;nicht&quot;, &quot;nie&quot;) becomes obligatory (e.g.MHG &quot;ine weiz (niht)&quot;, ENHG &quot;ich weiss nicht&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;).
*Case government
**Decline of the genitive: Verbs that take a genitive object increasingly replace this with an accusative object or a prepositional phrase. Prepositions that govern the genitive likewise tend to switch to the accusative.

==Literature==

The period saw the invention of printing with moveable type (c.1455) and the Reformation (from 1517). Both of these were significant contributors to the development of the Modern German Standard language, as they further promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area – even the illiterate, who were read &quot;to&quot;. The most important single text of the period was Luther&#x27;s Bible translation, the first part of which was published in 1522, though this is now not credited with the central role in creating the standard that was once attributed to it. This is also the first period in which prose works, both literary and discursive, became more numerous and more important than verse.

<text>Middle Low German is a developmental stage of Low German. It developed from the Old Saxon language in the Middle Ages and has been documented in writing since about 1225–34 (). During the Hanseatic period (from about 1300 to about 1600), Middle Low German was the leading written language in the north of Central Europe and served as a lingua franca in the northern half of Europe. It was used parallel to medieval Latin also for purposes of diplomacy and for deeds.

==Terminology==
While &quot;Middle Low German&quot; (MLG) is a scholarly term developed in hindsight, speakers in their time referred to the language mainly as (Saxon) or (the Saxon language). In contrast to Latin as the primary written language, speakers also referred to discourse in Saxon as speaking/writing , i.e. &#x27;clearly, intelligibly&#x27;. This contains the same root as &#x27;German&#x27; (cf., High German: , Dutch (ally &quot;N(i)ederduytsche&quot; to mean the contemporary version of the Dutch language) both from Proto-Germanic &quot;of the people&quot;; &#x27;popular, vernacular&#x27;) which could also be used for Low German if the context was clear. Compare also the modern colloquial term (from &#x27;plain, simple&#x27;) denoting Low (or West Central) German dialects in contrast to the written standard.

Another medieval term is (lit. &#x27;East-ish&#x27;) which was at first applied to the Hanseatic cities of the Baltic Sea (the &#x27;East Sea&#x27;), their territory being called (&#x27;East-land&#x27;), their inhabitants (&#x27;Eastlings&#x27;). This appellation was later expanded to other German Hanseatic cities and it was a general name for Hanseatic merchants in the Netherlands, e.g. in Bruges where they had their (office; see Kontor).

In the 16th century, the term (lit. &#x27;Lowland-ish, Netherlandish&#x27;) gained ground, contrasting Saxon with the German dialects in the uplands to the south. It became dominant in the High German dialects (as ENHG , which could also refer to the modern Netherlands), while remained the most widespread term within MLG. The equivalent of &#x27;Low German&#x27; (NHG ) seems to have been introduced later on by High German speakers and at first applied especially to Netherlanders.

&quot;Middle Low German&quot; is a modern term used with varying degrees of inclusivity. It is distinguished from Middle High German, spoken to the south, which was later replaced by Early New High German. Though Middle Dutch is today usually excluded from MLG (although very closely related), it is sometimes, especially in older literature, included in MLG, which then encompasses the dialect continuum of all high-medieval Continental Germanic dialects outside MHG, from Flanders in the West to the eastern Baltic.

==Extent==
Middle Low German covered a wider area than the Old Saxon language of the preceding period, due to expansion to the East and, to a lesser degree, to the North.

In the East, the MLG-speaking area expanded greatly as part of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; (settlement of the East) in the 12th to 14th century and came to include Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Pomerania and (Old) Prussia, which were hitherto dominated by Slavic and Baltic tribes. Some pockets of these native peoples persisted for quite some time, e.g. the &quot;Wends&quot; along the lower Elbe until about 1700 or the Kashubians of Eastern Pomerania up to modern times.

In the North, the Frisian-speaking areas along the North Sea diminished in favour of Saxon, esp. in East Frisia which largely switched to MLG since the mid-14th century. North of the Elbe, MLG advanced slowly into Sleswick, against Danish and North Frisian, although the whole region was ruled by Denmark. MLG exerted a huge influence upon Scandinavia (cf. &quot;History&quot;), even if native speakers of Low German were mostly confined to the cities where they formed colonies of merchants and craftsmen. It was an official language of Old Livonia, whose population consisted mostly of Baltic and Finnic tribes.

In the West, at the Zuiderzee, the forests of the Veluwe and close to the Lower Rhine, MLG bordered on closely related Low Franconian dialects whose written language was mainly Middle Dutch. In earlier times, these were sometimes included in the modern definition of MLG (cf. &quot;Terminology&quot;).

In the South, MLG bordered on High German dialects roughly along the northern borders of Hesse and Thuringia. The language border then ran eastwards across the plain of the middle Elbe until it met the (then more extensive) Sorb-speaking area along the upper Spree that separated it from High German. The border was never a sharp one, rather a continuum. The modern convention is to use the pronunciation of northern &quot;maken&quot; vs. southern &quot;machen&quot; (&#x27;to make&#x27;) for determining an exact border. Along the middle Elbe and lower Saale rivers, Low German began to retreat in favour of High German dialects already during Late Medieval times (cf. &quot;Wittenberg&quot; whose name is Low German but whose inhabitants already spoke mostly/exclusively High German when the Reformation set in).
==History==
Sub-periods of Middle Low German are:

* Early Middle Low German (Standard High German: ): 1200–1350, or 1200–1370
* Classical Middle Low German (): 1350–1500, or 1370–1530
* Late Middle Low German (): 1500–1600, or 1530–1650

Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, spoken all around the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It used to be thought that the language of Lübeck was dominant enough to become a normative standard (the so-called ) for an emergent spoken and written standard, but more recent work has established that there is no evidence for this and that Middle Low German was non-standardised.

Middle Low German provided a large number of loanwords to languages spoken around the Baltic Sea as a result of the activities of Hanseatic traders. Its traces can be seen in the Scandinavian, Finnic, and Baltic languages, as well as Standard High German and English. It is considered the largest single source of loanwords in Danish, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Swedish.

Beginning in the 15th century, Middle Low German fell out of favour compared to Early Modern High German, which was first used by elites as a written and, later, a spoken language. Reasons for this loss of prestige include the decline of the Hanseatic League, followed by political heteronomy of northern Germany and the cultural predominance of central and southern Germany during the Protestant Reformation and Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible.

==Phonology and orthography==
The description is based on Lasch (1914) which continues to be the authoritative comprehensive grammar of the language but is not necessarily up-to-date in every detail.

===Consonants===

* Square brackets indicate allophones.
* Round brackets indicate phonemes that do not have phoneme status in the whole language area or are marginal in the phonological system.

It is not rare to find the same word in MLG affected by one of the following phonological processes in one text and unaffected by it in another text because the lack of a written standard, the dialectal variation and ongoing linguistic change during the Middle Low German (MLG) era.

General notes
* Final devoicing: Voiced obstruents in the syllable coda are devoiced, e.g. &quot;geven&quot; (to give) but &quot;gift&quot; (gift). The change took place early in MLG but is not always represented in writing. Proclitic words like &quot;mid&quot; (with) might remain voiced before a vowel because they are perceived as one phonological unit with the following word. Also, as can already be seen in Old Saxon, lenited is devoiced to before syllabic nasals or liquids, e.g. &quot;gaffel&quot; (fork) from PG &quot;*gabalō&quot;.
* Grammatischer Wechsel: Because of sound changes in Proto-Germanic (cf. Verner&#x27;s law), some words had different sounds in different grammatical forms. In MLG, there were only fossilised remnants of the &quot;grammatischer wechsel&quot; (grammatical change), namely for and , e.g. &quot;kêsen&quot; (to choose) but &quot;koren&quot; ((they) chose), and for and , e.g. &quot;vân&quot; &lt; PG &quot;*fanhaną&quot; (to take hold, to catch) but &quot;gevangen&quot; &lt; PG &quot;*fanganaz&quot; (taken hold of, caught).
* Assimilation: A sound becoming more similar to a (usually) neighbouring sound, usually in place or manner of articulation, is very common across all languages. Early MLG did mark assimilation much more often in writing than later periods, e.g. &quot;vamme&quot; instead of &quot;van deme&quot; (of the).
* Dissimilation: In MLG, it frequently happened with vs. or vs. , e.g. &quot;balbêrer&quot; &lt; &quot;barbêrer&quot; (barber), or &quot;knuflôk&quot; &lt; &quot;kluflôk&quot; (garlic). Both forms frequently co-existed. The complete loss of a sound in proximity to an identical sound can also be explained in such a way, e.g. the loss of in &quot;Willem&quot; (William) &lt; &quot;Wilhelm&quot;.
* Metathesis: Some sounds tended to switch their places, especially the &quot;liquids&quot; and . Both forms may co-exist, e.g. &quot;brennen&quot; vs. (metathesised) &quot;bernen&quot; (to burn).
* Gemination: In MLG, geminate consonants, which came into being by assimilation or syncope, were no longer pronounced as such. Instead, geminate spelling marks the preceding vowel as short. Many variants exist, like combinations of voiced and voiceless consonants (e.g. letters, Sundays). Late MLG tended to use clusters of similar consonants after short as well as long vowels for no apparent reason, e.g. for (time).
* h spellings: A mute &quot;h&quot; appeared sporadically after consonants already in Old Saxon. Its use greatly increased in MLG, first at the end of a word, when it often marked the preceding vowel as long, but it later appears largely randomly. In very late times, the use of &quot;h&quot; directly after the vowel is sometimes adopted from Modern High German as a sign of vowel length.

Specific notes on nasals
(Indented notes refer to orthography.)

* had a tendency to shift to in the coda, e.g. &quot;dem&quot; &gt; &quot;den&quot; (the (dat.sg.m.)).
** Intervocalic is sometimes spelled &quot;mb&quot; whether or not it developed from Old Saxon .
* assimilated to before velars and .
* Final often dropped out in unstressed position before consonants, e.g., (we have), cf. Modern Dutch for a similar process. Similarly, it often dropped from -clusters after unstressed vowels, especially in Westphalian, e.g. &quot;jârlix&quot; (annually) &lt; &quot;jârlings&quot;.
* Furthermore, had been deleted in certain coda positions several centuries earlier (the so-called Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law), but there were many exceptions and restorations through analogy: the shifted form &quot;gôs&quot; (goose &lt; PG &quot;*gans&quot;) with an unshifted plural &quot;gense&quot; (geese) was quite common. Non-shifted forms have been common in the more innovative Eastern dialects.

Specific notes on stops and fricatives
* as a stop is always word-initially (&quot;blôme&quot; flower, bloom), at the onset of stressed syllables (&quot;barbêrer&quot; barber) and (historically) geminated (&quot;ebbe&quot; ebb, low tide). Its allophones in other cases are word-internal and word-final (e.g. &quot;drêven&quot; to drive, vs. &quot;drêf&quot; drive (n.)).
* Voiceless usually appeared word-initially (e.g. &quot;vader&quot; father), word-finally (merged with historical , see above), otherwise between short vowels and nasals/liquids (also from historical , e.g. &quot;gaffel&quot; fork) and in loans (e.g. &quot;straffen&quot; to tighten, from High German).
** It was mostly written &quot;v&quot; in the syllable onset, in the coda. Exceptions include loans (&quot;figûre&quot;), some proper names (&quot;Frederik&quot;), cases like &quot;gaffel&quot; as mentioned earlier and sporadically before &quot;u&quot; (where &quot;v&quot; would be too similar graphically) and before &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot;. Sometimes, &quot;w&quot; is used for &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;ph&quot; for &quot;f&quot;. 
** In MLG (like in other medieval) texts, there is usually no clear graphic distinction between &quot;v&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. The distinction between both (consonant value as &quot;v&quot;, vocalic value as &quot;u&quot;) is used in modern dictionaries, in grammars and in this article simply for better readability. Thus, in the manuscripts, e.g. &quot;auer&quot; is &quot;aver&quot; (but).
* was originally an approximant but seems to have later shifted towards a fricative. Its exact articulation likely differed from dialect to dialect, and many of them merged word-internally with , an allophone of .
** In writing, &quot;w&quot; for word-internal was kept strictly separate from at first, but the use of &quot;w&quot; later also expanded to .
** The clusters , , , were originally often written with &quot;v&quot;/&quot;u&quot; (&quot;svager&quot; brother-in-law) but later mostly shifted to a &quot;w&quot;-spelling, except for , which kept &quot;qu&quot; from Latin influence.
* The dentals and tended to drop out between unstressed vowels, e.g. &quot;antwēr&quot; (either) instead of &quot;antwēder&quot;, and in word-final clusters like , or , e.g. often &quot;rech&quot; next to &quot;recht&quot; (law, right), &quot;schrîf&quot; next to &quot;schrîft&quot; ((he/she) writes).
* Remnants of Old Saxon shifted via into in the early MLG era. After and , it was the case already in late Old Saxon. For , word-final and some frequent words like &quot;dat&quot; (that, the (neut.)), the change also happened very early. The changes happened earliest in Westphalian and latest in North Low Saxon.
* was voiced intervocalically as . Whether it was voiced word-initially is not fully clear. There seems to have been dialectal variation, with voiceless more likely for Westphalian and voiced more likely for East Elbian dialects.
** Because of the variation, voiceless (for example in loans from Romance or Slavic) was often written &quot;tz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot;, &quot;c&quot; etc. for clarity.
* The phonemic status of is difficult to determine because of the extremely irregular orthography. Its status likely differed between the dialects, with early MLG having (Westphalian keeping it until modern times) and no phonemic , and e.g. East Elbian and in general many later dialects had from earlier . If there is phonemic , it often replaces in clusters like and .
* Connected with the status of is the manner of articulation of . Orthographic variants and some modern dialects seem to point to a more retracted, more &quot;sh&quot;-like pronunciation (perhaps ), especially if there was no need to distinguish and . This is consistent with modern Westphalian.
* is at best a marginal role as a phoneme and appears in loans or develops because of compounding or epenthesis. Note the palatalised (next point).
** In writing, it was often marked by copious clustering, e.g. &quot;ertzcebischope&quot; (archbishop).
* before front vowels is strongly palatalised in Old Saxon (note the similar situation in the closely related Old English) and at least some of early MLG, as can be seen from spellings like &quot;zint&quot; for &quot;kint&quot; (child) and the variation of placename spellings, especially in Nordalbingian and Eastphalian, e.g. &quot;Tzellingehusen&quot; for modern &quot;Kellinghusen&quot;. The palatalisation, perhaps as or , persisted until the High Middle Ages but was later mostly reversed. Thus, for instance, the old affricate in the Slavic placename &quot;Liubici&quot; could be reinterpreted as a velar stop, giving the modern name &quot;Lübeck&quot;. A few words and placenames completely palatalised and shifted their velar into a sibilant (&quot;sever&quot; beetle, chafer, from PG &quot;*kebrô&quot;; the city of &quot;Celle&quot; &lt; Old Saxon &quot;Kiellu&quot;).
** Early MLG frequently used &quot;c&quot; for (&quot;cleyn&quot; small), which later became rarer. However, geminate &quot;k&quot; (after historically short vowels and consonants) continued to be written &quot;ck&quot; (e.g. &quot;klocke&quot; bell), more rarely &quot;kk&quot; or &quot;gk&quot;. 
** &quot;gk&quot; otherwise appeared often after nasal (&quot;ringk&quot; ring, (ice) rink). 
** was often written &quot;x&quot;, especially in the West. 
** usually appeared as &quot;qu&quot;, under Latin influence (&quot;quêmen&quot; to come).
* Furthermore, after unstressed , often changed into , e.g. in the frequent derivational suffix &quot;-lik&quot; (&quot;vrüntligen&quot; friendly (infl.)) or, with final devoicing, in &quot;sich&quot; instead of &quot;sik&quot; (him-/her-/itself, themselves).
** Sometimes, &quot;ch&quot; was used for a syllable-final (&quot;ôch&quot; also, too). The &quot;h&quot; can be seen a sign of lengthening of the preceding vowel, not of spirantisation (see &quot;&quot;h&quot;-spelling&quot; below).
* was a fricative. Its exact articulation probably differed by dialect. Broadly, there seem to have been dialects that distinguished a voiced palatal and a voiced velar , depending on surrounding vowels (: word-initially before front vowels, word-internally after front vowels; in those positions, but with back vowels), and dialects that always used word-initially and word-internally (Eastphalian, Brandenburgian, e.g. word-internally after a back vowel: vogt, reeve). Nevertheless, was kept separate from old . In the coda position, became a dorsal fricative (palatal or velar , depending on the preceding sound), thus merging with .
** The spelling &quot;gh&quot; was at first used almost exclusively before &quot;e&quot; or word-finally but began to spread to other positions, notably before &quot;i&quot;. It did not indicate a different pronunciation but was part of an orthographic pattern seen in many other parts of Europe. Furthermore, in early western traditions of MLG, sometimes &quot;ch&quot; was used for in all positions, even word-initially.
** Coda was mostly spelled &quot;ch&quot; because it completely merged with historic (see below).
* After nasals and as a geminate, appeared as a stop , e.g. &quot;seggen&quot; &quot;to say&quot;, &quot;penninghe&quot; &quot;pennies&quot;. In contrast to modern varieties, it remained audible after a nasal. Pronouncing &quot;g&quot; word-initially as a stop is likely a comparatively recent innovation under High German influence.
** could be used for in older MLG, e.g. &quot;Dudiggerode&quot; for the town of Düringerode.
* was frequently dropped between sonorants (except after nasals), e.g. &quot;bormêster&quot; (burgomaster, mayor) &lt; &quot;borgermêster&quot;.
* was often epenthetised between a stressed and an unstressed vowel, e.g. &quot;neigen&quot; (to sew) &lt; Old Saxon &quot;*nāian&quot;, or &quot;vrûghe&quot; (lady, woman) &lt; Old Saxon &quot;frūa&quot;. In Westphalian, this sound could harden into [g], e.g. &quot;eggere&quot; (eggs).
* in the onset was a glottal fricative , and it merged with historic in the coda (see above). Word-final after consonant or long vowel was frequently dropped, e.g. &quot;hôch&quot; or &quot;hô&quot; (high). In a compound or phrase, it often became silent (&quot;Willem&quot; &lt; &quot;Wilhelm&quot; William).
** Onset was written &quot;h&quot;, while coda = was mostly written &quot;ch&quot; but also and the like because of its merger with .
* Coda = frequently dropped between and , e.g. &quot;Engelbert&quot; (a first name) with the common component &quot;-bert&quot; &lt; Old Saxon (bright, famous). In unstressed syllables, it could also occur between a vowel and , e.g. &quot;nit&quot; (not) &lt; Old Saxon &quot;niowiht&quot; (not a thing).
** Often, &quot;h&quot; was used for other purposes than its actual sound value: to mark vowel length (see &quot;h&quot;-spelling under &quot;General Notes&quot; above), to &quot;strengthen&quot; short words (&quot;ghân&quot; to go), to mark a vocalic onset ( our (infl.)) or vowel hiatus (&quot;sêhes&quot; (of the) lake).

Specific notes on approximants
* was a palatal approximant and remained separate from , the palatal allophone of .
** It was often spelled &quot;g&quot; before front vowels and was not confused with &quot;gh&quot; = . The variant &quot;y&quot; was sometimes used (&quot;yöget&quot; youth). 
* was likely an alveolar trill or flap , like in most traditional Low German dialects until recently. Post-vocalic sometimes dropped, especially before . 
* was originally probably velarised, i.e. a &quot;dark l&quot; , at least in the coda, judging from its influence on surrounding vowels, but it was never extensively vocalised as Dutch was. During the MLG era, it seems to have shifted to a &quot;clear l&quot; in many dialects and tended to be dropped in some usually unstressed words, especially in Westphalian, e.g., , instead of (as).

===Vowels===
Modern renderings of MLG (like this article) often use circumflex or macron to mark vowel length (e.g. &quot;â&quot; or &quot;ā&quot;) to help the modern reader, but original MLG texts marked vowel length not by accents but by doubling vowels, by adding a lengthening &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, by doubling the following consonants (after short vowels) or by adding &quot;h&quot; after the following consonants.

==Dialects==
Lasch distinguished the following large dialect groups, emphasising that she based it strictly on the orthography, which may often omit strongly dialectal phenomena in favour of more prestigious/&quot;standard&quot; forms. Nevertheless, the dialect groups broadly correspond with modern ones.

Westphalian (HG: &quot;Westfälisch&quot;, Dutch: &quot;Westfaals&quot;): Broadly speaking, the area between the middle Weser and lower Rhine. Main cities: Münster, Paderborn, Dortmund, Bielefeld, Osnabrück. Some Saxon dialects in the modern Netherlands (esp. modern Gelderland and Overijssel) belonged to this group. Dutch influence on them strongly increased since the 15th century.

&quot;Some features&quot;: In the West, strong influence from Low Franconian orthographic patterns (e.g. &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot; as a sign of length, like &quot;oi&quot; = ). The &quot;breaking&quot; of old short vowels in open syllables and before was often marked in writing (e.g. &quot;karn&quot; instead of &quot;korn&quot;). Old geminated and sometimes was hardened into ; frequently shifted to (sometimes reversed in writing); instead of (&quot;sal&quot; vs &quot;schal&quot;). The native present plural verbs was &quot;-et&quot; but the written norm often impressed &quot;-en&quot;. Similarly, the participle prefix &quot;ge-&quot; was usually written, though probably only spoken in the Southwest. Lexically, strong connections with adjacent dialects further north (East Frisian and Oldenburgish), e.g. (&#x27;Wednesday&#x27;) instead of . Westphalian was and is often thought to be altogether the most conservative dialect group.

North Low Saxon (HG: &quot;Nordniedersächsisch&quot;, Dutch: &quot;Noord-Nedersaksisch&quot;): Spoken in a long stretch of coastal regions from the Zuiderzee in the West to East Prussia in the East. Its orthographic habits come closest to what was traditionally perceived as a MLG standard (the &quot;Lübeck standard&quot;, nowadays disputed).

Some features: Short and in open syllables are stretched into a -like vowel. The personal suffixes &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-ald&quot; appear as &quot;-ar&quot; and &quot;-old&quot;. The pronouns &quot;mî&quot; (1.sg.), &quot;dî&quot; (2.sg.) and &quot;jû&quot; (2.pl.) are used for both dative and accusative.

Three subgroups can be distinguished:

(1) &quot;East Frisian and Oldenburgish&quot;, i.e. the areas west of the lower Weser, in the North including dialects on Frisian substrate. As can be expected, there is much Westphalian, Dutch and Frisian influence (&quot;hem&quot; next to &quot;em&quot; &#x27;him&#x27;; plurals in &quot;-s&quot;; &quot;vrent&quot; next to &quot;vrünt&quot; &#x27;friend&#x27;).

(2) &quot;Nordalbingian&quot;, between the lower Weser and the lower Elbe, and also Holstein on the right bank of the lower Elbe. main towns: Hamburg, Bremen, Lunenburg, Kiel.

(3) &quot;East Elbian&quot;, including Lübeck and the areas further east, like Mecklenburg, Pomerania, northern Brandenburg (Prignitz, Uckermark, Altmark), Old Prussia, Livonia. Very close to &quot;Nordalbingian&quot;. While the Eastern dialects are today clearly distinguished from the West by their uniform present plural verb ending in &quot;-en&quot; (against Western uniform ), in MLG times, both endings competed against each other in West and East. Main towns: Lübeck, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund. High German influence was strong in the Teutonic Order, due to the diverse regional origins of its chivalric elite, therefore MLG written culture was neglected early on.

Eastphalian (HG: &quot;Ostfälisch&quot;): Roughly the area east of the middle Weser, north and partly west of the Harz mountains, reaching the middle Elbe, but leaving out the Altmark region. In the north, the sparsely populated Lunenburg Heath forms something of a natural border. Main cities: Hanover, Hildesheim, Brunswick, Goslar, Göttingen, Magdeburg, Halle (early times). The area within the Elbe&#x27;s drainage was established by colonisation and is in many ways special. The southern part of this &quot;Elbe Eastphalian&quot; (HG: &quot;Elbostfälisch&quot;) area switched to High German already in Late Medieval times.

&quot;Some features&quot;: Umlaut is more productive, occurring before &quot;-ich&quot; and &quot;-isch&quot; (e.g. &#x27;Saxon, Low German&#x27;) and shifting also &quot;e&quot; to &quot;i&quot; (e.g. &quot;stidde&quot; for &quot;stêde&quot; &#x27;place&#x27;). Diphthongised short is rarely marked as such, contrary to other dialects. Before , &quot;e&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are frequently interchanged for each other. Unstressed &quot;o&quot; (as in the suffix &quot;-schop&quot;) frequently changes into &quot;u&quot; (&quot;-schup&quot;). The modal verb for &#x27;shall/should&#x27; features , not (i.e. &quot;schal&quot;). The past participle&#x27;s prefix was commonly spoken &quot;e-&quot; but mostly written &quot;ge-&quot; under prescriptive influence. The local form &quot;ek&quot; (&#x27;I&#x27; (pron. 1.sg.)) competed with &quot;standard&quot; &quot;ik&quot;; in a similar way the oblique form &quot;mik&quot; (&#x27;me&#x27;) with &quot;standard&quot; &quot;mî&quot;. Unusually, there is also a dative pronoun (1.sg. &quot;mê&quot;). Lexically, close connections with Nordalbingian. Unusual plural &quot;menne&quot; (&#x27;men&#x27;).

(South) Brandenburgish (HG: &quot;(Süd-)Brandenburgisch&quot;) and &quot;East Anhaltish&quot; (HG: &quot;Ostanhaltisch&quot;): Roughly between the middle Elbe and the middle Oder, and along the middle Havel, bordering old Sorbian territory to the Southeast. Main cities: Berlin, Frankfurt/Oder, Zerbst. A colonial dialect strongly influenced by settlers speaking Low Franconian. Also strongly influenced by High German early on.

&quot;Some features&quot;: Old long &quot;ê&quot; and &quot;ô&quot; were diphthongised into and , written &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. Old Germanic coda is restored, contrary to Ingvaeonic sound changes, e.g. &quot;gans&quot; &#x27;goose&#x27;. Present plural of verbs features the suffix &quot;-en&quot;. Lack of negative determiner &quot;nên&quot; (&#x27;no&#x27; (attr.)), instead: &quot;keyn&quot;, similar to High German. The past participle retains the prefix &quot;ge-&quot;. Lack of &quot;gaderen&quot; (&#x27;to gather&#x27;) and &quot;tőgen&quot; (&#x27;to show&#x27;); instead of them, forms close to High German, i.e. and .

<text>The Chevrolet Capriceis a full-size car produced by Chevrolet in North America for the 1965 through 1996 model years. Full-size Chevrolet sales peaked in 1965, with over a million units sold. It was the most popular car in the U.S. in the 1960s and early 1970s, which, during its production, included the Biscayne, Bel Air, and Impala.

Introduced in mid-1965 as a luxury trim package for the Impala four-door hardtop, Chevrolet offered a full line of Caprice models for the 1966 and subsequent model years, including a &quot;formal hardtop&quot; coupe and an Estate station wagon. The 1971 through 1976 models are the largest Chevrolets built. The downsized 1977 and restyled 1991 models were awarded &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year. Production ended in 1996.

From 2011 until 2017, the Caprice nameplate returned to North America as a full-size, rear wheel drive police vehicle, a captive import from Australia, built by General Motors&#x27;s subsidiary Holden. The police vehicle is a rebadged version of the Holden WM/WN Caprice. The nameplate also had a civilian and police presence in the Middle East from 1999 until 2017, where the imported Holden Statesman/Caprice built by Holden was marketed as the Chevrolet Caprice in markets such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

== Early history ==
There are differing accounts of the origin of the Caprice name. One states that it was coined by Bob Lund, Chevrolet&#x27;s General Sales Manager, after a classy restaurant he frequented in New York City. Another says the car was named after Caprice Chapman, the daughter of auto executive James P. Chapman.

A &quot;Caprice Custom Sedan&quot; option package (RPO Z18) was offered on the 1965 Chevrolet Impala 4-door hardtop, adding to the price tag. The Caprice option included a heavier frame, suspension changes, black-accented front grille and rear trim panel with Caprice nameplate, slender body sill moldings, Fleur-de-lis roof quarter emblems, color-keyed bodyside stripes and Caprice hood and dash emblems. Full wheel covers were the same as that year&#x27;s Super Sport, but a Chevy bowtie emblem replaced the &quot;SS&quot; emblem in the spinner&#x27;s center. The Super Sport&#x27;s blackout rear trim panel was also used, but without the &quot;Impala SS&quot; nameplate. The interior featured a higher-grade cloth and vinyl seat and door trim (as well as thicker, higher-grade carpeting), faux walnut trim on the dashboard and door panels, pull straps on the doors, and extra convenience lights. A full vinyl roof was optional. A , V8 engine was standard, as was a column-mounted shifter for the three-speed manual transmission.

The Caprice was intended to compete with the Ford LTD, Plymouth VIP, and AMC&#x27;s Ambassador DPL. These models included luxuriously upholstered interiors with simulated wood dashboard and door-panel trim, thicker carpeting, sound insulation, courtesy lighting, and more upscale exterior trims.

== First generation (1966–1970) ==
=== 1966 ===

Caprice gained series status for the 1966 model year and was positioned as the top-line full-size Chevrolet. It included a four-door hardtop, six- or nine-passenger station wagon, and a two-door hardtop with a squared-off formal roofline in contrast to the Impala/SS Sport Coupe&#x27;s fastback roof styling. All four Caprice models were marketed as &quot;Caprice Custom.&quot;

The Caprice Custom Estate, a new station wagon model with simulated woodgrain exterior trim was the first Chevrolet with such a design since its real woodie wagon was offered in 1954 on the Chevrolet Bel Air. All wagons included an all-vinyl upholstered two-row bench seat interior with an optional third rear-facing seat for two. The Custom Estate became the full-sized station wagon when the Buick LeSabre Estate was discontinued in 1964. The V8 engine was standard for Caprice models with the &quot;Turbo Jet&quot; V8 optional. It was possible to have Regular Production Option (RPO) L72, a 425-hp big block V8 with solid lifters, special camshaft and carburetor, and 11 to 1 compression. An automatic transmission, power steering, white sidewall tires, and a vinyl top (on the hardtops) were extra-cost options, but most were built with them. Additionally, air conditioning, power windows, Cruise-Master speed control, power seats, an automatic headlight dimmer (1965 only) and stereo radios were available. The standard transmission was a Synchro-Mesh three-speed manual, mounted on the steering column. It remained standard throughout this generation.

The 1966 Caprice featured a revised grille and front bumper, and new rectangular taillights which replaced the Chevrolet-traditional triple round taillights used on Impalas since 1958, with the exception of the 1959 model. Lenses and silver trim on Caprices differed slightly from the other full-sized models. Sedans and coupe models included luxurious cloth and vinyl bench seats with a folding center armrest in the rear seat. Optional on both was a &quot;Strato bench&quot; seat which combined bucket-style seat backs and a center armrest with a bench cushion for six-passenger seating. Caprices had unique standard wheel covers, although some of the optional wheels and wheel covers on full-sized models were optional.

New options included the &quot;Comfortron&quot; air conditioning system where the driver could set a constant year-round temperature. A &quot;Tilt/Telescopic&quot; steering wheel option could be adjusted vertically in six positions, as well as be telescoped farther out from the steering column. Coupes could also be ordered with an all-vinyl interior featuring Strato bucket seats and center console with floor shifter, storage compartment, courtesy lighting, and full instrumentation at the front end of the console that was integrated with the lower instrument panel.

The 1965-70 GM B platform is the fourth best-selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T, and the Lada Riva.

=== 1967–1968 ===
The 1967 Caprice received a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, as well as a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillamp lenses were all red as the backup lamps were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps in the center of the taillamps. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the and V8s was now optional with the Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.

The &quot;100 millionth GM car&quot; was a light blue metallic 1967 Caprice coupe. It was assembled on April 21, 1967, at the Janesville, Wisconsin plant. It was actually the 100 millionth GM car built in the United States; production including Canadian plants had actually passed the 100 million mark in March 1966, with an Oldsmobile Toronado being the car in question.

The 1968 Caprice received a minor facelift that included a new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, and the removal of vent (wing) windows. Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lamps which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lamps on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the lamp itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. The Caprice Coupe got serious competition when Chevrolet offered the car&#x27;s formal roofline in the Impala series as well. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new Turbo Fire V8 rated at replaced the small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lamps. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.
=== 1969–1970 ===
The 1969 Caprice and other full-sized Chevrolets were restyled with new body lines and front bumpers that wrapped around the grille (again with optional concealed headlamps, for which washers could be added as a new &quot;one year only&quot; option) along with ventless front windows on all models. The wheelbase, inner bodyshell and framework were carried over from the 1965 model. The station wagon was renamed the Kingswood Estate and continued to use exterior wood grain trim along with the interior trim of the Caprice sedans and coupes. Front seat headrests were now standard equipment to meet federal safety standards and the ignition switch moved from the dashboard to the steering column and also locked the steering wheel when the key was removed. This was part of a Federal mandate for the 1970 models, but introduced a year earlier on all General Motors cars except the Corvair.

The 1969 Caprice also offered a new GM-designed variable-ratio power steering unit as optional equipment along with a seldom-ordered &quot;Liquid Tire Chain&quot; option, which was a vacuum activated button that would spray ice melt on the rear tires (UPC option code is &quot;V75&quot;). The standard engine was enlarged to a V8 with optional engine choices including a new Turbo Fire V8 in 255 or versions, a cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8, as well as a cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8s rated at or . All V8 engines were now available with the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission for the first time though the two-speed Powerglide was still offered with the 327 and 350 V8s.

The 1970 Caprice received a minor facelift featuring a more conventional under the grille bumper replacing the wrap-around unit used in 1969, along with new triple vertical taillamps in the rear bumper. Power front disc brakes and fiberglass-belted tires on wheels were made standard equipment along with a 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8. Optional V8s included a 350 and a new Turbo Fire V8. The top engine was a new Turbo Jet V8 offered in or versions. Both the 250- and Turbo Fire engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the 350 Turbo Fire and both 454 Turbo Jet engines required premium fuel. A three-speed manual transmission with column shift was standard equipment as in previous years but the floor-mounted four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list for 1970 as were the Strato bucket seats and center console previously offered on coupes. Automatic transmission options included the two-speed Powerglide on 350 V8s and Turbo Hydra-Matic with all engines.
== Second generation (1971–1976) ==
=== 1971–1972 ===
For 1971 the top-of-the-line Caprice was completely redesigned on a longer wheelbase and featured bold, Chrysler-like fuselage styling. Flush exterior door handles and double-shell roofs were new on the Caprice – both features first appearing on the 1970½ Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. The new styling was highlighted by a Cadillac-like &quot;egg-crate&quot; grille with a &quot;Caprice&quot; emblem in the center and brushed metal trim surrounding the taillights on the rear deck. The &quot;Full-Perimeter&quot; frame and all-coil suspension were refined for improvements in ride and noise reduction.

Inside were revised interiors featuring a two-spoke cushioned steering wheel and new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer and instrument placement similar to previous full-sized Chevrolets. Caprices continued with higher grade interiors than their Impala counterparts with luxurious cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, wood grain trim on the dash, steering wheel, and door panels as well as carpeting on lower door panels on both sedans and coupes. A center front seat armrest was also featured on sedans.

Station wagons now used a unique wheelbase and were larger than ever before. Station wagons continued to use unique model names. The Kingswood Estate wagon was considered to be equivalent to the Chevrolet Caprice being the top-level wagon. Unlike previous years, station wagons used unique rear suspension using a solid axle with leaf springs as opposed to coil springs and trailing arms on sedans and coupes.

Wagons featured a &quot;clamshell&quot; design marketed as the &quot;Glide-away&quot; tailgate, also called a &quot;disappearing&quot; tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate. The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years. Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat — and could accommodate a sheet of building material with rear seats folded. The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without the impediment of a door — for example, in a closed garage.

The Kingswood Estate had the two-barrel engine as standard with the same engine options as the coupes and sedans. Station wagon models came only with single exhaust systems which meant lesser power ratings than coupes and sedans.

Power front disc brakes were standard equipment, along with a larger gross ( net) 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8. This engine, along with all optional power plants, was designed to run on regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline of 91 research octane or higher. To achieve this, all engines had the compression ratios lowered to 8.5:1. General Motors was the first of the big three to have all engines run on regular fuel and these changes were made to help meet the increasingly stringent emission regulations that were to come into place in years to come.

Optional engines included 300 horsepower (206 net) 402 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8 (marketed as &quot;Turbo Jet 400 on full-size cars, and as &quot;Turbo Jet 396 on intermediate cars) and gross ( net) 454 Turbo Jet V8 which came standard with dual exhaust. When equipped with dual exhaust, the 400 Turbo Jet was rated at . At year&#x27;s beginning, a three-speed manual transmission was standard when the model was introduced in the fall of 1970, although at mid-year, the Turbo Hydramatic transmission and variable-ratio power steering became standard equipment on all Caprice models and lower-line models fitted with a V8 engine.

Chevrolet specifications included both &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;net&quot; horsepower figures in 1971, which was a year before the industry-wide transition to SAE net horsepower figures. SAE net horsepower standardized horsepower ratings in accord with SAE standard J1349 figures to get a more accurate horsepower figure. &quot;Net&quot; horsepower was measured &quot;as installed&quot; in a vehicle with power using accessories and emission equipment installed, exhaust systems, and air cleaners, leading to lower power ratings. For 1971, the 400 Turbo-Jet engine was rated at 300 gross horsepower with and without dual exhaust, while the more accurate net figures show it rated at with a single exhaust and 260 with dual exhaust. Beginning in 1972, automakers would follow SAE standard J1349 and the &quot;net&quot; horsepower ratings were the only advertised ratings.

In its May 1971 issue, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine published a comparison road test that included a Caprice Coupe and a Cadillac Sedan de Ville. The tested Caprice was powered by the 454 V8 and loaded with virtually all available options. Though testers noted that the Cadillac had a higher level of quality than the Chevrolet along with a far more luxurious interior (the DeVille was upholstered in leather while the Caprice had the standard cloth trim), the magazine ultimately considered the Chevy as the better value at $5,550 compared to the Cadillac&#x27;s $9,081 price mainly due to the fact the $3,500 price difference bought only a modest-quality addition and a few more luxury features.


The 1972 Caprice received a facelift with a revised grille that was lower in height than the &#x27;71 model flanked by a new bumper with increased protection one year ahead of the Federal mandate. This was done by a bumper within the bumper design. Heavy gauge beams reinforced the bumper and attached to the frame. The rear bumper also featured this design and now had the triple taillights now mounted in the bumper. Engine offerings were carried over from 1971 with the switch to &quot;net&quot; horsepower ratings including for the standard two-barrel Turbo Fire V8, ( with optional dual exhaust) for the four-barrel Turbo Jet 400 big-block V8 and for the four-barrel dual exhaust Turbo Jet V8 (rated at in wagons with single exhaust). Turbo Hydramatic transmission, variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes continued as standard equipment. New to the Caprice lineup was a pillared four-door sedan. All models also featured a revised &quot;Astro Ventilation&quot; system utilizing vents in the doorjambs that replaced the troublesome 1971 version that used vents in the trunk lid and turned out to be a major source of complaints to Chevy (and other GM divisions) dealers from customers. 6-way power seats, 8-track tape players, and air conditioning were optional.
=== 1973–1974 ===

The Caprice models were renamed to Caprice Classic for the 1973 model year. The Kingswood Estate model with simulated wood-grain body side trim was now named the Caprice Estate. The convertible was moved from the Impala to the Caprice lineup for the first time in 1973.

The 1973 facelift included a new cross-hatch grille, energy-absorbing front bumper and revised square taillights, again mounted in the bumper. New emission standards added EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) valves to engines (with a new roller camshaft), and horsepower ratings were reduced. The standard Turbo-Fire two-barrel was now rated at while the only optional engine was the Turbo-Jet V8 produced with dual exhaust with single exhaust used in station wagons. A new option on sedans and coupes was a 50/50 bench seat with recliner on the passenger side. The instrument panel and steering wheel were now offered in a variety of colors to harmonize the interior, and the wheel featured a new &quot;soft-grip&quot; rim. Front seats were also re-positioned to give more legroom for taller drivers, but shorter people found the driving position awkward.

The 1974 models featured a new formal, upright grille while turn signals moved from the bumper and were now inset of the dual headlights. The taillights were moved above the new rear bumper. New thick &quot;B&quot; pillars and fixed rear quarter opera windows were new on two-door coupes, which essentially eliminated pillar-less hardtop design much like the GM intermediates did the previous year. Other body styles including the four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, convertible and Estate Wagon were carried over with only minor changes from 1973. New to the engine roster was a four-barrel version of the small block 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8 rated at (which was the standard engine on wagons and all cars sold in California, optional on other models in 49 states). All other engines were carried over from 1973 although the 454 Turbo Jet lost , now rated at Also new for 1974 were integrated lap and shoulder seat belts and an &quot;interlock&quot; system required the driver and front seat passengers to fasten seat belts to be able to start the engine. The interlock feature proved so unpopular that Congress rescinded it shortly after the introduction of the 1975 models. A new option this year was a remote control for the passenger-side outside rear-view mirror.

=== 1975–1976 ===
The 1975 models received a new front end with swept-back headlights, revised grille, and turn signals returned to the bumper which also angles backward at both ends. New taillights now wrap around rear fenders. Caprice Classic Sport sedans now feature opera windows in the C-pillars. The dashboard, radio and climate control graphics were revised; the speedometer read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour. The Caprice convertible would be discontinued after the 1975 model year along with its full-size B-body counterparts including the Oldsmobile Delta 88, Buick Centurion, and Pontiac Grand Ville. Just about 8,350 Caprice Classic convertibles found buyers in 1975.

As fuel economy became a bigger priority among Americans following the Arab Oil Embargo of late 1973 and early 1974, Chevy made the smaller small block V8 with two-barrel carburetor standard on all Caprice models except wagons for 1975. In California, the four-barrel 350 V8 was the base engine and this engine was unavailable elsewhere. Optional engines included the small block V8 (standard on wagons) and big block, the last was not available in California. All engines except for the 454 were single exhaust systems with the introduction of the catalytic converter. Station wagons that used the 454 now featured dual exhaust as well. Also introduced this year were GM&#x27;s &quot;High Energy&quot; electronic ignition and radial tires that were advertised as part of &quot;Chevrolet&#x27;s New Efficiency System.&quot; The theme of economy continued through to the new options this year: A new &quot;Econominder&quot; gauge package included a temperature gauge and a &quot;fuel econominder&quot;, the second being a gauge alerting drivers as to when their driving habits caused the engine to use more or less fuel. Also new on the options list: intermittent windshield wipers, and 50/50 seating options on the Impala coupe/sedan and Caprice Classic convertible models.

&quot;Landau&quot; model was also introduced in 1975, and was primarily an appearance package. Carried over unchanged into 1976, the Landau featured a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rear-view mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a landau vinyl roof (with chrome band across the roof), a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pinstriping. Inside there were color-keyed seat belts and floor mats. Fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. With minor changes, the Landau model would be carried over into the 1977 generation coupe models.

The 1976 Caprice Classic marked the sixth and final year of a body style introduced for the 1971 model year. 1976 models weighed approximately and was long, growing considerably from the 1971s and length. Only minor changes were made for 1976, including an eggcrate grille similar to that of the 1976 Cadillac Calais/DeVille/Fleetwood flanked by new rectangular headlights, along with revised exterior and interior trimmings. Engine options remained virtually unchanged with the 350 two-barrel remained standard in everywhere but California where the 350 four-barrel was standard. The only change was the 350 four-barrel was available in sedans and coupes nationwide and rated at . The dual exhaust equipped 454 increased , rated at and was still unavailable in California. Also available was the four-barrel 400 V8 standard on wagons and optional on all other models. This was the final year for the big block 454 V8 to be offered, along with hardtop body styles and the clam shell-tailgate design for the station wagon. The 1976 4-door hardtop Sport Sedan was the last pillarless model offered by Chevrolet; it was offered in both the Caprice Classic and Impala series. All subsequent Caprice passenger cars were pillared sedans and coupes.

== Third generation (1977–1990) ==
=== 1977–1979 ===
Launched in late September 1976, the 1977 Caprice Classic was drastically downsized, which reduced its weight and exterior dimensions, while increasing headroom, rear-seat legroom and trunk space compared to 1976 models. GM called its downsizing program Project 77 and invested $600 million to develop the most changed full-size Chevrolet to date. The weight reductions from the 1976 models were for coupes, for sedans and for wagons. The 1977 Caprice coupe and sedan were over shorter while the wagon was shorter. Wheelbases were reduced to from for coupes and sedans and for wagons. Width was reduced by for sedans and coupes; the wagon&#x27;s width remained virtually unchanged. Heights were increased by and trunk capacities were increased to for sedans and for coupes.

Size comparison between 1976 and 1977 Caprice:

Although by modern standards, the 1977 &quot;downsized&quot; Chevrolet cars are quite large, the new Chevrolet had exterior dimensions closer to the intermediates of its day. The 1977 Caprice shared the same wheelbase of the intermediate-sized Chevrolet Chevelle; 1977 also marked the first model year in history that a midsized car, the Monte Carlo, was larger than a full-sized car; this would be repeated in the 1980s by GM and Chrysler on multiple vehicles, then by Nissan in the early 2000s when the third generation Nissan Altima was bigger than the concurrent fifth-generation Nissan Maxima. The introduction of a downsized full-size car was considered quite a risk for General Motors. To help ensure the car was a success, preview clinics were held by Chevrolet that returned very positive results. Furthermore, the design process for this car was revolutionized.

Ford would respond with advertising the Ford LTD&#x27;s traditional full-size attributes. In 1978, Ford released a true downsized full-size car with the introduction of the 1979 Ford LTD. Chrysler responded in 1978 when it re-engineered its intermediate B-body cars, and designated them the full-size R-bodies. However, these were not true downsized cars like GM and Ford introduced. 1977 models included a four-door sedan, two-door sedan, six-passenger two-seat station wagon, and an eight-passenger three-seat station wagon. All models had window-framed doors. No hardtop models were offered.

Two-door models featured a unique rear window that created a semi-fastback. This glass had sharp corners giving it three sides. This was done through a &quot;hot-wire&quot; bending process. The Caprice was available as either the &quot;Sport Coupe&quot; or as the &quot;Landau Coupe&quot;. The Landau Coupe features a partially covered vinyl roof.

Station wagon models received a new three-way tailgate for 1977; the clamshell tailgate was gone. The three-seat models featured a rear-facing third seat for two occupants making these cars eight-passenger models. The cargo capacity was reduced to , and although the station wagon could still carry a sheet of plywood, this could now only be done with the tailgate down. The station wagons use the coil spring suspension in the rear, as for the sedans and coupes.

The headlight dimmer switch was also removed from the floor and incorporated into the turn signal lever for all 1977 models. All 1977 models were named Caprice Classics. A V8 engine was no longer standard equipment for the first time since 1965. The base engine for 1977 Chevrolet Caprice coupes and sedans was Chevy&#x27;s long-running I6 engine rated at . This engine was previously available in a full-size Chevy in the 1973 lower trim Bel Air. Standard on station wagons and optional on other Caprice models was a 2-barrel version of the Chevy&#x27;s small-block V8. This was the first model year the 305 cu in had been used in a full-size Chevrolet; it was first introduced in 1976 in compact and mid-sized Chevrolet lines. A V8 with four-barrel carburetor was now the top engine offering as the larger and V8s were discontinued. Standard for all models was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission.


With the new lighter weight and smaller engines, Chevrolet promised increase fuel economy without great loss of performance compared to 1976 models. The EPA estimates for 1977 Chevrolet was city and highway for six-cylinder models. Ford&#x27;s 1977 LTD was rated at city and highway with its smallest engine, the V8. By the same EPA estimates, Plymouth&#x27;s Gran Fury returned 13 MPG city and 18 MPG highway with the 318 V8. Performance was good when comparing the smaller 1977 Caprice to the 1976 Caprice. A 1976 350 two-bbl powered Chevrolet ran 0–60 mph in 12.9 seconds, while a 400 powered model ran 10.7 seconds. 1977 models ran 11.4 seconds to with the 305 engine and 10.8 seconds with the 350 engine. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested a 1977 Chevrolet Impala with the 350 engine and 3.08:1 axle running a 9.6 second 0–60 mph time and obtaining a top speed. The 350 was available with a 2.56:1 axle ratio and a 3.08 axle ratio which may explain the difference in performance times.

The 1977 models became the number one selling car in the United States. (In 1976, the previous generation full-size Chevrolet was the third best-seller). More than 660,000 full-size Chevrolets were produced for the 1977 model year, with the most popular model being the four-door Caprice Classic sedan (212,840 produced). By 1978 more than 1 million downsized Chevrolets had been produced. Auto publications agreed with the public reception, with &quot;Motor Trend&quot; awarding the 1977 Chevrolet Caprice Car of the Year.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; declared &quot;Even the most jaded car critics are in fact tripping over each other trying to be the first to anoint this sedan to be the best full-sized Chevrolet ever made.&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot; commented on the F41 suspension option which included stiffer springs, larger sway bars, wheels, and tires to say, &quot;It will make you think your Chevy came from the Black Forest instead of Detroit.&quot;

1978 models had minor front and rear styling revisions. The engine line-up remained unchanged, but numerically lower axle ratios were used in an attempt to boost fuel economy. The 305 and 350 engines went from a standard 2.56:1 axle for 1977 (2.73:1 for wagons), to a 2.41:1 axle for 1978 (2.56:1 for wagons). An optional 3.08 axle was also available for 350 powered Caprices. The 305 V8 engine received an aluminum intake manifold which reduced engine weight by 35 pounds. A larger brake booster was also added to help reduce braking effort. New options included a steel sliding moonroof and 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio.

The 1979 models continued with only minor refinements. One major change was the relocation of the reverse lights to the bumper filler panels right below the taillights. Again the front and rear styling was refreshed slightly. The 250 six gained five horsepower, while the 305 V8 lost . The change to the 305 was a result of switching from the larger Rochester 2GC carburetor to the smaller Rochester Dualjet carburetor. The 350 engine was unchanged.

=== 1980–1985 ===
The 1980 Caprice Classic saw its first major revision since the 1977 downsizing. To further improve the fuel economy of the car, efforts were made to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The Caprice received new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics the hood was tapered lower, while the trunk area was higher. The grille was now an egg crate style while the tail-light panel featured three separate square lights per side. All the doors and components within were redesigned to be lighter, including the window-crank mechanisms, which now used a tape-drive mechanism. Greater use of aluminum including in-bumper reinforcement and in-sedan/coupe radiators helped to further reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. 1980 models were approximately lighter than 1979 models.

The new styling increased the trunk capacity of both coupes and sedans to . This increase was also partially achieved with a now-standard compact spare tire on a wheel. A new frame lift jack replaced the bumper-mounted model. A larger fuel tank was standard equipment in sedans and coupes. Easy-roll radial tires, improved anti-corrosion measures, low-friction ball joints, and larger front-suspension bushings were also new for 1980. Puncture-sealant tires and cornering lights were new options.

The six was replaced by a new 90-degree Chevrolet 3.8 L (229 cu in) V6 as the base engine for sedans and coupes. This engine shared the same bore and stroke as the 305 cu in V8. California emission cars used the Buick 3.8 L (231 cu in) V6 engine. The Chevrolet 3.8 L was rated at while the Buick V6 engine had a rating. Although the 3.8 L V6 had the same horsepower rating as the 250 six used in 1979, the 250 had more torque than the 3.8 L (200 lb·ft vs 175 lb·ft). The 3.8 L V6 did boost Chevrolet Caprice&#x27;s fuel economy to an EPA estimated city and highway, the highest a full-size Chevrolet had been rated to date.

The base-V8 engine was new for 1980. The 4.4 L 267 cu in V8 rated at and was the standard engine for station wagons. This engine had a Rochester Dualjet carburetor and was not available in California. The two-barrel carburetor on the V8 was replaced with a four-barrel, increasing the 305&#x27;s output to . This was now the most powerful engine option (standard on California station wagons), as the V8 was no longer available except as part of the police-package option. The Oldsmobile-built 350 cu in Diesel V8 was added to the option list for station wagons. This engine was rated at and . To further increase fuel economy, all transmissions were equipped with an electronically controlled lock-up torque converter clutch.

1981 models saw only minor revisions. Styling was unchanged other than the grille which remained egg crate style but now had larger sections. Refinements included redesigned front disc brakes for less drag and a translucent plastic master cylinder reservoir. The cruise control became equipped with a resume feature, while wire-wheel covers had locking bolts to secure them in place. This was the last year for the Delco GM 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio option.

The engine line-up remained unchanged, although the 3.8 L 229 cu in V6 was now rated at and the 5.0 L 305 cu in V8 was rated at . All engines were updated with the &quot;Computer Command Control&quot; (CCC) system which included an electronically metered carburetor. This change occurred in 1980 for California emission cars and did not occur to Canadian emission cars until 1987. The Oldsmobile-built 350 cu in Diesel V8 was added to the option list for the coupe and sedan models during the model year.

1982 models saw only minor styling revisions. The model line-up was reduced by one, with the Caprice Landau coupe dropped. Remaining were the sedan, sport coupe, six-passenger wagon, and the eight-passenger wagon. A new four-speed automatic overdrive transmission with a lock-up torque converter joined the powertrain line-up. This transmission helped boost highway fuel economy, while improving city performance with a 3.08:1 rear axle ratio. The overdrive transmission was only available with the 305 cu in V8, and was a mandatory option for this engine.

The engine line-up and power ratings remained unchanged. The 350 cubic-inch Diesel V8 engine was now available on all models.

1983 was marked with the fewest models to date. No two-door models were produced, leaving only the four-door and the eight-passenger station wagon, since the 6-passenger wagon also left the line-up. The 4.4 L 267 cu in engine was discontinued, but all other engines remained unchanged. The 305 cu in engine and the automatic overdrive transmission was standard on station wagons. The 350 cu in diesel was available with the automatic overdrive transmission at extra cost, while the 305 cu in V8 came equipped only with the automatic overdrive transmission. The 1983 Chevrolet Caprice Classic was selected on the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; Ten Best list.

The 1984 model year saw the return of the two-door sport coupe making a three model line-up. Styling remained unchanged. 1984 models were virtually identical to the 1981 models. The windshield washer controls were moved from the dashboard to the turn signal stalk to create the &quot;multi-stalk&quot;. The optional cruise control (which continued to be mounted on the turn signal stalk) now featured acceleration/deceleration in increments. An optional Landau package included a vinyl roof, sport mirrors, and reveal moldings.

Powertrain availability and power ratings were unchanged for 1984. The 350 cu in diesel engine came standard with an automatic overdrive transmission when equipped in station wagons.

1983 saw the introduction of a Caprice clone from Canada, the Pontiac Parisienne. While this car bore Pontiac emblems and trim similar to the pre-1982 Bonneville, it was a Caprice in every other way. Pontiac dealers gained a full-size car again and buyers did not seem to mind that the car was virtually the same as the contemporary Caprice. It sold well enough to remain available until 1986 for the sedan and 1989 for the Safari station wagon.


1985 models received minor updates while styling remained unchanged. The interior was updated for 1985, marking its most significant update since 1977. The simulated woodgrain appliqué used on the dash was replaced with a simulated silver metallic appliqué. The shaft-style radio was replaced with a more modern DIN-and-a-half style radio, while the pull-out headlight switch was replaced by a push-button style switch. The climate controls were updated with rotary switches for the fan and rear window defroster replacing the toggle style switches. The instruments were updated to have a more modern appearance, with a horizontal speedometer while a round speedometer was included with the optional gauge package.

The engine line-up saw major changes for 1985. The 4.3 L V6 engine (262 cu in) with throttle body fuel injection (RPO LB4) replaced both 3.8 L V6s in 1985 as the base engine for sedans and coupes. The 4.3 L engine was rated at and , producing more than the 229 cu in V6. The 4.3 L V6 shared its bore and stroke with the 350 cu in Chevrolet V8. This engine came standard with a three-speed automatic but was available with the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. The 5.0 L 305 cu in V8 engine received an electronic spark control and compression was increased from 8.6:1 to 9.5:1. This caused the 305&#x27;s output to jump to . The 350 cu in diesel engine remained unchanged until being dropped in January.

=== 1986–1990 ===
1986 marked the first major exterior restyle since 1980. From 1986 to 1990, the Caprice was the only sedan riding on the B platform; (except in Canada where Pontiac Parisienne remained as a sedan for 1986 and available as a safari wagon until 1989) all other sedans had been discontinued or transferred to the smaller, front-wheel-drive H platform. The front fascia was restyled to have a more aerodynamic look: the Caprice emblem was no longer a standup hood ornament, but was an emblem located on the vertical area directly above the grill in the center of the front fascia. A smaller grille with prominent vertical chrome divider bars replaced the larger previous egg-crate grille. The redesigned front end still had two side-by-side rectangular sealed beam headlamps, as had been used on the Caprice since 1976; the taillights were restyled, but continued to have three chambers—another long-running Caprice styling cue. New aerodynamic side-view mirrors were used. The car&#x27;s sheetmetal remained otherwise unchanged.

The former Impala was rebranded as &quot;Caprice&quot; (without &quot;Classic&quot; appended), unifying all full-size Chevrolets under a single model name for the first time since the early 1930s. Still available was a Caprice Classic four-door sedan, coupe and eight-passenger station wagon, while a new Brougham four-door sedan joined the model line-up. Brougham models featured a 55/45 front seat with armrest, and a new &quot;pillow design&quot; with velour fabrics. Broughams featured woodgrain appliqué on its dash fascia, a dome map light, front-door courtesy lights and 20 oz carpeting. Power window controls for all models moved from the door panel to the armrest for improved ergonomics.

The 4.3 L V6 engine received a boost, rated at . The 305 cu in engine was unchanged and remained standard on station wagons. Station wagons built after approximately November 1, 1985 came equipped with the Oldsmobile-built 307 cu in engine and the 305 cu in was no longer available in station wagons. This engine was used in all GM B-body station wagons from this point on to simplify production. The 307 was equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was rated at and . The 350 cu in diesel engine was discontinued.

The 1987 models received minor styling revisions: composite aerodynamic headlamps replaced the formerly sealed beam bulbs, and a standup hood ornament returned. A simulated woodgrain dashboard finish, last used on the 1984 models, returned. The model range was slightly revised, and now included a base level Caprice eight-passenger wagon and a Caprice Classic Brougham LS four-door sedan, introduced mid-1986. The Brougham LS featured all the Brougham amenities plus a fiberglass roof plug covered by a padded vinyl roof for a more formal look, opera lights, and LS monograms. Leather upholstery was a newly available option for Brougham and Brougham LS sedans, which also had a new pillow-style seating design and a folding center armrest in the back seat. Exterior colors for the Brougham LS were now limited to conservative colors compared to the 1986 model: White, Black, Burgundy, Dark Blue, and Dark Grey. The trim level names &quot;stacked up&quot;: Caprice, Caprice Classic, Caprice Classic Brougham, and Caprice Classic Brougham LS in ascending order of price and plushness.

The engine offerings received only minor changes. The 4.3 L V6 and the 305 cu in V8 were updated with roller lifters and center bolt valve covers. The 305 cu in had a rating increase and was now rated at and . The 307 cu in Oldsmobile-built V8 remained unchanged and was the only available engine for the station wagons. Some Canadian-sold Chevrolet Caprice sedans used the 307 cu in Oldsmobile-built V8 in place of the Chevrolet-built 305 cu in engine during the 1987 model year.

The 1988 model range was revised, with the sport coupe dropped due to low sales. There was now just one station wagon model, an eight-passenger configuration. Engines remained unchanged, and the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission was standard equipment. Other standard equipment for all models included tinted glass, a remote-control driver&#x27;s side-view mirror, automatic headlight on/off, and an AM/FM stereo. A police version of the Caprice wagon was made; it had the code 1A2 and was designed for special service use.

1989 marked the first year of a fuel-injected V8 engine. The 305 cu in V8 was updated with throttle body electronic fuel-injection (RPO LO3), first introduced in 1987 on Chevrolet/GMC pickups and vans. This engine was rated at and , which was only a slight increase in torque over the carbureted engine. However, as a result of fuel injection, the cold weather starts, drivability, fuel economy, and emissions were all improved. The 4.3 L V6 was no longer the base engine, and was now only available in taxi and police optioned Caprices. The 307 engine remained unchanged for station wagons. Rear-seat passengers received shoulder belts for the outboard positions and air conditioning was standard on all models.

Essentially, 1990 was a carryover year and marked the last year for this body style. New for 1990 were door-mounted front seat belts, quick-connect fuel lines for the 305 cu in engine, revised interior colors, new metallic paint color choices, and Scotchgard-protected interior fabrics. The model range and engine offerings were unchanged. The 1990 Caprice was only produced until the end of 1989, when production was shut down to prepare for the redesigned 1991 models.

Production Figures:
=== 9C1 Police model ===
A police package, orderable under GM&#x27;s Regular Production Option code 9C1, was introduced for the new base-model Caprice that replaced the Impala for 1986. In the 1986 Michigan State Police tests, the Chevrolet Caprice was competitive with the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury. The Caprice had the fastest quarter-mile times of the three, and the best fuel economy. The Dodge and Plymouth outran the Caprice in the 0–100 mph times, but placed last in the road course times. However, there was only a 1/3 second difference between the fastest and slowest vehicles on the road course. All four cars were very close in competition for 1986, and there was little performance difference.

For 1987, the 9C1 Caprice changed little. The 350-4bbl engine received a boost in compression, roller lifters, and new center-bolt valve covers. The rating of this engine helped boost the Caprice&#x27;s performance above its competition. The 4.3 L LB4 V6 engine remained available, but was marketed towards urban police departments with less need for performance. Michigan State Police tests had the Chevrolet Caprice beating its competition from Ford, Dodge, and Plymouth in almost every category. The Caprice had the quickest quarter-mile times and 0–100 mph times, the highest top speed, the fastest road course time, and the best fuel economy, though the Plymouth and Dodge had shorter braking distances. The 1987 Chevrolet Caprice won the contract for the Michigan State police and would hold this contract until 1996 when the Caprice was discontinued.

For 1988, the 9C1 Caprice was again unchanged. Michigan State Police tests proved to be more competitive, with the Ford LTD Crown Victoria showing a strong improvement in performance. The Plymouth and Dodge models continued unchanged and were not competitive with the Chevrolet and Ford. 1988 tests showed the Caprice with the fastest quarter-mile and 0–100 mph times, the best fuel economy, the fastest road course time (although it tied with the Ford) and the best ergonomics. The Ford edged out the Chevrolet with a faster top speed and better brakes, but the Chevrolet scored second place for both those categories. Overall the Chevrolet scored the highest in the competition, followed by the Ford, Dodge, and Plymouth

For 1989, the 9C1 Caprice received some major changes to the drivetrain. All engines were now equipped with throttle-body fuel-injection (shared with the truck/van lineup and based on the LB4 4.3L TBI injection system first used with the 1985 model year passenger cars), and the engine (RPO LO3) was now added to the options list. The available engines were now the V6, the and V8s (which was only available on police package models). The V6 and 350 engines were equipped with TH700-R4 transmissions while the 305 engine used the TH200-4R transmission. The V6 and the 305 used a 3.08:1 axle ratio, while the 350-powered cars now used a 3.42:1 axle ratio. The 4.3 L remained at , while the 305 TBI engine was rated at , and the 350 TBI engine was rated at . Unlike the LO5 used with the GMT400 light-duty truck and van line including the R/V series, the police spec LO5 used the roller camshaft sourced from its TPI equipped F bodies and Corvette along with high flow fuel injectors. The 350 powered Caprice did well again at Michigan State Police tests for pursuit-rated cars. It had the fastest 0–100 mph, the fastest road course time, the highest top speed and the best fuel economy. The Dodge Diplomat and Ford LTD Crown Victoria outbraked the Caprice, and the Plymouth Fury and Dodge Diplomat had better ergonomics than the Caprice.

1990 was another carry-over year for the 9C1 Caprice with the only major change being door-mounted seatbelts. In Michigan State Police tests, the only competition was from the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, as the production of the Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury had ended during 1989. The Caprice won all six categories for 1990, having the quickest 0–100 times, the fastest road course times, the best brakes, highest top speed, the best fuel economy, and the best interior ergonomics. This was the first time any car had won all six categories in Michigan State Police tests.

==Fourth generation (1991–1996)==



Introduced in April 1990 for the 1991 model year in America, the Caprice was restyled, replacing the previously rectilinear styling with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. The Caprice Classic received &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; 1991 Domestic Car of the Year. 

General Motors initially decided in 1980 to eliminate the production of the former generation model by 1989 for the 1990 model year, but a business decision in 1985 to plan an exterior redesign gave a further continuation and this generation&#x27;s fiberglass prototype model was first shown in April 1987.

While the body and interior were new, the chassis, powertrain, and transmission were largely carried over from the former generation 1977 and 1990 models respectively; the steel fuel tank was replaced by an HDPE tank (with capacity on sedans decreasing from to ), and anti-lock brakes were added as standard equipment on all models. Several major components (including the floor pan) are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996, merely having a reskinned body on an already dated body-on-frame platform introduced in 1977.

Much of the engine availability was carried over from the previous generation, which included for all models the 5.0 L L03 V8. A 5.7L L05 V8 was also carried over; it was originally only available on 1991 and 1992 9C1 Police package models (which featured a digital speedometer), but finally made available to the general public on the 1993 Caprice LTZ, and the LB4 4.3 L V6 was carried over to the 1992–93 Caprice 9C6 taxi package for increased fuel economy at significantly reduced power output.

Two trim levels were initially offered, Caprice and Caprice Classic, replacing the previous Classic and Brougham models. 

The final B-body Caprice was not well received by critics and did not hold on to high annual sales numbers, with roughly half from fleet sales. The car&#x27;s styling was criticized as a &quot;beached whale&quot; and &quot;an upside-down bathtub&quot;, then later as the &quot;bubble Caprice&quot; in response to the former generation&#x27;s nickname &quot;box Caprice&quot;.

1993 revisions removed the rear fender skirts in favor of more open wheel wells on the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. With 1991–93 Caprices essentially having the same three engine options and 4L60 transmission from the former generation, in the fall of 1993 for the 1994 model year, the Caprice received two new V8 engine replacements that shared the exact same external dimensions yet differ internally, and a new transmission. The standard engine in all sedans, including many 9C1 police sedans, was the , L99 263 cu. in. (4.3 L) V8 for better fuel economy in response to rising fuel prices after the Persian Gulf War that was rated at 240 lb·ft (325 N·m) of torque on 87 octane. Caprice sedans were the only cars to receive the L99 4.3 L V8 engine. The Caprice was one of the first cars to introduce OBD 1.5 as standard prior to OBD II being mandatory on all sedans for the 1996 model year.

For model year 1994, Chevrolet offered an optional detuned (by 40 hp) version of the fourth generation Corvette&#x27;s LT1 350 cu. in. (5.7 L) performance V8 engine rated at and 330 lb·ft (447 N·m) of torque. The LT1 was optional in the 9C1 police packages in regards to highways and rural areas and standard in all wagons, with General Motors offering roughly 846 optional 1A2 Caprice special service police package wagons between 1991 and 1995, which were generally available for other administrative duties such as; supervisors, detectives, unmarked units, and fire departments. The LT1 350 cu. in. was standard in civilian sedans with the addition of the V92 towing package. The V92 towing package also gave a heavy-duty suspension with similar spring rates to the 9C1 police car suspension, 2.93 gears, V08 heavy-duty cooling with a mechanical fan, heavy-duty rear drum brakes, and limited-slip differential. The 4L60-E transmission replaced the 4L60. Transmission failures shortly after 100,000 miles (160,000 km), especially when paired with the stronger LT1 V8, were commonplace due to transmission build and software specs that sacrificed long-term durability for slightly improved fuel economy scores. The 1994 Caprice&#x27;s interior had a redesign which featured a Camaro steering wheel, digital speedometer and odometer, and a new instrument panel, which included a front passengers-side airbag.

For the 1995 model year, the rear side window between the back door and C pillar, featured a so-called Hofmeister kink and both the sedan and wagon had their now foldable exterior mirrors repositioned. In 1995 and 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel and the badge on the dashboard saying &quot;Caprice SS&quot;.

The Caprice 9C1 with the LT1 engine became one of the quickest and most popular modern-day police vehicles. This vehicle established such strong devotion by many police departments that a cottage industry thrived in refurbishing Caprices for continued police service after GM discontinued production of the car, with many police departments keeping them in service longer than other police cars from that era. The 1994-96 Caprice 9C1 5.7 L V8 and Impala SS are mechanically the same, as both shared four wheel disc brakes and rigid heavy duty suspension components. In 2006, Chrysler introduced the Dodge Charger Pursuit, serving as an indirect successor to the Caprice&#x27;s muscle sedan image in the police market after a decade hiatus.

The car&#x27;s production was stopped in December 1996 due to sales pressure from the mid-size Chevrolet Lumina, financial troubles at General Motors, and consumer demand shifting from full-sized family sedans to the increasingly popular sport utility vehicles. The Arlington, Texas vehicle assembly plant (used for the Caprice, Impala SS, Buick Roadmaster, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, and Cadillac Fleetwood) was converted to produce GM&#x27;s more profitable full size SUVs (the Tahoe and Suburban). In 1997, the Lumina LTZ would take the Caprice&#x27;s place as Chevrolet&#x27;s premium passenger car. Total production of 1991–96 models was 689,257 with production ending on December 13, 1996. There were plans to reintroduce the Caprice for the 2000 model year in America, but was only revived in the Middle East as the Holden Caprice. The Chevrolet Impala nameplate was reintroduced to the American passenger car market in 2000 as the marque&#x27;s premium offering, albeit in a front wheel drive configuration.

Production Figures:


== Fifth generation (1999–2006) ==


General Motors revived the Chevrolet Caprice nameplate in the Middle East and Latin/South American markets on imported Holden Statesman and Caprice models built by its Australian subsidiary Holden, these cars were lengthened versions of the Commodore range, which was at this time based on the Opel Omega. The WH series Statesman/Caprice was the first series to be engineered to support both left- and right-hand drive (Middle Eastern market being LHD while Australia right-hand drive) in order to allow for manufacturing of export versions. Same was true for the related short-wheelbase Holden VT Commodore, whose left-hand drive version became the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East (In Mexico only, the Commodore and Holden models were sold alongside the Lumina and Caprice).


The Middle Eastern Caprice came out for 2000 in four versions, base LS, standard mid-range LTZ, a sporty SS and the range topper Royale (introduced in 2002). Differences between the models were mostly equipment and slight styling tweaks. The base LS came with a 3.8 L V6 engine; the LTZ came standard with a 5.7 L &quot;Gen III&quot; V8, the SS and Royale came with a version of the same engine. In 2003, Holden launched a revised and facelifted Statesman and Caprice (WK), which was reflected in their Middle Eastern versions for the 2004 model year. The new models sported new front and rear fascias and completely redesigned interior. Engines carried over unchanged.

In 1999, GM had again considered resurrecting the Caprice name in America for 2000, this time under this generation, and as a new Caprice 9C1 long before the appearance of the sixth-generation model (third-generation Holden Caprice) as the Caprice PPV, but it did return several years later as such.

== Sixth generation (2006–2017) ==


=== Middle East ===

In November 2006, a completely redesigned Caprice lineup was launched, again based on the recently introduced Holden WM Statesman/Caprice. The new Caprice lineup includes the base LS, LTZ, SS and Royale, all sporting the new &quot;L98&quot; 6.0 L V8.

The LS, LTZ, and Royale all share the front bumper as the Holden WM Statesman while the LS lacks the Statesman&#x27;s trademark foglights which are seen on the LTZ and Royale; the SS gains the Caprice&#x27;s front bumper and foglamps minus the parking sensors. The LS also gains the VE Commodore Omega&#x27;s interior and trims, while the LTZ gains the trims from the VE Commodore V based on the Commodore Omega, and the Statesman&#x27;s interior minus the headrests with the LCD screens and DVD player, while the Royale gains the Statesman&#x27;s trims, and the Statesman&#x27;s interior with the LCD screens in the headrests and DVD player from the Holden versions, the grille from the Daewoo Veritas, hood ornament similar to the one that the appears on the 4th and 5th generation models, and the SS gains the same trims as the WM Caprice, interior from the Caprice minus the headrests with the LCD screens and DVD player, color-coded version of the grille&#x27;s trim, and the optional lip spoiler from the WM Caprice.

The Caprice was updated for 2011 to include the features that Holden included the Holden Caprice. The Caprice lettering engraved on the chrome trim which was on the car from 2000 until 2010 on the trim was dropped &amp; replaced by a Caprice nameplate badge which is below the chrome trim on the left end of the rear fascia on the trunk. The V6 engines were dropped in the LS &amp; LTZ leaving the V8 as the standard engine while the LS got the trims that were previously on the LTZ from 2007 to 2010 as well as previously seen on the VE Commodore V based on the Omega Series I model, while the LTZ &amp; Royale get the trims seen on the VE Commodore Calais V Series II and the 2010 and 2011 Chevrolet Omega Fittipaldi Edition and the SS now gains the trims that the WM Caprice V Series II has. The LS, LTZ, &amp; Royale still retain the Statesman front bumper, while the SS still retains the Caprice/Caprice V front bumper. The Royale also gains a rear vision camera in the chrome trim on the trunk which is absent on the LS, LTZ, &amp; SS like the Holden Caprice &amp; Caprice V. For the 2013 model year for the Caprice SS the Impala badge on the trunk was dropped in favor of the traditional Chevrolet bowtie.

The Caprice was updated again based on the Holden WN Caprice. The Caprice LS &amp; LTZ still retain the front bumper as the WM Statesman while the Royale now gets the same front bumper as seen on the WM/WN Caprice and the Caprice SS and the trims that were previously on the 2011–2013 Caprice SS, the 2010–2013 WM Caprice V, and currently the WN Caprice LPG model, and the Holden Commodore (VF) Calais&#x27;s interior just like the Holden models. The SS now gains the rear vision camera which was previously only available on the Caprice Royale while it is still not available on the Caprice LS or LTZ, the same interior updates the WN Caprice and Caprice Royale, and also delivered the same trims as on the WN Caprice V &amp; while the LS, LTZ, and SS gain new trims.

The Holden-sourced Chevrolet Caprice in the LS trim is used in Middle East police forces in the Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates such as the Abu Dhabi Police, Royal Oman Police, and Dubai Police Force. In 2012 after the Libyan Civil War ended the Abu Dhabi Police donated 100 of its Caprice LS police cars to Libya along with uniforms making it the only country in the continent of Africa to have the Holden sourced Caprices in service.


=== North America ===
On October 5, 2009, General Motors announced the Chevrolet Caprice Police Patrol Vehicle (PPV).

The Caprice PPV was based on a previous Australian-built export to the Middle East, the Chevrolet Caprice LS (which was based on the Holden Caprice WM series I, sold only in the Australasian market). The front end and grille were the same as the 2007–2010 Caprice LS.

While the 2009 onward Chevrolet Caprice was officially sold only to law enforcement agencies in the US, some vehicles evidently have been purchased by private individuals via dealers. These included demonstrator vehicles, excess unsold dealer inventory, and purchases for demonstration use by upfitters and related businesses.

The Caprice PPV was imported from Australia as a captive import of the Holden Caprice (WM series), rather than the short-wheelbase Holden Commodore (VE), which was sold in a police pack in Australia. (However, these cars were both designed on GM&#x27;s Zeta platform.

Australian-built Chevrolet Caprices featured either the 6.0 L &quot;L77&quot; AFM V8, which was standard in 2011 and optional from 2012; or the standard 3.6 L &quot;LLT&quot; SIDI V6 engine, that became available nine months later. Both engines were E85 ethanol-capable.

The Caprice police car had a generally positive reception, placing perfect scores in an assessment by The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, with the only criticism being directed at its over-cautious electronic stability control.

The Caprice logo was engraved into the chrome trim on the trunk, there was a PPV logo on the right side of the rear fascia and a FlexFuel nameplate, which was on GM vehicles in North America from 2007 through 2009. The PPV had dual exhausts, a floor shifter in the console, a prisoner partition with rifle and shotgun mounts, lights and siren controls in the console, 18-inch steel wheels and center caps from the Impala 9C1, and a touch screen in place of the radio and HVAC controls. A prototype similar to the concept car in LAPD was shown publicly in Australia by Holden. Another prototype tested by the LAPD had the same front end, grille, steel wheels, and center caps as the production models, while the car was based on the Series I WM Caprice with its rear bumper, colored turn signal indicators lamps on the side of the car, chrome trim with Caprice engraved on it, &amp; V8 badge from the 2007–2010 Caprice.

Special features were added by Chevrolet for the Caprice Police Patrol Vehicle (PPV). The driver&#x27;s seat had a special indentation made to accommodate a police officer&#x27;s equipment belt. Special tuning, such as Performance Algorithm Liftfoot (PAL) calibration and a performance-tuned suspension was added for increased performance, for police needs.

Previously, the future of Holden&#x27;s North American export program had been the subject of contradictory announcements, as General Motors emerged from bankruptcy. On July 11, 2009, Bob Lutz declared the Australian-built, Holden Commodore-based Pontiac G8 &quot;too good to waste&quot; and indicated it would return in the form of a Chevrolet Caprice. Initially, it was unclear whether the revived Caprice marque, in North America, would be based on the short-wheelbase Commodore (like the Pontiac G8) or the longer Holden/Chevrolet Caprice variants already sold in Australasia and the Middle East. Several days later, Lutz retracted his comment, citing market conditions, while GM CEO Frederick Henderson confirmed that police applications were being studied.

What also made the North America Caprice different from the preceding Caprice variants sold in Australasia and the Middle East was the lower end of the front bumper (based on the Holden Commodore Omega Series II front end), a honeycomb grille similar to the 2001–2011 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, and an interior from the Commodore Omega. (The latter was the common trim of the VE Commodore police packs sold in Australasia in 2007–2013.) An unmarked detective subvariant of the PPV used the same interior as the Middle East market variant Caprice LS, from 2007 to 2013.

Standard equipment on the Caprice PPV included keyless entry, power windows and door locks, a 6.5-inch, full-color LCD audio system called &quot;Holden iQ&quot; with auxiliary audio input and a single-disc CD player, a four-speaker front audio system with separate woofers and tweeters, full instrumentation with an integrated driver information center (DIC), air conditioning with dual-zone temperature controls for the driver and front passenger, dual front bucket seats with a power driver&#x27;s seat adjuster, a cruise control, and front and rear cloth seating surfaces. Optional features included wiring for police lighting and sirens, an additional battery to power police-installed accessories, the disabling of the interior courtesy lamps and rear door window controls and door locks, eighteen-inch (18&quot;) plastic wheel covers, a vinyl rear bench seat, rubberized vinyl flooring and rear trunk mats, and a remote vehicle starter system.

For 2014, the Caprice PPV received a new seven-inch, Chevrolet MyLink touchscreen infotainment system as standard equipment, which now included Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless stereo audio streaming via A2DP, Pandora Internet Radio capabilities, and an integrated rearview backup camera display among other new features. The single-disc CD player was available for the 2014–2016 model years, but deleted for the 2017 model year. The dashboard was restyled with a new steering wheel that integrated cruise (speed), audio system, and Bluetooth voice controls, a new instrument cluster with a larger monochromatic LCD driver information center (DIC) screen, and revised controls (the new dashboard in the Caprice PPV was similar to the civilian Chevrolet SS sedan that was released for the 2014 model year). The gear selector lever for the six-speed automatic transmission was relocated from the center console to the dashboard directly next to the steering column, which freed up space in the center console for police-installed equipment, such as computers and radio equipment. In addition, the door panels were redesigned with more convenient control placement including dual-side trunk release buttons, and the front bucket seats were redesigned for greater officer comfort and support, with a new seat fabric for the cloth seats.

In 2017, General Motors closed the Elizabeth, South Australia assembly plant where the Caprice PPV was produced, ending production of both the civilian Chevrolet SS and Caprice PPV. The last PPV was produced on May 18, 2017. With the discontinuation of the 9C1 Chevrolet Impala Limited PPV after the 2017 model year, Chevrolet no longer offers a four-door sedan with a Police Package.

== South Africa (1975 to 1978)==
From late 1975 to 1978, the Australian-developed Statesman Caprice was marketed in South Africa as the &quot;Chevrolet Caprice Classic&quot;. The V8-engined Caprice Classic received full equipment, with reading lights, air conditioning, and imported leather upholstery. It was very similar to the 5-liter Constantia, albeit fitted with a different grille, hubcaps, and a vinyl roof.

<text>Smbat (; 1277 – c. 1310) was king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, ruling from 1296 to 1298. He was the son of Leo II of Armenia and Kyranna de Lampron and was part of the Hetoumid-family.

Sempad seized the throne with the aid of his brother Constantine while his brothers Hethum II and Thoros were in the Byzantine capital Constantinople. In 1297, on a volitional journey to the Ghazan&#x27;s court, Sempad managed to receive recognition of his position as king from the Mongol ruler of Persia, which was necessary to legitimate his usurpation. He also received a bride from the Mongol khan in order to form a matrimonial alliance, perhaps a relative of the khan himself.

On Hethum&#x27;s return, Sempad had Hethum blinded by cauterization and both brothers imprisoned at Partzerpert. Thoros was murdered there on Sempad&#x27;s orders in 1298, but Constantine turned traitor again and helped Hethum overthrow Sempad, assuming the throne while Hethum&#x27;s blindness healed. Sempad again plotted with Constantine to resume the throne soon after Hethum&#x27;s restoration, and both were imprisoned for the rest of their lives.

<text>Constantine I (, Western Armenian transliteration: &quot;Gosdantin&quot; or &quot;Kostantine&quot;;) (also called Constantine III; 1278 – 1310) was briefly king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia from 1298 to 1299. He was the son of Leo II of Armenia and Kyranna de Lampron and was part of the Hetoumid-family or the House of Lampron.

He helped his brother Sempad to usurp the throne in 1296, but turned against him two years later in 1298 to restore his older brother Hethum II. He assumed the throne for a year while Hethum recovered from his imprisonment. Shortly after Hethum&#x27;s resumption in 1299, Constantine plotted to restore Sempad again, and both were imprisoned for the rest of their lives.

<text>Leo II (; 1150 – 2 May 1219) was the tenth lord of Armenian Cilicia, ruling from 1187 to 1219, and the first king to be crowned, in 1198/9 (sometimes known as Levon I the Magnificent). Leo eagerly led his kingdom alongside the armies of the Third Crusade and provided the crusaders with provisions, guides, pack animals and all manner of aid.

He was consecrated as king on 6 January 1198 or 1199.

==Early years==

He was the younger son of Stephen, the third son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. His mother was Rita, a daughter of Sempad, Lord of Barbaron. Leo&#x27;s father, who was on his way to attend a banquet given by the Byzantine governor of Cilicia, Andronicus Euphorbenus, was murdered on 7 February 1165. Following their father&#x27;s death, Leo and his elder brother Roupen lived with their uncle.

Their paternal uncle, Mleh I, lord of Armenian Cilicia had made a host of enemies by his cruelties in his country, resulting in his assassination by his own soldiers in the city of Sis in 1175. The seigneurs of Cilician Armenia elected Leo&#x27;s brother, Roupen III to occupy the throne of the principality. Roupen III sent Leo to surround Hethum&#x27;s mountain lair. But Bohemond III, rushing to the aid of Hethum, treacherously made Roupen prisoner. During 1187, he became the ruler.

==His rule==
In 1187, he was forced to engage in a war against Aleppo and Damascus, an arduous war in which he actually forced the allied forces to retreat. This first success of Leo is of great significance from a historical perspective, for at the same time that Saladin had begun his decisive battle against the Latin state of Jerusalem, the forces of Leo drew away the attention of some part of his forces and this way easing the pressure on the crusaders.

===Prince of Cilicia===

===Coronation===

Leo was crowned on 6 January 1198 (or 1199) at Tarsus,

===Antiochene War of Succession===

In Cyprus between 28 January 1210/27 January 1211 Leo married Sibylle, the half-sister of King Hugh I of Cyprus.

==Last years==


==Marriages and children==

<doc id="406317" wikidata="Q630372" url="?curid=406317" title="Cangrejeros de Santurce (basketball)">
<text>Cangrejeros de Santurce is the name of several franchises sanctioned by the professional basketball league Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) of Puerto Rico. Named after Santurce, all versions have played out of San Juan. The first franchise was founded in 1918 and began active play in the BSN in 1956, winning titles in 1962 and 1968 before folding.

The second iteration of the Cangrejeros played their home games at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum under the ownership of music industry executive Angelo Medina, winning five championships in a six-year span (including four consecutive) and another in 2007. This version remained active for another decade after winning its last championship. In 2021, a new franchise was approved under the name of Cangrejeros under the ownership of artist Bad Bunny and urban music entrepreneurs Noah Assad and Jonathan García. Teams bearing the name of Cangrejeros have won 8 championships and appeared in 14 BSN finals.

==History==
===The first years (1918–1976)===

Founded in 1918, the team has included name players such as Teófilo Cruz, and Rafael Valle. Cruz, #13, played for 25 seasons being MVP in 4 seasons and leading the BSN in points per game 2 times. He was the starting center of the PR national basketball team in the times when Puerto Rico and Brazil where the two most dominant teams in the Americas outside the USA. Valle, #5, arguably the best power forward in BSN history, played actively in 8 seasons finishing MVP and first in points per game in 1956. He was active in 2 Olympic games, where he led Puerto Rico in scoring both times. After 2 championships, and several finals, the Santurce Crabbers played their last season in 1976.

===The return (1998–2016)===

On 1998, Angelo Medina acquired the Tiburones de Aguadilla and the Capitalinos de San Juan, merged them and acquired other free agents (in a time where there was no Free Agency in the BSN) to revive the Cangrejeros, who started playing in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. The team featured players like: Jose &quot;Piculin&quot; Ortiz, Carlos Arroyo, Orlando &quot;Guayacan&quot; Santiago and Jeffrey Aubry. Besides those players, Santurce featured as a coach Julio Toro, who was the coach of the national team and had previously won a championship in the league. The team went on to defeat the Leones de Ponce in the final.

Rolando Hourruitiner would join the Cangrejeros in 1999. Santurce won the BSN championship in 1999, 2000, 2001 (completing a rare, back-to-back-to-back-to-back four titles in a row run) and 2003. In all those championships the team was led by Ortiz, Arroyo and Horrutinier, the 3 then members of the national team. In 2007, the Cangrejeros won their eighth league championship.

===Move from the Roberto Clemente Coliseum===

In 2005, the mayor of San Juan, Jorge Santini, decided that the Cangrejeros could no longer play in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum because the assistance was low and it was not worth playing there and offered them the Pedrín Zorrilla Coliseum, which is used for volleyball. The mayor of Guaynabo, Héctor O&#x27;Neill, offered Medina use of the Mario Morales Coliseum, located in Guaynabo, and Medina decided to split home games between there and the recently opened Puerto Rico Coliseum. The games at the Puerto Rico Coliseum averaged an attendance of 10,000. Santini and the municipality of San Juan insisted that the Pedrín Zorrilla Coliseum should be used, and even had a giant billboard in front of the coliseum that read “We want this (the Pedrín Zorrilla) to be the new home of the Cangrejeros”. The use of the &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales Coliseum contributed to the return of the Conquistadores de Guaynabo.

In 2007, the Cangrejeros advanced to the league&#x27;s round robin, following a 73–70 victory over Fajardo. In this game Robert Traylor scored the first triple-double in the season with 17 points, 15 rebounds and ten blocks. This total established a new record in blocks for a single game, breaking the previous record of nine. With less than a minute remaining Orlando Santiago scored a free throw and subsequently stole a ball to secure a win. The Cangrejeros would reach the finals and face the Capitanes de Arecibo, defeating them in the series to win the league&#x27;s championship.

During this time frame, the team remains played its home games in Guaynabo and the Puerto Rico Coliseum. The José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum was used in playoffs and regular season games against teams that attract a large crowd such as the Capitanes, Leones de Ponce and Vaqueros de Bayamón.

In 2008, the Cangrejeros advanced to the league&#x27;s &quot;Super 6&quot; semifinals. They began a series against the Capitanes on June 5, 2008. Santurce won the first game, but lost the second. This was followed by a series against the Gigantes de Carolina, winning the first game.

In 2015, former Cangrejeros player and former NBA player Carlos Arroyo returned to the team after ending his music career, an endeavor in which he had briefly engaged.

===Inactivity (2016–2020)===
In 2017, the team recessed.

In 2018, the Cangrejeros were acquired by businessmen Ricardo García and Camilo Domínguez. Ricardo Garcia who is the owner of Havoc Media Group and Camilo Domiguez owner of Reydom Sports and entertainment group both entrepreneurs of Orlando Florida.

After some controversy and some allegedly fraud in the part of Ariel Rodriguez who was the owner previous to Ricardo Garcia and Camilo Dominguez both are no longer owners of the team. During the exchange Rodriguez failed to provided accurate information of the debts owned to vendors, team staff, third parties, agents, coaches and players. After the team was taken over by Mr. Garcia and Mr. Camilo Dominguez many issues came to light. In one of the issues there was some controversy of misuse of money needed to pay debts passed on by Angelo Medina. Now the team has been recessed once again and Ariel Rodriguez continues to be the team owner and liable for over 400k + in debt.

===Expansion franchise (2021–present)===
In April 2021, the league approved the return of the Cangrejeros under the ownership of Noah Assad and Jonathan Miranda, who were joined by urban artist Bad Bunny the following month. Veteran point guard José Juan Barea served as the cornerstone of a roster that had begun construction with the purchase of shooting guard Isaac Sosa’s contract from the Atléticos. The staff was composed by Néstor García, with former players Elías Ayuso and Carla Cortijo as assistants and Daniel Seoane as scout. More roster acquisitions, including import players Dante Cunningham and Thomas Robinson, as well as a return to the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum were announced during the off-season.

Throughout the 2021 season the veteran roster of the Cangrejeros faced several difficulties, including recurrent injuries on Barea. While still in contention García was released from his contract, becoming the new head coach of the Argentina national baseball team. Assistant Larry Ayuso took over the staff and lead it in a second half that saw the team fell to the fourth place of the B Division to close the regular season. Before the postseason began, the administration left José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum and moved to Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Cangrejeros faced Capitanes de Arecibo in their first round matchup, being eliminated in the series 2-4.

During the off-season, Cangrejeros acquired guard Gian Clavell in a trade, signed imports Skal Labissière and Tyler Hansbrough and free agents forwards Ramón Clemente, Gilberto Clavell and Ángel Matías. The team also brought Iván Ríos as an assistant coach, ultimately taking over the full role when Ayuso left to join the Piratas in March 2022, with Luis Armando Cancel and Cortijo completing the staff.

==International performance==
===FIBA Americas League===
As champions of the 2007 BSN season the Cangrejeros were one of two teams selected to represent Puerto Rico in the first edition of the FIBA Americas League, the other team representing the island in this event were the league&#x27;s runner-up the Capitanes de Arecibo. The Cangrejeros qualified to the tournament&#x27;s second round, finishing the first with a record of 2-1. Santurce lost a one point game to Soles de Mexicali (74:75) and defeated the PBL All-Stars (97:73) and Metros de Santiago (91:62) as part of the Group A games hosted at the Mario Morales Coliseum. After advancing they were matched against the Miami Tropics in three game hosted by them at Florida International University&#x27;s basketball court. Santurce won the first game of this round with a score of 102:94. However, they lost the remaining games to the home team with scores of 64:91 and 83:91 and were eliminated in the quarterfinals.

===FIBA Basketball Champions League Americas===
In September 2021, Cangrejeros became the first BSN team to participate in the Basketball Champions League Americas (which replaced the Americas League in 2019) by joining the participating clubs for the 2021-22 tournament. In the first window that took place at Nicaragua, Santurce defeated the Edmonton Stingers 89:68 and Real Estelí Baloncesto 91:88. The Cangrejeros were selected to host the second stage of its group, with the Roberto Clemente Coliseum serving as their home court. However, local venue capacity restrictions introduced to curve the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant led to the postponement and relocation, with Managua hosting again. In the second window, Cangrejeros lost to Real Estelí (78:82) and defeated Stingers (93:55). Santurce dropped both of the games in the third window played at Calgary, first to Stingers (93:87) and to Estelí (96:83) in the closer. 

By finishing first, the Cangrejeros were matched against Quimsa in the quarterfinals.

The Cangrejeros are featured in Season 5 of NBA 2K24’s MyTEAM and MyCareer game modes, in which the team’s court, uniform and owner Benito Martínez are included as part of the Bad Bunny Spotlight challenge. In February 2024, the team announced a collaboration with Santurce Brewery to market a limited edition beer, the Cangrejeros Blonde Ale. The product was unaffiliated with the BSN and not made available in Roberto Clemente Coliseum during seasonal games, instead being offered as a promotional item in certain San Juan establishments.

<text>Airline deregulation is the process of removing government-imposed entry and price restrictions on airlines affecting, in particular, the carriers permitted to serve specific routes. In the United States, the term usually applies to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. A new form of regulation has been developed to some extent to deal with problems such as the allocation of the limited number of slots available at airports.

==Introduction==
As jets were integrated into the market in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the industry experienced dramatic growth. By the mid-1960s, airlines were carrying roughly 100 million passengers and by the mid-1970s, over 200 million Americans had traveled by air. This steady increase in air travel began placing serious strains on the ability of federal regulators to cope with the increasingly complex nature of air travel.The onset of high inflation, low economic growth, falling productivity, rising labor costs and higher fuel costs proved problematic to the airlines.

Although it is generally recognized that the purpose behind government regulation is to create a stable industry, in the decades leading up to deregulation many airline market analysts expressed concerns with the structure of the United States&#x27; passenger air transport system. Concerns included high barriers to entry for fledgling airlines, slow government response to existing airlines entering to compete in city-pairings, and monopolistic practices by legacy airlines artificially inflating passenger ticket prices. 

In order to address these growing concerns airline deregulation began in the U.S. in 1978. It was, and still is, a part of a sweeping experiment to ultimately reduce ticket prices and entry controls holding sway over new airline hopefuls. Airline deregulation had begun with initiatives by economist Alfred E. Kahn in the Nixon administration, carried through the Ford administration and finally, at the behest of Ted Kennedy, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 as the Airline Deregulation Act. 

Globally, state supported airlines are still relatively common, maintaining control over ticket prices and route entry, but many countries have since deregulated their own domestic airline markets. A similar but less laissez-faire approach has been taken by the European Union, Australia, United Kingdom, Scandinavia, Ireland and select South and Central American nations.

==In the United States==
In the early days of interstate air travel, the prevalent thought at the time was that government regulation was necessary to protect and promote the fledgling industry. For example, the then dominant rail industry was forbidden from a financial interest in airlines to prevent them from smothering competition in the industry. Congress created the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which became the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), and gave the CAB the power to regulate airline routes, control entry to and exit from the market, and mandate service rates, to investigate accidents, certify aircraft and pilots, to create rules for air traffic control (ATC) and to recommend new rules to prevent repetition of previous accidents. Additional airline safety regulation came later with the passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which created the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a separate regulatory body.

===Civil Aeronautics Board===

In 1938 the U.S. government, through the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), regulated many areas of commercial aviation such as routes, fares and schedules.
The CAB had three main functions: to award routes to airlines, to limit the entry of air carriers into new markets, and to regulate fares for passengers.

Much of the established practices of commercial passenger travel within the U.S., went back even farther, to the policies of Walter Folger Brown, the U.S. postmaster general from 1929 to 1933 in the administration of President Herbert Hoover. After passage of the Air Mail Act of 1930, also known as the McNary-Watres act, Brown had changed the mail payments system to encourage the manufacture of passenger aircraft instead of mail carrying aircraft. His influence was crucial in awarding contracts so as to create four major domestic airlines: United, American, Eastern, and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA). Contracts for each of three transcontinental air mail routes were awarded to United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (later United), Robertson Aircraft Corporation (later American), and Transcontinental Air Transport (later TWA). The contract for the New York to Washington route was awarded to Eastern Air Transport, which would later become Eastern Air Lines. By 1933, United, American, TWA, and Eastern accounted for about 94% of air mail revenue. Similarly, Brown had also helped give Pan American a monopoly on international routes. (See also the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission )

Typical regulatory thinking from the 1940s onward is evident in a Civil Aeronautics Board report. In the absence of particular circumstances presenting an affirmative reason for a new carrier, there appears to be no inherent desirability of increasing the present number of carriers merely for the purpose of numerically enlarging the industry.

===Airline Deregulation Act===

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 removed many of the previously mentioned controls. Prior to deregulation, it was required that airlines first seek regulatory approval to serve any given route. Thus incumbent airline operators could raise barriers to the challenge of new competition. This system was dismantled as a result of the Airline Deregulation Act. (See also the Centennial of Flight Commission) It also dismantled the notion of a flag carrier.

==Post-deregulation==
In the wake of deregulation, airlines adopted new strategies and consumers experienced a new market. Below are the marquee effects of deregulation.

===Hub and spoke===
In the immediate aftermath of deregulation, many large airlines adopted a hub-and-spoke system. In this system, several smaller routes (&quot;spokes&quot;) are connected to a single larger route (&quot;hubs&quot;) are selected an airport, the hub, as the point for flights from a number of origination cities, the spokes. Because hubs allowed passenger travel to be consolidated in &quot;transfer stations&quot;, capacity utilization increased, decreasing costs and lowering ticket prices.

=== Low-cost carriers ===
While deregulation led legacy airlines to switch to a hub-and-spoke model, the old point-to-point transit model was quickly adopted by the new generation of low-cost carriers (LCCs) that emerged in the 1970s and 80s. While previously, LCCs such as Southwest Airlines were only permitted to serve routes that did not cross state borders (placing them outside the purview of the CAB), deregulation allowed low-cost airlines to choose their own domestic routes, fares, and schedules, increasing competition across state lines and creating new markets outside the two largest states (California and Texas). As the cost of flying dropped, the number of potential customers increased, making many smaller routes viable.

===Price===
Base ticket prices have declined steadily since deregulation. The inflation-adjusted 1982 constant dollar yield for airlines has fallen from 12.3 cents in 1978 to 7.9 cents in 1997, and the inflation-adjusted real price of flying fell 44.9% from 1978 to 2011. Along with a rising U.S. population and the increasing demand of workforce mobility, these trends were some of the catalysts for dramatic expansion in passenger miles flown, increasing from 250 million passenger miles in 1978 to 750 million passenger miles in 2005.

===Service quality===
Over the past several years the public&#x27;s view of airline service quality has shown a significant drop. According to the 2008 American Customer Satisfaction Index, a University of Michigan study of 80,000 consumers&#x27; expectations and preferences, the major US airlines ranked last among all the industries surveyed. In 2009, the airlines have moved up to being one point ahead of Cable &amp; Satellite TV and the newspaper industry (though results for all industries were not available at the time of this writing).

In 2011 Congress finally responded to repeated calls for the United States government to pass an &quot;Air Passenger Bill of Rights&quot; to provide specific requirements about what must happen to air passengers in certain conditions. The push for the bill stemmed from several high-profile passenger strandings over the last several years. On April 25, 2011, the Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections rule, 76 Fed. Reg. 32,110, was enacted. Among other items, the rule includes raising the minimum &quot;denied boarding compensation&quot; to customers with valid tickets yet still not allowed to board the aircraft. The legislation further penalizes airlines up to $27,500 a passenger if left stranded aboard an aircraft, on a tarmac for more than three hours. In 2010, the largest trade associations representing airline management interests before Capitol Hill, Airlines for America and the Regional Airline Association, opposed this legislation stating that they could self-regulate themselves and they already had begun implementing systems by which to mitigate any tarmac delays. Later American Eagle, an RAA airline member, was the first airline to be fined under the new legislation. A total settlement including fines and compensation paid to passengers totaled $800,000 for tarmac delays incurred in Chicago in May 2011.

Deregulation advocate Alfred Kahn noted a deterioration in the quality of airline service following deregulation, including the &quot;turmoil&quot; of massive restructuring of airline routes, price wars, conflicts with airline employee unions, airline bankruptcies, and industry consolidation. He also noted unexpected congestion and delays &quot;that have plagued air travelers in recent years&quot;. However, he also argued that such congestion and delays was also a sign of deregulation success (because they were caused by lower prices leading Americans to book more flights). Kahn considered the turmoil, congestion, and delays to be unforeseen &quot;surprises&quot; from deregulation, but believed they continued to support deregulation in spite of these events.

===Competition among carriers===

A major goal of airline deregulation was to increase competition between airline carriers, leading to price decreases. As a result of deregulation, barriers to entry into the airlines industry for a potential new airline decreased significantly, resulting in many new airlines entering the market, thus increasing competition.

===Effects on airline staff===
A key indicator of the volatility of deregulation from 1976 to 1986 in the U.S. revolves around employee affairs. Airlines saw a 39% increase in employees (according to Alfred Kahn), and saw continued yet less rapid growth throughout the 1990s. Subsequently, between 2000 and 2008, 100,000 jobs were shed - approximately 20% - and formerly busy hub airports (such as Pittsburgh and St. Louis) reduced staffing due to a significantly decreased number of flights.

Immediately following the September 11th attacks, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act provided the U.S. airlines with $15 billion in loans and an additional $5 billion in grants by the U.S. government. Despite these loans and grants, nearly every major carrier fired 20% of its staff, with United and American both cutting 20,000 jobs. It is difficult to determine the precise job losses due to the effects of deregulation, given such layoffs. Then-retired former CEO of American Airlines Robert Crandall stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure 9/11 by itself had any particular profound impact [on the industry], but it exacerbated the problems they had before 9/11.&quot;

Although regular pay-cuts had become commonplace in the years following deregulation, of the employees remaining after September 11, 2001, the average pay cut has been 18%, with many of the highest earners seeing as much as 40% reductions. Further, virtually every regularly scheduled airline has shifted its pension obligations to its employees.

According to a study by economist David Card, deregulation resulted in the shift of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 airline mechanic jobs from the major trunk airlines to smaller carriers between 1978 and 1984. Because such smaller carriers typically pay less than the major airlines, the average hourly wage of airline mechanics decreased by up to 5 percent; however, this decrease is said to be relatively small.

===Open Skies===
Beyond the domestic liberalization of the airlines in the U.S., Open Skies agreements are bilateral agreements between the U.S. and other countries to open the aviation market to foreign access and remove barriers to competition. These agreements give airlines the right to operate air services from any point in the U.S. to any point in the other country, as well as to and from third countries. The first major Open Skies agreements were entered into in 1979.

The U.S. has Open Skies agreements with more than 60 countries, including 15 of the 28 EU nations. Open Skies agreements have been successful at removing many of the government-implemented barriers to competition and allowing airlines to have foreign partners, access to international routes to and from their home countries, and freedom from many traditional forms of economic regulation.

==Criticisms==
With long standing companies like Braniff, TWA, and Pan Am disappearing through bankruptcy since 1978, the years since 2000 have seen every remaining legacy carrier file for bankruptcy at least once, with the exception of Alaska Airlines. US Airways filed twice in the same number of years. During the same time period, Southwest Airlines continued to expand its route structure, buy new airplanes, and hire more employees, while remaining profitable. JetBlue, a new airline that started up in 1999, &quot;was one of only a few U.S. airlines that made a profit during the sharp downturn in airline travel following the September 11, 2001 attacks. For many years, analysts had predicted that JetBlue&#x27;s growth rate would become unsustainable. Despite this, the airline continued to add planes and routes to the fleet at a brisk pace. JetBlue is one of the largest airlines in the Northeast United States.&quot;

Various proposals have been made by labor unions, former management and industry analysts, including federal price controls and mandated routes served by major airlines with the intent of increasing both prices and competition.

In June 2008 former CEO of American Airlines, Robert Crandall stated,

Crandall has also criticized deregulation for causing airlines to cut service to smaller airports, resulting in a &quot;relatively unsatisfactory transportation network;&quot; he argues that this &quot;has accelerated the movement of people towards the big cities and has discouraged the creation of medium-sized cities.&quot;

<text>Georgios Papadopoulos (; ; 5 May 1919 – 27 June 1999) was a Greek military officer and dictator who led a coup d&#x27;etat in Greece in 1967 and became the country&#x27;s Prime Minister from 1967 to 1973. He also was the President of Greece under the junta in 1973, following a referendum. However, after the effective suppression of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, he was, in turn, overthrown by hardliner Dimitrios Ioannidis, in a string of events that would culminate in the fall of the regime in 1974. His and the dictatorship&#x27;s legacy, as well as its methods he constructed and effects on Greek economy and society as a whole, are still fiercely debated.

He joined the Hellenic Army during the Second World War and resisted the Italian invasion of Greece in the Greco-Italian War; in so doing he obtained honors and became a hero. He remained in the army after the war and rose to the rank of colonel.

In April 1967, Papadopoulos and a group of other mid-level army officers overthrew the democratic government and established a military junta that lasted until 1974. Assuming dictatorial powers, he led an authoritarian, anti-communist and ultranationalist regime which eventually ended the Greek monarchy and established a republic, with himself as president. In 1973, he was overthrown and arrested by his co-conspirator Brigadier General Dimitrios Ioannidis. After the &quot;Metapolitefsi&quot; which restored democracy in 1974, Papadopoulos was tried for his part in the crimes of the junta and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Refusing several offers of clemency in exchange for admitting guilt for the crimes of the junta, he spent the remainder of his life in prison.

== Early life and military career ==
Papadopoulos was born in Elaiohori, a small village in the Prefecture of Achaea in the Peloponnese, to local schoolteacher Christos Papadopoulos and his wife Chrysoula. He was the eldest son and had two brothers, Konstantinos and Haralambos. After finishing high school in 1937, he enrolled in the Hellenic Military Academy, completing its three-year programme in 1940.

His biographical notes, published as a booklet by his supporters in 1980, mention that he took a civil engineering course at the Polytechneion but did not graduate.

=== Resistance and acquiescence ===
During the Second World War, Papadopoulos saw field action as an artillery second lieutenant against both Italian and Nazi German forces which attacked Greece on 6 April 1941.

It has been argued by various authors that Papadopoulos was a member of the Security Battalions under the command of Colonel Kourkoulakos, who was responsible for the formation of the &quot;Security Battalions&quot; in Patras which &quot;hunted down&quot; Greek resistance fighters. However, Evanthis Hatzivassiliou and Leonidas F. Kallivretakis disagree with this claim. It has also been argued that Papadopoulos, at the end of the Axis occupation of Greece, entered Organisation X, but Calivratakis considers that this information has not been proven. According to Kallivretakis and Grigoriadis, during the Axis occupation of Greece, Papadopoulos worked in the Greek administration’s Patras office.

Along with other right-wing military officers, he participated in the creation of the nationalist right-wing secret IDEA organisation in the autumn of 1944, shortly after the country&#x27;s liberation. Those 1940 officers who took refuge in the Kingdom of Egypt along with King Geórgios II immediately after the German invasion, had become generals when their still-colonel former classmates undertook the coup of 1967.

== Post-Second World War career ==
He was promoted to captain in 1946; and in 1949, during the Greek Civil War, to major. (See also Greek military ranks.) He served in the KYP Intelligence Service from 1959 to 1964 as the main contact between the KYP and the top CIA operative in Greece, John Fatseas, after training at the CIA in 1953.

=== Trials and tribulations: The Beloyannis affair ===

Major Papadopoulos, as he then was, was also a member of the court-martial in the first trial of the well-known Greek communist leader Nikos Beloyannis, in 1951. At that trial, Beloyannis was sentenced to death for the crime of being a member of the Communist Party of Greece (&quot;KKE&quot;), which was banned at that time in Greece following the Greek Civil War. The death sentence pronounced after this trial was not carried out, but Beloyannis was put on trial again in early 1952, this time for alleged espionage, following the discovery of radio transmitters used by undercover Greek communists to communicate with the exiled leadership of the Party in the Soviet Union. At the end of this trial, he was sentenced to death and immediately taken out and shot. Papadopoulos was not involved in this second trial. The Beloyannis trials were highly controversial in Greece, and many Greeks consider that, like many Greek communists at the time, Beloyannis was shot for his political beliefs, rather than any real crimes. The trial was by military court-martial under Greek anti-insurgency legislation enacted at the time of the Greek Civil War, which remained in force even though the war had ended.

=== Rise to colonel in the 1960s ===
In 1956, Papadopoulos took part in a failed coup attempt against King Pávlos. In 1958, he helped create the Office of Military Studies, a surveillance authority, under General Gogousis. It was from this same office that the subsequently successful coup of 21 April 1967 emanated.

In 1964, Papadopoulos was transferred to an artillery division in Western Thrace by a decree of Defense Minister Garoufalias, a member of the Centre Union (&quot;EK&quot;). In June 1965, days before the onset of the major political turmoil known as &quot;Apostasia&quot;, he made national headlines after arresting two soldiers under his command and eight leftist civilians from settlements near his military camp, on charges that they had conspired to sabotage army vehicles by pouring sugar into the vehicles&#x27; petrol tanks. The ten were imprisoned and tortured, but it was eventually proven that Papadopoulos himself had sabotaged the vehicles. Andreas Papandreou wrote in his memoirs that Papadopoulos wanted to prove that under the Centre Union (&quot;EK&quot;) government, the Communists had been left free to undermine national security. Even after this scandal, Papadopoulos was not discharged from the army since the Prime Minister, Geórgios Papandreou, forgave him as a compatriot of his father.
In 1967, Papadopoulos was promoted to colonel. 

== 21 April 1967: &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; ==
That same year, on 21 April, a month before the general elections, Colonel Papadopoulos, along with fellow middle-ranking Army officers, led a successful coup, taking advantage of the volatile political situation that had arisen from a conflict between the young King Constantine II and the popular former prime minister, Geórgios Papandreou. Papadopoulos used his power gained from the coup to try to place Papandreou under house arrest and re-engineer the Greek political landscape rightward. Papadopoulos, along with the other junta members, are known in Greece by the term &quot;Aprilianoi&quot; (&#x27;Aprilians&#x27;), denoting the month of the coup. The term &quot;Aprilianoi&quot; has become synonymous with the term &quot;dictators of 1967–1974&quot;.

=== Regime of the Colonels ===

King Constantine appointed a new government nominally headed by Konstantinos Kollias. However, from the early stages, Papadopoulos was the strongman of the new regime. He was appointed Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Presidency in the Kollias government, and his position was further enhanced after the King&#x27;s abortive counter-coup on 13 December, when Papadopoulos replaced Kollias as Prime Minister. Not content with that, on 21 March 1972, he nominated himself Regent of Greece, succeeding General Geórgios Zoitakis.
Torture of political prisoners in general, and communists in particular, was not out of the question. Examples included severe beatings, isolation and, according to some sources, pulling out fingernails.

=== &quot;Patient in a cast&quot; and other metaphors ===
Throughout his tenure as the junta strongman, Papadopoulos often employed what have been described by the BBC as gory surgical metaphors, where he or the junta assumed the role of the &quot;medical doctor&quot;. The &quot;patient&quot; was Greece. Typically, Papadopoulos or the junta portrayed themselves as the &quot;doctor&quot; who operated on the &quot;patient&quot; by putting the patient&#x27;s &quot;foot&quot; in an orthopedic cast and applying restraints on the &quot;patient&quot;, tying him on a surgical bed and putting him under anesthesia to perform the &quot;operation&quot; so that the life of the &quot;patient&quot; would not be &quot;endangered&quot; during the operation. In one of his famous speeches, Papadopoulos mentioned: Translated as:
In the same speech Papadopoulos continued: 
which translates as follows:

Other metaphors contained religious imagery related to the resurrection of Christ at Easter: &quot;Χριστός Ανέστη – Ελλάς Ανέστη&quot; translating as &quot;Christ has risen – Greece has risen&quot;, alluding that the junta would &quot;save&quot; Greece and resurrect her into a greater, new Land. The theme of rebirth was used many times as a standard reply to avoid answering any questions as to how long the dictatorship would last:

The religious themes and rebirth metaphors are also seen in the following:

=== Assassination attempt ===
A failed assassination attempt against Papadopoulos was perpetrated by Alexandros Panagoulis in the morning of 13 August 1968, when Papadopoulos was driven from his summer residence in Lagonisi to Athens, escorted by his personal security motorcycles and cars. Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, since the boat sent to help him escape was instructed to leave at a specific time and he couldn&#x27;t swim there on time due to strong sea currents. After his arrest, he was taken to the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA) offices where he was questioned, beaten and tortured. On 17 November 1968, Panagoulis was sentenced to death but was personally pardoned by Papadopoulos, served only five years in prison, and after democracy was restored was elected a member of Parliament. He was regarded as an emblematic figure of the struggle to restore democracy, and as such has often been paralleled to Harmodius and Aristogeiton, two ancient Athenians known for their assassination of Hipparchus, brother of the tyrant Hippias.

=== Normalisation and attempts at liberalisation ===


Despite his heavy-handed rule, Papadopoulos was one of the more moderate members of the junta. He had indicated as early as 1968 that he was eager for reform. He had declared at the time that he did not want the &quot;Revolution of 21 April&quot; (as the coup was called by the junta&#x27;s supporters) to become a &#x27;regime&#x27;. Around the same time, he&#x27;d reached out to some old-line politicians, such as Spiros Markezinis. Several attempts to liberalise the regime during 1969 and 1970 were thwarted by the hardliners on the junta, including Ioannides. In fact, subsequent to his 1970 failed attempt at reform, he threatened to resign and was dissuaded only after the hardliners renewed their personal allegiance to him.

As internal dissatisfaction grew in the early 1970s, and especially after an abortive coup by the Navy in early 1973, Papadopoulos attempted to legitimise the regime by beginning a gradual &quot;democratisation&quot; (see also the article on the &quot;Metapolitefsi&quot;). On 1 June 1973, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president. He was confirmed in office via a controversial referendum. He furthermore sought the support of the old political establishment, but secured only the cooperation of Markezinis, who became prime minister. Concurrently, many restrictions were lifted and the army&#x27;s role significantly reduced. An interim constitution created a presidential republic. The president would serve an eight-year term, and was vested with sweeping—almost dictatorial—powers. The decision to return to (at least nominal) civilian rule and the restriction of the army&#x27;s role did not go nearly far enough for those who wanted full democracy. At the same time, this move was resented by many of the regime&#x27;s supporters, whose dissatisfaction with Papadopoulos would become evident a few months later.

===Ties to US intelligence===

Papadopoulos is widely reported to have had certain ties to the Central Intelligence Agency, and has also been reported to have undergone military and intelligence training in the United States during the 1950s.

On 1 July 1973, &quot;The Observer&quot; published an investigative journalism article that accused the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of engineering the 1967 coup, further writing that Papadopoulos was known among senior officials in the Joint United States Military Aid Assistance Group in Athens as &quot;the first CIA agent to become Premier of a European country&quot;. The following day, during CIA agent William Colby&#x27;s confirmation hearings to be Director of Central Intelligence, Colby was asked in response to the article if there was any justification for the assertions. Colby denied that the CIA had engineered the coup or that Papadopoulos was either a CIA agent or otherwise paid by the CIA, adding that &quot;[Papadopoulos] has been an official of the Greek Government at various times, and in those periods from time to time we worked with him in his official capacity.&quot;.

In 1977, John M. Maury, a CIA agent who was Chief of Station in Athens during the coup, wrote in an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the CIA had considered swaying the elections to prevent Papandreou from winning by promoting moderate candidates. The agency ultimately decided against the plan. As the election drew near, CIA agents were vaguely prodded by their Greek contacts about the possibility of a coup. Maury argues that the CIA&#x27;s choice to officially condemn suggestions of a military takeover and remain uninvolved led to the agency being taken by surprise by the events of April 21, 1967. He concludes: &quot;That we seriously attempted neither to influence nor to injure them is still taken by Greeks of all kinds as proof of U.S. complicity, or at least acquiescence, in the excesses of the dictatorship. And when the dictatorship eventually fell, to the shame of its perceived U.S. support was added the humiliation of perceived U.S. defeat.&quot;

A detailed study by Alexis Papachelas argues that Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s claim of U.S. involvement &quot;is wildly at variance with the facts&quot;: according to the study, U.S. officials had contemplated but rejected using the CIA to weaken the leftist flank of the Centre Union Party associated with Andreas, eventually determining that a prospective Centre Union government under Geórgios Papandreou would not pave the way for a takeover by Greek communists. As late as 20 April 1967, the U.S. embassy was instructed to pressure King Constantine II &quot;to accept the popular will and keep the army in its barracks.&quot; U.S. officials were reportedly stunned by the coup on 21 April because, while aware of coup plotting within Greek military circles, they never expected Greek officers to act independently of the monarchy.

== Fall of the Papadopoulos regime ==
After the events of the student uprising of 17 November at the National Technical University of Athens (see Athens Polytechnic uprising), the dictatorship was overthrown on 25 November 1973 by hardline elements in the Army. The outcry over Papadopoulos&#x27;s extensive reliance on the army to quell the student uprising gave Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis a pretext to oust him and replace him as the new strongman of the regime. Papadopoulos was put under house arrest at his villa, while Greece returned to an &quot;orthodox&quot; military dictatorship.

After democracy was restored in 1974, during the period of &quot;Metapolitefsi&quot; (&quot;regime change&quot;), Papadopoulos and his cohorts were arrested and were eventually put on trial for high treason, mutiny, torture, and other crimes and misdemeanors.

On 23 August 1975, he and several others were found guilty and were sentenced to death, which was later commuted to life imprisonment.

==Personal life==
In 1942, after 3 years of courtship and 6 months of engagement, he married Niki Vasileiadi (died 2015), originally from Ilion of Asia Minor. Together they had a son, Christos (born 1943), a chemist, who lives in the United States and Chrysoula (1945–2004). In 1954, he met and entered into a relationship with Despina Sereti (née Gaspari) (1930–2023), an employee of the Hellenic Intelligence Service and the Geographical Service of the Greek Army, at the time Papadopoulos was posted to the Artillery Division of the VI Division, with the rank of Major. Together, they had a daughter out of wedlock, Hypermachia. Since then, he was estranged from Vasileiadi.

=== Divorce by decree rumors ===
The separation, however lengthy, could not lead to divorce at first because, under Greece&#x27;s restrictive divorce laws of that era, spousal consent was required. It is claimed that, as a remedy to the issue, in 1970, as Prime Minister of the dictatorship, he decreed a custom-made divorce law with a strict time limit (and a built-in sunset clause) that enabled him to get the divorce. After having served its purpose, the law eventually expired automatically. Those reports are contradicted by a 1975 article by Makedonia, which claims that Vasiliadi had filed for divorce on the 19th of September 1969, with the divorce being granted by the Athens Court of First Instance on the 27th of October of the same year on &quot;joint liability&quot; grounds. Makedonia&#x27;s claims are further corroborated by the failure of newer sources to provide the decree specifics (type, number, Efimeris tis Kyverniseos Issue number). Such rumors are baseless in the case of Papadopoulos&#x27; divorce, but in 1972 a bill that would allow divorces on the basis of long-term separation (featuring a built-in sunset clause) was put forward by the government, only to meet the opposition of the Church of Greece. Such a law (but without a sunset clause) came to be only in 1979, a decade after the divorce of Vasileiadi and Papadopoulos.

In March 1970, he married Gaspari, with whom he lived throughout the years of his separation from Vasileiadi. Gaspari, immediately after the wedding, informally assumed the role of First Lady of Greece, until his overthrow in November 1973. They remained married until his death.

==Death==
Papadopoulos showed no remorse and steadfastly refused to apply for parole or amnesty or to use the leniency provisions that allowed him to be released on the grounds of ill health, as did several of his associates, such as Makarezos and Zoitakis. In the summer of 1996, his health deteriorated and he was diagnosed with ALS and bladder cancer, resulting in his being hospitalized for three years in an Athens hospital until his death on June 27, 1999. He was buried in First Cemetery of Athens three days later, in the presence of old associates and regime sympathisers.

== Legacy ==
Today, Papadopoulos is a symbol of authoritarianism and xenophobia. After the restoration of democracy, some support for his type of politics remained which was, for a time, bolstered by the National Political Union (&quot;EPEN&quot;), a small political party that declared him its honorary leader. The &quot;EPEN&quot; eventually dissolved, with supporters scattering to various other political parties such as the Popular Orthodox Rally (&quot;LAOS&quot;) and criminal organisations like Golden Dawn (&quot;XA&quot;).

<text>A Red Tory is an adherent of a centre-right or paternalistic-conservative political philosophy derived from the Tory tradition. It is most predominant in Canada; however, it is also found in the United Kingdom, where it is more commonly known as one nation conservatism. This philosophy tends to favour communitarian social policies, while maintaining a degree of fiscal discipline and a respect of social and political order. It is contrasted with &quot;Blue Tory&quot; or &quot;High Tory&quot;. Some Red Tories view themselves as small-c conservatives.

In Canada, Red Toryism is found in provincial and federal Conservative political parties. The history of Red Toryism marks differences in the development of the political cultures of Canada and the United States. Canadian conservatism and American conservatism have been different from each other in fundamental ways, including their stances on social issues and the role of government in society.

Red Tory governments in Canada, such as those of John A. Macdonald, Robert Borden, and John Diefenbaker, were known for supporting an active role for the government in the economy. This included the creation of government-owned and operated Crown Corporations such as the Canadian National Railway, and the development and protection of Canadian industries with programs such as the National Policy.

The adjective &quot;red&quot; refers to the economically left-leaning nature of Red Toryism in comparison with Blue Toryism, since socialist and other leftist parties have traditionally used the colour red. In Canada today, however, red is commonly associated with the Liberal Party. The term reflects the broad ideological range traditionally found within conservatism in Canada.

== Canada ==

=== Philosophy ===
Historically, Canadian conservatism has been derived from the Tory tradition, with a distinctive concern for a balance between individual rights and collectivism, as mediated through a traditional pre-industrial standard of morality – which has never been as evident in American conservatism.

Red Toryism derives largely from a classical conservative tradition that maintained that the unequal division of wealth and political privilege among social classes can be justified if members of the privileged class practiced &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; and contributed to the common good. Red Tories supported traditional institutions such as religion and the monarchy, and maintenance of the social order. This position was later manifested in their support for some aspects of the welfare state. This belief in a common good, as expanded on in Colin Campbell and William Christian&#x27;s &quot;Political Parties and Ideologies in Canada&quot;, is at the root of Red Toryism.

=== Origins ===
In distinction to the American experience where class divisions were seen as undemocratic (although still existing), Canadian Tories adopted a more paternalistic view of government. Monarchy, public order and good government – understood as dedication to the common good – preceded, moderated and balanced a belief in individual rights and liberty. Anthony Hall has argued that Red Toryism in Canada developed specifically in opposition to the American Revolution and its ideology.
This type of Canadian conservatism is derived largely from the Tory tradition developed by English conservative thinkers and statesmen such as Richard Hooker; the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury; and Benjamin Disraeli, later the first Earl of Beaconsfield. The primary influences on Canadian Toryism in the Victorian age were Disraeli&#x27;s One Nation Conservatism and the radical Toryism advocated by Lord Randolph Churchill. Inherent in these Tory traditions was the ideal of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; and a conservative communitarianism.

In Victorian times, these ideas were the pre-eminent strains of conservative thought in the British Empire, and were advanced by many in the Tory faction of John A. Macdonald&#x27;s conservative coalition in the Canadas. None of this lineage denies that Tory traditions of communitarianism and collectivism had existed in the British North American colonies since the Loyalist exodus from the American colonies between 1776 and 1796. It is this aspect that is one of the primary points of difference between the conservative political cultures of Canada and the United States.

The explicit notion of a &quot;Red&quot; Toryism was developed by Gad Horowitz in the 1960s, who argued that there was a significant Tory ideology in Canada. This vision contrasted Canada with the United States, which was seen as lacking this collectivist tradition because it was expunged from the American political culture after the American Revolution and the exodus of the United Empire Loyalists. Horowitz argued that Canada&#x27;s stronger socialist movement grew from Toryism, and that this explains why socialism has never had much electoral success in the United States. This also meant that Canadian conceptions of liberty were more collective and communitarian, and could be seen as more directly derivative of the English tradition, than that of American practices and theories.

Horowitz identified George Grant and Eugene Forsey as exemplars of this strain of thought, which saw a central role for Christianity in public affairs and was profoundly critical of capitalism and the dominant business &quot;élites&quot;. Forsey became a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) member, while Grant remained a Conservative – although he became disdainful of an overall shift in policy toward liberal economics and continentalism, something Forsey saw happening decades earlier. When the Conservative government of John Diefenbaker fell in 1963, largely due to the BOMARC controversy, Grant wrote &quot;Lament for a Nation: The Defeat of Canadian Nationalism&quot;, a book about the nature of traditional Canadian nationhood and independence that would become a lodestar of Red Toryism. Grant defined an essential difference between the founding of the Canadian and American nations when he wrote &quot;Canada was predicated on the rights of nations as well as on the rights of individuals.&quot; This definition recognized Canada&#x27;s multi-faceted founding nature as an English-speaking, aboriginal and Francophone nation.

=== Predominance and decline ===
Many of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s leaders have been labelled &#x27;Red Tories&#x27;, including Sir Robert Borden, John Diefenbaker, Robert Stanfield and Joe Clark. Many others have been influential as cabinet ministers and thinkers, such as Davie Fulton, Dalton Camp, Roy McMurtry and John Farthing. The main bastions of Red Toryism were Ontario, the Atlantic provinces and urban Manitoba, areas where the Red Tories dominated provincial politics, and in some federal elections Quebec, where the federal PC party operated largely separately from provincial politics. During 42 years, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario was led by Red Tories such as George A. Drew, Leslie Frost, John Robarts and Bill Davis, all of which supported increased funding for infrastructure, health care and education. Throughout the Atlantic provinces, traditional Red Tories are the dominant force in the provincial Progressive Conservative parties because of their support of the welfare state. As premier of Nova Scotia from 1956 to 1967, Red Tory Robert Stanfield introduced reforms for education, health care and civil liberties. The Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta included a broad spectrum from Red Tories to social conservatives, but Peter Lougheed who led the party from 1968 to 1985 and was Premier from 1971 to 1985 was a Red Tory and Lougheed&#x27;s tenure was characterized by active economic measures and social reforms. In the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s, Manitoba saw great prosperity in economic and social reforms thanks to the leadership of Premier Dufferin Roblin, a Red Tory, who governed to the left of the previous government led by Douglas Campbell, the leader of the Liberal-Progressive coalition.

The dominance of Red Toryism can be seen as a part of the international post-war consensus that saw the welfare state embraced by the major parties of most of the western world. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the federal Progressive Conservative Party suffered a string of electoral defeats under Red Tory leaders Robert Stanfield and Joe Clark. Pressure began to grow within the party for a new approach. Clark&#x27;s leadership was successfully challenged, and in the 1983 PC leadership convention, members endorsed Brian Mulroney who rejected free trade with the United States as proposed by another Blue Tory candidate, John Crosbie. Despite this early perception, the eagerness in which Mulroney&#x27;s ministry embraced the Macdonald Commission&#x27;s advocacy of bilateral free trade would come to indicate a sharp drift toward libertarian or liberal economic policies, comparable to such contemporaries as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

Following Mulroney, the Canadian conservative movement suffered a profound schism in the 1993 election, splitting into the distinct Progressive Conservative and Reform parties. The Red Tory tradition remained loyal to the Progressive Conservatives, while many &quot;blue&quot; Tories aligned with social conservatives in the Reform Party. Various Unite the Right efforts achieved only modest success in the 1990s and early 2000s – most notably, while the creation of the Canadian Alliance in 2000 attracted a small number of Progressive Conservatives, it failed to attract those in the Red Tory tradition or to replace the Progressive Conservatives.

Following the victory of Peter MacKay at the 2003 PC convention, and in violation of an informal contract signed with rival candidate David Orchard, MacKay merged the Tories with Stephen Harper&#x27;s Alliance to create the modern federal Conservative Party in 2003. When first created, one of the most important issues facing the Conservative Party was what Red Tories would do. The union resulted in a number of Red Tories leaving the new party, either to retire or to cross the floor to the Liberal Party. Members of Parliament (MPs) André Bachand, John Herron, Joe Clark and Scott Brison declined to join the new party – Brison immediately crossed the floor to the Liberals, Bachand and Clark sat out the remainder of the 37th Canadian Parliament as Progressive Conservatives and then retired from office in the 2004 election, and Herron sat as a Progressive Conservative for the remainder of the term but then ran for re-election in 2004 as a Liberal.

Clark, a former Prime Minister, gave a tepid endorsement to the Liberals in the 2004 election, calling Paul Martin &quot;the devil we know&quot;. Rick Borotsik joined the new party but openly criticized it from within, did not run for re-election in 2004, and also publicly endorsed the Liberals over the Conservatives during the campaign. Additionally, three of the twenty-six Progressive Conservative Senators, Lowell Murray, Norman Atkins and William Doody, decided to continue serving as Progressive Conservatives, rejecting membership in the new party. Atkins, who died in 2010, remained allied with the still-existent Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and Murray, from Atlantic Canada, opposed the merger of the federal PC party. Most, like prominent Senator Marjory LeBreton, came to endorse the new party and have been vocal and visible supporters of the party both between and during elections. Elaine McCoy and Nancy Ruth were later appointed to the Senate by Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin, and chose to designate themselves as Progressive Conservatives. Doody has since died, and Ruth joined the Conservative Party caucus in 2006.

Despite the union, some former Progressive Conservative members still identify themselves as Red Tory, including high-profile political strategist turned Senator Hugh Segal, who in 2013 continued to describe himself as a Red Tory, which has put him at increasing odds with the government on several occasions.

A &#x27;grassroots&#x27; movement of dissenting Red Tories, who opposed the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s merger with the Canadian Alliance, gathered signatures on Elections Canada forms from over 200 Progressive Conservative members and applied to re-register as the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. This name was refused by Elections Canada. Having anticipated such a rejection, the coordinators had had the &#x27;SignaTories&#x27; also sign a second application to at least continue with the ballot name &quot;PC Party&quot;. On March 26, 2004, the Progressive Canadian Party was registered with Elections Canada. It aimed to be perceived as a continuation of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, but achieved only very minor results. The party achieved its largest vote to date in the 2006 election, with 14,151 votes in 25 ridings (about 0.1% of the nationwide total). The party was deregistered by the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada on November 30, 2019, for failing to comply with Canada Elections Act requirements set out in subsection 415(1).

=== Revival in provincial politics ===
With the rise of the conservative Wildrose Party in Alberta in the 2010s, the term &quot;Red Tory&quot; was revived as a name for the moderate wing of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, which was seen to gain power under the premiership of Ed Stelmach and Alison Redford. As premier, Redford was closely associated with centrist Tories such as Joe Clark and Peter Lougheed, whereas Danielle Smith—the then Wildrose leader—was associated with the right-wing Tories Ralph Klein and Tom Flanagan. Redford was called a &quot;Red Tory&quot; by Chantal Hébert, Ezra Levant and others in the media.

The Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia under Tim Houston, branding themselves as Red Tories, won a majority government in the 2021 Nova Scotia general election. Houston&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives campaigned on using provincial resources to improve healthcare services.

== United Kingdom ==

In 2009, Phillip Blond promoted communitarian traditionalist conservative ideas within the Conservative Party with a book titled &quot;Red Tory: How Left and Right Have Broken Britain and How We Can Fix It&quot; and by creating the think-tank ResPublica. Leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron spoke at ResPublica&#x27;s launch and Red Tory ideas were said to be a major influence on him.

In Scotland, the term &quot;Red Tory&quot; has been used to describe the Scottish Labour Party, who some see as assisting with, or failing to oppose, certain Conservative policies. The term was first used in this context by Scottish independence supporters, following Labour&#x27;s participation in the Better Together campaign in opposition to Scottish independence alongside the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

Evolving from the Scottish usage of the term, the term, along with the terms Blairite, Brownite and &quot;centrist&quot;, have been used, particularly on social media by members on the political left of the Labour Party to refer to MPs and Labour Party figures who withheld support for Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader from 2015 to 2020. The term has also been used as a pejorative against current Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has been seen by some to have moved the party too far away from traditional left-wing positions.

== Definitional drift ==

The term &quot;Red Tory&quot; is often used today in the Canadian media not to refer to those in the tradition of George Grant, Dalton Camp or Robert Stanfield, but simply to moderates in the conservative movement, particularly those who reject or do not sufficiently embrace social conservatism. For example, in the 2004 Conservative Party leadership election, Tony Clement was sometimes referred to as a Red Tory even though he advocated privatization, tax cuts and the curtailment of social and economic development spending. Traditional Red Tories would reject most if not all of these stances.

More recently, Phillip Blond, director of British think tank ResPublica, has gained traction with his so-called Red Tory thesis which criticizes what he refers to as the welfare state and the market state. Phillip Blond promotes a radical communitarian traditionalist conservatism. It inveighs against welfare states as well as market monopolies and instead respects traditional values and institutions, localism, devolution of powers from the central governments to local communities, small businesses, and volunteerism. Blond also favours empowering social enterprises, charities and other elements of civil society to solve problems such as poverty. He has been mentioned as a major influence on the thinking of David Cameron and other Tories in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis. He advocates a civic state as the ideal, where the common good of society is valued and solutions emerge from local communities. Blond&#x27;s ideas also parallel the socioeconomic tradition of distributism, as is evidenced by Blond&#x27;s appearance at a distributist conference at Oxford University in 2009 sponsored by the G. K. Chesterton Institute for Faith and Culture. Blond&#x27;s Red Toryism has been embraced by traditionalist conservatives in the United States, such as economist John Medaille.

The editors of the web log &quot;Front Porch Republic&quot;, however, define Red Toryism as a &quot;&quot;left&quot; or &quot;socialist&quot; conservatism&quot; and further go on to say that it is &quot;not a traditionalism that happened to oddly pick up a few egalitarian rhetorical tropes along the way.&quot; This is more in keeping with the typical dictionary definition of the term as: &quot;(Canadian) a Conservative who holds liberal or mildly socialist views on certain fiscal and social issues.&quot; In this regard, Phillip Blond&#x27;s views are probably closer to what has been referred to as High Tory.

<text>The American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), founded in Hollywood in 1919, is a cultural, educational, and professional organization that is neither a labor union nor a guild. The society was organized to advance the science and art of cinematography and gather a wide range of cinematographers to discuss techniques and ideas and to advocate for motion pictures as a type of art form. Currently, the president of the ASC is Shelly Johnson.

Members use the post-nominal letters &quot;ASC&quot;. On the 1920 film titled &quot;Sand&quot;, cinematographer Joseph H. August, who was an original member of the ASC, became the first individual to have the &quot;ASC&quot; appear after his name on the onscreen credit.

Only cinematographers and special effect supervisors can become an ASC member. Basic requirements include being a director of photography for a minimum five out of the last eight years, having a high professional reputation and being recommended by three active or retired ASC members.

== History ==

In the beginning of cinema, directors and photographers in the United States had a similar problem: they had &quot;big, ugly white streaks&quot; that resulted from static electricity discharged from the cameras. Two separate groups in the United States worked together to find a solution to this problem. The two groups were the Cinema Camera Club and the Static Club of America.

A precursor to the ASC, the Cinema Camera Club in New York City was founded in 1913 by Arthur Miller, Phil Rosen, and Frank Kugler. Arthur and his brother, William Miller, both filmmakers in New York City, worked together and established a union for cinematography workers called the Motion Picture Industry Union. Miller left to work in Hollywood, California, one year after the Motion Picture Industry Union was formed.

In 1918, Phil Rosen asked the president of the Cinema Camera Club of California, Charles Rosher, whether he could help reorganize the association by creating a national organization with &quot;membership by invitation and a strong educational component&quot;. This reorganisation and the setup of the bylaws occurred on December 21, 1918. The ASC was officially authorized by the State of California on January 8, 1919.

In 2014, the ASC admitted its first member with no background in live action feature film, Pixar&#x27;s Sharon Calahan, who had worked entirely in computer animation. The society started the ASC Master Class education program in the same year (2014). This program allows members of the ASC and other professionals to teach students from all walks of life on various subjects including composition, lighting, angles, creating mood among other techniques of visual storytelling.

In 2017, John Bailey, an ASC member, was elected as the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making him the first cinematographer to take up such a position.

== Publications ==
In the 1920s, the ASC began printing a four-page newsletter titled &quot;The American Cinematographer&quot; in 1920. According to the ASC, &quot;&quot;The American Cinematographer&quot; covers the technology and artistry of visual storytelling, offering print and digital editions.&quot; Within this publication, a wide range of cinematographer and technical information was produced through a variety of means such as interviews, articles, blogs and podcasts.

Other than the magazine, the ASC also publishes the &quot;American Cinematographer Manual&quot;. The first edition was published in 1935 by Jackson J. Rose as &quot;The American Cinematographer Hand Book and Reference Guide&quot;. The Hand Book evolved from the &quot;Cinematographic Annual&quot; only published twice, in 1930 and 1931. Rose&#x27;s handbook went through nine editions by the middle of the 1950s, and it was from this book that the modern &quot;American Cinematographer Manual&quot; originated. The first edition of the new manual was published in 1960 and is now in its 11th edition, published in 2022.
