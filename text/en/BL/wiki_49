<text>John Lowry Dobson (14 September 1915 – 15 January 2014) was an American amateur astronomer and is best known for the Dobsonian telescope, a portable, low-cost Newtonian reflector telescope. He was also known for his efforts to promote awareness of astronomy (and his unorthodox views of physical cosmology) through public lectures including his performances of &quot;sidewalk astronomy&quot;. Dobson was also the co-founder of the amateur astronomical group, the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers.

== Biography ==
Dobson was born to Methodist missionary parents in China, but moved with his family back to the U.S. as a young child. He was a “belligerent atheist” as a young man. After earning a master&#x27;s in chemistry, he encountered a teacher of a Vedanta monastic order, which seeks to integrate Veda-based religious precepts with rational inquiry, and joined the order, where he served as a Vedantan monk for 23 years. After leaving the order (in part because the time he surreptitiously dedicated to building telescopes did not meet the approval of the leader of the order&#x27;s San Francisco monastery) he became an itinerant popularizer of amateur astronomy and sidewalk astronomy. In his later life, Dobson resumed regular association with a branch of the Vedanta order in southern California, but continued to dedicate most of his time to promoting public astronomy.

=== Early life and education ===
Dobson was born in Beijing, China. His maternal grandfather was the missionary Hiram Harrison Lowry, his mother was a musician, and his father taught zoology at a university. He and his parents moved to San Francisco, California in 1927. His father accepted a teaching position at Lowell High School and taught there until the 1950s. Dobson spent 23 years in a monastery, after which he became more active in promoting astronomy.

As a teen, Dobson became a &quot;belligerent&quot; atheist. He described his state of mind at that time:
: &quot;I could see that these two notions cannot arise in the same being: &#x27;do unto others as you would that they do unto you&#x27; and &#x27;if you&#x27;re not a good boy, it&#x27;s into hell for keeps.&#x27; ... They must be spoofing us. So I became an atheist – a belligerent atheist. If anybody started a conversation about the subject, I was a belligerent atheist.&quot;

Over time Dobson became interested in the universe and its workings. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in 1943, working in E. O. Lawrence&#x27;s lab.

=== Time at the monastery ===
In 1944 he attended a lecture by a Vedantan swami. Dobson said the swami “revealed to him a world he had never seen.” That same year Dobson joined the Vedanta Society monastery in San Francisco, becoming a monk of the Ramakrishna Order. “One of John&#x27;s responsibilities at the monastery was to reconcile astronomy with the teachings of Vedanta. That job led him to build telescopes on the side. He took to wheeling them around outside the monastery, fascinating the neighbors who would congregate around him.”

Dobson&#x27;s interest in telescope building was in part to better understand the universe, and in part to inspire in others a curiosity about the cosmos. To this end, he often offered assistance and corresponded about his work with those outside the monastery. Amateur telescope making was not part of the curriculum at the monastery, however, and much of his correspondence was written in code so as to attract less attention. For instance, a telescope was referred to as a &quot;geranium&quot;, which is a type of flower. A &quot;potted geranium&quot; referred to a telescope in a tube and rocker, while a &quot;geranium in bloom&quot; referred to a telescope whose mirror was now aluminized.

Eventually Dobson was given the option of ceasing his telescope building or leaving the order. He chose to stop building telescopes so that he could remain at the monastery. But one day another monk wrongly accused him as missing and reported him to the head swami. Dobson was expelled in 1967. However, he maintains that the accusation was not the true reason for his expulsion. The true reason, he contends, was a result of a misunderstanding. The head swami read a paper that was presumed written by Dobson, that contradicted the reconciliation of science with Vedanta, and the swami thought Dobson had rejected the swami&#x27;s teaching.

=== Amateur astronomy ===
Having left the order in 1967, Dobson in 1968 co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers, an amateur astronomy organization that aims to popularize astronomy among people on the street, along with Bruce Sams and Jeffery Roloff. Sams had built a large telescope but because at the time he was only age 12, he was not eligible for membership in the only local club – the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers – thus the “San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers” was founded. It was also at this time that Dobson&#x27;s simple form of telescope – which came to be known as the Dobsonian – became well known after he started teaching classes to the public on how to make your own telescope.

He was later asked to speak at the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood, and continued to spend two months there each year teaching telescope and cosmology classes. He spent two more months at his home in San Francisco, and spent most of the rest of each year traveling as an invited guest for astronomical societies, where he spoke about telescope building, sidewalk astronomy, and his views of cosmology and the scientific establishment.

===Amateur cosmology===
Dobson claimed the Big Bang model did not hold up to scrutiny, and instead advocated a non-standard cosmology; a “recycling” Steady State model of the universe, where matter in the universe is forever expanding outward, but matter also “recycles” over time via quantum tunneling. In an essay entitled, “&quot;Origins&quot;”, Dobson also argued that such a universe could allow for life to be ubiquitous and ever-present.

===Honours===
In 2004, the Crater Lake Institute presented Dobson with its Annual Award for Excellence in Public Service for pioneering sidewalk astronomy in the national parks and forests, “where curious minds and dark skies collide”.

In 2005, the Smithsonian magazine listed Dobson as among 35 individuals who have made a major difference during the lifetime of that periodical.

=== Death ===
Dobson died while in Providence / Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California on January 15, 2014. He was 98.

== Promotion of astronomy ==

=== The Dobsonian telescope ===

Dobson&#x27;s most enduring legacy is the refinement and promotion of a design for a large, portable, low-cost reflecting telescope, now known as the &quot;Dobsonian telescope&quot;. The design is a very simple, low cost alt-azimuth mounted Newtonian telescope that employs common materials such as plywood, Formica®, PVC closet flanges, cardboard construction tubes, recycled porthole glass, and indoor-outdoor carpet. This type of simplified altazimuth mount has since been commonly referred to as a &quot;Dobsonian mount&quot; in amateur astronomical circles. Its construction method makes the typical Dobsonian telescope portable, inexpensive, very stable, and easy to manufacture, while revolutionizing
the sheer size of telescopes available to amateur astronomers, with optical diameters unheard of before their appearance.

The design is named after Dobson because he is credited for being the first person to have combined all these construction techniques in a single telescope design. Dobson himself was reluctant to take credit, pointing out that he built it that way because it was all he needed. In his own words, he joked that he was &quot;too retarded&quot; to build a telescope with a more sophisticated equatorial telescope mount.
With its simplicity of construction and use, the Dobsonian has become a very popular design today, particularly for large amateur telescopes.
The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, in Washington, D.C., uses a Dobsonian telescope in the museum&#x27;s public observatory, alongside other solar telescopes.

=== Sidewalk astronomers ===
Dobson co-founded the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers in coordination with two other people, having cheaply constructed several telescopes that were easy to use, including a telescope that was built for approximately US$300. Rather than have regular meetings, the organization simply set up telescopes on the sidewalk during clear evenings, offering to show and explain the night sky to people passing by. The telescope which Dobson used most frequently on the streets of San Francisco, was a classic 9-inch aperture Dobsonian, with a typical porthole-glass mirror of outstanding optical quality, made by one of his own students in a mirror making class. This telescope was portable enough that it could be taken by Dobson from his residence to many busy street corners in San Francisco, using the city&#x27;s Muni public transportation. Appropriately nicknamed &quot;Tumbleweed&quot;, since it traveled randomly about to numerous public observing locations, this 9-inch telescope is now shared among many astronomy clubs and organizations around the world, allowing people everywhere to observe the heavens with such an iconic instrument, just as Dobson would have wished.

Unexpectedly, the Sidewalk Astronomers were invited to the 1969 Riverside Telescope Makers Conference (Riverside County, California). The Dobsonian telescope brought by the Sidewalk Astronomers was unconventional, because most telescopes at such meetings tended to be smaller, on equatorial mounts, and designed for astrophotography rather than optical viewing. Surprisingly (and controversially at the time) Dobson&#x27;s telescope tied in first prize for best optics. It was also awarded the runner up prize for mechanics, despite the mechanics of the telescope and its mount being exceptionally simple.

Sidewalk Astronomers has since become a prominent organization, recognized for its taking of astronomy to the public via &quot;sidewalk astronomy&quot;. The current organization has members throughout the world, and continues to promote public service astronomy by putting telescopes on street corners in urban areas. Members of the organization also visit national parks giving slide show presentations, providing telescope viewing, and explaining the universe.

== Publications by John Dobson ==

A 1991 book by Dobson &amp; Sperling on telescope-making helped popularize what came to be known as the Dobsonian mount, and treats the &quot;why&quot; as being as important as the &quot;how&quot;. It covers Dobson&#x27;s background and his philosophy on astronomy and the universe, and his belief in the importance of popular access to astronomy for proper appreciation of the universe. Dobson has also published two books on cosmology.

== John Dobson in the media ==
Dobson&#x27;s life and ideas are the subject of the 2005 documentary &quot;A Sidewalk Astronomer&quot;. He was also featured in the PBS series &quot;The Astronomers&quot;, and appeared twice on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Dobson also appears as one of the speakers in &quot;Universe: The Cosmology Quest&quot;, a documentary about non-standard cosmological theories.

<doc id="402244" wikidata="Q775155" url="?curid=402244" title="Gold cyanidation">
<text>Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur–Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore through conversion to a water-soluble coordination complex. It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in silver extraction, usually after froth flotation.

Production of reagents for mineral processing to recover gold represents 70% of cyanide consumption globally. While other metals, such as copper, zinc, and silver, are also recovered using cyanide, gold remains the primary driver of this technology. The highly toxic nature of cyanide has led to controversy regarding its use in gold mining, with it being banned in some parts of the world. However, when used with appropriate safety measures, cyanide can be safely employed in gold extraction processes. One critical factor in its safe use is maintaining an alkaline pH level above 10.5, which is typically controlled using lime in industrial-scale operations. Lime plays an essential role in gold processing, ensuring that the pH remains at the correct level to mitigate risks associated with cyanide use.

==History==
In 1783, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold dissolved in aqueous solutions of cyanide. Through the work of Bagration (1844), Elsner (1846), and Faraday (1847), it was determined that each gold atom required two cyanide ions, i.e. the stoichiometry of the soluble compound.

===Industrial process===

The expansion of gold mining in the Rand of South Africa began to slow down in the 1880s, as the new deposits found tended to contain pyritic ore. The gold could not be extracted from this compound with any of the then available chemical processes or technologies.
In 1887, John Stewart MacArthur, working in collaboration with brothers Robert and William Forrest for the Tennant Company in Glasgow, Scotland, developed the MacArthur–Forrest process for the extraction of gold from gold ores. Several patents were issued in the same year. By suspending the crushed ore in a cyanide solution, a separation of up to 96 percent pure gold was achieved.
The process was first used on the Rand in 1890 and, despite operational imperfections, led to a boom of investment as larger gold mines were opened up.

By 1891, Nebraska pharmacist Gilbert S. Peyton had refined the process at his Mercur Mine in Utah, &quot;the first mining plant in the United States to make a commercial success of the cyanide process on gold ores.&quot; In 1896, Bodländer confirmed that oxygen was necessary for the process, something that had been doubted by MacArthur, and discovered that hydrogen peroxide was formed as an intermediate.
Around 1900, the American metallurgist Charles Washington Merrill (1869–1956) and his engineer Thomas Bennett Crowe improved the treatment of the cyanide leachate, by using vacuum and zinc dust. Their process is the Merrill–Crowe process.

==Chemical reactions==
The chemical reaction for the dissolution of gold, the &quot;Elsner equation&quot;, follows:
: 4Au + 8NaCN + O2 + 2H2O → 4Na[Au(CN)2] + 4NaOH

Potassium cyanide and calcium cyanide are sometimes used in place of sodium cyanide.

Gold is one of the few metals that dissolves in the presence of cyanide ions and oxygen. The soluble gold species is dicyanoaurate. from which it can be recovered by adsorption onto activated carbon.

==Application==
The ore is comminuted using grinding machinery. Depending on the ore, it is sometimes further concentrated by froth flotation or by centrifugal (gravity) concentration. Water is added to produce a slurry or &quot;pulp&quot;. The basic ore slurry can be combined with a solution of sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide; many operations use calcium cyanide, which is more cost effective.

To prevent the creation of toxic hydrogen cyanide during processing, slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or soda (sodium hydroxide) is added to the extracting solution to ensure that the acidity during cyanidation is maintained over pH 10.5 - strongly basic.
Lead nitrate can improve gold leaching speed and quantity recovered, particularly in processing partially oxidized ores.

===Effect of dissolved oxygen===
Oxygen is one of the reagents consumed during cyanidation, accepting the electrons from the gold, and a deficiency in dissolved oxygen slows leaching rate. Air or pure oxygen gas can be purged through the pulp to maximize the dissolved oxygen concentration. Intimate oxygen-pulp contactors are used to increase the partial pressure of the oxygen in contact with the solution, thus raising the dissolved oxygen concentration much higher than the saturation level at atmospheric pressure. Oxygen can also be added by dosing the pulp with hydrogen peroxide solution.

===Pre-aeration and ore washing===
In some ores, particularly those that are partially sulfidized, aeration (prior to the introduction of cyanide) of the ore in water at high pH can render elements such as iron and sulfur less reactive to cyanide, therefore making the gold cyanidation process more efficient. Specifically, the oxidation of iron to iron (III) oxide and subsequent precipitation as iron hydroxide minimizes loss of cyanide from the formation of ferrous cyanide complexes. The oxidation of sulfur compounds to sulfate ions avoids the consumption of cyanide to thiocyanate (SCN−) byproduct.

==Recovery of gold from cyanide solutions==
In order of decreasing economic efficiency, the common processes for recovery of the solubilized gold from solution are (certain processes may be precluded from use by technical factors):
* Carbon in pulp
* Electrowinning
* Merrill–Crowe process
==Cyanide remediation processes==
The cyanide remaining in tails streams from gold plants is potentially hazardous. Therefore, some operations process the cyanide-containing waste streams in a detoxification step. This step lowers the concentrations of these cyanide compounds. The INCO-licensed process and the Caro&#x27;s acid process oxidise the cyanide to cyanate, which is not as toxic as the cyanide ion, and which can then react to form carbonates and ammonia:
: + [O] → 
: + 2 → + 
The Inco process can typically lower cyanide concentrations to below 50 mg/L, whereas the Caro&#x27;s acid process can lower cyanide levels to between 10 and 50 mg/L, with the lower concentrations achievable in solution streams rather than slurries. Caro&#x27;s acid – peroxomonosulfuric acid (H2SO5) - converts cyanide to cyanate. Cyanate then hydrolyses to ammonium and carbonate ions. The Caro&#x27;s acid process is able to achieve discharge levels of Weak Acid Dissociable&quot; (WAD) cyanide below 50 mg/L, which is generally suitable for discharge to tailings. Hydrogen peroxide and basic chlorination can also be used to oxidize cyanide, although these approaches are less common. Typically, this process blows compressed air through the tailings while adding sodium metabisulfite, which releases SO2. Lime is added to maintain the pH at around 8.5, and copper sulfate is added as a catalyst if there is insufficient copper in the ore extract. This procedure can reduce concentrations of WAD cyanide to below the 10 ppm mandated by the EU&#x27;s Mining Waste Directive. This level compares to the 66-81 ppm free cyanide and 500-1000 ppm total cyanide in the pond at Baia Mare. Remaining free cyanide degrades in the pond, while cyanate ions hydrolyse to ammonium. Studies show that residual cyanide trapped in the gold-mine tailings causes persistent release of toxic metals (e.g. mercury ) into the groundwater and surface water systems.

==Effects on the environment==

Despite being used in 90% of gold production: gold cyanidation is controversial due to the toxic nature of cyanide. Although aqueous solutions of cyanide degrade rapidly in sunlight, the less-toxic products, such as cyanates and thiocyanates, may persist for some years. The famous disasters have killed few people — humans can be warned not to drink or go near polluted water, but cyanide spills can have a devastating effect on rivers, sometimes killing everything for several miles downstream. The cyanide could be washed out of river systems and, as long as organisms can migrate from unpolluted areas upstream, affected areas can soon be repopulated. Longer term impact and accumulation of cyanide in riparian or limnological benthos and environmental fate is less clear. According to Romanian authorities, in the Someș river below Baia Mare, the plankton returned to 60% of normal within 16 days of the spill; the numbers were not confirmed by Hungary or Yugoslavia.
Famous cyanide spills include:
Such spills have prompted fierce protests at new mines that involve use of cyanide, such as Roşia Montană in Romania, Lake Cowal in Australia, Pascua Lama in Chile, and Bukit Koman in Malaysia.

==Alternatives to cyanide==
Although cyanide is cheap, effective, and biodegradable, its high toxicity &amp; increasingly poor impact on a mine&#x27;s political and social license to operate, has incentivized alternative methods for extracting gold. Other extractants have been examined including thiosulfate (S2O32−), thiourea (SC(NH2)2), iodine/iodide, ammonia, liquid mercury, and alpha-cyclodextrin. Challenges include reagent cost and the efficiency of gold recovery, although some chlorination process using sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) have shown promise in terms or reagent regeneration. These technologies are at a pre-commercialisation stage and compare favourably to equivalent cyanidation methods, including gold recovery percentage. Thiourea has been implemented commercially for ores containing stibnite. Yet another alternative to cyanidation is the family of glycine-based lixiviants.

==Legislation==

The US states of Montana and Wisconsin, the Czech Republic, Hungary, have banned cyanide mining. The European Commission rejected a proposal for such a ban, noting that existing regulations (see below) provide adequate environmental and health protection. Several attempts to ban gold cyanidation in Romania were rejected by the Romanian Parliament. There are currently protests in Romania calling for a ban on the use of cyanide in mining (see 2013 Romanian protests against the Roșia Montană Project).

In the EU, industrial use of hazardous chemicals is controlled by the so-called Seveso II Directive (Directive 96/82/EC, which replaced the original Seveso Directive (82/501/EEC brought in after the 1976 dioxin disaster. &quot;Free cyanide and any compound capable of releasing free cyanide in solution&quot; are further controlled by being on List I of the Groundwater Directive (Directive 80/68/EEC) which bans any discharge of a size which might cause deterioration in the quality of the groundwater at the time or in the future. The Groundwater Directive was largely replaced in 2000 by the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC).

In response to the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2006/21/EC on the management of waste from extractive industries. Article 13(6) requires &quot;the concentration of weak acid dissociable cyanide in the pond is reduced to the lowest possible level using best available techniques&quot;, and at most all mines started after 1 May 2008 may not discharge waste containing over 10ppm WAD cyanide, mines built or permitted before that date are allowed no more than 50ppm initially, dropping to 25ppm in 2013 and 10ppm by 2018.

Under Article 14, companies must also put in place financial guarantees to ensure clean-up after the mine has finished. This in particular may affect smaller companies wanting to build gold mines in the EU, as they are less likely to have the financial strength to give these kinds of guarantees.

The industry has come up with a voluntary &quot;Cyanide Code&quot; that aims to reduce environmental impacts with third party audits of a company&#x27;s cyanide management.

<doc id="402245" wikidata="Q1415113" url="?curid=402245" title="New England Anti-Slavery Society">
<text>The New England Anti-Slavery Society (1831–1837) was formed by William Lloyd Garrison, editor of &quot;The Liberator,&quot; in 1831. &quot;The Liberator&quot; was its official publication.

Based in Boston, Massachusetts, members of the New England Anti-slavery Society supported immediate abolition and viewed slavery as immoral and non-Christian (sinful). It was particularly opposed to the American Colonization Society, which proposed sending African Americans to Africa.

The founding meeting took place on January 1, 1831, in the vestry of the Belknap Street Church. (Some sources list the date as January 1, 1832.) Garrison was the principal founder. The other founding members were: Benjamin Bierly of Amesbury, Massachusetts, Reverend Elijah Blanchard, Dr. Gamaliel Bradford, Elizabeth B. Chase, Joshua Easton, also a member of the Massachusetts General Colored Association, Charles Theodore Follen, Reverend Henry Grew, Reverend Cyrus Pitt Grosvenor, Ellis Gray Loring, Captain Jonas Parker of Reading, Massachusetts, Reverend Perry of Mendon, Massachusetts, Reverend Amos August Phelps, Reverend Aaron Pickett of Reading, Massachusetts, Samuel Edmund Sewall, Horace Wakefield, Amasa Walker, and a Reverend Yates.

The society sponsored lecturers or &quot;agents&quot; who traveled throughout the New England area, speaking in local churches or halls, and also selling abolitionist tracts or &quot;The Liberator&quot;. Whenever possible, the Society&#x27;s agents would also encourage the formation of local anti-slavery societies. By 1833 there were 47 local societies in ten northern states, 33 of them in New England. The society also sponsored mass mobilizations such as yearly anti-slavery conventions and celebrations of July 4 or — preferred by those who believed celebrating July 4 was unacceptable since the U.S. Constitution accepted slavery — the Anniversary of the Abolition of Slavery in the West Indies, August 1.

John Levy, &quot;a colored gentleman&quot; from Lowell, decries insufficient involvement of free Negroes in the struggle. Garrison, Birney, Burleigh, Henry Stanton, and other stalwarts speak at length.

== Massachusetts General Colored Association ==
In January 1833, Thomas Dalton, president of the Massachusetts General Colored Association, led a successful petition to merge with the New England Anti-Slavery Society. Separate black anti-slavery societies had already existed in Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Connecticut, and New Jersey, however, a strong feeling against the organization of separate anti-slavery societies had been emerging.

Together they organized anti-slavery conventions and speaking programs throughout New England.

Sometime after Joshua Easton was sent as a delegate to the New England society in 1833, African Americans were granted full membership in the organization.

== American Anti-Slavery Society ==
In 1833, Garrison and Arthur Tappan expanded this society and formed the American Anti-Slavery Society. The American Anti-Slavery Society, however, attempted to create state-based organizations under the umbrella of its executive committee. At first the New England Anti-Slavery Society and the American Society worked together, with the New England Society becoming an auxiliary in 1834.

== Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society ==
In 1838, however, the New England Society gave up its regional jurisdiction and reorganized into the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. The society took a proactive role in advocating for legislation against new slave codes and laws, particularly within Massachusetts, including publishing treatises related to proposals to outlaw or penalize those participating in the activities and formation of societies relating to abolition and anti-slavery activities.

Annual meetings were held in Boston at Julien Hall, Melodeon, and Tremont Temple. Officers included James N. Buffum, Francis Jackson, Wendell Phillips, Parker Pillsbury, and Edmund Quincy. Lecturers affiliated with the society included William Wells Brown, Frederick Douglass, Samuel Joseph May, and Charles Lenox Remond. Joel W. Lewis was the chairman in 1840.

The New England Anti-Slavery Society held conventions in:
* Boston, Massachusetts, May 30, 31 and June 1 and 2, 1837

The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society held conventions in:
* Worcester, Massachusetts, October 1840
* Nantucket, Massachusetts, 1841

Following the Civil War the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society took up the cause of racial equality.

<doc id="402247" wikidata="Q424163" url="?curid=402247" title="Orlistat">
<text>Orlistat, sold under the brand name Xenical among others, is a medication used to treat obesity. Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet by acting as a lipase inhibitor, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use in conjunction with a healthcare provider-supervised reduced-calorie diet.

Orlistat is the saturated derivative of lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases isolated from the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces toxytricini&quot;. However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug.

The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting weight loss is definite but modest. Pooled data from clinical trials suggest that people given orlistat in addition to lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, lose about more than those not taking the drug over the course of a year. Orlistat also modestly reduces blood pressure and appears to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, whether from the weight loss itself or other effects. It reduces the incidence of diabetes type II in people who are obese around the same amount that lifestyle changes do.

Benefits aside, however, orlistat is noted for its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes referred to as &quot;treatment effects&quot;), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. In Australia it has been listed as an S3 medication, available from a pharmacist without a prescription, since 2000.
== Medical uses ==
Orlistat is used for the treatment of obesity. The amount of weight loss achieved with orlistat varies. In one-year clinical trials, between 35.5% and 54.8% of subjects achieved a 5% or greater decrease in body mass, although not all of this mass was necessarily fat. Between 16.4% and 24.8% achieved at least a 10% decrease in body fat. After orlistat was stopped, a significant number of subjects regained weight—up to 35% of the weight they had lost. It reduces the incidence of diabetes type II in people who are obese around the same amount that lifestyle changes do. Long-term use of orlistat also leads to a very modest reduction in blood pressure (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively).

== Contraindications ==
Orlistat is contraindicated in:
* Malabsorption
* Hypersensitivity to orlistat
* Reduced gallbladder function (e.g. after cholecystectomy)
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
* Anorexia and Bulimia
* Use caution with: obstructed bile duct, impaired liver function, and pancreatic disease
== Side effects ==
The primary side effects of the drug are gastrointestinal-related, and include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools with excessive flatus due to unabsorbed fats reaching the large intestine), fecal incontinence and frequent or urgent bowel movements. To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Oily stools and flatulence can be controlled by reducing the dietary fat content to somewhere in the region of 15 grams per meal. The manual for Alli makes it clear that orlistat treatment involves aversion therapy, encouraging the user to associate eating fat with unpleasant treatment effects.

Side effects are most severe when beginning therapy and may decrease in frequency with time; It has also been suggested that the decrease in side effects over time may be associated with long-term compliance with a low-fat diet.

On 26 May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication.

An analysis of over 900 orlistat users in Ontario showed that their rate of acute kidney injury was more than triple that of non-users.

A study from 2013 looked at 94,695 participants receiving orlistat in the UK between 1999 and 2011. The study showed no evidence of an increased risk of liver injury during treatment. They concluded:

=== Long-term ===
Despite a higher incidence of breast cancer amongst those taking orlistat in early, pooled clinical trial data—the analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat—a two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between orlistat and placebo (0.54% versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them. There is evidence from an &quot;in vitro&quot; study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing orlistat, namely the concurrent administration of orlistat and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, can induce cell death in breast cancer cells and block their growth.

Fecal fat excretion promotes colon carcinogenesis. In 2006 the results of 30-day study were published indicating that orlistat at a dosage of 200 mg/kg chow administered to rats consuming a high-fat chow and receiving two 25 mg/kg doses of the potent carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine produced significantly higher numbers of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) colon lesions than did the carcinogen plus high-fat chow without orlistat. ACF lesions are believed to be one of the earliest precursors of colon cancer.

=== Precautions ===
Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other fat-soluble nutrients is inhibited by the use of orlistat.

=== Interactions ===
Orlistat may reduce plasma levels of ciclosporin (also known as &quot;cyclosporin&quot; or &quot;cyclosporine&quot;, trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.), an immunosuppressive drug frequently used to prevent transplant rejection; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly. Orlistat can also impair absorption of the antiarrhythmic amiodarone. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has suggested the possibility that orlistat could reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medications.

== Mechanism of action ==
Orlistat works by inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases, the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination is through the feces.

Orlistat was also found to inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), an enzyme involved in the proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of orlistat, such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective antitumor agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of orlistat, including its off-targets. Orlistat also shows potential activity against the &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; parasite.

Orlistat prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed.

== Legal status ==
Orlistat is available both with and without a prescription.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia and New Zealand, orlistat is available as a &quot;Pharmacist Only Medicine&quot;. In 2007, the Committee decided to keep orlistat as a Schedule 3 drug, but withdrew its authorization of direct-to-consumer Xenical advertising, stating this &quot;increased pressure on pharmacists to provide orlistat to consumers...this in turn had the potential to result in inappropriate patterns of use&quot;.

=== United States ===
Orlistat was initially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 1999 as a prescription-only medication. On 23 January 2006, an FDA advisory panel voted 11 to 3 to recommend the approval of an OTC formulation of orlistat, to be sold under the brand name Alli by GlaxoSmithKline. Approval was granted on 7 February 2007, and Alli became the first weight loss drug officially sanctioned by the U.S. government for over-the-counter use.
Consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen opposed over-the-counter approval for orlistat.

Alli became available in the U.S. in June 2007. It is sold as 60 mg capsules—half the dosage of prescription orlistat.

=== European Union and Switzerland ===

On 21 January 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted approval for the sale of orlistat without a prescription.

At least since September 2017, tablets with 60 mg orlistat can be freely sold in Swiss drugstores. Formulations with 120 mg per tablet require a prescription, but can be sold without one in pharmacies under an exemption rule, which is based on a list of easily diagnosable diseases.

=== Generic formulations ===
U.S. patent protection for Xenical, originally to end on 18 June 2004, was extended by five years (until 2009) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The extension was granted on 20 July 2002, and expired on 18 June 2009.

Generic orlistat is available in Iran under the brand Venustat manufactured by Aburaihan Pharmaceutical co., in India, under the brands Orlean (Eris), Vyfat, Olistat, Obelit, Orlica and Reeshape. In Russia, orlistat is available under the brand names Xenical (Hoffmann–La Roche), Orsoten/Orsoten Slim (KRKA d. d.) and Xenalten (OBL-Pharm). In Austria, orlistat is available under the brand name Slimox. In Malaysia, orlistat is available under the brand name Cuvarlix and is marketed by Pharmaniaga. In the Philippines orlistat is available under the brand name RedoXfat Plus manufactured by ATC Healthcare

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
At times, such as in spring 2012, orlistat has come into short supply, with consequent price increases because of nonavailability of one of the drug&#x27;s components.

=== Counterfeit products ===
In January 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert stating that some counterfeit versions of Alli sold over the Internet contain no orlistat, and instead contain the weight-loss drug sibutramine. The concentration of sibutramine in these counterfeit products is at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.

<text>Air Namibia (Pty) Limited, which traded as Air Namibia, was the national airline of Namibia, headquartered in the country&#x27;s capital, Windhoek. It operated scheduled domestic, regional, and international passenger and cargo services, having its international hub in Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport and a domestic hub at the smaller Windhoek Eros Airport. , the carrier was wholly owned by the Namibian government. Air Namibia was a member of both the International Air Transport Association and the African Airlines Association.

== History ==
=== Early years ===

The origins of the airline trace back to , when &quot;South West Air Transport (SWAT)&quot; was established. Using Ryan Navion aircraft, this carrier started operations in 1949 linking Windhoek with Grootfontein. Charter and cargo flights were also undertaken. In 1950, the company started feeder services for South African Airways. By 1958, a fleet of seven Ryan Navions and one de Havilland Dragon Rapide served a route network that included Grootfontein, Tsumeb, Otjiwarongo, Outjo, Swakopmund, Walvis Bay and Windhoek. On 26 March 1959, SWAT merged with &quot;Oryx Aviation&quot; — a small passenger airline established three years earlier— to form &quot;South West Airways&quot; (). IATA membership was gained later that year.

Two Cessna 205s were purchased, entering the fleet in and eventually replacing the Navions. &quot;Namibair&quot;, set up as a charter airline in 1963, became a subsidiary company of Suidwes Lugdiens in 1966. In 1969, Safmarine acquired a 50% stake in Suidwes, eventually boosting its participation to 85%. At , the Suidwes fleet comprised four Piper Aztecs, one de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, two Piper PA-28 Cherokees, one Cessna 182, one Cessna 205, one Cessna 206, one Cessna 402, three Douglas DC-3s and five Piper PA-30 Twin Comanches; at this time the carrier had 45 employees. A Fairchild-Hiller FH-227 was acquired in 1974, and a Convair 580 was later incorporated into the fleet to perform charter flights carrying miners to their jobs in Grootfontein and Tsumeb.

Suidwes merged into Namib Air on 1 December 1978. The South West African government became the major shareholder in 1982. Following the creation of the &quot;South West Africa National Transport Corporation&quot; in 1986, Namib Air took over all air transport operations in the country. The airline was designated as the country&#x27;s flag carrier in 1987. That year, two 19-seater Beech 1900s were bought. In 1988, the company was incorporated into the Namibian state-owned holding company Transnamib. On 6 August 1989, a Boeing 737-200 leased from South African Airways that flew the Windhoek–Johannesburg route inaugurated the carrier&#x27;s jet era. In the same year, a third Beech 1900 was incorporated into the fleet.
Services to Lusaka and Luanda were launched in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Following the independence of the country, the company was re-christened again, adopting the current name of &quot;Air Namibia&quot; in . The early 1990s also saw the launch of long-haul services to Europe: the Windhoek–Frankfurt route started being flown in 1991 twice a week using a Boeing 747SP, and London was included into the route network in 1992, with a non-stop flight. In 1993, services to Frankfurt, which were served twice-weekly, were also extended to London. Air Namibia was re-absorbed into the Namibian government after an injection of in 1998, following the precarious cash position it was led into by TransNamib. LTU, Germany&#x27;s second largest airline at the time, entered into a &quot;codeshare agreement&quot; with Air Namibia in February 1998. Air Namibia acquired a new Boeing 747-400 Combi in with financial aid from the U.S. Export Import Bank. Named &quot;Welwitschia&quot;, the aircraft was handed over by the manufacturer in that year. The new machine came to replace the carrier&#x27;s Boeing 747SP, and was retired in 2004. That year, the carrier started flying the McDonnell Douglas MD-11.

=== Developments since the 2000s ===

By , the airline&#x27;s employees numbered 418. At this time, Air Namibia operated a Boeing 727-100, two Boeing 737-200 Advanced, one Boeing 747-400 Combi and three Raytheon Beech 1900Cs that served Cape Town, Frankfurt, Johannesburg, London, Luanda, Luderitz, Lusaka, Maun, Mokuti Lodge, Mpacha, Ondangwa, Oranjemund, Swakopmund, Victoria Falls, Walvis Bay and Windhoek. That year, the airline joined the African Airlines Association.

The first of three Embraer ERJ 135s the airline leased from Régional, intended to replace the Beechcraft 1900 fleet, was received in ; likewise, the first of two leased Airbus A319-100s entered the fleet in the same year. Intended as a replacement for the Boeing 737 fleet, the company ordered another two Airbus A319s in , in a deal worth  million; in the same year, the carrier signed an agreement for the lease of two Airbus A330-200s, aimed at replacing the Airbus A340-300s. Of the last two A319s ordered, the first one was incorporated into the fleet in early . In , Air Namibia took delivery of its first Airbus A330-200.

In , the airline was granted permission to fly to the United States by the US Department of Transportation. In March the airline completed a re-certification application by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (an audit process which was initiated in 2013), enabling the airline to fly to any EU member state.

===Decline and shutdown===
Air Namibia had been making losses since Namibian independence. In 2020, its assets stood at below 1 billion N$, while its liabilities amounted to 3 billion N$. Around 11 billion N$ had been provided by government over the previous 20 years. The airline was essentially &quot;on death row&quot;.

On 8 July 2020 the Transportation Commission of Namibia suspended the carrier&#x27;s Scheduled Air Services Licence, citing financial and safety concerns. In October 2020 the airline was given notice by Belgian lawyer Anicet Baum, of the company Challengair, claiming that Air Namibia was insolvent and unable to repay its debts to Challengeair (an amount of 18,s million Euro), which was settled to be repaid in instalments until September 2021.

On 11 February 2021, the Namibian government announced the immediate shutdown and liquidation of Air Namibia due to overwhelming debt and years of financial dependence from the state. At the time of closure, the airline operated nine aircraft and employed approximately 600 staff.

In late October 2021, a South African aviation company offered 3.2 billion Namibian dollars to purchase the airline.

== Destinations ==

, the route network comprised 18 destinations and 19 airports in nine different countries in Africa and Europe, with seven of these destinations being domestic ones.

===Codeshare agreements===
Air Namibia codeshared with the following airlines, :
* Condor
* Ethiopian Airlines
* Kenya Airways
* Turkish Airlines

==Fleet==

===Final fleet===
The Air Namibia fleet consisted of the following aircraft (as of August 2019):
===Fleet development===
In recent developments regarding the Embraer ERJ-135-fleet, Westair Aviation, a 100% Namibian-owned company, acquired the four aircraft from the previous owner, Air France. According to the new owners, Westair would&#x27;ve enabled the upgrade and renewal of the domestic and regional fleet. In August 2017 the airline confirmed that it was committed to purchasing 2 new Embraer ERJ-135 and 4 new Embraer ERJ-145 jets, for delivery 2018 However, none of those were ever delivered prior to the airline&#x27;s demise.

<text>JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler) is an open-source parser generator and lexical analyzer generator written in the Java programming language.

JavaCC is similar to yacc in that it generates a parser from a formal grammar written in EBNF notation. Unlike yacc, however, JavaCC generates top-down parsers. JavaCC can resolve choices based on the next &quot;k&quot; input tokens, and so can handle LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars automatically; by use of &quot;lookahead specifications&quot;, it can also resolve choices requiring unbounded look ahead. JavaCC also generates lexical analyzers in a fashion similar to lex. The tree builder that accompanies it, JJTree, constructs its trees from the bottom up.

JavaCC is licensed under a BSD license.

==History==
In 1996, Sun Microsystems released a parser generator called &quot;Jack&quot;. The developers responsible for &quot;Jack&quot; created their own company called Metamata and changed the &quot;Jack&quot; name to JavaCC. Metamata eventually became part of WebGain. After WebGain shut down its operations, JavaCC was moved to its current home.

==Uses==
Software built using JavaCC includes:

* Apache Derby
* BeanShell
* FreeMarker
* PMD
* Vaadin
* Apache Lucene
* JavaParser

<doc id="402261" wikidata="Q7370386" url="?curid=402261" title="Roth IRA">
<text>A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account (IRA) under United States law that is generally not taxed upon distribution, provided certain conditions are met. The principal difference between Roth IRAs and most other tax-advantaged retirement plans is that rather than granting an income tax reduction for contributions to the retirement plan, qualified withdrawals from the Roth IRA plan are tax-free, and growth in the account is tax-free.

The Roth IRA was introduced as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and is named for Senator William Roth.

==Overview==
A Roth IRA can be an individual retirement account containing investments in securities, usually common stocks and bonds, often through mutual funds (although other investments, including derivatives, notes, certificates of deposit, and real estate are possible). A Roth IRA can also be an individual retirement annuity, which is an annuity contract or an endowment contract purchased from a life insurance company. As with all IRAs, the Internal Revenue Service mandates specific eligibility and filing status requirements. A Roth IRA&#x27;s main advantages are its tax structure and the additional flexibility that this tax structure provides. Also, there are fewer restrictions on the investments that can be made in the plan than many other tax-advantaged plans, and this adds somewhat to their popularity, though the investment options available depend on the trustee (or the place where the plan is established).

The total contributions allowed per year to all IRAs is the lesser of one&#x27;s taxable compensation (which is not the same as adjusted gross income) and the limit amounts as seen below (this total may be split up between any number of traditional and Roth IRAs. In the case of a married couple, each spouse may contribute the amount listed): 

== History ==

Originally called an &quot;IRA Plus&quot;, the idea was proposed by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon and Senator William Roth of Delaware in 1989. The Packwood–Roth plan would have allowed individuals to invest up to $2,000 in an account with no immediate tax deductions, and the earnings could later be withdrawn tax-free at retirement.

The Roth IRA was established by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-34) and named for Senator Roth, its chief legislative sponsor. In 2000, 46.3 million taxpayers held IRA accounts worth a total of $2.6 trillion in value according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Only a little over $77 billion of that amount was held in Roth IRAs. By 2007, the number of IRA owners had jumped to over 50 million taxpayers with $3.3 trillion invested.

In 1997, Roth wanted to restore the traditional IRA which had been repealed in 1986, and the upfront tax deduction that goes with it. Under congressional budget rules, which worked within a 10-year window, the revenue cost of giving that tax break to everyone was too high, so his staff limited deductible IRAs to people with very low income, and made Roth IRAs (initially with income limitations) available to others. This slid the revenue cost outside the 10-year window and got the legislation out from under the budget rules.

Economists have warned about exploding future revenue losses associated with Roth IRAs. With these accounts, the government is &quot;bringing in more now, but giving up much more in the future,&quot; said economist and Forbes contributor Leonard Burman. In a study for The Tax Policy Center, Burman calculated that from 2014 to 2046, the Treasury would lose a total of $14 billion as a result of IRA-related provisions in the 2006 tax law. The losses stem from both Roth conversions and the ability to make nondeductible IRA contributions and then immediately convert them to Roths.

==Differences from a traditional IRA==
In contrast to a traditional IRA, contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax-deductible. Withdrawals are tax-free under certain conditions (for example, if the withdrawal is only on the principal portion of the account, or if the owner is at least 59½ years old). A Roth IRA has fewer withdrawal restrictions than traditional IRAs. Transactions inside a Roth IRA (including capital gains, dividends, and interest) do not incur a current tax liability.

===Advantages===
* Direct contributions to a Roth IRA (principal) may be withdrawn tax and penalty-free at any time. Earnings may be withdrawn tax and penalty-free after 5 years if the condition of age 59½ (or other qualifying condition) is also met. Rollover, converted (before age 59½) contributions held in a Roth IRA may be withdrawn tax and penalty-free after 5 years. Distributions from a Roth IRA do not increase Adjusted Gross Income. This differs from a traditional IRA, where all withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and a penalty applies for withdrawals before age 59½. Even capital gains on stocks or other securities held in a regular taxable account, so long as they are held for at least a year, are generally treated more advantageously than traditional IRA withdrawals, being taxed not as Ordinary Income, but at the lower Long-Term Capital Gain rate. This potentially higher tax rate for withdrawals of capital gains from a traditional IRA is a quid pro quo for the deduction taken against ordinary income when putting money into the IRA.
* Up to a lifetime maximum $10,000 in earnings, withdrawals are considered qualified (tax-free) if the money is used to acquire a principal residence for the Roth IRA owner. This principal residence must be acquired by the Roth IRA owner, their spouse, or their lineal ancestors and descendants. The owner or qualified relative who receives such a distribution must not have owned a home in the previous 24 months.
* Contributions may be made to a Roth IRA even if the owner participates in a qualified retirement plan such as a 401(k). (Contributions may be made to a traditional IRA in this circumstance, but they may not be tax deductible.)
* If the Roth IRA owner expects that the tax rate applicable to withdrawals from a traditional IRA in retirement will be higher than the tax rate applicable to the funds earned to make the Roth IRA contributions before retirement, then there may be a tax advantage to making contributions to a Roth IRA over a traditional IRA or similar vehicle while working. There is no current tax deduction, but money going into the Roth IRA is taxed at the taxpayer&#x27;s current marginal tax rate, and will not be taxed at the expected higher future effective tax rate when it comes out of the Roth IRA. There is always risk, however, that retirement savings will be less than anticipated, which would produce a lower tax rate for distributions in retirement.
* The Roth IRA does not require distributions based on age. All other tax-deferred retirement plans, including the related Roth 401(k), require withdrawals to begin by April 1 of the calendar year after the owner reaches the RMD (Required minimum distribution) age of 72 (prior to the year 2020, the RMD age was 70½). If the account holder does not need the money and wants to leave it to their heirs, a Roth can be an effective way to accumulate tax-free income. Beneficiaries who inherit Roth IRAs are subject to special minimum distribution rules.
* Roth IRAs have a higher &quot;effective&quot; contribution limit than traditional IRAs, since the nominal contribution limit is the same for both traditional and Roth IRAs, but the post-tax contribution in a Roth IRA is equivalent to a larger pre-tax contribution in a traditional IRA that will be taxed upon withdrawal. For example, a contribution of the 2008 limit of $5,000 to a Roth IRA would have been equivalent to a traditional IRA contribution of $6667 (assuming a 25% tax rate at both contribution and withdrawal). In 2008, one could not contribute $6667 to a traditional IRA due to the contribution limit, so the post-tax Roth contribution may be larger.
* On estates large enough to be subject to estate taxes, a Roth IRA can reduce estate taxes since tax dollars have already been subtracted. A traditional IRA is valued at the pre-tax level for estate tax purposes.
* Most employer sponsored retirement plans tend to be pre-tax dollars and are similar, in that respect, to a traditional IRA, so if additional retirement savings are made beyond an employer-sponsored plan, a Roth IRA can diversify tax risk.
* Unlike distributions from a regular IRA, qualified Roth distributions do not affect the calculation of taxable social security benefits.
* Roth Conversions not only convert taxable IRA income to tax-free income, but if the IRA holds alternative assets such as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), Leasing Programs, Oil and Gas Drilling Partnerships and Royalty Partnerships, a Fair Market Valuation (FMV) or &quot;Substantially Discounted Roth-Conversion&quot; may provide reductions in the conversion income tax by up to 75%, possibly more, depending on assets and the Fair Market Valuation.
* Roth Conversions using the FMV or &quot;Substantially Discounted Roth-Conversion&quot; may reduce the estate tax attributed to IRA&#x27;s on large estates by up to 75%, or more, depending on the assets held at the time of conversion.
* Roth Conversions main benefit is in the conversion of taxable IRA income to tax-free Roth income, however Roth-Conversion income does not add to MAGI (Modified Adjusted Gross Income) hence reducing the taxpayers Medicare Part B Premiums (another tax).
* FMV or &quot;Substantially Discounted Roth-Conversion&quot; may allow the taxpayer to reduce RMDs by up to 75%.

===Disadvantages===

* Funds that reside in a Roth IRA cannot be used as collateral for a loan per current IRS rules and therefore cannot be used for financial leveraging or as a cash management tool for investment purposes.
* Contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax deductible. By contrast, contributions to a traditional IRA are tax deductible (within income limits). Therefore, someone who contributes to a traditional IRA instead of a Roth IRA gets an immediate tax savings equal to the amount of the contribution multiplied by their marginal tax rate while someone who contributes to a Roth IRA does not realize this immediate tax reduction. Also, by contrast, contributions to most employer sponsored retirement plans (such as a 401(k), 403(b), Simple IRA or SEP IRA) are tax deductible with no income limits because they reduce a taxpayer&#x27;s adjusted gross income.
* Eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA phases out at certain income limits. By contrast, contributions to most tax deductible employer sponsored retirement plans have no income limit.
* Contributions to a Roth IRA do not reduce a taxpayer&#x27;s adjusted gross income (AGI). By contrast, contributions to a traditional IRA or most employer sponsored retirement plans reduce AGI. Reducing one&#x27;s AGI has a benefit (besides reducing taxable income) if it puts the AGI below some threshold to make the taxpayer eligible for tax credits or deductions that would not be available at the higher AGI with a Roth IRA. The amount of credits and deductions may increase as the taxpayer slides down the phaseout scale. Examples include the child tax credit, the earned income credit, the student loan interest deduction.
* A Roth IRA contribution is taxed at the taxpayer&#x27;s current income tax rate, which is higher than the income tax rate during retirement for most people. This is because most people have a lower income, that falls in a lower tax bracket, during retirement than during their working years. (A lower tax rate can also occur if Congress lowers income tax rates before retirement.) By contrast, contributions to traditional IRAs or employer-sponsored tax-deductible retirement plans result in an immediate tax savings equal to the taxpayer&#x27;s current marginal tax bracket multiplied by the amount of the contribution. The higher the taxpayer&#x27;s current marginal tax rate, the higher the potential disadvantage. However, this issue is more complicated because withdrawals from traditional IRA or employer sponsored tax deductible retirement plans are fully taxable, up to 85% of Social Security income is taxable, personal residence mortgage interest deduction decreases as the mortgage is paid down, and there may be pension plan income, investment income and other factors.
* A taxpayer who pays state income tax and who contributes to a Roth IRA (instead of a traditional IRA or a tax deductible employer sponsored retirement plan) will have to pay state income taxes on the amount contributed to the Roth IRA in the year the money is earned. However, if the taxpayer retires to a state with a lower income tax rate, or no income taxes, then the taxpayer will have given up the opportunity to avoid paying state income taxes altogether on the amount of the Roth IRA contribution by instead contributing to a traditional IRA or a tax deductible employer sponsored retirement plan, because when the contributions are withdrawn from the traditional IRA or tax deductible plan in retirement, the taxpayer will then be a resident of the low or no income tax state, and will have avoided paying the state income tax altogether as a result of moving to a different state before the income tax became due.
* The perceived tax benefit may never be realized. That is, one might not live to retirement or much beyond, in which case the tax structure of a Roth only serves to reduce an estate that may not have been subject to tax. To fully realize the tax benefit, one must live until one&#x27;s Roth IRA contributions have been withdrawn and exhausted. By contrast, with a traditional IRA, tax might never be collected at all, such as if one dies before retirement with an estate below the tax threshold, or retires with income below the tax threshold. (To benefit from this exemption, the beneficiary must be named in the appropriate IRA beneficiary form. A beneficiary inheriting the IRA solely through a will is not eligible for the estate tax exemption. Additionally, the beneficiary will be subject to income tax unless the inheritance is a Roth IRA.) Heirs will have to pay taxes on withdrawals from traditional IRA assets they inherit, and must continue to take mandatory distributions (although they will be based on their life expectancy). It is also possible that tax laws may change by the time one reaches retirement age.

==Double taxation==
Double taxation may still occur within these tax sheltered investment plans. For example, foreign dividends may be taxed at their point of origin, and the IRS does not recognize this tax as a creditable deduction. There is some controversy over whether this violates existing Joint Tax Treaties, such as the Convention Between Canada and the United States of America With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital.

For Canadians with U.S. Roth IRAs, a 2008 rule provides that Roth IRAs (as defined in section 408A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and similar plans are considered to be pensions. Accordingly, distributions from a Roth IRA (as well as other similar plans) to a resident of Canada will generally be exempt from Canadian tax to the extent that they would have been exempt from U.S. tax if paid to a resident of the U.S. Additionally, a resident of Canada may elect to defer any taxation in Canada with respect to income accrued in a Roth IRA but not distributed by the Roth IRA, until and to the extent that a distribution is made from the Roth IRA or any plan substituted therefor. The effect of these rules is that, in most cases, no portion of the Roth IRA will be subject to taxation in Canada.

However, where an individual makes a contribution to a Roth IRA while they are a resident of Canada (other than rollover contributions from another Roth IRA), the Roth IRA will lose its status as a &quot;pension&quot; for purposes of the Treaty with respect to the accretions from the time such contribution is made. Income accretions from such time will be subject to tax in Canada in the year of accrual. In effect, the Roth IRA will be bifurcated into a &quot;frozen&quot; pension that will continue to enjoy the benefit of the exemption for pensions and a non-pension (essentially a savings account) that will not.

==Eligibility==
===Income limits===
Congress has limited who can contribute to a Roth IRA based upon income. A taxpayer can contribute the maximum amount listed at the top of the page only if their Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is below a certain level (the bottom of the range shown below). Otherwise, a phase-out of allowed contributions runs proportionally throughout the MAGI ranges shown below. Once MAGI hits the top of the range, no contribution is allowed at all; however, a minimum of $200 may be contributed as long as MAGI is below the top of the range. Excess Roth IRA contributions may be recharacterized into Traditional IRA contributions as long as the combined contributions do not exceed that tax year&#x27;s limit. The Roth IRA MAGI phase out ranges for 2021 are:
* Single filers: Up to $125,000 (to qualify for a full contribution); $125,000–$140,000 (to be eligible for a partial contribution)
* Joint filers: Up to $198,000 (to qualify for a full contribution); $198,000–$208,000 (to be eligible for a partial contribution)
* Married filing separately (if the couple lived together for any part of the year): $0 (to qualify for a full contribution); $0–$10,000 (to be eligible for a partial contribution).

The lower number represents the point at which the taxpayer is no longer allowed to contribute the maximum yearly contribution. The upper number is the point as of which the taxpayer is no longer allowed to contribute at all. People who are married and living together, but who file separately, are only allowed to contribute a relatively small amount.

However, once a Roth IRA is established, the balance in the plan remains tax-sheltered, even if the taxpayer&#x27;s income rises above the threshold. (The thresholds are just for annual eligibility to contribute, not for eligibility to maintain a Roth IRA.)

To be eligible, one must meet the earned income minimum requirement. In order to make a contribution, one must have taxable compensation (not taxable income from investments). If one makes only $2,000 in taxable compensation, one&#x27;s maximum IRA contribution is $2,000.

If a taxpayer&#x27;s income exceeds the income limits, they may still be able to effectively contribute by using a &quot;backdoor&quot; contribution process (see backdoor contributions below).

===Contribution limits===
Contributions to both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA are limited to the total amount allowed for either of them. Generally, the contribution cannot exceed your earned income for the year in question. The one exception is for a &quot;spousal IRA&quot; where a contribution can be made for a spouse with little or no earned income provided the other spouse has sufficient earned income and the spouses file a joint tax return. 

The Roth annual maximum input increased to $7,000 as of 2024, is a $1,000 increase from prior years and $500 increase from 2023. It is highly recommended that an investor to max-out the annual input amount for maximum return; however, penalties exist for going above the maximum allowable investment amount.

===Conversion rules===
The government allows people to convert Traditional IRA funds (and some other untaxed IRA funds) to Roth IRA funds by paying income tax on any account balance being converted that has not already been taxed (e.g., the Traditional IRA balance minus any non-deductible contributions).

Prior to 2010, two circumstances prohibited conversions: Modified Adjusted Gross Income exceeding $100,000 or the participant&#x27;s tax filing status is Married Filing Separately. These limitations were removed as part of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005.

====Backdoor contributions====
Regardless of income but subject to contribution limits, contributions can be made to a Traditional IRA and then converted to a Roth IRA. This allows for &quot;backdoor&quot; contributions where individuals are able to make Roth IRA contributions even if their income is above the limits.

One major caveat to the entire &quot;backdoor&quot; Roth IRA contribution process, however, is that it only works for people who do not have any pre-tax contributed money in IRA accounts at the time of the &quot;backdoor&quot; conversion to Roth; conversions made when other IRA money exists are subject to pro-rata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter. In effect, one cannot choose the tax character of the contribution, as it must reflect the existing proportion of tax character in traditional IRAs. For example, a traditional IRA contains $10,000 post-tax and $30,000 pre-tax funds, it has 75% pre-tax character. Converting $10,000 into a Roth would lead to 75% ($7,500) of the contribution being considered taxable. The pro-rata calculation is made based on all traditional IRA contributions across all the individual&#x27;s traditional IRA accounts (even if they are in different institutions).

Backdoor Roth IRA contributions were explicitly allowed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Prior to that, there was concern that the process would violate the step transaction doctrine that one cannot combine individually legal steps to achieve an outcome that would be illegal if done in a single step.

===Distributions===

Returns of regular contributions from Roth IRA(s) are always withdrawn tax and penalty-free. Eligible (tax and penalty-free) distributions of earnings must fulfill two requirements. First, the seasoning period of five years since the opening of the Roth IRA account must have elapsed, and secondly a justification must exist such as retirement or disability. The simplest justification is reaching 59.5 years of age, at which point qualified withdrawals may be made in any amount on any schedule. Becoming disabled or being a &quot;first time&quot; home buyer can provide justification for limited qualified withdrawals. Finally, although one can take distributions from a Roth IRA under the substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP) rule without paying a 10% penalty, any interest earned in the IRA will be subject to taxa substantial penalty which forfeits the primary tax benefits of the Roth IRA.

===Inherited Roth IRAs===
When a spouse inherits a Roth IRA:
* the spouse can combine the Roth IRA with his or her own Roth IRA
* the spouse can make contributions and otherwise control the account
* required minimum distributions do not apply
* income tax does not apply to distributions
* estate tax (if any) does not apply at the time of transfer

When a non-spouse inherits a Roth IRA:
* the non-spouse cannot combine the Roth IRA with his or her own
* the non-spouse cannot make additional contributions
* required minimum distributions apply
* income tax does not apply to distributions, if the Roth IRA was established for at least five years before the distribution occurs.
* estate tax (if any) applies

In addition, the beneficiary may elect to choose from one of two methods of distribution. The first option is to receive the entire distribution by December 31 of the fifth year following the year of the IRA owner&#x27;s death. The second option is to receive portions of the IRA as distributions over the life of the beneficiary, terminating upon the death of the beneficiary and passing on to a secondary beneficiary. If the beneficiary of the Roth IRA is a trust, the trust must distribute the entire assets of the Roth IRA by December 31 of the fifth year following the year of the IRA owner&#x27;s death, unless there is a &quot;Look Through&quot; clause, in which case the distributions of the Roth IRA are based on the Single Life Expectancy table over the life of the beneficiary, terminating upon the death of the beneficiary. Subtract one from the &quot;Single Life Expectancy&quot; for each successive year. The age of the beneficiary is determined on 12/31 of the first year after the year that the owner died.

<text>The Exposition Universelle of 1878 (), better known in English as the 1878 Paris Exposition, was a world&#x27;s fair held in Paris, France, from 1 May to 10 November 1878, to celebrate the recovery of France after the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War. It was the third of ten major expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937.

==Construction==
The buildings and the fairgrounds were somewhat unfinished on opening day, as political complications had prevented the French government from paying much attention to the exhibition until six months before it was due to open. However, efforts made in April were prodigious, and by 1 June, a month after the formal opening, the exhibition was finally completed.

This exposition was on a far larger scale than any previously held anywhere in the world. It covered over , the main building in the Champ de Mars and the hill of Chaillot, occupying . The Gare du Champ de Mars was rebuilt with four tracks to receive rail traffic occasioned by the exposition. The Pont d&#x27;Iéna linked the two exhibition sites along the central allée. The French exhibits filled one-half of the entire space, with the remaining exhibition space divided among the other nations of the world. Germany was the only major country which was not represented, but there were a few German paintings being exhibited. The United States exhibition was headed by a series of commissioners, which included Pierce M. B. Young, a former United States Congressman and major general in the Confederate States Army and Floyd Perry Baker, a Kansas newspaper editor, as well as other generals, politicians, and celebrities.

The United Kingdom, British India, Canada, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Cape Colony and some of the British crown colonies occupied nearly one-third of the space set aside for nations outside France. The United Kingdom&#x27;s expenditure was defrayed out of the consolidated revenue; each British colony defrayed its own expenses. The UK display was under the control of a royal commission, of which the Prince of Wales was president.

==Views of the Exposition==
==Displays==
The exhibition of fine arts and new machinery was on a very large and comprehensive scale, and the Avenue des Nations, a street 730 metres in length, was devoted to examples of the domestic architecture of nearly every country in Europe and several in Asia, Africa and America.
The &quot;Gallery of Machines&quot; was a metallic building, an industrial showcase of low transverse arches, designed by the engineer Henri de Dion (1828–78). Many of the buildings and statues were made of &quot;staff&quot;, a low-cost temporary building material invented in Paris in 1876, which consisted of jute fiber, plaster of Paris, and cement.

On the northern bank of the Seine River, an elaborate palace was constructed for the exhibition at the tip of the Place du Trocadéro. It was a handsome &quot;Moorish&quot; structure, with towers 76 metres in height and flanked by two galleries. It had a Cavaillé-Coll organ which was inaugurated with a concert in which Charles Marie Widor played the premiere of his Symphony for Organ No. 6. The building stood until 1937. On 30 June 1878, the completed head of the Statue of Liberty was showcased in the garden of the Trocadéro palace, while other pieces were on display in the Champs de Mars.

Among the many inventions on display was Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s telephone. Electric arc lighting had been installed all along the Avenue de l&#x27;Opera and the Place de l&#x27;Opera, and in June, a switch was thrown and the area was lit by electric Yablochkov arc lamps, powered by Zénobe Gramme dynamos. Thomas Edison had on display a megaphone and phonograph. International juries judged the various exhibits, awarding medals of gold, silver and bronze. One popular feature was a human zoo, called a &quot;negro village&quot;, composed of 400 &quot;indigenous people&quot;. And Augustin Mouchot&#x27;s solar-powered engine converting solar energy into mechanical steam power, he won a gold medal in Class 54 for his works, most notably the production of ice using concentrated solar heat. Henry E. Steinway exhibited a grand piano which &quot;attracted extraordinary attention&quot;.

===Awards===
* Gold award for painting: Jan Matejko, for &quot;The Hanging of the Sigismund Bell&quot;, &quot;Union of Lublin&quot; and &quot;Wacław Wilczek&quot;.
* Gold award for photography: Aimé Dupont
* Gold award for playing cards: New York Consolidated Card Company

==Attendance==
Over 13 million people paid to attend the exposition, making it a financial success. The cost of the enterprise to the French government, which supplied all the construction and operating funds, was a little less than a million British Pounds, after allowing for the value of the permanent buildings and the Trocadéro Palace, which were sold to the city of Paris. The total number of persons who visited Paris during the time the exhibition was open was 571,792, or 308,974 more than came to the French metropolis during 1877, and 46,021 in excess of the visitors during the previous exhibition of 1867. In addition to the general impetus given to French trade, the revenue from customs and duties from the foreign visitors increased by nearly three million sterling compared with the previous year.

Concurrent with the exposition, a number of meetings and conferences were held to gain consensus on international standards. French writer Victor Hugo led the Congress for the Protection of Literary Property, which led to the eventual formulation of international copyright laws. Similarly, other meetings led to efforts to standardize the flow of mail from country to country. The International Congress for the Amelioration of the Condition of Blind People led to the worldwide adoption of the Braille System of touch-reading.

==In popular culture==
* Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau&#x27;s time travel novel &quot;El Anacronópete&quot; starts with a lecture in the exposition.
* Eoin Colfer&#x27;s novel &quot;Airman&quot; begins with its protagonists (Conor Broekhart) birth at the exposition.

==Artefacts==
The Paris firm of Gruel and Engelmann was known for its deluxe bookbindings. The Book of Hours is a Gothic Revival example, for which the celebrated Paris jeweler Alexis Falize (1811–1898) created a relief showing the Adoration of the Magi, surrounded by fantastic animals derived from the amusing, marginal decoration found in some medieval manuscripts. The filigree and granular work is of exceptional quality.

<doc id="402275" wikidata="Q2373048" url="?curid=402275" title="USS Antietam (CV-36)">
<text>USS &quot;Antietam&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-36) was one of 24 s built during and shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the second US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the American Civil War Battle of Antietam (Maryland). &quot;Antietam&quot; was commissioned in January 1945, too late to serve actively in World War II. After serving a short time in the Far East, she was decommissioned in 1949. She was soon recommissioned for Korean War service, and in that conflict earned two battle stars. In the early 1950s, she was redesignated an attack carrier (CVA) and then an antisubmarine warfare carrier (CVS). After the Korean War she spent the rest of her career operating in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean. From 1957 until her deactivation, she was the Navy&#x27;s training carrier, operating out of Florida.

&quot;Antietam&quot; was fitted with a port sponson in 1952 to make her the world&#x27;s first true angled-deck aircraft carrier. However, she received no major modernizations other than this, and thus throughout her career largely retained the classic appearance of a World War II &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1963, and sold for scrap in 1974.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Antietam&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships. The keel was laid on 15 March 1943 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The ship was launched on 20 August 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Millard E. Tydings, the wife of Senator Tydings of Maryland. &quot;Antietam&quot; was commissioned on 28 January 1945, with Captain James R. Tague in command.

===World War II and occupation of Japan===

The aircraft carrier completed fitting out at Philadelphia until 2 March 1945, when she got underway for her shakedown cruise. The ship arrived in Hampton Roads on 5 March and conducted operations from Norfolk until 22 March, when she stood out of Chesapeake Bay bound for Trinidad in the British West Indies. At the conclusion of her shakedown cruise, &quot;Antietam&quot; returned to Philadelphia on 28 April to begin post-shakedown availability. She completed repairs on 19 May and departed Philadelphia that same day. After a three-day stop at Norfolk, the warship resumed her voyage to the Panama Canal in company with , , and . She arrived at Cristóbal on 31 May, transited the Panama Canal the next day, and continued her voyage up the coast to San Diego. She stopped at San Diego from 10 to 13 June before beginning the first leg of her transpacific voyage. Antietam arrived in Pearl Harbor on 19 June and remained in the Hawaiian Islands conducting training missions until 12 August. On that day, she shaped a course for the western Pacific.

Three days out of Oahu, she received word of the Japanese capitulation and the consequent cessation of hostilities. Thus, by the time of her arrival in Eniwetok Atoll on 19 August, her mission changed from combat to occupation support duty. On 21 August, she exited the lagoon in company with and a screen of destroyers bound for Japan. En route, she suffered some internal damage which forced her into port at Apra Harbor, Guam, for inspections. The inspection party deemed the damage minimal; and the carrier remained operational, resuming her course on 27 August. By that time, however, her destination had been changed to the coast of the Asian mainland. She stopped at Okinawa between 30 August and 1 September, and arrived in Chinese waters near Shanghai the following day.

The aircraft carrier remained in the Far East for a little more than three years. The Yellow Sea constituted her primary theater of operations while her air group provided support for the Allied occupation of North China, Manchuria, and Korea. During the latter stages of that assignment, her airmen conducted surveillance missions in that area as a result of the civil war in China between communist and nationalist factions which later resulted in the expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces from mainland China and the establishment of Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist People&#x27;s Republic of China. Throughout the period, however, she did depart the Yellow Sea on occasion for visits to Japan, the Philippines, Okinawa, and the Marianas. Early in 1949, she concluded her mission in the Orient and headed back to the United States for deactivation. She was decommissioned on 21 June 1949.

===Korean War===

&quot;Antietam&quot; remained in reserve at Alameda, California, but after Communist forces from North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, she began reactivation preparations on 6 December and went back into commission on 17 January 1951, with Captain George J. Dufek in command. Initially, the carrier conducted shakedown training and carrier qualifications along the California coast, first out of Alameda and – after 14 May – out of San Diego. She made one voyage to Pearl Harbor and back to San Diego in July and August before departing the latter port on 8 September and heading for the Far East. &quot;Antietam&quot; arrived in the Far East later that fall and, by late November, began the only combat deployment of her career. During that tour, she made four cruises with Task Force 77 (TF 77), in the combat zone off the coast of the Korean peninsula. In between fighting assignments, she returned to Yokosuka, Japan. During each of those periods, her air group carried out a variety of missions in support of United Nations forces combating North Korean aggression. Those missions included combat air patrol, logistics interdiction, particularly against railroad and highway traffic, reconnaissance, antisubmarine patrols, and night heckler missions. From late November 1951 to mid-March 1952, &quot;Antietam&quot;″s air group flew nearly 6,000 sorties of all types. She returned to Yokosuka on 21 March 1952 at the conclusion of her fourth cruise with TF 77 to begin preparations for her voyage back to the United States.

===Later years===

The aircraft carrier returned home in April and rejoined the Pacific Reserve Fleet briefly. She was reactivated later that summer and, in August, transited the Panama Canal to join the Atlantic Fleet. In September, the warship entered the New York Naval Shipyard for major alterations. In October, she was redesignated an attack aircraft carrier, &quot;CVA-36&quot;. In December 1952 &quot;Antietam&quot; emerged from the yard as the world&#x27;s first carrier with a true angled flight deck. The principle had been tried on other carriers with lines painted on an axis deck. &quot;Antietam&quot;″s deck was based on a rudimentary sponson. The installation allowed for true angle deck tests, including arrested landings. Trials with British and US units proved during trials to be superior to the usual fore-aft deck. She operated out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island, until the beginning of 1955. During the intervening years, she participated in numerous fleet and independent ship&#x27;s exercises. Detachment #39 from VC-4, NAS Atlantic City was sent out on the Antietam on 9 June 1953. The stated purpose was to show off the canted deck capabilities to the Royal Navy. There were two aircraft with pilots and 13 enlisted men. Two days of flight operation took place with all sorts of Royal Navy aircraft making touch and gos. The F3Ds were used to give Royal Navy VIPs catapult shots and arrested landings. The VC-4 pilots were air lifted back to the states on 3 July and the F3Ds were off loaded and flown back to Atlantic City from Rhode Island. After August 1953, during which time she was redesignated an Anti-submarine warfare carrier (ASW), CVS-36 &quot;Antietam&quot; concentrated up on honing her hunter/killer skills.

==Post-Korean War==
In January 1955, she embarked upon a voyage to the Mediterranean Sea where she served with the 6th Fleet until March. Resuming duty with the Atlantic Fleet ASW forces, she operated along the eastern seaboard until the fall of 1956. In October of that year, she cruised to the waters of the eastern Atlantic for NATO ASW exercises and goodwill visits to ports in Allied countries. She ran aground off Brest, France, on 22 October 1956, but was refloated undamaged. While the carrier was in Rotterdam, the Suez crisis broke out in the eastern Mediterranean. &quot;Antietam&quot; cut short her visit to the Netherlands and headed for the Mediterranean to bolster the 6th Fleet during the evacuation of American citizens from Alexandria, Egypt. At the end of that assignment, she conducted ASW training exercises with Italian naval officers embarked before returning to Quonset Point on 22 December.
After resuming operations along the eastern seaboard early in 1957, &quot;Antietam&quot; was assigned on 21 April 1957 to training duty with the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Mayport however, served as her home port because ships of her draft could not then enter port at Pensacola. For almost two years the aircraft carrier operated out of Mayport training new Navy pilots and conducting tests on new aviation equipment—most noteworthy on the Bell automatic landing system during August 1958. She also participated in annual Naval Academy midshipmen cruises each summer.

In January 1959, after the deepening of the channel into Pensacola had been completed, &quot;Antietam&quot;″s home port was changed from Mayport to Pensacola. For the remainder of her active career, the carrier operated out of Pensacola as an aviation training ship.

The deck of the &quot;Antietam&quot; served as the launching pad for the stratospheric balloon flight of Commander Malcolm D. Ross and Lieutenant Commander Victor A. Prather, both of the United States Navy, on 4 May 1961. This flight set an absolute official altitude record for manned balloons of . The flight took place over the Gulf of Mexico. During recovery, Prather slipped from the rescue helicopter&#x27;s lifting harness and fell into the ocean; he died from his injuries onboard &quot;Antietam&quot;. Commander Ross was successfully recovered.

On two occasions, she provided humanitarian services to victims of hurricane damage. The first came in September 1961 when she rushed to the Texas coast to provide supplies and medical assistance to the victims of Hurricane Carla. The second came just over a month later when she carried medical supplies, doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel to British Honduras to help the victims of Hurricane Hattie. Otherwise, she spent the final four years of her naval career in routine naval aviation training duty out of Pensacola. On 23 October 1962, &quot;Antietam&quot; was relieved by sister ship as aviation training ship at Pensacola and was placed in commission, in reserve, on 7 January 1963. Berthed at Philadelphia, she remained in reserve until May 1973 when her name was struck from the Navy List. On 28 February 1974, she was sold to the Union Minerals &amp; Alloys Corp. for scrapping.

<doc id="402279" wikidata="Q2342475" url="?curid=402279" title="USS Lake Champlain (CV-39)">
<text>USS &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-39) was one of 24 s completed during or shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. She was the second US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the Battle of Lake Champlain in the War of 1812.

Commissioned on 3 June 1945, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; did not participate in World War II, but did serve as a transport, bringing troops home from Europe as part of Operation Magic Carpet. Like many of her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, but was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s, and redesignated as an attack carrier (CVA). She participated in the Korean War but spent the rest of her career in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean. In the late 1950s, she was redesignated as an antisubmarine carrier (CVS).

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was the prime recovery ship for the first crewed Project Mercury mission (&quot;Freedom 7&quot;), the second uncrewed Gemini mission (Gemini 2), and for the third crewed Gemini (Gemini 5) space mission.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; had a unique modernization history. She was the only &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship to receive the SCB-27 conversion which was a rebuild of the superstructure, flight deck and other features but without also receiving the SCB-125 conversion which would have given her an angled flight deck and hurricane bow. Therefore, she was the last operational US aircraft carrier with an axial flight deck.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was decommissioned in 1966 and sold for scrap in 1972.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships. She was laid down in Drydock No. 8 at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 March 1943. The hull was launched from drydock on 2 November 1944. &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; commissioned on 3 June 1945 under the command of Captain Logan Ramsey. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Mildred Lucas, wife of Senator Warren Austin of Vermont.

==Service history==

===Operation Magic Carpet===
After shakedown and visits to New York and Philadelphia, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was assigned to &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty to repatriate US military personnel. She departed Norfolk for England on 14 October, and arrived at Southampton on the 19th where she embarked veterans and returned them to New York.

She set a speed record, averaging 32.048 kn, for crossing the Atlantic on 26 November 1945 when she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, having completed a run from Gibraltar, a distance of 3360.3 nautical miles, in 4 days, 8 hours, 51 minutes. This record stood until surpassed by in the summer of 1952.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was laid up in the reserve fleet at Norfolk on 17 February 1947.

===Korean War===
&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was needed again for the Korean War. In August 1950, she began her SCB-27A modernization program at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. She recommissioned on 19 September 1952.

A shakedown cruise in Cuban and Haitian waters lasted from 25 November to 25 December 1952. The carrier departed Mayport, Florida, for Korea on 26 April 1953 via the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and South China Sea. &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; became the largest ship to date to transit the Suez Canal. She moored at Yokosuka, Japan, on 9 June 1953.

As flagship of Carrier Task Force 77 (TF 77), she sailed from Yokosuka on 11 June and arrived off western Korea on 14 June. The carrier&#x27;s air group immediately launched sorties cratering runways; assaulting enemy troops; attacking trenches, bunkers, gun positions; and giving close air support to hard pressed ground forces. Her planes also escorted B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers on their way to enemy targets. &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; continued to strike at the enemy until the truce was signed on 27 July. Relieved by on 11 October, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; headed toward the South China Sea arriving Singapore on 24 October. Bidding farewell to the Pacific Ocean on 27 October, she steamed toward home, touching at Colombo, Port Said, Cannes, and Lisbon before arriving Mayport, Florida, on 4 December 1953.

===Postwar years===

====NATO, Middle East and reclassification====
In the years that followed, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; made several cruises to the Mediterranean, participating with NATO forces. On 25 April 1957, in response to tensions between Jordan&#x27;s king and parliament (see 1957 alleged Jordanian military coup attempt), she joined elements of her fleet in a high-speed run to the vicinity of Lebanon, where she backed King Hussein. King Hussein ended Jordan&#x27;s constitutional democracy, dissolving political parties, dismissing municipal councils, censoring the press, imposing military curfew, and culling the military of dissenting elements. The tensions eased and &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; returned to Mayport on 27 July. Converted to an antisubmarine carrier and reclassified (CVS-39) on 1 August, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; trained off the eastern seaboard to master her new role.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was near the island of Majorca when the Spanish city of Valencia was devastated by floods on the night of 14 October 1957. The American ambassador to Spain, John Davis Lodge, requested that &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; provide assistance for rescue operations. The ship&#x27;s Chickasaw helicopters undertook numerous rescue missions, and the ship&#x27;s crew fought in the &quot;mud battle&quot; that followed the disaster.

She departed Bayonne, New Jersey, on 8 February 1958 for another Mediterranean cruise returning to Mayport, Florida, on 30 October. After a yard overhaul, she departed for the Mediterranean on 10 June and visited Spain, Denmark, and Scotland, before returning to Mayport on 9 August.

The carrier operated off Florida and in the Caribbean until 15 June 1958, when she sailed on another Mediterranean cruise returning to her newly assigned home port, Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 4 September.

The carrier operated out of Quonset Point until 29 June 1960, when she made a midshipmen&#x27;s cruise to Halifax, Nova Scotia, returning on 12 August. Beginning on 7 February, she made a cruise to the Caribbean, returning on 2 March.

====Project Mercury====
&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was selected as the prime recovery ship for America&#x27;s first crewed space flight. She sailed for the recovery area on 1 May 1961, and was on station on 5 May when Commander Alan Shepard was recovered, along with his spacecraft &quot;Freedom 7&quot;, after splashdown some down range from Cape Canaveral. Helicopters from the carrier visually tracked the descent of the capsule and were over it two minutes after splashdown. They recovered Shepard and the &quot;Freedom 7&quot; capsule, delivering them safely to &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;″s flight deck.

During retrieval, the vessel was under the command of then-Captain Ralph Weymouth. There were some complications in retrieval, as the helicopters that were to retrieve Alan Shepard from the craft did not have the explosive squibs required to cut the Mercury craft&#x27;s radio antenna. The Mercury craft&#x27;s antenna was designed to help locate the craft if it landed out of visual tracking range. The antenna would have gotten in the way of retrieving Shepard from the craft if it had deployed; fortunately, it had a malfunction and was unable to deploy.

====Caribbean and Cuban blockade====
For the next year, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. In June 1962, she and her escorts embarked First and Third Class Regular NROTC Midshipmen for a summer training cruise from NAS Quonset Point to offshore training areas, Canadian Forces Base Halifax, Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, and Kingston, Jamaica, where she represented the US at the island&#x27;s celebration of its independence on 3 August. The midshipmen acted as tour guides for visitors aboard and provided an honor guard ashore for then-VP Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s speech in a local park.

On 24 October, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; joined in a classic exercise of sea power – the quarantine of Cuba, where the Soviet Union was constructing bases for offensive missiles. To block this grave threat, U.S. warships deployed throughout the western Atlantic, choking off the flow of military supplies to Cuba and enforcing American demands for the withdrawal of the Russian offensive missiles.

After the American demands were substantially complied with, &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; sailed for home on 23 November via St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and arrived Quonset Point on 4 December 1962. For the next few months the carrier was in New England waters for operations and overhaul. In September 1963, while she was on a cruise to Guantanamo Bay, her training schedule was interrupted when she was ordered to Haiti to relieve distress caused by Hurricane Flora. Her helicopters located homeless victims and flew them food and medical supplies.

On 6 May 1964, an collision occurred between &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; and the destroyer while underway in the Atlantic Ocean. No one was injured during the accident and &quot;Decatur&quot; sailed back to Norfolk under her own power with significant damage to her mast, superstructure and stack.

====North Atlantic and Project Gemini====
&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; returned to Quonset Point on 9 November for operations in New England waters. She visited Bermuda briefly in spring of 1964 and steamed to Spain in the fall for landings near Huelva. She sailed on 6 November from Barcelona for the United States, touched at Gibraltar and arrived at Quonset Point on 25 November. The first half of 1965 found &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; performing training duties and conducting exercises up and down the East Coast, and on 19 January 1965, was the recovery ship for the uncrewed Gemini 2 mission. For FY 1966, the Navy proposed a modernization program for &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara refused to authorize the proposal, citing the limited effectiveness of anti-submarine carriers.

&quot;Lake Champlain&quot; completed her last major duty on 29 August 1965 when she served as the primary recovery ship for Gemini 5. Shortly afterward, she sailed to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she commenced inactivation. She was decommissioned on 2 May 1966 and was laid up in the Reserve Fleet.

The Spanish Navy considered acquiring &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; but instead chose the carrier , which was renamed &quot;Dédalo&quot;.

The 24-year-old &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; was stricken from the Navy List on 1 December 1969, and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 28 April 1972.

<doc id="402282" wikidata="Q961280" url="?curid=402282" title="USS Valley Forge (CV-45)">
<text>USS &quot;Valley Forge&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-45, LPH-8) was one of 24 s built during and shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the first US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named after Valley Forge, the 1777–1778 winter encampment of General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was commissioned in November 1946, too late to serve in World War II, but saw extensive service in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. She was reclassified in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), then to an antisubmarine carrier (CVS), and finally to an amphibious assault ship (LPH), carrying helicopters and Marines. As a CVS she served in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She was the prime recovery vessel for an early uncrewed Mercury space mission. After conversion to an LPH she served extensively in the Vietnam War. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was awarded eight battle stars for Korean War service and nine for Vietnam War service, as well as three Navy Unit Commendations.

Although she was extensively modified internally as part of her conversion to an amphibious assault ship, external modifications were minor, so throughout her career &quot;Valley Forge&quot; retained the classic appearance of a World War II &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1970, and sold for scrap in 1971.

==Construction and Commissioning==

The citizens of the Philadelphia area in 1945 bought over $76,000,000 worth of E Bonds during the Seventh War Loan Drive to pay for &quot;Valley Forge&quot;—equal to $ in . School children of Philadelphia sold $7,769,351 of these bonds (equivalent to $ in ).

The ship was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; , laid down on 7 September 1944 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Like all long-hull &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships, she was long overall and at the waterline. Her beam was at the extreme and at the waterline. Her draft was at standard load and full load. As designed, her displacement was standard and full load.

For propulsion, the ships in her class had eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers producing steam at and delivering . She used four Westinghouse geared turbines connected to four diameter propellers. She was designed for a maximum speed of and a range of at . During sea trials, her engines produced and she attained . She carried of fuel oil and of aviation gasoline.

For armament, she was originally equipped with a battery of twelve /38 caliber guns, eight mounts of four 40-mm Bofors guns and 46 20-mm Oerlikon cannon. She was protected by of armor on the hangar and protective decks while her belt armor was thick. Protective bulkheads had of armor. The conning tower had of Special Treatment Steel (STS) on the top and there was of STS on the sides of the pilot house. The steering gear had a deck.

Her flight deck was and her hangar deck was by high. She was equipped with two elevators, each with a capacity of , two flight deck aircraft catapults, and the Mark IV arresting gear. She was designed to carry 36 fighter aircraft, 36 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo bombers but this changed through her career as her mission and naval aircraft changed. Her design complement was 268 officers and 2363 men. By the end of the war, the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers had a complement of 3385 officers and men.

Being one of the youngest &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; did not receive the SCB-27 or SCB-125 modifications that her older sisters received. She maintained the World War II-style straight flight deck throughout her life. Her armament was changed in 1954 with her conversion to an antisubmarine carrier CVS-45. Her 20 mm Oerlikon cannon were removed and she carried the original twelve /38 caliber guns and a total of 72 40 mm Bofors guns.

She was launched on 18 November 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Mildred Vandegrift (née Strode), wife of Alexander A. Vandegrift, the Commandant of the Marine Corps. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was commissioned on 3 November 1946, with Captain John W. Harris in command.

As a commissioning gift, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presented &quot;Valley Forge&quot; with the finest State Silver Service ever presented to the Navy. The service was designed and made by Philadelphia silversmiths in 1904 and was originally placed aboard . The elaborate service was decorated in tradition with Neptune, sea horses and dolphins as well as historic scenes and personalities and a State seal.

==Service history==

===1947–1950===

Following fitting out, on 16 Jan 1947 the first eleven aircraft landed on &quot;Valley Forge&quot;. A Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Commander H. H. Hirshey, the Commanding Officer of VF5B was the first to land on the new carrier. The next day, 96 aircraft and personnel from Air Group 5 were taken aboard.

The carrier got underway on 24 January for shakedown training, which took her, via Naval Station Norfolk, to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, and the Panama Canal Zone. She completed the cruise on 18 March and returned to Philadelphia for post-shakedown overhaul. The ship left Philadelphia on 14 July, headed south, and transited the Panama Canal on 5 August and a message was sent to Commander Air Pacific (ComAirPac) – &quot;USS &quot;Valley Forge&quot; reporting for duty&quot;. She arrived at her new home port, Naval Base San Diego on 14 August and joined the United States Pacific Fleet.

====Round the World Cruise====
Following the embarkation of Air Group 11 and intensive air and gunnery training in coastal waters, the aircraft carrier – flying the flag of Rear Admiral Harold L. Martin, Commander of Task Force 38 (TF 38) – got underway for Hawaii on 9 October. The task force devoted almost three months to training operations out of Naval Station Pearl Harbor before sailing for Australia on 16 January 1948. After a visit to Sydney, the American warships conducted exercises with units of the Royal Australian Navy and then steamed to Hong Kong.

During a voyage from the British crown colony to Tsingtao, China, orders arrived directing the task force to return home via the Atlantic with her escorting destroyers. The ship continued the round-the-world trip with calls at Hong Kong, Singapore, and Trincomalee, Ceylon. On 21 March 1948 at 0800, she was at 18-43&#x27;N and 64-33&#x27;E – halfway around the world. She visited the Persian Gulf and anchored off the ARAMCO refinery in Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia as a gesture of goodwill from the American government. On 25 March, the ship&#x27;s complement &quot;manned the rail&quot; for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and officers attended a banquet given by Crown Prince of Damman. Rounding the Arabian peninsula, she became the largest aircraft carrier and the longest ship at that time to transit the Suez Canal. On 6 April she joined with the Mediterranean Fleet carrier , cruisers , , , and six destroyers for three days of sea exercises.

After a call at Gibraltar and then entering the Atlantic Ocean, she set a course to Bergen, Norway. On 29 April, she moored in Bergen after a trip through the treacherous fjords with snow squalls reducing visibility to less than 100 ft at times. The crew paraded through the main part of the city, causing concern, as this was the way the German occupation entered in World War II. On 1 May, a &quot;May Day&quot; parade and celebration was held; unfortunately for the crew, all local pubs were closed. Air Group 11 flew in parade formation over the Capital City of Oslo, spelling the name of King Haakon VII.

The ship was underway 4 May for Portsmouth, England; the historic base of the Royal Navy. After firing a 21-gun salute while passing the imposing , the ship was moored near , Admiral Nelson&#x27;s flagship. The Commander of 6th Fleet authorized 72-hour staggered liberty pass for all hands.

Underway 13 May to New York; on 22 May entered the Lower New York Bay. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Louis Denfield, who was instrumental in initiating the World cruise, was welcomed aboard for a visit. Underway 27 May for the Panama Canal, she arrived 11 June in San Diego Bay.

In July 1948, new squadrons joined &quot;Valley Forge&quot; bringing with them the Navy&#x27;s newly introduced aircraft, the Douglas A-1 Skyraider, and the Navy&#x27;s first jet fighters, the McDonnell F2H Banshee and the Grumman F9F Panther. These squadrons gave new capabilities to the ship. Intensive air operations and additional training and exercises commenced with the new aircraft.

===Korean War===

&quot;Valley Forge&quot; deployed to the Far East, departing the west coast on 1 May 1950. While anchored in Hong Kong harbor on 25 June, the warship received the news that North Korean forces had attacked across the 38th parallel into South Korea. Departing Hong Kong the next day, the carrier steamed south to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, where she provisioned, fueled, and set her course for Okinawa. On 28 June, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; became flagship of the United States Seventh Fleet and formed Task Force 77 with cruiser &quot;Rochester&quot; and six destroyers. On 30 June, Task Force 77 rendezvoused with ships of the Royal Navy including the cruiser , the carrier , and two British destroyers, under the command of Rear Admiral Andrews, RN.

The first carrier air strike of the Korean War was launched from &quot;Valley Forge&quot;″s flight deck on 3 July 1950. Successive waves of A-1 Skyraiders and F4U Corsairs struck the North Korean airfield at Pyongyang bombing hangars, fuel storages, parked aircraft, and railroad marshaling yards while F9F Panthers, flying top cover, downed two Yak-9s and damaged another. This was the world&#x27;s first combat strike by jet aircraft.

In spite of attempts by United Nations forces to stop the steady flow of North Korean infantry and armor, the North steadily pushed the South Koreans back into a tenuous defense perimeter around Pusan.

On September 4, 1950, Chance Vought F4U Corsairs of VF-53 took off from the ship to chase down 2 Douglas A-20 Havoc of the Soviet Naval Aviation over the Yellow Sea and shot down one to prevent them from finding a concentration of American ships preparing for the Incheon landing.

On 18 September 1950, the American landing at Inchon outflanked the North Koreans while United Nations forces broke out of the perimeter to the south. After the landing at Inchon, the tide of battle changed and Korean, American, and other allied troops pushed northward and crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. Air Group 5 made numerous daily strikes against North Korean targets. Troop concentrations, defensive positions, and supply and communications lines were repeatedly bombed by the A-1 Skyraiders and the F9F Panthers and F4U Corsairs delivered rocket and cannon fire. Over 5,000 combat sorties delivered of bombs and rockets between 3 July and 19 November 1950. During this time, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; maintained a high operational record as she steamed up and down the coast of Korea, a distance equal to twice around the world.

====Second Deployment====

Returning to San Diego for overhaul, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; arrived on the west coast on 1 December, only to have sailing orders urgently direct her back to Korea. In the interim, between the carrier&#x27;s leaving station and her planned overhaul, Chinese forces had entered the war, launching a powerful offensive which sent United Nations troops retreating back to the south. Accordingly, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; hurriedly embarked a new air group, about 100 planes and 10 helicopters; replenished, of provisions and stores and of ammunition were loaded in record time of three days; and sailed on 6 December for the Far East.

Rendezvousing with Task Force 77 three days before Christmas of 1950, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; recommenced air strikes on the 23rd and continued for three months of concentrated air operations against the advancing Chinese and North Korean forces. The first offensive air operations consisting of close air support missions assisting soldiers and marines on the ground. F4U Corsair and A-1 Skyraider pilots struck at troop concentrations, supply dumps, bridges, gun emplacements and railroad equipment. The United Nation forces were able to move north again on the Korean Peninsula and up to the 38th parallel. During her second deployment, the ship launched some 2,580 sorties in which her planes delivered some of bombs.

On 29 March the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; turned east and began her voyage back home again to San Diego, after spending almost ten continuous months in Korean waters, arriving at North Island on 7 April. The ship, needing long-awaited yard repairs, sailed to Bremerton, Washington and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard where she underwent a major overhaul.

====Third Deployment====

&quot;Valley Forge&quot; returned to San Diego on 10 Aug 1951, ready for a new assignment with the Pacific Fleet. Air Group 1 embarked and she became the first U.S. carrier to return for a third Korean deployment. On 11 December, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; launched her first air strikes in railway interdiction – keep supplies from reaching enemy front lines. Rockets, cannon fire, and bombs from the ship&#x27;s air group, and those of her sister ships also on station, hammered at North Korean railway targets – lines, junctions, marshaling yards, and rolling stock. By June, &quot;Valley Forge&quot;″s Skyraiders, Corsairs, and Panthers had severed rail lines in at least 5,346 places. She returned to her homeport in San Diego on 3 July 1952.

====Fourth Deployment====

In October 1952, she was reclassified an attack carrier and redesignated CVA-45. Again, in October 1952 she stood out and headed for the Far East. She now had become the only U.S. carrier to return to the Korea combat zone four times. On 2 January 1953, Captained by Robert E. Dixon, she began the new year with strikes against Chinese supply dumps and troop billeting areas behind the stalemated front lines. While the propeller-driven Skyraiders and Corsairs delivered tons of bombs on their targets, the jet Panthers conducted flak-suppression missions using a combination of cannon fire and rockets to knock out troublesome enemy gun sites. This close teamwork between old and new style planes made possible regular strikes against Korea&#x27;s eastern coastlines and close-support missions to aid embattled Marine or Army forces on the battle lines. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; air groups dropped some of bombs on the enemy before the ship left the Korean coast and returned to San Diego on 25 June 1953.

===1954–1960===
After a west-coast overhaul, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet and reclassified – this time to an antisubmarine warfare support carrier – and redesignated CVS-45. She was refitted for her new duties at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and then rejoined the Fleet in January 1954. The carrier soon got underway to conduct exercises to develop and perfect the techniques and capabilities needed to carry out her new duties. Conducting local operations and antisubmarine warfare exercises, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; operated off the east coast through late 1960, varied by a visit to England and the eastern Atlantic for exercises late in 1954. Her operations during this period also included midshipman and reservists&#x27; training cruises and occasional visits to the Caribbean.

Carrying out training operations out of Guantanamo Bay in 1957, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; accomplished an American naval &quot;first&quot; in October, when she embarked the ship&#x27;s landing party and twin-engined HR2S-1 Mojave helicopters. Experimenting with the new concept of &quot;vertical envelopment&quot;; first pioneered by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines during the Suez Crisis in 1956; &quot;Valley Forge&quot;″s helicopters air-lifted the landing party to the beachhead and then returned them to the ship in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first ship-based air assault exercise. In March she again joined ships of the Amphibious Force for a major amphibious landing exercise, LANTPHIBEX 1-58. She off loaded nearly 1,400 Marines, landing them ashore from troop-carrying helicopters.

On 1 April 1958, Rear Admiral John S. Thach hoisted his two-star flag to the carrier&#x27;s main as the ship became flagship of Task Group Alpha (TG Alpha). This group, built around &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, included eight destroyers, two submarines, and one squadron each of antisubmarine helicopters and airplanes; a detachment of airborne early warning airplanes, modified A-1 Skyraiders called &quot;guppies&quot; because of their bulging ventral Radomes; and a land-based Lockheed P-2 Neptune. A significant development in naval tactics, TG Alpha concentrated solely on developing and perfecting new devices and techniques for countering the potential menace of enemy submarines in an age of nuclear propulsion and deep-diving submersibles.

Observing the New Year (1958–1959) at sea, the carrier was steaming in very heavy weather when she was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with a merchant ship. Heavy seas severely damaged the forward portion of the flight deck, requiring her to proceed to the New York Naval Shipyard for repairs. To ready her for service as quickly as possible, a corresponding section was taken from the flight deck of the inactive carrier , berthed at Bayonne, New Jersey. The damaged section was cut away from flight deck and the &quot;Franklin&quot; deck piece installed in its place. A bronze plaque was mounted on the newly replaced deck section to commemorate how the &quot;Franklin&quot; was damaged in action off Japan in April 1945.

&quot;Valley Forge&quot; remained engaged in operations with TG Alpha through the early fall of 1959, when she then entered the New York Naval Shipyard for repairs. The ship returned to sea on 21 January 1960, bound for maneuvers in the Caribbean. During her ensuing operations, the carrier served as the launching platform for Operation Skyhook. This widely publicized scientific experiment involved the launching of three of the largest balloons ever fabricated, carrying devices to measure and record primary cosmic ray emissions at an altitude of between above the Earth&#x27;s surface. Following a deployment in the eastern Mediterranean &quot;Valley Forge&quot; returned to Norfolk to resume local operations on 30 August, continuing antisubmarine exercises as flagship of TG Alpha through the fall of 1960.

On 19 December, the carrier acted as the primary recovery ship for the Mercury-Redstone 1A uncrewed space capsule, the first flight of the Redstone rocket as part of Project Mercury. Her helicopters retrieved the capsule, launched from Cape Canaveral, after its successful 15-minute flight and splashdown. Two days later off Cape Hatteras, in response to an SOS, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; sped to the aid of the tanker SS &quot;Pine Ridge&quot;, which had broken in two during a storm. While the survivors of the stricken ship clung to the after half of the tanker, the carrier&#x27;s helicopters shuttled back and forth to pick up the men in distress. Soon, all 28 survivors were safe on board &quot;Valley Forge&quot;.

===1961–1964===
Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 6 March 1961 for overhaul and modification to an amphibious assault ship, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was reclassified as LPH-8 on 1 July 1961 and, soon thereafter, began refresher training in the Caribbean. She returned to Hampton Roads in September and trained in the Virginia capes area with newly embarked, troop-carrying helicopters. In October, the ship – as a part of the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s ready amphibious force – proceeded south to waters off Hispaniola and stood by from 21–25 October and from 18–29 November to be ready to evacuate any American nationals from the Dominican Republic of needed during the struggle for power in the months following the assassination of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo.

After returning home late in the year, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; sailed from Norfolk on 6 January 1962, bound for Long Beach and duty with the Pacific Fleet. At the end of three months of training off the west coast, the amphibious assault ship steamed westward for duty in the Far East with the Seventh Fleet. With the flag of the Commander, Ready Amphibious Task Group, 7th Fleet at her main, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; closed the coast of Indochina under orders to put ashore her embarked Marines. In Laos, communist Pathet Lao forces had renewed their assault on the Royal Laotian Government and the latter requested President John F. Kennedy to land troops to avert a feared, full-scale communist invasion of the country. The amphibious assault ship airlifted her Marines into the country on 17 May and, when the crisis had abated a few weeks later, carried them out again in July.

For the remainder of 1962, the ship operated in the Far East before returning to the west coast of the United States to spend the first half of 1963 in amphibious exercises off the coast of California and in the Hawaiian Islands. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 1 July 1963 for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul, including the installation of improved electronics and facilities for transporting and handling troops and troop helicopters. Putting to sea again on 27 January 1964, the newly modernized assault ship rejoined the fleet and, following local operations and training, departed Long Beach for another WestPac deployment. She stopped at Pearl Harbor and Okinawa, en route to Hong Kong, and then steamed to Taiwan. In June, she joined ships of other SEATO navies in amphibious exercises and then visited the Philippines, where in July she was awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;.

===Vietnam War===

On 2 August 1964, North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin incident. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; then spent 57 days at sea off the Vietnamese coast in readiness to land its Marines if required.

Returning to Long Beach on 5 November, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; made two round-trip voyages to Okinawa carrying marines and aircraft before commencing a WestPac deployment in the South China Sea in late 1965. With a Marine landing force embarked and flying the flag of Commander, Amphibious Squadron 3, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; conducted intensive training exercises in the Philippines while preparing for service in Vietnam.

In mid-November, the amphibious assault ship stood by in reserve during Operation Blue Marlin and then airlifted its marines ashore for Operation Dagger Thrust and Operation Harvest Moon before spending the Christmas season in Okinawa. After embarking a fresh Marine battalion and a medium transport helicopter squadron, it sailed for South Vietnam on 3 January 1966. Following pauses at Subic Bay and Chu Lai, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; arrived off the Vietnamese coast on 27 January and, two days later, launched its landing forces to take part in Operation Double Eagle. Remaining on station off the coast, the ship provided logistic and medical support with inbound helicopters supplying the men ashore and outbound helicopters evacuating casualties for medical treatment back on the ship. Reembarking its landing team on 17 February, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; proceeded northward, while its Marines rested. The second phase of &quot;Double Eagle&quot; commenced two days later, and the ship&#x27;s Marines again went ashore via helicopter to attack enemy concentrations. By 26 February, the operation had drawn to a close, and &quot;Valley Forge&quot; reembarked its Marines and sailed for Subic Bay.

Following a round trip to Đà Nẵng, the carrier steamed back to the west coast for an overhaul and local training along the California coast before again deploying to WestPac. Upon its return to Vietnamese waters, the ship took part in operations off Đà Nẵng before it again returned to the United States at the end of the year 1966.

After undergoing a major overhaul and conducting training off the west coast, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; returned to the Far East again in November 1967 and took part in Operation Fortress Ridge, launched on 21 December. Air-landing its troops at a point just south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the ship provided continual supply and medical evacuation (Medevac) services for this &quot;search and destroy&quot; operation aimed at eliminating People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units which threatened American and South Vietnamese troops. The completion of this operation on the day before Christmas 1967 did not mark the end of &quot;Valley Forge&quot;″s operations for this year, however, as it was again in action during Operation Badger Tooth, near Quảng Trị in northern South Vietnam.

Upkeep at Đà Nẵng preceded its deployment to its new station off Đồng Hới, where it provided her necessary resupply and MedEvac support for Allied troops operating against PAVN forces. Operation Badger Catch, commencing on 23 January 1968 and extending through 18 February, supported the Cửa Việt Base, at the mouth of the Thạch Hãn River south of the DMZ, before the ship set course for Subic Bay and much-needed maintenance.
Subsequently, returning to Vietnam, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; operated as &quot;Helo Haven&quot; for Marine helicopter units whose shore bases had come under attack by PAVN ground and artillery fire. During Operation Badger Catch II, from 6 March – 14 April, Marine helicopters landed on board the carrier while their land bases were being cleared of PAVN troops. Following a routine refit at Subic Bay, the ship took part in Operation Badger Catch III from 28 April – 3 June. It then moved to Đà Nẵng and prepared for Operation Swift Saber which took place from 7–14 June. Landing Exercise Hilltop XX occupied the ship early in July. Then &quot;Valley Forge&quot; transferred its Marines and helicopters to and headed home via Hong Kong, Okinawa, and Pearl Harbor. She reached Long Beach on 3 August.

Following five months on the west coast which included local operations and an overhaul, the amphibious assault ship returned to the Far East for the last time departing Long Beach on 30 January 1969.

At San Diego, it embarked a cargo of Marine Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters for delivery to transport squadrons in Vietnam. The ship stopped at Pearl Harbor and paused near Guam while one of its helicopters carried a stricken crewman ashore for urgent surgery. It loaded special landing-force equipment at Subic Bay and embarked the Commander, Special Landing Forces Bravo and a squadron of Marine Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight transport helicopters. On 10 March, the carrier began operating in support of Operation Defiant Measure, steaming off Đà Nẵng as its helicopters flew missions &quot;on the beach&quot;. This was completed by 18 March, and &quot;Valley Forge&quot; debarked its helicopters before steaming to Subic Bay for upkeep.

After its return to Đà Nẵng on 3 May, the ship reembarked its helicopters as well as part of a battalion landing team of Marines who had been taking part in fighting ashore. The carrier continued to operate in the Đà Nẵng area during the weeks that followed, its helicopters flying frequent support missions, and its Marines preparing for further combat landings.

During late May and early June, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; received visits from Secretary of the Navy John Chafee and Vice Admiral William F. Bringle, Commander 7th Fleet. It offloaded its Marines at Đà Nẵng on 10 June and embarked a battalion landing team for transportation to Okinawa, where it arrived on 16 June. The landing team conducted amphibious exercises with &quot;Valley Forge&quot; for 11 days and boarded the ship for a voyage to Subic Bay where they continued the training process. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; returned to the Đà Nẵng area on 8 July and resumed flying helicopter support for Marine ground forces in the northern I Corps area. The ship took evasive action to avoid an approaching typhoon and then began preparations for an amphibious operation.
Operation Brave Armada began on 24 July with a helicopter-borne assault on suspected Việt Cộng and PAVN positions in Quảng Ngãi Province. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; remained in the Quảng Ngãi–Chu Lai area to support this attack until its completion on 7 August. It then steamed to Đà Nẵng to debark its Marines. General Leonard F. Chapman, Jr., the Commandant of the Marine Corps, visited &quot;Valley Forge&quot; that same day. The ship sailed for Okinawa on 13 August arriving four days later and debarking its helicopter squadron before getting underway again to evade another typhoon. It proceeded to Hong Kong, and on 22 August, received a message announcing its forthcoming inactivation. It returned to Đà Nẵng on 3 September to load material for shipment to the United States and sailed that evening for U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka for three days of upkeep before leaving the Far East.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Valley Forge&quot; got underway from Yokosuka on 11 September 1969 and anchored at Long Beach on 22 September. After leave and upkeep, she offloaded ammunition and equipment at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach and Naval Base San Diego. The ship returned to Long Beach on 31 October to prepare for decommissioning. This process continued through the new year; and on 15 January 1970, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was placed out of commission. Her name was struck from the Navy List on the same day.

While at Long Beach, from 14–28 February 1971, the interior of the aircraft carrier was used as a shooting location for filming the 1972 science fiction film &quot;Silent Running&quot;. The central location of the film is a long space-bound cargo freighter, carrying six large geodesic domes, under which the last forests of an environmentally-devastated Earth are kept.

The producers of the film were searching for pre-existing locations which could represent the cargo deck, control rooms, and living quarters of a fictional &quot;space freighter.&quot; Building sets on Hollywood sound stages would have been prohibitively expensive, so in order to minimize the impact on the film&#x27;s minimal budget, various large interior locations were investigated, including warehouses, cargo ships, and oil tankers. After contacting the United States Navy with a query about the use of aircraft carriers, the producers were directed to several decommissioned &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers awaiting scrapping at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, including the USS &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, and fellow carriers &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; and . The type of location proved to be perfect for the film, the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was selected, and a deal was struck with the Navy. In honor of the filming location, the space freighter of the film was christened &quot;Valley Forge&quot;.

The carrier&#x27;s hangar deck was featured in the film as a cargo hold, which was repainted and filled with polystyrene modules representing futuristic cargo containers. Her flight command area was heavily modified to represent the control room and living quarters of the fictional space ship crew. Bulkheads were cut out and replaced with wider passageways to allow for camera and actor movement. Set pieces, computer consoles, and various props were moved in to dress the ship as the space freighter. The production crew was allowed to do anything they wanted with the ship, as long as no metal was removed. All power and water had to be imported, as the crew was not allowed to use ship power. Filming was hampered by the tight confines of the carrier, necessitating several innovations in the filming process.

Eight months after filming wrapped, and after the failure of attempts to raise funds for using the ship as a museum, she was sold on 29 October 1971 to the Nicolai Joffre Corporation, of Beverly Hills, California, for scrap.

==Awards==
&quot;Valley Forge&quot; was awarded eight battle stars for Korean War service and nine for Vietnam War service, as well as a Navy Unit Commendation.

<text>Rocket Robin Hood is a Canadian animated television series, placing the characters and conflicts of the classic Robin Hood legend in a futuristic, outer space setting. It was produced by Krantz Films, Inc. and aired on CBC Television from 1966 to 1969.

==Summary==
Rocket Robin Hood leads his &quot;Merry Men&quot;—including the strong, dimwitted and likeable Little John; consummate overeater Friar Tuck (who designs all of the Merry Men&#x27;s weaponry); his two-fisted, red-headed cousin Will Scarlet; Robin&#x27;s plucky girlfriend Maid Marian; his sharp-witted right-hand man Alan-a-Dale; scrawny and feisty camp cook Giles (a reformed crook and Gabby Hayes-type); and other characters from the classic story of Robin Hood. They live in &quot;the astonishing year 3000&quot; on New Sherwood Forest Asteroid and are determined to foil the despotic plans of Prince John and his bumbling lackey, the Sheriff of N.O.T.T. (National Outer-space Terrestrial Territories) and other villains such as Dr. Medulla, Manta, Nocturne and the Warlord of Saturn. Rocket Robin Hood and his merry men fly in spaceships and use weapons such as &quot;electro-quarterstaffs&quot;.

Each 22-minute episode is divided into three segments, with cliffhangers between the first and second part and the second and third part. All episodes also feature short vignettes of the various characters.

A male chorus sang the opening and closing themes for each of the three seasons in the style of traditional old English ballads mixed with military marches.

==Voice cast==
* Carl Banas as Titanor / Dr. Manta
* Len Birman as Rocket Robin Hood
* Chris Wiggins as Will Scarlet / Infinata / Baron Blank
* Bernard Cowan as Narrator
* Ed McNamara as Little John
* Paul Kligman as Friar Tuck
* Gillie Fenwick as the Sheriff of N.O.T.T.
* John Scott as Prince John

==Background==
&quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot; was produced and animated at Trillium Productions, an animation studio that was part of the Guest Group—a creative group of companies owned by producer Al Guest. One of the key animators was Jean Mathieson, one of the first female animators in Canada, who later formed Rainbow Animation in Canada and Magic Shadows Inc in the U.S. with Guest, where they continued to produce animated TV programming.

Background designer Richard H. Thomas joined the group late in the second season and brought a dark, almost psychedelic feel to the production under Associate Producer for Krantz Films Ralph Bakshi, who would later become a well known animation producer and would be responsible for, among other series, the animated film versions of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Third-season episodes were animated at Ralph&#x27;s Spot in New York City, although voices continued to be recorded in Toronto. One of the show&#x27;s chief designers during this time was science fiction illustrator/comic book artist Gray Morrow.

Bernard Cowan was the show&#x27;s narrator. Paul Kligman, who voiced J. Jonah Jameson in the 1960s animated version of Spider-Man, was the voice of Friar Tuck. Len Birman, who appeared in the movies &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976) and &quot;Bayo&quot; (1985), was the voice of Rocket Robin Hood. Len Carlson subbed for Birman as Rocket Robin Hood in some third-season episodes. Carl Banas was the voice of Titanor / Dr. Manta. Ed McNamara provided the voice of Little John. Chris Wiggins was the voice of Will Scarlet.

There was also a French version titled &quot;Robin Fusée&quot;, broadcast on French-language television in Canada.

===Connection to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;===
The &quot;Spider-Man&quot; episodes &quot;Phantom from the Depths of Time&quot; and &quot;Revolt in the Fifth Dimension&quot; were largely recycled animation from two episodes (&quot;From Menace to Menace&quot; and &quot;Dementia Five&quot;) of &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;, with Spider-Man substituted for Rocket Robin Hood on the animation cels.

<text>USS &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-47, AVT-11) was one of 24 s of the United States Navy, and the first ship to be named for the Battle of the Philippine Sea. She was launched on 5 September 1945, after the end of World War II, and sponsored by the wife of the Governor of Kentucky.

During her career, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; served first in the Atlantic Ocean and saw several deployments to the Mediterranean Sea as well as a trip to Antarctica as a part of Operation Highjump. Sent to the Korean Peninsula at the outbreak of the Korean War, she sent aircraft in support of United Nations ground troops, first during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and then during the Inchon Landings and the Second Battle of Seoul. She subsequently supported UN troops during the surprise Chinese attack and the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; saw three tours to Korea during the war, receiving nine battle stars for her service.

For the remainder of her service, she operated primarily out of San Diego and San Francisco, seeing several deployments to the Far East and being redesignated an anti-submarine warfare carrier. She was decommissioned on 28 December 1958 and sold for scrap in 1970.

==Construction==
&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was the last of the 24 ships to be completed, among the largest and most numerous capital ships produced for World War II. CV-47 was ordered simultaneously to and in June 1943.
The ship was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; designs of the class, which had begun production after March 1943. This &quot;long-hull&quot; variant involved lengthening the bow above the waterline into a &quot;clipper&quot; form. The increased rake and flare provided deck space for two quadruple mounts; these units also had the flight deck slightly shortened forward to provide better arcs of fire. Of the &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships laid down after 1942, only followed the original &quot;short-hull&quot; design. The later ships have been variously referred to as the &quot;long-bow units&quot;, the &quot;long-hull group&quot;, or the &quot;&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class&quot;. However, the U.S. Navy never maintained any institutional distinction between the long-hull and short-hull members of the &quot;Essex&quot; class, and applied postwar refits and upgrades to both groups equally. The ship was powered by eight 600 psi Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, and Westinghouse geared steam turbines that developed 150,000 shaft horsepower that turned four propellers. Like other &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, she had a maximum speed of . The ship&#x27;s cost is estimated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000.

Like other &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; had a displacement of . She had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The ship was powered by steam turbines with a designed range of . While &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers typically had a designed maximum speed of , &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; only made on sea trials. The ship had a total crew complement of 3,310. Like other &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships, she was armed with twelve 38-caliber 5-inch (127 mm) dual-purpose guns arrayed in four twin and four single mountings, as well as 8 quadruple Bofors 40 mm guns and a variable number of Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Unlike her sisters, however, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; substituted additional Bofors guns for the Oerlikons with forty-four guns arrayed in 10 quadruple and two double mounts.

The keel of CV-47 was laid down 19 August 1944 at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy, Massachusetts. Originally, the ship was to be named in honor of the Wright brothers, but following the 19 June 1944 Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Navy decided that the ship be named after the battle, and on 13 February 1945, she was renamed. Construction on the ship continued throughout the summer of 1945, but &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was not completed at the time of V-E Day. The ship was launched on 5 September 1945, only days after V-J Day and the end of World War II. She was christened by the wife of Governor of Kentucky Albert &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler.

== Service history ==
&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; commissioned on 11 May 1946, when Rear Admiral Morton Deyo placed the ship under the command of Captain Delbert Strother Cornwell at the Boston Navy Yard in South Boston, Massachusetts. The ship remained drydocked at the yard for two weeks before sailing for Naval Air Station Quonset Point on 13 June. However, a shortage of men following the post-World War II demobilization forced her to remain at reduced operational status until 23 September when she embarked for sea trials.

Returning from trials on 27 September, the carrier embarked Carrier Air Group 20, which flew two squadrons of Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter aircraft as well as a squadron each of Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and Grumman TBM-3E Avenger torpedo bombers, about 90 aircraft total. She left port 30 September and commenced training en route to Norfolk, Virginia. CVG-20 Commander Robert M. Milner made the first takeoff from the carrier on 1 October aboard a Bearcat. &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard 12 October for Cuban waters where she conducted an abbreviated shakedown cruise and training exercises for CVG-20&#x27;s Grumman F8F Bearcats and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers until 20 November.

Following these trials, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was assigned to Operation Highjump. She returned to Quonset and disembarked CVG-20 before sailing for Boston for repairs and alterations. She then headed to Norfolk where Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd boarded her and she took on six Douglas R4D-5 Skytrain transports, two Stinson OY-1 Sentinel liaison aircraft, and a Sikorsky HO3S-1 helicopter along with cargo, spare parts, skis and Task Force 68 personnel. She left Norfolk 29 December and stood out of Hampton Roads 2 January 1947 en route to Antarctica. &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; passed through the Panama Canal 8 January and cleared Balboa by 10 January. By 12 January the ship had crossed the equator in an elaborate ceremony, but on 22 January its HO3S-1 was lost due to pilot error, though the crew was recovered. Two days later, it met the remaining ships of Task Force 68. The ship arrived on station on 29 January, from Little America, and launched its R4Ds in the next few days to explore the Antarctic. Commander William M. Hawkes and Byrd both disembarked from &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; aboard the aircraft to begin their expedition. After her aircraft departed, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; returned to Quonset, passing through Balboa again on 22 February and arriving back in port on 27 February.

In late March, the carrier embarked Carrier Air Group 9, which flew two squadrons of Gruman F8F Bearcats and Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters as well as a squadron each of SB2C Helldivers and TBM Avengers, and a detachment of HO3S helicopters for a total of about 100 aircraft. She completed her shakedown cruise at Guantánamo Bay until late May. She continued sea trials in the area until 1 July when she arrived at Gravesend Bay, New Jersey, for refit. She was refitted for most of the year at New York Naval Shipyard and Bayonne, New Jersey through 15 November 1947 before conducting trials and training around Quonset and Guantánamo Bay through February 1948. That month, she became flagship of Carrier Division Four led by Rear Admiral Ralph E. Jennings, who established his command aboard her on 4 February. On 20 February she departed for her first deployment in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Vice Admiral Forrest Sherman&#x27;s 6th Fleet. Here she logged 8,534 flight hours, including 85 hours of night operations. She returned to Quonset 26 June and for repairs to her catapult machinery. She spent the remainder of the year as a part of the Operational Development Force testing new carrier aircraft doctrine, and her pilots logged 750 hours in 670 carrier controlled approach tests and 314 successful landings. On 22 October she was sent to the North Atlantic to conduct cold-weather landing tests and tested problem landing scenarios along the Arctic Circle until 23 November 1948.

In January 1949, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; returned to Carrier Division Four under Rear Admiral Joseph J. Clark and embarked Carrier Air Group 7 for another tour in the Mediterranean, which had a similar fighter complement. She sailed 4 January with the aircraft carrier and supporting ships. There, she conducted joint exercises with carriers of the British fleet. She returned in late May and began an overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. On 18 August, Captain Raymond R. &quot;Raoul&quot; Waller was assigned as her commanding officer. That fall, the ship returned to the Caribbean to shake down with its new upgrades, this time with Carrier Air Group 1. For the rest of the year, she continued fleet exercises in the North Atlantic and testing for new jet engine powered fighter aircraft to test their abilities to operate on aircraft carriers.

Operating again from her base at Quonset Point, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; spent early 1950 qualifying new carrier pilots. During February and most of March, she took part in more fleet exercises throughout the Atlantic. During April and May 1950 she conducted demonstration cruises for guests of the Secretary of the Navy, the Armed Forces Industrial College, Air War College, and the Armed Forces Staff College. On 24 May 1950, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; sailed from Norfolk through the Panama Canal, arriving at her new home port of San Diego to join the Pacific Fleet. She was replaced in the Atlantic Fleet by . She was scheduled to begin a tour in the Far East in October 1950 before she was called to combat duty.

=== Korean War ===
With the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was ordered to Naval Base Pearl Harbor. She sailed for Hawaiian waters on 5 July with Carrier Air Group 11 embarked, flying four squadrons of Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. The ship departed for Japan on 24 July. Leaving Pearl Harbor, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; sailed at full speed for the Western Pacific, reaching Okinawa on 4 August. During this time, she took command of Carrier Division One. She was the third aircraft carrier to arrive in Korea, as her sister ship &quot;Valley Forge&quot; as well as had arrived in July. By the time &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; arrived in Korea, the UN forces had established superiority in the air and sea.

&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; arrived in Korean waters on 1 August, and became flagship of Task Force 77 on 5 August. She immediately began launching air strikes against strategic targets, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began and United Nations and United States Army forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army. Her first strikes were against Iri, Mokpo, and Kunsan. The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but the intensity of the battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily close air support missions for troops on the front lines. They also hit targets of opportunity, such as North Korean boats, bridges and dams spotted during missions. As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier. Except for brief rests to re-arm, refuel, or repair, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was in action continuously. She was put in a rotation of continuous action with &quot;Valley Forge&quot; to assure at least one was launching aircraft at all times. Following the beginning of The Great Naktong Offensive on 31 August, the two carriers launched 263 sorties to prevent the North Koreans from overrunning Pusan Perimeter. The ship sent sorties to defend Masan during the Battle of Masan, in spite of being from the area. The ship steamed to the southern tip of the Peninsula at on 1 September to support the Masan area more easily during the North Korean attacks.

With the other carriers of Task Force 77, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; targeted rail and communication centers around North Korean-controlled Seoul to Wonsan in September. The strikes were part of a deception plan to draw North Korean attention away from the UN force massing for an attack on Inchon. Stationed in the Yellow Sea, she sent numerous air attacks on Inchon and Wolmi-do in preparation for Operation Chromite. The day of the operation, 15 September, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; dispatched planes far inland to destroy North Korean positions and prevent reinforcements from countering the Inchon landings. Following the initial assault, she continued to provide close air support for the thrust inland to recapture Seoul. During this time, she was joined by . They were part of a massive invasion force of some 230 ships and hundreds of aircraft.

On 17 September 1950 a pair of Grumman F9F-2 Panthers launched from the deck of &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea&#x27;s capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield turned out to be little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from &quot;passengers&quot; on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20 mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to &quot;clothesline&quot; low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship and with the help of LSO Lt.j.g. &quot;Les&quot; Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.

In November 1950 when China surprised the United Nations ground troops with an unexpected counterattack from the Yalu River by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; planes saw heavy action. The US Navy had sent &quot;Valley Forge&quot; and several other ships away from Korea, expecting the conflict to end, and so the unprepared forces remaining in the area were heavily engaged. Throughout the long retreat from the Yalu River, the four carriers&#x27; Panthers, Skyraiders and Corsairs provided close air support for the trapped X Corps at Chosin Reservoir. Though the increasingly cold weather proved a problem for &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;, the ship continued to support the troops as they tried to evacuate from the reservoir and then cleared the path for their retreat to Hungnam. The carriers provided support with hundreds of aircraft sorties as 150,000 UN troops and civilians were evacuated, and then destroyed the port. During this support, &quot;Valley Forge&quot; and &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; were tightly clustered with and and commanders worried that they would be a target for air attack by North Korean MiG-15 fighters, prompting a large screen of 32 destroyers.

For the rest of 1950 and early 1951, she launched numerous attacks against Chinese forces around the 38th Parallel hoping to slow their advance as UN troops retreated. With only brief stops for repair and rest, the carrier continued numerous sorties against Chinese targets. On 25 February, command of Task Force 77 was transferred to &quot;Valley Forge&quot;. During this time, the cold weather hampered operations and blizzards occasionally shut them down completely. Putting into Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan, in late March 1951 for repair and refit, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; exchanged Air Group 11 for Carrier Air Group 2 from &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, a group which consisted mostly of Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. The same date as the transfer on 28 March, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; became flagship of Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, the commander of the 7th Fleet.

Returning to the Sea of Japan in April, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; led Task Force 77 as well as other ships of the 7th Fleet through the Strait of Formosa to the South China Sea. From the Formosa Strait, planes flew in parades over Formosa as part of a show of support for the newly formed nation of Taiwan, in an effort to boost morale of the nation. She steamed back to Korea three days later, in time to lend close air support to UN forces throughout early 1951 as they faced repeated offensives by the Chinese.

===Post-Korea===
&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; completed her first deployment to Korea and arrived at San Francisco on 9 June 1951. It conducted refits, repairs and patrol operations along the West Coast continued for the remainder of the year. On 19 December, she was the site of a test for an emergency nuclear weapon assembly, the first such test involving a nuclear weapon aboard a US Navy ship. The ship departed from San Diego on 31 December 1951. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1952, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; continued on to Yokosuka for a second deployment to Korea, arriving 20 January 1952 with Carrier Air Group 11, which flew five squadrons of the F4U Corsair, about 100 aircraft. During this tour, the front lines in Korea had largely stabilized, and instead the ship directed its aircraft against strategic targets, including the 23 June attack on the Sui-ho Dam in conjunction with &quot;Boxer&quot;, &quot;Princeton&quot;, and &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot;, and sending aircraft against targets in Pyongyang.

&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; returned to San Diego in August 1952. Her designation was changed to CVA, denoting an &quot;attack aircraft carrier&quot; in October. With five more Corsair squadrons of Carrier Air Group 9 embarked, she began a third cruise to the Far East early in December 1952 with about 100 aircraft. In this third tour in Korea, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; focused primarily on interdiction attacks against rail and communication lines in North Korea, hoping to limit supplies to the front lines. The North Korean offensive, begun at the same time truce talks began at Panmunjom, marked the beginning of a series of &quot;round the clock&quot; air sorties designed to weaken North Korean and Chinese front line troops and support UN troops when under attack. This mission continued until an armistice was signed in the summer of 1953, resulting in the &quot;de jure&quot; cessation of open warfare.

Following the end of her tour in Korea, the ship arrived in Alameda Naval Air Station in Alameda, California, on 14 August 1953 to offload Air Group 9, then entered drydock at Hunters Point in San Francisco for overhaul. On 9 January 1954, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; once more began training off the coast of San Diego. She then steamed west on 12 March, for her fourth tour in the Far East. She operated out of U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay near Olongapo, Philippines. She was part of Carrier Division 3 and operated alongside around French Indochina.

The most significant event of the tour occurred in late July 1954. Chinese airplanes had shot down a Douglas DC-4 passenger aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific Airways near Hainan Island off the Chinese coast. The Chinese military had believed it to be a Taiwanese military airplane. &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; was ordered into the area as part of a search mission to recover some of the 19 on board. While engaged in the search mission, a flight of the ship&#x27;s Douglas AD Skyraiders was attacked by two Chinese fighter aircraft. The Skyraiders returned fire and shot down the airplanes. Later this came to be known unofficially as the &quot;Hainan Incident&quot;.

Following this duty, the ship sailed for Hawaii, where she was used as a prop in the movie &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. The ship returned to San Diego on 18 November. Remaining in the area for four months, &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; conducted several training operations off the California coast. She then began her fifth cruise of the Far East on 1 April 1955 &quot;en route&quot; to Yokosuka. She operated in waters of Japan, Okinawa, and Taiwan for most of 1955, with Air Task Group 2 consisting of VF-123, VF-143 and VA-55, VF-123 flying the F9F-2 Panther jet fighter-bomber, VF-143 flying the Grumman F9F-6 Cougar jet fighter, and VA-55 flying the AD-6 Skyraider propeller attack bomber. During this time, she made trips to Hong Kong, Keelung and Formosa. On 23 November, she was redesignated as a CVS, or an anti-submarine warfare carrier. Her aircraft complement was replaced with several dozen S2F Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and HSS-1 Seabat helicopters. She returned to San Diego on 23 November 1955. Throughout 1956 she saw little activity as crew went on leave and she was docked for maintenance, and only conducted several routine training operations off the coast of southern California. In late 1956 she moved to Hawaii for more training operations.

In March 1957, she sailed for the western Pacific on a sixth tour to the area with the HSS-1s and S2Fs of VS-21, VS-23, and VS-37. She was there for two months before returning to San Diego and resuming training missions off the west coast in summer 1957. In November 1957, she found some debris of Pan Am Flight 7, an airline flight that disappeared en route to Hawaii. In January 1958, she steamed west on her last 7th Fleet deployment. Remaining six months, she returned to San Diego on 15 July and commenced inactivation. She was decommissioned 28 December 1958 and berthed with the United States Reserve Fleet at Long Beach, California. She was redesignated AVT-11, an auxiliary aircraft transport and landing training ship, on 15 May 1959. After 10 years docked at the reserve fleet, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 December 1969 and sold for scrapping on 23 March 1971 to Zidell Explorations Corporation in Portland, Oregon.

&quot;Philippine Sea&quot; received nine battle stars for Korean War service. During her career, she logged 82,000 launches, including 33,575 catapult shots, and 82,813 landings. In April 1987, a new was launched, a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided missile cruiser. An organization was also formed of veterans who had served aboard the ship, the &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; Association.

<text>A key grip is a senior role on movie sets, involved with a wide variety of behind-the-scenes tasks. The key grip supervises grip crews who support camera and lighting technicians; assesses what equipment is necessary for each shooting location; coordinates the transportation of this equipment and its set up; and arranges the general movement and positioning of the camera and collaborating with the director of photography. The key grip relies on the best boy as their foreperson to supervise the grip crew.

Industry myths vary as to the origins of the name &quot;grip&quot;. Some say it originated from the early days of the film industry when a production crew consisted of a director, camera person, assistants and workers. Workers acted as handymen, setting up all equipment needed, working from a kit, container or bag containing their tools. This bag was known as a &quot;grip&quot; and, as the industry evolved and workers began to separate into specialized groups, the name grip stuck with those that worked on rigging. It is most likely, however, that the term has origins in railway work, where &quot;gaffers&quot; and &quot;grips&quot; formed an integral part of the US rail transport system in the 19th century. The term &quot;gaffer&quot; is a contraction of &quot;grandfather&quot; or &quot;godfather&quot;, used by immigrant Irish-Americans as a term of respect for the supervisor of a gang of working men. A &quot;grip&quot; was a worker whose job it was to grip the electric cable above the tram and transfer it to the new line when the tram reached a junction. As the film industry took off, these titles became part of the vernacular. The word &quot;key&quot; when applied to &quot;grip&quot; simply means &quot;principal&quot;.

A typical key grip has worked in the industry for years and proved themself worthy of more responsibilities. Those who have attended film school or completed training courses have an advantage as they possess technical understanding of on-set procedures.

The role and responsibilities of a key grip can differ by region. In the United States, key grips supervise the set-up of both cameras and lights, despite unions preventing key grips from touching lights, while in places such as Hungary, key grips are able to move lights around to their suiting and electricians simply deal with &quot;everything that&#x27;s connected to a lamp&quot;.

==Responsibilities==
The job of key grip is a challenging one, demanding long hours, manual labour and travel. The roles and responsibilities that come with this are extensive and, as a result, key grips are expected to possess a wide variety of skills. These include creativity, adaptability, good communication, patience, agility, comfort with heights and leadership qualities.

Communication is particularly essential as much of a key grip&#x27;s work comes from their collaboration with directors, gaffers and electricians as well as the management of the grip crew. Some of the most important work between the director and key grip happens in pre-production, where meetings are held to discuss the vision for the project and how, through lighting and rigging, the key grip can bring this to life. To ensure that each series of shots can be created as envisioned, key grips direct where equipment is placed, coordinate the rigging and work with the gaffer on lighting positions. These meetings are typically followed by a location scout where the key grip will assess shooting locations and construct a general plan for the setup of lighting and rigging.

Key grips are depended upon to source the equipment themselves. As equipment is expensive and the amount required is extensive, it is typically rented from production companies and the key grip uses discretion and experience to determine from which companies to source the equipment. Often more than one company is relied on to fully satisfy the sizeable list of required equipment, all of which is organised in pre-production. The truck loaded with all the rented equipment is referred to as a grip package and the responsibility of its arrival at set also falls on the key grip.

Pre-production is also a chance for the key grip to assess how much work the project is going to take and hire grips accordingly to form the grip crew. The key grip is assisted primarily by the best boy, who acts as a second in charge, taking care of equipment, ordering supplies and supervising pre-rigging.

To enact the directors vision, the key grip is expected to keep up with a wide array of tasks to achieve specific shots. These can include rigging lights to vehicles for running shots, rigging silks and overheads, the placement of sand bags, transporting and adjusting heavy equipment, weatherproofing lights and cutting and shaping lights. A key grip is expected to quickly address, and ideally anticipate, any problems that arise when completing these tasks.

== Tools ==
To ensure that production runs smoothly key grips are required to have a personal tool kit with, at minimum, a &#x27;claw hammer, screwdriver, wire cutters, pliers, crescent wrench, and a tape measure&#x27;. These basics are required by union contracts, as much of a film crew&#x27;s safety and production depend on the ability of a key grip to efficiently and effectively complete their job. Alongside these basics, key grips are expected to be comfortable operating dangerous power tools and should add extra tools as they see fit.

=== Commonly used tools ===
* Claw hammer: For removing nails, providing better leverage than a typical hammer
* Tape measure: Ideally between 25 and 30 ft tape measure, necessary to correctly adjust lights and to measure distances
* Lineman&#x27;s pliers: Appropriate for heavy-duty cutting, bending or gripping of an object.
* C-wrenches: Aid in everyday rigging duties, 8–10&quot; varieties typically preferred
* Chalk: Makes for easy marking of equipment when measuring, adjusting or setting up
* Gloves: For safety purposes durable work gloves are required
* Gaffer tape: Easily tearable multipurpose cloth tape, useful when adjusting cables and cords, fixing equipment, etc.
* Torpedo level: Small, portable levels, approximately 9 inches long, useful for rigging, lighting, etc.

==Career path==
Typically, no degree is required of a key grip; however, those that have attended film school generally have some advantage as they are familiar with the processes of production. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees also offers training and advancement courses that are beneficial to those looking to make it in the industry. However, in places such as Chicago, key grips are expected to train in lighting, makeup, props and craft services as part of a three-year apprenticeship.

Despite the benefit a formal education can provide, the most significant qualification of a potential key grip is extensive experience on set. This can be gained by interning for key grips or at equipment rental companies to gain connections and experience. Typically, key grips will have worked within the grip crew for many years and, as a result, have established strong relationships with the rest of their crew. Starting out in the grip crew, it is expected that, with more experience, potential key grips will follow the path of grip, dolly grip, best boy and then rigging grip.

Typically, those looking to be key grips can expect a minimum of $36.35 an hour based on IATSE agreements, with starting yearly income of $60,000/year, increasing based on seniority and experience. The occupation is overwhelmingly male; from 2016 to 2018, only 1.4% of key grips working on major films were women.

== In other countries ==
In the US, key grips are responsible for much of the rigging and positioning of the camera and, despite being in charge of the set up and arrangement of lights, are prevented from moving lights due to standards set by unions; similarly, in the UK, key grips work solely with cameras. Many find this division of labour unnecessary and time-consuming as riggers must be hired to move cameras for the key grip and electricians are expected to rely on grips for any help with flagging.

European key grips are expected to oversee the camera and all that comes with it such as dollies, cranes, etc., essentially taking on the US equivalent of a dolly grip. For example, on larger sets, key grips will typically service camera A while a second grip will service camera B. The full responsibility of lighting is left to electricians while tasks requiring heavy rigging are left to grips. This typically means that European crews are made up of more electricians and fewer grips.

<text>Aesop&#x27;s Fables: The Smothers Brothers Way is the seventh comedy album by the Smothers Brothers (released March 15, 1965, on Mercury Records). It reached number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. Seven of Aesop&#x27;s more famous stories and morals are related in this album (or what are intended to be his fables but are often overshadowed by the bickering of the two brothers). The songs were written by John McCarthy.

The physical album has long been out of print, but is currently available in digital stores such as iTunes and Amazon Music. However, on the first track (&quot;OvertureAesop&#x27;s Fables Our Way&quot;), approximately 47 seconds of the beginning are missing for unknown reasons

<doc id="402301" wikidata="Q336273" url="?curid=402301" title="Motherland (anthem)">
<text>&quot;Motherland&quot; is the national anthem of Mauritius. The music was composed by Philippe Gentil, and the English lyrics were written by Jean-Georges Prosper. The anthem is short and briefly describes the luscious landscape of Mauritius. It also mentions the qualities of its people: peace, justice and liberty.

The national anthem was first played during the first Independence Day on 12 March 1968.

==History==
Mauritius was a British colony from 1810 and became an independent state on 12 March 1968, with Elizabeth II as Queen of Mauritius, represented as head of state by the Governor-General. The last governor, Sir John Shaw Rennie, served as the first governor-general until 27 August 1968. A competition was held to choose the best national anthem. Jean Georges Prosper, a popular poet, won the competition, and &quot;Motherland&quot; was chosen as the national anthem. Music for the anthem was later composed by police band musician Philippe Gentil. During the announcement of independence, the flag of the United Kingdom was lowered by Lieutenant D.E. Wenn from the British side, and the flag of Mauritius was hoisted by Inspector Palmyre of the Special Mobile Force from the Mauritian side. &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the national anthem of the UK, was played for the last time, and &quot;Motherland&quot; was played for the first time. It was followed by firing of 31 salvos in the harbour and a loud cheer from the crowd.

The Labour Party in various coalitions with the IFB, CAM and PMSD ruled Mauritius from the time of independence in 1968 to 1982, even cancelling the 1972 elections in order to stay in power. The newly founded MMM in coalition with Harish Boodhoo&#x27;s PSM won the 1982 election. Whilst in government interim-PM Paul Bérenger with the support of his MMM ministers sneakily decided to establish Mauritian Creole as the national language and replaced the national anthem &quot;Motherland&quot; by a Creole version during the 15th Anniversary of Independence on 15 March 1983, which was even aired nationwide on radio by the MBC. Paul Bérenger had not consulted with the elected Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth and other key partners of the MMM-PSM government, but had worked with Rama Poonoosamy (MMM Minister of Culture) and MBC&#x27;s boss Gaëtan Essoo to implement the unauthorised changes. Coincidentally during that week MMM-leader Jugnauth was on an official visit in India, and PSM-leader Boodhoo was off-duty due to an illness. Paul Bérenger&#x27;s authoritarian behaviour was sternly opposed by the MMM-PSM alliance, thus leading to the sacking of Gaëtan Essoo, then director general of the MBC and elections being called again in 1983.

== Lyrics ==
==Criticism==
Critics consider that the national anthem failed to inspire the people during not-so-prosperous times of the economy when communalism and casteism made headway. There is a strong criticism in sections of Mauritian media that although the anthem states unity as the prime strength of the nation, the nation stands divided even after 40 years of independence. Unity described as the strength of the nation, as quoted as &quot;as one people as one nation&quot;, is also posted as a challenge the country faces at the face of globalization. The harmony and cultural mix of different religious communities of the country are also not seen united in the nation. The unrest during 1969 clashes between Muslims and Creoles and the football tournaments until 1980 conducted on community basis are commonly quoted to show the indifference.

The fifth son of Henry Vansittart (died 1770), the Governor of Bengal, Vansittart was born in Bloomsbury, Middlesex, and raised in Bray, Berkshire. Educated at Christ Church, Oxford, he took his degree in 1787, and was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. 
From the early 1770s he was living with his mother at 60 Crooms Hill, Greenwich.

==Political career==
Vansittart began his public career by writing pamphlets in defence of the administration of William Pitt, especially on its financial side, and in May 1796 became Member of Parliament for Hastings, retaining his seat until July 1802, when he was returned for Old Sarum. In February 1801 he was sent on a diplomatic errand to Copenhagen, and shortly after his return was appointed joint Secretary to the Treasury, a position which he retained until the resignation of Henry Addington&#x27;s ministry in April 1804. Owing to the influence of his friend, the Duke of Cumberland, he became Chief Secretary for Ireland under Pitt in January 1805, resigning his office in the following September. With Addington, now Viscount Sidmouth, he joined the government of Charles James Fox and Lord Grenville as Secretary to the Treasury in February 1806, leaving office with Sidmouth just before the fall of the ministry in March 1807.

During these and the next few years Vansittart&#x27;s reputation as a financier was gradually rising. In 1809 he proposed and carried without opposition in the House of Commons thirty-eight resolutions on financial questions, and only his loyalty to Sidmouth prevented him from joining the cabinet of Spencer Perceval as Chancellor of the Exchequer in October 1809. He opposed an early resumption of cash payments in 1811, and became Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Earl of Liverpool succeeded Perceval in May 1812. Having forsaken Old Sarum, he had represented Helston from November 1806 to June 1812; and after being member for East Grinstead for a few weeks, was returned for Harwich in October 1812.

== Chancellor of the Exchequer ==
When Vansittart became Chancellor of the Exchequer the country was burdened with heavy taxation and an enormous debt. Nevertheless, the continuance of the Napoleonic Wars compelled him to increase the customs duties and other taxes, and in 1813 he introduced a complicated scheme for dealing with the sinking fund. In 1816, after the conclusion of peace, a large decrease in taxation was generally desired, and there was an outcry when the Chancellor proposed only to reduce, not to abolish, the property or income tax. The abolition of this tax, however, was carried in parliament, and Vansittart was also obliged to remit the extra tax on malt, meeting a large deficiency principally by borrowing. He devoted considerable attention to effecting real or supposed economies with regard to the national debt. He carried an elaborate scheme for handing over the payment of naval and military pensions to contractors, who would be paid a fixed annual sum for forty-five years; but no one was found willing to undertake this contract, although a modified plan on the same lines was afterwards adopted.

Vansittart became very unpopular in the country, and he resigned his office in December 1822. His system of finance was severely criticised by William Huskisson, Tierney, Brougham, Hume and Ricardo. On his resignation Liverpool offered Vansittart the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Accepting this offer in February 1823, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Bexley, of Bexley in the County of Kent, in March, and granted a pension of £3000 a year. He resigned in January 1828. In the House of Lords, Bexley took very little part in public business, although he introduced the Spitalfields Weavers Bill in 1823, and voted for Catholic Emancipation in 1824.
He took a good deal of interest in the British and Foreign Bible Mission, the Church Missionary Society and kindred bodies, funded Kenyon college and seminary on the US western frontier (the seminary is now named Bexley Hall in his honour) and assisted in founding King&#x27;s College London. 
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1822. He was also one of the vice-presidents of the American Colonization Society, whose aim was to repatriate African freedmen in the United States to the African continent.

==Family==
Lord Bexley married Catherine Isabella (1778–1810), daughter of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, in July 1806. He withdrew from public life in the spring of 1809 to take her on rest cures at Malvern and Torquay. The marriage was childless. He died at Foots Cray, Kent, on 8 February 1851. As he had no issue the title became extinct on his death.

==Legacy==
The Australian explorer Phillip Parker King named one of the bays on the coast of Kimberley in Western Australia &quot;Vansittart Bay&quot; after Lord Bexley.

==Archives==
There are nine volumes of Vansittart&#x27;s papers in the British Library.

<doc id="402312" wikidata="Q1234366" url="?curid=402312" title="Dodge Rampage">
<text>The Dodge Rampage was a subcompact unibody coupe utility based on Chrysler&#x27;s L platform and manufactured and marketed from 1982 to 1984 model years. Plymouth marketed a rebadged variant for model year 1983, as the Scamp.

The Rampage combined the handling and passenger carrying characteristics of a traditional passenger car with the open-bed versatility and load capacity of a small pickup truck, similar to its competitors: the Volkswagen Rabbit Sportruck and Subaru BRAT.

== Description ==
=== Rampage ===
The Rampage borrowed the car&#x27;s unibody construction and front end panels and components from the Dodge Omni 024 (later renamed the Charger), using the suspension from its parent vehicles with coil struts and a linkless sway bar at the front, and leaf springs with shock absorbers unique to the Rampage at the rear.

The Rampage was available with a Chrysler-built and designed 2.2 L carbureted inline-four engine with to depending on the year, a curb weight of around and used a four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic transmission. These arrangements gave the vehicle limited performance.

Performance was improved with the introduction of a five-speed manual transmission in 1983. The truck had a load capacity of , for a true &quot;half ton&quot; rating and about 90% that of the Chevrolet El Camino’s rating of . 

In 1984, the Rampage received a facelifted front fascia shared with the Charger, with quad 165 mm x 100 mm sealed beam headlights opposed to the dual 200 mm x 142 mm sealed beam headlights found on previous models. The grille was also changed, switching from a 6-slot design to a vertically split design. The lower bumper featured revised indicators, a horizontally split lower air intake, and an impact strip that wrapped around the front end.

The Plymouth Scamp was only marketed for 1983. The Rampage lasted three years before being dropped from production after the 1984 model year. There was a &quot;Shelby Rampage&quot; built by Chrysler/Shelby engineers in their free time for Carroll Shelby, but there is no official record of the existence of such a vehicle. However, a special California market &quot;Direct Connection&quot; Rampage was built in 1984 and only sold at certain California-area Dodge dealerships, which featured the front fascia from the Shelby Charger, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a ground effects package.

Only 250 &quot;Direct Connection&quot; Rampages were produced. 
1/3 Black
1/3 Garnet Red
1/3 Santa Fe Blue. 

The Dodge Rampage produced sales of 17,636 in 1982, 8,033 in 1983, and 11,732 in 1984 — and total sales for the Plymouth Scamp were 2,184 base models and 1,380 for the Scamp GT.

==2006 concept==
Dodge resurrected the Rampage name at the 2006 Chicago Auto Show with a front-wheel drive concept pickup. As opposed to the original Rampage, this concept vehicle was as large as the full-size Dodge Ram. It was powered by the 5.7 L Hemi V8 and featured &quot;Stow &#x27;n Go&quot; seating taken from the Chrysler minivans.

<text>Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon, (8 February 17907 February 1866) was a British Whig politician, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1835 to 1839.

==Background==
Spring Rice was born into a notable Anglo-Irish family, which owned large estates in Munster. He was one of the three children of Stephen Edward Rice (died 1831), of Mount Trenchard House, and Catherine Spring, daughter and heiress of Thomas Spring of Ballycrispin and Castlemaine, County Kerry, a descendant of the Suffolk Spring family. He was a great grandson of Sir Stephen Rice (1637–1715), Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and a leading Jacobite, and Sir Maurice FitzGerald, 14th Knight of Kerry. His only married sister, Mary, was the mother of the Catholic converts Aubrey Thomas de Vere, poet, and the Liberal Member of Parliament, Sir Stephen de Vere, 4th Baronet. Spring Rice&#x27;s grandfather, Edward, had converted the family from Roman Catholicism to the Anglican Church of Ireland, to save his estate from passing in gavelkind.

Spring Rice was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but was not called to the Bar. His family was politically well-connected, both in Ireland and Great Britain, and he was encouraged to stand for Parliament by his father-in-law, Lord Limerick.

==Political career==
Spring Rice first stood for election in Limerick City in 1818 but was defeated by the Tory incumbent, John Vereker, by 300 votes. He won the seat in 1820 and entered the House of Commons. He positioned himself as a moderate unionist reformer who opposed the radical nationalist politics of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and became known for his expertise on Irish and economic affairs. In 1824 he led the committee which established the Ordnance Survey in Ireland.

Spring Rice&#x27;s fluent debating style in the Commons brought him to the attention of leading Whigs and he came under the patronage of the Marquess of Lansdowne. As a result, Spring Rice was made Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department under George Canning and Lord Goderich in 1827, with responsibility for Irish affairs. This required Spring Rice to accept deferral of Catholic Emancipation, a policy which he strongly supported. Spring Rice then served as joint Secretary to the Treasury from 1830 to 1834 under Lord Grey. Following the Reform Act 1832, he was elected to represent Cambridge from 1832 to 1839.

In June 1834, Grey appointed Spring Rice Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, with a seat in the cabinet, a post he retained when Lord Melbourne became Prime Minister in July. A strong and vocal unionist throughout his life, Spring Rice led the Parliamentary opposition to Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s 1834 attempt to repeal the Acts of Union 1800.

In a six-hour speech in the House of Commons on 23 April 1834, he suggested that Ireland should be renamed &#x27;West Britain&#x27;. In the Commons, he championed causes such as the worldwide abolition of slavery and the introduction of state-supported education.
The Whig government fell in November 1834, after which Spring Rice attempted to be elected Speaker of the House of Commons in early 1835.

When the Whigs returned to power under Melbourne in April 1835, Spring Rice was made Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Chancellor, Spring Rice had to deal with crop failures, a depression and rebellion in North America, all of which created large deficits and put considerable strain on the government. His Church Rate Bill of 1837 was quickly abandoned and his attempt to revise the charter of the Bank of Ireland ended in humiliation. Spring Rice, unhappy as Chancellor, again tried to be elected as Speaker, but failed. He was a dogmatic figure, described by Lord Melbourne as &quot;too much given to details and possessed of no broad views&quot;.

Upon his departure from office in 1839, Spring Rice had become a scapegoat for the government&#x27;s many problems. That same year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Monteagle of Brandon, in the County of Kerry, a title intended earlier for his ancestor, Sir Stephen Rice. Lord Monteagle of Brandon was also Comptroller General of the Exchequer from 1835 to 1865, despite Lord Howick&#x27;s initial opposition to the maintenance of the office. Monteagle differed from the government regarding the exchequer control over the treasury, and the abolition of the old exchequer was already determined upon when he died.

From 1839, he largely retired from public life, although he occasionally spoke in the House of Lords on matters generally relating to government finance and Ireland. He vehemently opposed Lord John Russell&#x27;s policy regarding the Irish famine, giving a speech in the Lords in which he said the government had &quot;degraded our people, and you, English, now shrink from your responsibilities.&quot;

==Outside Parliament==
In addition to his political career, Spring Rice was a commissioner of the state paper office, a trustee of the National Gallery and a member of the senate of the University of London and of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland. Between 1845 and 1847, he was President of the Royal Statistical Society. In addition, he was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Geological Society. In May 1832 he became a member of James Mill&#x27;s Political Economy Club.

Spring Rice was well regarded in Limerick, where he was seen as a compassionate landlord and a good politician. An advocate of traditional Whiggism, he strongly believed in ensuring society was protected from conflict between the upper and lower classes. Although a pious Anglican, his support for Catholic emancipation won him the favour of many Irishmen, most of whom were Roman Catholic. He led the campaign for better county government in Ireland at a time when many Irish nationalists were indifferent to the cause.

During the Great Famine of the 1840s, Spring Rice responded to the plight of his tenants with benevolence. The ameliorative measures he implemented on his estates almost bankrupted the family and only the dowry from his second marriage saved his financial situation. A monument in honour of him still stands in the People&#x27;s Park in Limerick.

Even so, Spring Rice&#x27;s reputation in Ireland is not entirely favourable. In a book regarding assisted emigration from Ireland (a process in which a landlord paid for their tenants&#x27; passage to the United States or Australia), writer Gerard Moran has suggested that Spring Rice was engaged in the practice. In 1838, he is recorded as having &#x27;helped&#x27; a boat load of his tenants depart for North America, thereby allowing himself the use of their land. However, Spring Rice is also recorded as having been in support of state-assisted emigration across the British Isles, suggesting that Moran&#x27;s interpretation of Spring Rice&#x27;s actions is not fully accurate.

Mount Monteagle in Antarctica and Monteagle County in New South Wales were named in honour of Spring Rice.

Lord Monteagle of Brandon was married twice. He married firstly Lady Theodosia Pery, daughter of Edmund Pery, 1st Earl of Limerick, in 1811. He was just 21 at the time, and this marriage prematurely ended his university career. It produced five sons and three daughters:

*Hon. Theodosia Alicia Ellen Frances Charlotte Spring Rice (died 2 January 1891), married Sir Henry Taylor in 1839.
*Hon. Mary Alicia Pery Spring Rice (died 11 May 1875), served as a Maid of Honour to Queen Victoria between 1837 and 1841. Married James Marshall in 1841.
*Hon. Catherine Anne Lucy Spring Rice (died 23 July 1853), married Henry Marshall in 1837.
*Hon. Stephen Edmund Spring Rice (31 Aug 18149 May 1865), married Ellen Frere in 1839. He was High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1837.
*Hon. Charles William Thomas Spring Rice (10 Jan 181913 July 1870), married Elizabeth Marshall in 1855. He was Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
*Hon. Edmund Henry Francis Louis Spring Rice (31 Mar 182116 January 1887), married Margaret Little in 1870. 
*Hon. Aubrey Richard Spring Rice (15 Aug 182229 November 1897), married Anne John-Mildmay in 1852. 
*Hon. William Cecil Spring Rice (1 Nov 182311 August 1880), died unmarried.

After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1839, Monteagle married secondly Marianne, daughter of the Leeds industrialist John Marshall, in 1841. This union brought much needed money into the family, allowing Spring Rice to maintain his Mount Trenchard estate in Ireland and a London house. Upon Lord Monteagle of Brandon&#x27;s death in February 1866, aged 75, he was succeeded in the barony by his grandson Thomas Spring Rice, the son of his eldest son Hon. Stephen Edmund Spring Rice. Lord Monteagle of Brandon&#x27;s great-granddaughter was the Irish nationalist, Mary Spring Rice. His second son, Hon. Charles William Thomas Rice, was the father of the diplomat Sir Cecil Spring Rice, British Ambassador to the United States from 1912 to 1918.

<doc id="402320" wikidata="Q5230970" url="?curid=402320" title="David B. Frohnmayer">
<text>David B. &quot;Dave&quot; Frohnmayer (July 9, 1940 – March 10, 2015) was an American attorney, politician, and academic administrator from Oregon. He was the 15th president of the University of Oregon, serving from 1994 to 2009. His tenure as president was the second-longest after John Wesley Johnson. He was the first native Oregonian to run the University of Oregon. Frohnmayer previously served as Oregon Attorney General from 1981 to 1991, and subsequently served as dean at the University of Oregon School of Law before serving as president of the university. He served in an &quot;of counsel&quot; attorney role with the Oregon law firm, Harrang Long Gary Rudnick P.C.

== Early life and education ==
David Braden Frohnmayer was born in Medford, Oregon. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard University in 1962. He attended Wadham College, Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, and received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1967.

== Political career ==
Frohnmayer, a Republican, served three terms in the Oregon House of Representatives from 1975 to 1981, representing southern Eugene.

=== Oregon Attorney General ===

Frohnmayer was elected as Oregon Attorney General in November 1980, defeating Democrat Harl H. Haas, Jr., and was sworn into office on January 5, 1981. He was re-elected in 1984, when he defeated former State Sen. Vernon Cook (D), and 1988, when he was nominated by both the Democratic and Republican parties, and defeated Fred Oerther, the Libertarian nominee. Frohnmayer served as Attorney General until his resignation on December 31, 1991, when he became Dean of the University of Oregon School of Law. As Attorney General, one of his most notable cases involved leading the prosecution of members of the Rajneesh movement (followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.)

==== Supreme Court Litigation ====
Frohnmayer prevailed in six out of the seven cases that he took to the United States Supreme Court: &quot;Oregon v. Kennedy&quot; (1982), &quot;Oregon v. Bradshaw&quot; (1983), &quot;Oregon v. Elstad&quot; (1985), &quot;Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe&quot; (1985), &quot;Whitley v. Albers&quot; (1986), and &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; (1990). His one unsuccessful Supreme Court case was &quot;Tower v. Glover&quot; (1984).

=== 1990 gubernatorial election ===
Frohnmayer was the Republican nominee for Governor of Oregon in 1990. Popular Democratic incumbent–and former UC Berkeley School of Law classmate–Neil Goldschmidt withdrew after Frohnmayer&#x27;s campaign manager, Donna Zajonc, said &quot;...you&#x27;ve got to believe that the best family will win&quot; at a news conference, which was then reported by Jeff Mapes in &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. Zajonc&#x27;s statement was interpreted at the time as a threat to use Goldschmidt&#x27;s collapsing marriage as a political issue. Goldschmidt quickly withdrew from the race, an event that was considered one of the &quot;great mysteries in Oregon politics&quot; until 2004, when Goldschmidt admitted to having a sexual relationship with a minor in the 1970s. Frohnmayer subsequently lost the election to Barbara Roberts, the Democrat who was nominated after Goldschmidt&#x27;s withdrawal, in a three-way race that included independent, Oregon Citizens Alliance-backed candidate Al Mobley.

== Academic career ==
Frohnmayer taught law at the University of Oregon from 1971 to 1981, before he became state attorney general, and returned to the university as law school dean on January 1, 1992. He was appointed president of the university in 1994. Frohnmayer announced his retirement as president on April 29, 2008, and was succeeded on July 31, 2009, by Richard Lariviere. Frohnmayer&#x27;s tenure was widely acclaimed; &quot;The Register-Guard&quot;&#x27;s editorial &quot;Retiring from the University he Remade&quot; opined that &quot;Dave Frohnmayer has steered the University of Oregon through grim and changing times and he&#x27;s leaving a different and stronger institution.&quot; &quot;The Oregonian&quot; called Frohnmayer&#x27;s presidency &quot;one of the most remarkable higher education performances in Oregon history.&quot;

During his tenure as president, he established an enduring relationship between the university and Phil Knight and Nike, which has continued to provide significant financial support to the university&#x27;s athletic program. In April 2000, students protesting labor conditions at Nike blocked Frohnmayer from leaving his office, until they were arrested. Later in April, the University joined the Workers Rights Consortium. In response, Knight retracted a $30 million donation. After Frohnmayer withdrew the university from the consortium in February 2001, Knight restored his donation.

== Personal life ==
Frohnmayer met Lynn Johnson, a native of Grants Pass, Oregon, and returned Peace Corps volunteer, while working in Washington, D.C., as executive assistant to Robert Finch, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Nixon administration. They were set up by both sets of their parents, who were friends in Southern Oregon. After marrying, they returned to Oregon where they raised their five children—Kirsten, Mark, Katie, Jonathan, and Amy—in Eugene.

In 1983, during Frohnmayer&#x27;s first term as Oregon&#x27;s Attorney General, daughters Kirsten and Katie were diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, a rare and life-threatening recessive genetic illness. Their third daughter Amy, born in 1987, also inherited the disease. Lynn and Dave together founded the FA Family Support Group in 1985 to help share disease and treatment information with other families afflicted by the illness and in 1989 established the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund to fund research that would lead to a cure. All three Frohnmayer daughters died of complications related to Fanconi anemia: Katie in 1991 at age 12, Kirsten in 1997 at age 24, and Amy Elizabeth Winn in 2016 at age 29.

Frohnmayer was also a founding Director of the National Marrow Donor Program and served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Frohnmayer&#x27;s upbringing was heavily influenced by his father Otto&#x27;s dedication to the law and public service and his mother MarAbel&#x27;s love of music. His elder sister, Mira, had a distinguished career as a vocalist and music professor. His brother, John, served as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts under the administration of President George H. W. Bush and briefly challenged incumbent senator Gordon Smith in the 2008 election as an independent. His late brother, Philip, who resided in New Orleans, Louisiana, was professor of music at Loyola University. In 2005, the University of Oregon&#x27;s MarAbel B. Frohnmayer Music Building was named in honor of his mother.

===Death===
On March 10, 2015, Frohnmayer died of prostate cancer, aged 74. &quot;I am heartbroken at the loss of my wonderful and brilliant friend Dave Frohnmayer,&quot; Gov. Kate Brown said in a statement. &quot;His deep love of Oregon is reflected in a lifetime of leadership and public service. My thoughts and prayers go out to Lynn and the Frohnmayer family at this difficult time.&quot;

<text>Gustavo Adolfo Madero González (16 January 187518 February 1913), born in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila, Mexico, was a participant in the Mexican Revolution against Porfirio Díaz along with other members of his wealthy family. He was also known as &quot;Ojo Parado&quot; (&quot;staring eye&quot;) since he had one glass eye.

Madero&#x27;s brother, Francisco I. Madero, was president of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. During the coup d&#x27;état in Mexico City known as Ten Tragic Days, Gustavo Madero was arrested, released to followers of conspirator Félix Díaz. A mob tortured him, pulling out his &quot;good&quot; eye, and then eventually killing him.

The Gustavo A. Madero, D.F. borough in Mexico City is named after him.

==Early life==
Born as one of fifteen children on January 16, 1875, in Parras de la Fuente, located between Torreón and Saltillo in the state of Coahuila, Gustavo Madero grew up in one of the richest families of Mexico. The Madero family had settled in Northern Mexico in the early nineteenth century. Grandfather Evaristo had founded the Compañía Industrial de Parras. In the latter part of the nineteenth century the Madero family business extended from vineyards, cotton, and textiles, to mining, milling, smelting, ranching, and banking. Gustavo went to high school at the Colegio San Juan, a Jesuit school in Saltillo. For further high school studies and to learn English, the two oldest Madero brothers, Gustavo and Francisco attended Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College in Emmitsburg, Maryland but stayed only for a year. In 1887, made possible with the financial support of his father, Gustavo and his older brother Francisco moved to France where they attended the Lycee of Versailles and finally received a baccalaureate. Gustavo went on to study business management at Hautes Études Commerciales in Jouy-en-Josas, near Paris. After the two brothers settled back in Mexico, Gustavo joined Francisco as confidante and chief of staff for a run at the presidency of Mexico.

==Mexican Revolution==
There were many divisions within the Madero family; some of its members wished for a peace agreement, hoping to avoid the problems that the civil war would bring to their businesses and investments. Talks were arranged in New York with José Yves Limantour, the finance minister of the Díaz government, but these failed as the revolution continued and peace negotiations broke down.

Financing his brother&#x27;s revolution required serious funding. Gustavo through family contacts went to New York in 1910. His main contact was the Washington lawyer and lobbyist Sherburne Hopkins. For a fee of $50,000 Gustavo signed him on to represent and promote the revolutionary movement his brother Francisco led against the Dictator Porfirio Diaz. Hopkins brought the New York financiers Henry Clay Pierce and Charles Ranlett Flint on board. Both had financial interest in the Mexican railroads and oil. Their main competitors, John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil and Viscount Cowdray of the El Aguila Oil Company supported the Diaz regime. Thus, in the spring of 1911, the rivalry between international oil barons and the help of Sherburne Hopkins allowed Gustavo to raise the funds needed to depose the aging dictator of Mexico.

After the success of the revolution, Gustavo remained his brother&#x27;s closest confidante, although he did not hold public office. One of the most important tools of Gustavo&#x27;s power between May 1911 and February 1913 was the Mexican Secret Service which he headed. Originally established and financed by Sherburne Hopkins, Gustavo through his lieutenant Felix A. Sommerfeld put down the most serious challenges to Francisco Madero&#x27;s government. In the fall of 1911, Bernardo Reyes, an exiled general and competitor for the presidency in 1910, rose in revolt from San Antonio, Texas. The uprising fizzled by Christmas and Reyes was arrested. A few months later, another disgruntled revolutionary, Pascual Orozco who had fought alongside Madero to defeat Diaz, challenged the government in a massive uprising that covered much of northern Mexico. Again, Gustavo sent Sommerfeld to the border. The Mexican secret service cooperated closely with agents of the American Bureau of Investigations, customs and military officials to put down the uprising. Another uprising in Veracruz in the fall of 1912, this time headed by Felix Diaz, a relative of the deposed dictator, also fell victim to the efficient secret service under Gustavo&#x27;s control. In the process, however, Gustavo made many serious enemies. Felix Diaz and Bernardo Reyes plotted their next moves from their jail cells. Victoriano Huerta, the army chief who the Mexican president fired for disloyalty on Gustavo&#x27;s advice, seethed with resentment.

==The Ten Tragic Days==

In February 1913, the final push of the reactionary forces to oust the democratically elected Mexican government took shape. Felix Diaz, Bernardo Reyes and a host of members of the old regime plotted to take control of Mexico City first and then the entire country. As the assault started on February 9, Reyes and Diaz marched on the presidential palace. In a shootout with troops Gustavo had frantically assembled in the early morning hours, Reyes was killed. Madero&#x27;s secretary of war Lauro Villar Ochoa was seriously injured. The president appointed Victoriano Huerta, who professed undivided loyalty to Madero to replace him. However, Gustavo quickly uncovered the participation of Huerta in the conspiracy. On February 17, he arrested Huerta and brought him before the president. Against Gustavo&#x27;s advice, Huerta remained in charge of the military. The Madero government collapsed the next day. On February 18 the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, Victoriano Huerta and Félix Díaz signed an agreement cementing the coup d&#x27;état, titled the Pact of the Embassy. Gustavo was ambushed and arrested inside the Gambrinus restaurant just before lunch. Two hours later, President Francisco Madero became a prisoner of the putschists.

Followers of Díaz sought to have Francisco and Gustavo Madero turned over to them. The President was kept by Huerta, since his resignation from the presidency was needed to give a veneer of legality to the coup d&#x27;etat. Gustavo Madero was turned over and taken to the arsenal of the Ciudadela. That night Gustavo was set upon and brutally murdered by a mob of over a hundred federal soldiers on the orders Manuel Mondragón, the new government&#x27;s secretary of war. The mob desecrated Madero&#x27;s body, extracting his glass eye and passing it around. News of Gustavo&#x27;s death was kept from the President, as the usurpers pressured him to resign.

Gustavo had been Francisco Madero&#x27;s closest advisor. &quot;As the go-to person [for the president] he endured endless accusations of influence peddling and bribery... Besides the alleged corruptibility of Gustavo, the complaint alluded to the power of the President&#x27;s brother.&quot;

<text>Iztacalco () is a borough (&quot;demarcación territorial&quot;) in Mexico City. It is located in the central-eastern area and it is the smallest of the city&#x27;s boroughs. The area&#x27;s history began in 1309 when the island of Iztacalco, in what was Lake Texcoco, was settled in 1309 by the Mexica who would later found Tenochtitlan, according to the Codex Xolotl. The island community would remain small and isolated through the colonial period, but drainage projects in the Valley of Mexico dried up the lake around it. The area was transformed into a maze of small communities, artificial islands called chinampas and solid farmland divided by canals up until the first half of the 20th century. Politically, the area has been reorganized several times, being first incorporated in 1862 and the modern borough coming into existence in 1929. Today, all of the canals and farmland are dried out and urbanized as the most densely populated borough and the second most industrialized.

==The borough==

The borough of Iztacalco is located in the east-center of Mexico City bordering Venustiano Carranza, Iztapalapa and Benito Juárez boroughs, as well as the Mexico State municipality of Nezahualcoyotl . It is the smallest of the city&#x27;s boroughs. The territory is divided into thirty eight neighborhoods called “colonias” or “barrios” along with 220 major apartment complexes. The borough hall is located on Avenida Rio Churubusco in the Ramos Millán neighborhood.

Seventy-one percent of the borough is occupied by residences, commerce, and service establishments. Fifty-four percent of the territory is purely residential, down from 61% in 1980.%. There are 99,577 housing units, almost all of which are constructed of cinderblock and concrete. The average housing unit has 4.1 occupants. Many of these constructions are in some state of deterioration, which includes sixty percent of major housing complexes, as well as sixty percent of a type of housing situation, called a “vecindad.” Mixed-use zones, with residences, offices, services, and certain industries, have increased from 8.6% to 17%. Eleven percent is dedicated to manufacturing. Ninety percent of the land is paved over with only about two percent considered to be green space. Over 97% have basic services such as gas, electricity, garbage, and drainage.

The Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City is located on Avenida Río Piedad in Colonia Magdalena Mixhuca. It contains boasts professional-level playing fields, swimming pools, running tracks and gyms.
The Palacio de los Deportes, also called the Domo de Cobre (“the Copper Dome”) is located on Avenida Río Churubusco and Viaducto Miguel Alemán in Colonia Granjas México. Connected to the complex is the Escuela Nacional de Entrenadores Deportivos and the Escuela Superior de Educación Física. As a private concert venue, it has hosted such acts as Aerosmith, Robbie Williams, The Cure and Shakira.

The Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez, with adjoining Foro Sol is located on Avenida Viaducto Piedad in Colonia Magdalena Mixhuca. The Foro Sol has also hosted major concerts.

The La Viga Lienzo Charro (rodeo ring) is located on Guadalupe Street in Colonia Pantitlán.

The main annual festival in the borough is the anniversary of the parish of San Matias in August, celebrating its establishment as the Franciscan monastery. It features the “charros of Iztacalco” who are based at the Lienzo Charro de la Viga, a tradition from the 19th century. Other important days include the festival dedicated to Saint Sebastian in January in the Barrio de Zapotla, Carnival in some neighborhoods, the Procession of the Holy Burial on Good Friday and a pre-Hispanic festival called Ue-izkal-ilhuitl, or the spring equinox . The borough also hosts an annual youth event called the Festival Juventud. In 2011, this event included two days of rock and ska music at the Faro Iztacalco. It included bands such as Skandalo, Maskatesta and Los Korukos .

===Historic center===
Although the borough is completely urbanized, there are still traces of the area&#x27;s rural past, especially in the historic center, which corresponds to the original island in the former Lake Texcoco. This zone is still divided into six neighborhoods called barrios: Santa Cruz, La Asunción, San Miguel, Los Reyes, Zapotla, San Francisco Xicaltongo y Santiago, along with an area called Santa Anita Zacatlalmanco Huéhuetl. Most of these lie along the Calzada de la Viga. This area was designated as a &quot;Barrio Mágico&quot; by the city in 2011.

The Barrio de Santa Cruz contains some of the oldest structures of the entire borough. One of these is the Capilla de Santa Cruz, located on a small street called Amador Aztlán. It has a Salomonic main portal with vegetative designs. It is only one level topped with a vaulted niche. Inside, there is a silver leaf main altar with a notable wood cross covered in silver and decorated with the image of the Passion of Christ and the date of 1748. The chapel was declared a historic monument in 1972. The Ermita de la Cruz is on Calle Agricultures. It was constructed by the Franciscans in the early 16th century and listed as a historic monument in 1955. The interior contains a crucified Christ done in pea cane paste. It also has an oil painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This barrio also contains a number of houses and other structures from the 18th and 19th centuries.
However, the Barrio de la Asunción next door is home to the most important plaza and the church of the borough. The plaza is called either Plaza Miguel Hidalgo or Plaza San Matias, located between the parish of San Matías and Calzada de la Viga. It is of two levels with a number of trees and has a traditional kiosk in the center. It also has two important monuments, one of the Aztec glyph still used to designate the area and one of a bust of Miguel Hidalgo from 1870. The parish and former monastery of San Matías were begun in the 16th century. The main portal contains the main entrance, which consists of a richly decorated arch and two columns. Above it is an eight-sided choir window, and above that is a pediment in the form of a truncated triangle. Above this is a crest. There is one bell tower is Baroque. To the left of the facade, there is a dome over a chapel area, which is decorated with human figures and other elements. The interior contains chandeliers, arches and the main altar that features a marine shell. Saint Matthew continues to be the patron saint of the Iztacalco.

The Barrio de Santiago is marked by the Santiago Apóstol Church from the 18th century. It has a façade nearly without curves and almost square, covered in tezontle stone. On each side of the facade, there is a slim bell tower. The main entrance is marked by a simple arch of sandstone which contains a seashell and supported by two pilasters. Above this entrance, there is a clock. The interior is bright due to the many stained glass windows.

==Geography==

The borough extends over 23.1 km2 or 2,317.4 hectares, all of which is urbanized. It accounts for 1.75% of the total territory of Mexico City, and it is the smallest of the 16 boroughs.
The land is flat and located on the lakebed of Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico at an altitude of 2,235 meters above sea level. Today, however, the lake in this area has dried completely and the canals, wetlands and lake of the territory have completely disappeared. The climate is considered to be semi-arid and temperate, with only the area bordering Benito Juárez and Iztapalapa considered to be semi-moist with rains in the summer. Overall, the borough is the driest in Mexico City, with an annual rainfall of not over 600 to 700mm per year. With over 90% paved over, there are no wild habitats left in the borough. Of the 2.34% dedicated to green space, most of these are traffic islands on major thoroughfares.

There are only two parks in the borough. The Urbano-Ecológico School-Park is located on Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza in Colonia Agrícola Oriental, near the border of Iztapalapa. This park has less than one hectare. The other large green space is the parkland around the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports Center, which has been reforested with eucalyptus trees.

==Demographics==
Iztacalco is the most densely populated borough in Mexico City and the most dense subdivision in the country. As of 2020, the population was 404,695, with most being from the lower middle to lower classes. There are small communities of middle-class families in Reforma Iztaccihuatl, Militar Marte and Viaducto Piedad. Despite its density, the overall population of the borough has been dropping between one and two percent since 1990, but still about twenty percent of the current population moved into here from elsewhere in Mexico. The population is expected to continue decreasing.

About 5,400 people who speak an indigenous language, with thirty eight different indigenous ethnicities present. About 1,100 of these speak some form of Nahuatl, followed by Zapotec, Mixtec, Otomi, Mazateca, Mazahua and Totonaca. About 91% of the population is Catholic, with about seven percent belonging to Protestant or Evangelical churches.

==History==
While the most accepted interpretation of Iztacalco (from Nahuatl) is “house of salt,” others have been proposed such as “place of white houses.” Originally, the name was written “Ixtacalco” but its current spelling was adopted in the second half of the 20th century. The crest or seal of the borough is the Aztec glyph which has been used to designate the place since at least the time of the Mendocino Codex, which depicts the “house” and “salt” interpretations of the name. It contains a sun shining over a house. Inside the house, there is a grain of salt and two markings that represent raindrops’ tracks.

Because it was originally an island well within Lake Texcoco, Iztacalco was settled by humans later than the rest of the Valley of Mexico . The history of Iztacalco begins in 1309. The Xolotl Codex states that Iztacalco was one of the people&#x27;s last stops before they finally settled Tenochtitlan. The island was conquered and subject to the dominion of Texcoco as part of the territory of the Triple Alliance. From the beginning, inhabitants made a living by extracting salt from the brackish waters of the surrounding lake. This salt was consumed until the very early 20th century.

Just after the Conquest, the area belonged to a territory called San Juan de Dios ruled directly from Mexico City. A small monastery dedicated to Saint Matthew was constructed in which lived no more than two monks, with no more than 300 indigenous. As the area was very sparsely populated, these monks did not establish satellite parishes, except for the San Antonio hermitage, built for the feast day of this saint. In the middle of the 17th century, baptisms began to be recorded in the area, which then consisted of the main community and eight surrounding neighborhoods called barrios. Through the colonial period, Iztacalco was on an island, which impeded its growth. It had only 296 residents in its barrios of Asunción, Santa Cruz, Santiago, San Miguel and Los Reyes.

From the colonial period to the 19th century, various drainage projects in the Valley of Mexico eventually dried Lake Texcoco, creating firm land that would connect the former island of Iztacalco to the rest of the area. The dry land from the lake was formed mostly through the creation of chinampas on which were grown flowers and vegetables. However, from the 19th century to the first decades of the 20th, Iztacalco had a number of canals crisscrossing it, the main one being Canal de la Viga, earlier known as the Acequia Real. The canal extended for 1,560 meters and was thirty meters wide. This made Iztacalco an important strategic transit point between what is now the historic center of Mexico City and the agricultural areas to the south and east such as Chalco and Xochimilco . One of the main docks here was at Zacatlalmanco, which had an important market attached to it. The first steamship passed by here in 1850, connecting Mexico City and Chalco. The canal had a number of pedestrian bridges over it, such as the La Garita. These bridges also doubled as regulators for the canal&#x27;s waters due to the floodgates on their supporting arches. The canal also functioned as a rural getaway for Mexico City dwellers, especially on Sundays. Until mid-century, the borough area remained rural with small houses of adobe and/or reeds/small branches. Small canoes called &quot;trajineras&quot; carried cargo and passengers among the various docks on this canal. The canals were filled with aquatic birds such as herons and a local species called &quot;chichicuilotes&quot;. It was also the scene of one of the most popular festivals of the 19th century, the Viernes de Dolores (Friday of the Virgin of Sorrows), also known as the Fiesta de las Flores (Festival of the Flowers). Starting in 1915, due to health concerns, the canal was closed to traffic and filled into become current major road, with the process completed in the 1930s. 

Through the 19th century, the community of Iztacalco and Mexico City would remain entities mostly separated by farmland and chinampas. This was also true of a number of communities that are now part of the borough such as Mixiuhca, Zacatlalmanco, La Magdalena, Santa Ana, and San Matias. Up until the 20th century, the territory remained a maze of chinampas divided by canals large and small with carp and even snakes.

In 1855, the districts and municipalities of the Federal District were reorganized, with the municipality of Iztacalco consisting of the communities of San Matías, San Juanico, Santa Anita, Magdalena Atlacolpa, Asunción Aculco, Santa Cruz, Santiago, San Miguel, La Asunción, San Sebastián Zapotla, Los Reyes, San Francisco, San Antonio Zacahuisco as well as two ranches called Cedillo and De la Viga or De la Cruz Metlapalco. In the mid 19th century, the area&#x27;s population was dominated by indigenous peoples. In 1892, there was land redistribution among the families of the area, consisting of 255 hectares what belonged to three ranches.

Iztacalco was first incorporated as a municipality on March 5, 1862, as part of the Tlalpan prefecture, with a population of about 2,800. In 1903, the municipality disappeared and merged with the prefecture of Guadalupe Hidalgo, one of the six divisions of the Federal District at the time. On December 31, 1928, the current borough was formed.

The urban sprawl of Mexico City began to reach the borough in the first decades of the 20th century. As the canals were filled in, they were converted into the primary roadways which still remain today. Canal de la Viga is now Calzada de la Viga. The first industries in the area were established in the middle of the 20th century as the area was at the city&#x27;s periphery, but its proximity to the historic center made its urbanization quick. The first industries in the areas were those making cardboard boxes, cushions, furniture, chemicals, and food processing. The installation of factories and housing developments changed Iztacalco from rural to completely urban in less than four decades. Since the 1930s and especially since the 1950s, land became divided into housing lots as the canals and swamps were drained into dry land. Most of this housing was for the working classes. These include neighborhoods such as La Cruz, Pantitlán and Granjas México to house workers for factories built in the same areas. Some of the most dangerous neighborhoods of the city are located in this borough.

Citizens of the borough began directly electing local officials in 2000, like the borough president and two representatives to Mexico City&#x27;s government. The old &quot;delegación&quot; became an &quot;alcaldía&quot; headed by a mayor after the political reforms enacted in 2016.

==Economy==
Iztacalco is ranked ninth in economic marginalization in Mexico City with over 32% considered to be living in poverty. Over 85% are considered to be at least moderately economically marginalized, the highest in the city. As of 2007, about 55% of the population over the age of twelve is employed either in the formal or informal economy, with most of these between the ages of 35 and 39. About 48% of those in the total workforce do not have work in the formal economy. Well over half the workforce is male but the percentage of women has been rising since 1990. 0.1% work in agriculture, 20.9% work in mining, construction, and manufacturing, and 75.7% work in commerce and services.

Eleven percent of the borough and 11.7% of establishments are dedicated to industry and manufacturing, the second highest percentage in the city. The Ciudad Deportiva de la Magdalena Mixihuca is the second largest industrial zone in Mexico City. Just under 50% of establishments are in commerce and just over 37% are in services, but there are no major office buildings. The borough has eleven hotels, one five-star, two four-star and four three-star.

==Transportation==
The borough has 53.8 km of primary roadway, 5.7% of Mexico City&#x27;s total, with 6,082,261m2 of paved surface. Major thoroughfares include the Viaducto Río de la Piedad which borders the borough on the north going east-west and connecting to the Mexico City-Puebla highway. It is bordered on the east by the Anillo Periférico, with the Circuito Interior passing through the center. Near the old village of Iztacalco is Eje 3 Oriente and Calzada de la Viga. Other important roads include Eje 2, Eje 6 Sur, Eje 1 Oriente and Eje 5 Oriente. Four lines of the Metro pass through the borough: Line 9, Line 1, Line 4 and Line 8. Three of these lines meet at Metro Pantitlán, a major hub of the transport system and a major connecting point for busses heading east into the State of Mexico. There are four lines of the trolleybus and Metrobús Line 2 passes through as well.

High schools include &quot;Plantel 2&quot; de la Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (UNAM), la Preparatoria Iztacalco, dependiente del Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal (IEMS-DF) and Plantel 3 del Colegio de Bachilleres Metropolitano.

There are five centers dedicated to special education and nine centers that work with special needs children in the regular school system. There are fourteen vocational schools above the middle school level. It has eleven public libraries, mostly serving elementary school-aged children. It has ten &quot;casas de cultura&quot; which mostly serve only the neighborhoods in which they are found.
3.1% of the population is illiterate. To combat high dropout rates, the government of Mexico City offers stipends to families of school-aged children as long as the children remain enrolled in public schools.

The Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria en Ingeniería y Ciencias Sociales y Administrativas (UPIICSA) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional is located in the borough, which offers majors in engineering, computer science and administration. The Escuela Normal de Educación Física trains physical education teachers.

<text>Omega is a video game developed and published by Origin Systems in 1989. It was directed by Stuart B. Marks.

The player assumes the role of a cyber-tank designer and programmer, with the objective of creating tanks to defeat increasingly difficult opponents. The game emphasizes programming the tank, using a built-in text editor with artificial intelligence script commands similar to BASIC. Tanks can communicate and coordinate actions, and successful designs tend to be automated. Code is cross-platform, allowing Apple II, Commodore 64, and IBM PC users to compete against each other.

The game received positive reviews, with Compute! praising its ease of use for newcomers to programming. Computer Gaming World acknowledged its similarities to RobotWar, while noting its improvements. Games International magazine awarded it 4 stars out of 5, highlighting its unique gameplay and requirement for strategic thinking.

==Gameplay==
The game puts the player in the role of a cyber-tank designer and programmer. Given a limited budget, the player must design a tank that can defeat a series of ever more challenging opponent tanks. Each successful design yields a higher security clearance and a larger budget, ultimately resulting in an OMEGA clearance and an unlimited budget. The focus of the game is not on the combat but on game programming the tank itself.

Tanks are programmed using a built-in text editor that allows the player to use various artificial intelligence script commands, similar in structure to BASIC. These commands permit control of various aspects of the tank, and also allows teams of tanks to communicate and coordinate actions. While commands exist that enable a range of control over the tank, successful designs tend to be automated. Decision making is an important part of the design process, as the programming must reflect the equipment placed on the tank.

Code was cross-platform, so Apple, Commodore, and IBM users could compete against each other. Origin operated a bulletin board system for &quot;Omega&quot; owners.

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&quot; praised &quot;Omega&quot;, stating that it made writing code for tanks easy and fun for those new to programming.
Russell Sipe of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1989 gave the game a positive review, noting its similarities and improvements over &quot;RobotWar&quot;. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two of five stars, stating that &quot;Programmers loved this &#x27;simulation&#x27; [but] it&#x27;s all Geek to me&quot;.

John Inglis reviewed &quot;Omega&quot; for &quot;Games International&quot; magazine, and gave it 4 stars out of 5, and stated that &quot;In summary I would say that &quot;Omega&quot; is a unique game that has had a considerable amount of thought lavished on it. It is not a game for the shoot-em-up enthusiast, as you must put considerable thought in before you get anywhere.&quot;

<doc id="402333" wikidata="Q1832732" url="?curid=402333" title="Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico City">
<text>Miguel Hidalgo is a borough (&quot;alcaldía&quot;) in western Mexico City, it encompasses the historic areas of Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya along with a number of notable neighborhoods such as Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec. With landmarks such as Chapultepec Park and the Museo Nacional de Antropología, it is the second most visited borough in Mexico City after Cuauhtémoc where the historic center of Mexico City is located. Tacubaya and Tacuba both have long histories as independent settlements and were designated as “Barrios Mágicos” by the city for tourism purposes.

==Geography==
The borough is located in the northwest of the Mexico City, just west of the historic center. The borough is divided into eighty one neighborhoods called colonias. The largest of these is Bosques de las Lomas at 3.2km2, and the smallest is Popo Ampliación with only .33km2. It is bordered by the boroughs of Azcapotzalco, Cuauhtémoc, Benito Juárez, Álvaro Obregón and Cuajimalpa, and the State of Mexico to the west. It has a territory of 47.68km2 which is 3.17 percent of the total Mexico City.

The borough consists of an area which used to the west bank of Lake Texcoco, with three major zones, Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya. The geography of the borough includes canyons, hills and mesas associated with the Sierra de las Cruces, most present in the southwest bordering Cuajimalpa. In the northeast, mostly defined by the Interior Circuit ringway. The most important elevation is the Cerro de Chapultepec at 2,260masl. The area today is almost completely developed with green spaces mostly limited to parks. The largest green space is Chapultepec Park at 2.2 km2. Parque Lineal was the former rail line of the Ferrocarril de Cuernavaca. The strip was converted into a park in 2011. Where the park crosses Lago Constanza Street in Colonia Anáhuac, there are often cultural events held. One of the newest parks in the borough is located on Lago Caneguin in Colonia Argentina, created over a former roadway called Ruta 100. The unnamed park has 10,000 meters of surface area, kiosk, gymnasium, bicycle path, multipurpose room, parking, rain water containment system and child care center. It serves about 40,000 area residents. In 2008, reforestation efforts were undertaken, beginning at the Cañitas Park. While there were important rivers here such as Remedios, today there are no longer any free flowing currents of water. The climate is semi moist and temperate with annual rainfall varying between 700 and 800mm. The average annual temperature is 15C with lows in the winter about 8C and highs around 19C.

Certain areas of the borough have problems with the stability of the ground due to old abandoned underground mines. These areas include the América, Daniel Garza, 16 de Septiembre, Daniel Garza Apliación and Observatorio neighborhoods, which are particularly affected, but the problem also is found in El Capulín, Monte Sol and Ex Hacienda de Pedregal. The number of people living in these areas is estimated at over 25,000, and about 500 families living in very high risk areas. Abandoned mines have also been detected in Tacubaya, Lomas Altas, Bosque de las Lomas and even under Chapultepec Park.

==Demographics and socioeconomics==

As of 2005, the borough had 106,005 residences of which 25,308 were freestanding houses, 54,079 were apartments and the rests of other types. This total number grew to a total of 123,910. About eighty percent of homes are owned by their residents and not rented. Around 95% have basic services such as electricity and running water. While the borough contains mostly working class areas in and around Tacuba and Tacubaya, the southwest contains some of the most exclusive colonias of the borough.
While most of the borough is residential, the population of the borough has dropped from 650,497 in 1960 to 372,889 in 2010. It is now the twelfth most densely occupied borough of sixteen. Just over eighty eight percent identify themselves as Catholic.

The borough has 112 preschools, 160 primary schools, 79 middle schools, seven vocational/technical high schools and 49 high schools. The borough has an educational program called “Faros del Saber” (Lighthouses of Knowledge), which began in 2001. There are nine installations related to the program: each dedicated to a different field, such as ecology and science and technology, and each designed to promote these fields to the youth of the borough through workshops and various events. The main library of the program is part of CONACULTA and is designed to promote reading. The borough also offers classes to youth and adults in basic computer technology.

Main thoroughfares include Paseo de la Reforma, Calzada México Tacuba, the Anillo Periférico, Avenida V Palmas and Avenida Constituyentes. Numerous bus and Metro lines pass through here, with the major transportation hub centered in Metro Tacubaya, where Lines 1, 7 and 9 converge. The borough is also home to the Observatorio bus station, which mostly serves buses heading west to Toluca and other destinations.

The working population is 45.4% of the total. Overall socioeconomic marginalization of the borough is ranked very low. The borough is the second most visited by tourists in Mexico City according to the Secretary of Tourism of the Federal District, receiving just under 13% of total visitors in 2006. The borough has nineteen major hotels, and five of the six best hotels in the city. Its major, upscale restaurants and entertainment centers are located in Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec. Five star hotels include the Presidente Intercontinental, the Marriott and Niko, all located on Paseo de la Reforma next to Chapultepec Park. Commercial centers include eighteen traditional markets, the upscale shopping corridor along Avenida Presidente Masarik in Polanco and various malls.

Bases for unlicensed taxis and areas crowded with unregulated street vendors is a major problem, especially around Christmas time. Most street-vending occurs in the Tacuba, Tacubaya, Chapultepec, Argentinas, Lomas and Polanco neighborhoods. A number of stationary public markets have problems with abandoned stalls. This is occurs in the Tacuba, Anáhuac Anexo, Anáhuac Zone and El Chorrito markets. The main reason that these markets struggle is competition from supermarkets, but the deterioration of the buildings is another factor.

==History==

The borough is named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who began the Mexican War of Independence . The borough was created by fusing various former municipalities such as Tacuba, Tacubaya and the Chapultepec Park area along with the neighborhoods such as Polanco, Lomas de Chapultepec, Bosques de las Lomas, Popotla, Las Pensil, La Argentina, America, Santa Julia and Observatorio. The center of the borough is considered to be Chapultepec Park.

Until the 20th century, Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya had separate histories, all part of the Federal District of Mexico City during most of this entity&#x27;s existence under various arrangements. In 1899, the Federal District was divided into the municipality of Mexico and six prefectures, one of which was Tacubaya. This arrangement was reconfirmed in 1917. In 1928, the Federal District was reorganized as a department under the direct control of the federal government. The territory was reorganized into Mexico City proper and thirteen boroughs: Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Azcapotzalco, Iztacalco, General Anaya, Coyoacán, San Ángel, La Magdalena Contreras, Cuajimalpa, Tlalpan, Iztapalapa, Xochimilco, Milpa Alta and Tláhuac. The city proper was divided into twelve districts. What is now Miguel Hidalgo, was part of Mexico City proper. In 1970, the city area was subdivided into four parts, Cuauhtémoc, Venustiano Carranza, Benito Juárez and Miguel Hidalgo.

The various political arrangements to the present day have been a result of the growth of Mexico City proper. Tacuba, Chapultepec and Tacubaya in the pre Hispanic period were located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, just west of the island where the Aztecs established Tenochtitlan. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish established their capital in Tenochtitlan, renaming it Mexico City. Constant flooding problems, almost forced the Spanish to move the capital to Tacubaya in the early 17th century; however, it was decided to drain and fill in the lake instead. This effort would extend over the colonial period and well after Independence. Drainage of the lake would create land on which Mexico City grew.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the very edge of Mexico City has reached the villages of Tacuba and Tacubaya. During the first third of this century, the country estates, farmland and ranches between Tacuba, Tacubaya and Mexico City proper were turned into subdivisions for housing, with roads and other paved areas taking over empty fields. From the 1930s, population growth and development increased with the establishment of industrial and commercial areas. In the 1940s, the Polanco area between Chapultepec and Santa Julia was developed. Various public and private enterprises were installed along the avenues of Ejército Nacional and Marina Nacional. The Secretary of Defense made its home at Lomas de Sotelo. On the far west of the borough large cemeteries such as Panteón Francés, General Sancturum, Panteón Inglés and Panteón Español were opened. One reason for the westward expansion was that wealthy families were abandoning the historic center of Mexico City for newer areas. This began with areas such as Colonia Roma and Condesa, but later they would move to Polanco. This movement west still continues into the Lomas area.

==Chapultepec==

The center of the borough is Chapultepec Park. Chapultepec Park, more commonly called the &quot;Bosque de Chapultepec&quot; (Chapultepec Forest) in Mexico, is the largest city park in Latin America, measuring in total just over 686 hectares.

The area has been considered special since long in the pre Hispanic period when it was a ceremonial site and later a retreat for Aztec emperors. There is also evidence of settlements here by the Chichimecas and Toltecs. The Mexicas lived here at before they were expelled by Azcapotzalco. After finally establishing Tenochtitlan, the Mexicas or Aztecs considered Chapultepec sacred. The first aqueduct from there to Tenochtitlan/Mexico City was built by Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. Later Moctezuma Xocoyotzin had fish tanks and gardens constructed on the site. And Nezahualcoyotl had a palace constructed at the base of the hill. After the Conquest, Hernán Cortés tried to take this land for himself but Charles V denied this and made the area the heritage of Mexico City because it contained many of the springs that provided the city with potable water. The second and third sections of Chapultepec were opened in 1962 and 1974 respectively, with the third section from part of the lands which were an old paper factory.

The two most important museums are the Museo Nacional de Antropología and the Chapultepec Castle National History Museum. These and most of the rest of the museums in the first section are located along Paseo de la Reforma. Of all of the museums in the park, the most famous is the Museo Nacional de Antropología, considered to be one of the greatest archeological museums in the world. The museum has a number of antecedents beginning from the colonial period, but the current institution was created in the 1960s with the building and grounds designed by architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez. This museum has an area of 44,000m2 and 25 exhibit halls with sections devoted to each of the major pre-Hispanic civilizations in Mexico including the Aztec, Maya, Toltec and Olmec. The permanent collection is so large, that it is possible to spend an entire day to see it. There are also temporary exhibits as well.

The Castle of Chapultepec is on Chapultepec Hill on which the park is historically centered. Construction of this castle was begun in the 1780s and includes towers and merlons, not for defense, but to give the structure a more royal feel. In 1847, the Castle was the scene of the Battle of Chapultepec and the suicide of the “Niños Héroes” or Boy Heroes. A monument to these boys is located at the foot of Chapultepec Hill. From the 19th in to the 20th centuries, this structure was used as the official residence of Mexico&#x27;s heads of state until this was changed to Los Pinos in the 1930s. Residents included Maximiliano I of Mexico, who had Paseo de la Reforma, which passes through Chapultepec Park, built to connect the area with the center of the city. Today, it is home to the National History Museum.

Other features of the park include the Chapultepec Zoo, two artificial lakes with a lake house (Casa del Lago) and various pre Hispanic ruins including the remains of the Baths of Moctezuma, which was used until the 19th century when the area&#x27;s springs dried up.

==Neighborhoods==
Neighborhoods (&quot;colonias&quot;) in the borough include Bosques de las Lomas, Lomas de Chapultepec, Granada, Ampl. Granada, Pensil, Polanco, San Miguel Chapultepec, and the two formerly independent municipalities of Tacuba and Tacubaya.

===Tacuba===
Tacuba was called Tlacopan in the pre Hispanic period. Tacuba is derived from the former Nahuatl name “Tlacopan” and means place of the jarilla plant. It was conquered by Azcapotzalco which placed Totoquihuatzin as governor. When the Tenochtitlan and Texcoco decided to ally against Azcapotzalco, Tlacopan did not resist and for this reason is considered to be the third of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Tacuba&#x27;s importance led to the construction of a causeway over the lake linking it with Tenochtitlan. Today, this causeway still exists as a major thoroughfare called Calzada Mexico-Tacuba.

During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs succeeded at one point in expelling the Spanish from Tenochtitlan in an event called La Noche Triste (The Sad Night). Cortés and his men fled towards Tacuba on the road that still connects it with the historic center of Mexico City. One year later, Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan to conquer it for good. At the intersection of the Mexico-Tacuba Road and Mar Blanco is a still surviving Montezuma cypress tree. According to legend, this is the tree under which Cortés wept.

The last ruler of Tacuba was Tetlepanquetzal, who was tortured by Cortés, who suspected that he was hiding treasure. Over the pre Hispanic ceremonial site, the Franciscans constructed a church dedicate to the Archangel Gabriel. By 1632, the area had sixty haciendas and by the end of the 18th century, 28 villages with Tacuba proper having twelve neighborhoods. The main river through here was the Remedios, which was the main supply of water. In addition, to agriculture, the area was also an important supplier of lumber and sandstone for construction. By 1794, the area had 45 villages.

In the first third of the 20th century, three important schools were established in Tacuba. The Colegio Militar was moved to Popotla in 1913, closed during the Mexican Revolution and reopened in 1920. The Escuela Nacional de Maestros (National Teachers College) was opened in 1925 along with the Escuela de Medicina Veterinaria de UNAM. In 1937, the Instituto Politécnico Nacional was opened in Casco de Santo Tomás.

Since the mid 20th century, Tacuba proper has declined with problems such as crime and sanitation issues. Tacuba has major problems with uncontrolled street vending and public transportation, prostitution and other crime. Rehabilitation of Tacuba is under a program designated RENACE (rebirth) .

The church and former monastery of San Gabriel is located next to the Tacuba Metro station. The main entrance to the atrium has a stone gate with three arches. The small atrium is mostly paved with a few trees. The façade is mostly Baroque with the portal marked the two grooved Doric columns and topped by a frieze with vegetative design done in relief. It has one bell tower with two levels also in Baroque. The side portal faces Calzada Mexico-Tacuba. It also has an arched entryway, but marked with wavy grooved pilasters and topped with a niche. Part of the former cloister is also preserved. The interior is focused on the main altar, which is gilded and has twelve colonial era paintings of the Virgin Mary and various saints along with Salomonic columns. In the center is an image of the crucified Christ and the top has an image of God, the Father. One other feature of the church is an image of the Child Jesus called the “Niño futbolista” (Football playing child), named such because it is dressed in the uniform of Mexico&#x27;s national team when it plays in the World Cup .

The Monastery of San Joaquín was founded in 1689 by the Carmelites and conserves its original architecture. It was an important school for young priests.

The Tacuba area is home to a neighborhood called Popotla. Here are the remains of a Montezuma cypress, under which it is said that Hernán Cortés sat and wept after being run out of Tenochtitlan during La Noche Triste in 1520. Next to the plaza where this tree is found, there is an old mansion whose east side has a mural called “Noche de la Victoria” (Night of the Victory) done in 2010. Also here is the parish called Pronto Socorro. Further east along the Calzada Tacuba-Mexico, there is the Colegio Militar, next to the Metro stop of the same name. This school was founded in 1823 and operated until 1976. Today it is the site of the Universidad del Ejército y Fuerza Aérea which still trains part of Mexico&#x27;s military.

===Tacubaya===

In the Aztec period, Tacubaya was called Atlacuihuayan, “place where the river twists” in Nahuatl and only a way station for travelers. In 1590 after the Spanish conquest, The Dominicans founded a monastery and church called San José de Tacubaya. The area remained rural with orchards, important grain mills and abundant water from its three main rivers of Piedad, Morales and Xola, attracting the wealthy to build country homes here. Some development began in the mid 19th century, and mansion building reached its height here in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the 19th century, the municipality of Tacubaya consisted of Tacubaya proper and the villages of La Piedad, Mixcoac, Santa Fe and Santa Lucía, along with a number of haciendas and ranches. In 1888, Tacubaya had just over 9,000 inhabitants and at the beginning of the 20th, it had 20,000. By the 20th century the urban sprawl of Mexico City reached Tacubaya and its rural nature ended. Its rivers were encased and its springs dried up.

The historic center of Tacubaya still has some of its country mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries and earlier, such as the Casa de la Bola (House of the Ball) which belonged to the Count De la Cortina until 1783. Only the cloister of the original former monastery of Santo Domingo still exists, and its church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Purification whose main feast day is Candelaria (Candlemas), giving it the alternate name of the Parish of Candlemas. Outside of the historic center, there are several landmarks. Edificio Ermita is one of the first skyscrapers in Mexico City, constructed in 1930 in Art Deco style by architect Juan Segura. The Luis Barragán House and Studio was the home of one of the country&#x27;s most renowned architects, built in the early 20th century.

Much of Tacubaya is now working class. One major transportation problem is the overcrowding of unregulated vendors, especially around the Tacubaya Metro station.

<doc id="402336" wikidata="Q800875" url="?curid=402336" title="Hakata Station">
<text>is a major railway station in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. It is the largest and busiest railway terminal in Kyushu, and is a gateway to other cities in Kyushu for travelers coming from Honshu by rail travel. The San&#x27;yō Shinkansen from Osaka ends at this station.

The station was rebuilt in 2011. The main building was demolished and a new, larger station building, as well as office buildings and new platforms, was constructed. The station reconstruction project was initiated specifically for the Kyushu Shinkansen extension from Hakata to Shin-Yatsushiro Station which continues southward through its existing route to Kagoshima-Chūō Station. The new station building has a Hankyu Department Store, its first branch store in Kyushu, as a tenant, as well as other first-in-Kyushu branch retailers including Tokyu Hands.

<doc id="402341" wikidata="Q5481747" url="?curid=402341" title="Francis Light">
<text>Francis Light ( – 21 October 1794) was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer best known for founding the colony of Penang and its capital city of George Town in 1786. Light was the father of William Light, who founded the city of Adelaide in South Australia in 1836.

==Early years==

Francis Light was born in Dallinghoo, Suffolk and baptised on 15December 1740. His mother was Mary Light. Taken in by a relative, William Negus, Light was sent to attend the Woodbridge Grammar School in 1747.. Several historians have described Light as Negus&#x27; illegitimate son, but according to author Noël Francis Light Purdon – the six-times great-grandson of Light – Negus instead received payment from Light&#x27;s parents for looking after him and acted as his guardian throughout his education.

==Career==
===Naval career===

In February 1754, Light joined the British Royal Navy, serving as the servant of a naval surgeon onboard the 64-gun &quot;Mars&quot;. He began a Royal Navy apprenticeship in 1759 onboard the 70-gun &quot;Captain&quot; before being transferred after a few months to the newly-commissioned 70-gun &quot;Dragon&quot;. Light was promoted to the officer&#x27;s rank of midshipman on the 74-gun &quot;Arrogant&quot; in 1761 before being discharged from the Royal Navy in 1763. During his career in the Navy, he met James Scott, who would later play an important part in Light&#x27;s life and business career.

===In the colonies===

His movements between 1763 and 1765 are not recorded, but it seems that he managed to amass enough of a fortune to bequeath a considerable amount of property in a will to William Negus and three other men.

====Thalang, Siam====

In 1765 Light embarked on the East India Company (EIC) merchant ship &quot;Clive&quot;, captained by John Allen, bound for Madras and Bombay. In British India, he secured command of a &quot;country ship&quot; belonging to the Madras trading firm Jourdain, Sulivan &amp; Desouza, the &quot;Speedwell&quot;. Setting up a base in Thalang in Siam (also known as Salang and Jung/JunkCeylon, now Phuket province, in Thailand), he traded there, in Aceh (now an Indonesian province) and the Malay Peninsula, learning the local languages. Basing himself in Thalang, he met a woman named Martina Rozells, and together they set up a trading post in Kuala Kedah. He soon gained an influential position with the Sultan of Kedah.

For about ten years he had his headquarters in Thalang, where he revived a defunct French trading post. While in Thalang he learned to speak and write several languages, including Malay and Thai, and became family friends with Than Phu Ying Chan and her husband, the Governor of Thalang. Later, in 1785, he warned the island administrators of an imminent Burmese attack. Light&#x27;s warning enabled the islanders, led by Chan and her sister Mook, to prepare for Thalang&#x27;s defence and subsequently repel the Burmese invasion. In 1785, after the death of the Governor of Thalang, his widow and other relatives proposed that Light assume the position; however the King of Siam, Rama II, thwarted the proposal.

====Penang====

Light&#x27;s interest in Penang had begun in 1771, when he proposed the idea of a British settlement in the neighbourhood of the Malay Peninsula to Warren Hastings, the East India Company&#x27;s Governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal). He suggested that the island of Penang might serve as a &quot;convenient magazine for the Eastern trade&quot; but at that time his idea didn&#x27;t gain traction. In 1776–77, Light arranged a large shipment of firearms for the Siamese Kingdom of Thonburi, ruled by Taksin the Great.

Whereas his previous suggestion had brought no result, following the American Revolutionary War during which Britain had struggled with France for naval superiority, Light&#x27;s suggestion took on a new significance. In 1786, on behalf of the EIC, Light leased Penang Island from Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah, for the price of 6,000 Spanish dollars per annum. Under the administration of Governor-general Sir John Macpherson, Light was entitled superintendent and put in charge of the settlement, styled &quot;Dewa Raja&quot; by the Malays, on 1 July 1786; thus marking the beginning of British Malaya. The new colony was sparsely populated at this time: it was described as &quot;one vast jungle of nearly 107 square miles, with a population of only fifty-eight souls&quot;. Pirates had to be discouraged from landing, and forests were cleared. George Town (named after King George III) was established, and when two East India Company ships appeared on the coast, Light took the opportunity of inviting the ships and crews to attend the declaration of the new colony of Prince of Wales Island on 11 August 1786, being the eve of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s birthday.

The Sultan, however, was bound under the Southeast Asian mandala political model in fealty to the King of Siam. Light had exceeded his authority with a promise of military aid should the Burmese or Siamese invade, despite the fact that Sultan Abdullah asked him to refrain from landing until the promise of military aid had been confirmed in London. Thus, when the Sultan&#x27;s territories were invaded and no aid was forthcoming, the Sultan attempted to take back the island as a refuge in 1790.

The multicultural colony of Penang became extraordinarily successful from its inception and Light served as superintendent of the settlement until his death in October 1794, apart from 21 November 1789 to 9 February 1790, when John Glass acted in his place. By 1789 there were about 10,000 inhabitants, and by 1795, 20,000.

Accounts of his actions seem to indicate that he was a fair-minded and honourable man. In 1790, he asked for a higher salary, in order to allow him to live without having to engage in trade (by which he may have enriched himself, but possibly compromise his role). This led to his business partnership with James Scott being dissolved. In 1794, he recommended that a proper system of justice should be instituted in Penang, as it should not be within the powers of the superintendent to dispense &quot;arbitrary judgement&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Light died from malaria on 21 October 1794 and was buried at the Old Protestant Cemetery at Northam Road (now Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah Road) in George Town. He remembered his friends James Scott, William Fairlie and Thomas Pegou in his will.

A bronze statue, sculpted by F.J. Wilcoxson and cast at Burton&#x27;s Foundry in Thames Ditton, bears Francis Light&#x27;s name but was actually modelled on the features of his son William, as there were no portrait of Francis to use. Erected in 1936 to celebrate 150 years since George Town was founded, it stands at Fort Cornwallis in George Town. Light Street, within the UNESCO World Heritage Site in George Town, is named after him. Convent Light Street, Penang&#x27;s oldest girls&#x27; school, founded in 1852, is located along the street. He was respected by his British peers as a fair and honourable man and admired for his achievements, which included keeping the Siamese and Dutch at bay. He was a skilled negotiator and cared for the welfare of the people both in his colony and old friends in Thalang, sending rice when the island was hit by famine. He spoke the local languages and partially assumed the local dress, earning the love of the residents of Penang.

==Family==
===Martina Rozells===
Light had three daughters and two sons with Martina (sometimes spelt Martinha) Rozells (possibly born Thong Di), whose origins and status are the subject of debate. She has been variously recorded as being of Portuguese or French extraction on one side, and of Siamese or Malay on the other. She was also rumoured to have been a princess, possibly given to Light as a reward, or the island as her dowry, although other sources state that the princess was sent to enlist Light&#x27;s aid on behalf of the Sultan. 

Two contemporaries of Light, historian William Marsden (who says that she was the daughter of the Sultan of Kedah), and Captain Elisha Trapaud (who describes the wedding of Light to a princess of the Sultan&#x27;s family, bestowed upon him as a mark of the prince&#x27;s gratitude) seem to confirm the story that she was of noble blood. However, John Crawfurd, later First Resident of Singapore, said in 1820 that Martina was not a princess, but a Portuguese woman from Siam, and Steuart points out that there is no evidence that Trapaud knew Light when the couple began living together. Other contemporary accounts name her as the daughter of the 19th Sultan of Kedah (Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II), by a lower-ranking wife of mixed Thai-Portuguese ancestry. She may have adopted her mother&#x27;s name to emphasise her ancestry and &quot;high birth&quot;. She was probably one of many Portuguese Eurasian Catholics who had fled religious persecution in southern Siam and to Kedah.

There were a number of Rozells registered at George Town in 1788. There was also a Martinha (no surname shown) registered as being from Siam, with a son William, of Kedah. Steuart posits that Martina was the same person as the &quot;Nonya&quot; who took part in the earliest negotiations with the Sultan in 1770–1771. This would support the idea that she was not a princess, but nevertheless had strong connections with both Siam and Kedah and therefore a useful person to employ in negotiations between the Sultan and the British administration at Aceh. If they were legally married, Light did not declare it. However, it was against East India Company rules to marry a Catholic and, as Martina belonged to the Catholic faith, Light may have tried to avoid dismissal by refraining from officially declaring his marriage. Light left Rozells his considerable property in his will. Either way, they cohabited for at least 22 years before his death. 

Light&#x27;s business partners, James Scott and William Fairlie, were the executors of Light&#x27;s will, and some versions of events have suggested that they cheated Rozells out of portions of her inheritance, namely their family residence and estate, the Suffolk Estate. Rozells did however inherit a bungalow in Penang, along with a pension from the East India Company. Despite the lack of recognition from Light&#x27;s British peers in regards to the status of Rozells as his wife, she was perceived as such by the local Eurasians and Thai community. Rozells later remarried, marrying a John Timmer at a ceremony at the chapel in Fort Cornwallis in 1799.

===Family life and offspring ===

Light and his family lived in the first home constructed on the Suffolk Estate, now known as Suffolk House, west of George Town. Their home was described as a &quot;simple Anglo-Indian Garden House style of timber and attap construction&quot;, built within his pepper estate. (After Light&#x27;s estate was settled in 1805, William Edward Phillips built a grand Georgian-styled mansion, also known as Suffolk Park.) His eldest son, Colonel William Light, was the first Surveyor General of the Colony of South Australia; William is famous for choosing the site of the colony&#x27;s capital, Adelaide, and designing the layout of the streets and parks in the Adelaide city centre, North Adelaide and the Adelaide Park Lands.

The other son, Francis Lanoon Light II, was born in Penang in 1791, married a Javanese woman, Charlotte Aboni, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. He died in 1823. His descendants are the Capel family in Malaysia. Their daughters were named Sarah, Mary and Ann (aka &quot;Lukey&quot;). They all married in Calcutta. Sarah married General James Welsh, an EIC officer in the Madras Army. Mary married a wealthy indigo plantation owner, George Boyd, and Ann married a physician, Charles Hunter. By 1818, Welsh observed that his wife and her siblings had seen all of their mother&#x27;s property disappear.

==In popular culture==
In October 2019, co-commissioned by Adelaide&#x27;s OzAsia festival and Penang&#x27;s George Town Festival, a play was created and staged by Australian writer and director Thomas Henning in collaboration with Malaysian duo TerryandTheCuz, named &quot;Light&quot;. The play explores the personal circumstances first of Light and his pivotal role in Penang&#x27;s modern history, and then of his son William in Adelaide. The roles of the women in their lives are explored, as well as the geopolitical situation of the time which influenced the decisions of the elder and junior Lights.The life of Martina Rozells is also brought to life. The play is mainly about family, aiming to use Light&#x27;s inner perspective to look at the world, and touches on &quot;the values and notions of nationalism&quot;. Henning used the Mayo and Dutton collections at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia for all of his research for the play. Henning sees William Light as an unfulfilled individual, despite all of his success; his life was &quot;also lonely and drifting&quot;.

In October 2021, &quot;Dragon&quot;, the first volume of Penang Chronicles published by Monsoon Books was released worldwide. Written by Rose Gan, a British writer and historian who has lived in Malaysia for many years, the series follows the life and times of Francis Light and Martinha Rozells. It takes a fresh look at the historical sources, presenting a depiction of the people of the straits and their own history set aside the known events of the life of Captain Light. &quot;Dragon&quot; looks at the early years of Light, his years in the British navy at war in the Americas, and then his life as a country ship captain for the East India Company in the Straits of Malacca. The second volume &quot;Pearl&quot; was released in 2022 and charts Light&#x27;s journey from merchant captain to governor of Penang island and the part Martinha Rozells and her family played in the events. The third novel, &quot;Emporium&quot;, about the early years of the settlement, was due to be released in 2023.

<text>The Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) is a state agency of Mississippi that operates prisons. It has its headquarters in Jackson. Burl Cain is the commissioner.

==History==

In 1843 a penitentiary in four city squares in central Jackson was developed as Mississippi&#x27;s first state prison.

The prison in Jackson was destroyed during the Civil War, and the state did not replace it for decades. Instead, the state conducted convict leasing, leasing prisoners to third parties for their labor. The lessees held custody of the inmates and provided their room and board, often substandard. The state made substantial amounts of money from these arrangements, which created an incentive to have minor infractions criminalized in order to arrest more people and sentence them. Increasing the number of crimes for which persons could be arrested, such as vagrancy, resulted in an increased pool of prisoners to lease out, as many could not raise enough cash to pay fines or fees that were sometimes imposed. Most prisoners were freedmen; the state used this system to extract labor from former slaves and keep them suppressed socially. The state officially changed its policy at the end of the 19th century, saying that prisoners sentenced by the State could no longer be hired or leased by third parties, effective after December 31, 1894. 

After ending the convict leasing system, the State of Mississippi began to acquire property to build prisons. The state bought the Rankin Farm in 1895 in Rankin County, from Jackson; it is now the site of the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. Later the state purchased the Oakley Farm, located in Hinds County, from Jackson. The state government purchased land in Sunflower County in January 1901, where it developed the Parchman Farm (now Mississippi State Penitentiary). The prison properties were largely self-sufficient, raising their own crops and livestock, as well as commodity crops such as cotton for the state to sell. All the labor was by prisoners.

The state Department of Corrections was established in 1976 to oversee the existing Mississippi state prisons. Both federal and state laws were passed during various campaigns of &quot;wars on crime&quot; and &quot;wars on drugs;&quot; not only were new behaviors criminalized, but politicians supported mandatory sentencing and lengthier sentences. By the end of the 20th century, Mississippi had one of the largest state prison systems in the country, with a rising number of persons incarcerated even as crime rates fell. A disproportionate number and percentage of African Americans and other people of color have been incarcerated under these policies.

In addition to the major state prisons, the state developed many community detention centers for prisoners with lower security classifications. They were provided as workers to numerous locales, in part to prepare them for reintegration into society after release. Because of the dramatic climb in the number of prisoners and demand for space, the state legislature authorized MDOC to enter into contracts with for-profit prison management companies for the construction and operation of private prisons in the state. By the early 21st century, the state had contracts with operators of six private prisons.

Civil rights groups and prisoner advocates have filed class-action suits in efforts to improve prison conditions and protect prisoner rights. As a result of such a suit against Unit 32 (Death Row lockdown unit) at Mississippi State Penitentiary, the state and the ACLU worked out a settlement in 2006 that changed processes and dramatically reduced the use of punitive solitary confinement in the state.

In 2009 and 2014, the state passed legislation to provide more flexibility in sentencing and parole of certain classes of prisoners, reducing the prison population and returning non-violent offenders earlier to their families and communities.

===Rise of private prisons===
Changes in sentencing laws dramatically increased the prison population. In 1995 the state legislature passed a law requiring all prisoners to serve 85% of their sentence. The prison population more than doubled from 1995 to 2007, from 11,250 to 22,800, far outstripping capacity of the three state prisons.

Beginning in the late 20th century, the state dealt with the rising need to incarcerate individuals by contracting with private prison management companies, who built and operated a total of six prisons for state prisoners in Mississippi. Corrections Corporation of America and Cornell Companies were two early contractors; the latter was acquired by GEO Group in 2010, which took over its three contracts in Mississippi. Prisoners and their families made numerous complaints about conditions in these facilities, citing high rates of violence and sexual abuse, rampant drugs, lack of medical care and education, and other problems.

Class action suits were filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project against two private facilities with the most egregious conditions: they filed suit against Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in 2010. This case was settled in federal court in 2012, requiring the state to quickly transfer youth offenders to a state-run facility to be operated according to juvenile justice standards. They were transferred to Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. In addition, the state was prohibited from using solitary confinement for any youthful offender. WGCF was converted to be used for adults only. MDOC ended its contract with GEO Group, awarding a 10-year contract to Management and Training Corporation for Walnut Grove and two other private facilities, effective July 1, 2012. The court supervision of conditions at WGCF was extended because of two prison riots in 2014. Due to declining need, the state closed the prison in September 2016.

The ACLU and SPLC filed suit against the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, established for prisoners with serious mental illness, in 2013. The class-action suit at East Mississippi Correctional Facility is proceeding; the court affirmed the status of the plaintiffs in 2015.

===Sentencing, control and parole reforms===
At the same time, the state was seeking to reduce the prison population. Studies had found that minor reductions in length of sentence did not affect the rate of recidivism, showing that prisoners could be paroled earlier for certain types of crimes without affecting public safety. In 2008, the state passed SB 2136, to enable non-violent prisoners to again be eligible for parole after they had served 25% of their sentence. The new law was estimated to affect &quot;approximately 4,500 inmates, or about 25% of the 22,800 total population. A unique feature of SB 2136 was that it was applied retroactively in order to have an immediate impact on the prison population and to ensure equity in the sentencing process. About 3,000 inmates or 12% of the total population had already met their time-served requirement and were immediately eligible for parole consideration.&quot; To aid prison officials and parole boards in assessing candidates, the Bureau of Justice Assistance developed a science-based risk assessment instrument to apply.

By August 2009, some 3100 prisoners had been paroled from prison. The Board&#x27;s use of the new risk assessment instrument resulted in their having a higher rate of parole approval. The parole revocation rate has not changed, and in the first year, only 5 of the people returned to prison for new crimes, a rate of 0.2% that was a fraction of the national rate of 10.5%. Legislative amendments have been passed in 2009 increased the ability of MDOC to reduce the number of prisoners; one of these authorized the department to place most &quot;persons convicted of most drug crimes to be placed under house arrest with electronic monitoring.

===Closing of private facilities===
Both the state and private prison operators have had difficulty maintaining staffing in prisons because of low wages and high turnover. By 2011, MDOC operated below capacity due to the success of its efforts to reduce the prison population. As of 2011, the state prisons were below capacity by more than 2,000 spaces. With private prisons included, that was about 4,000 beds below capacity.

MDOC closed the Delta Correctional Facility in January 2012, and Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in September 2016. By early 2017 Mississippi had no state prisoners at the for-profit Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility; the prison operator CCA had contracts with California and other states to house their prisoners at this privately owned site.

By March 2017, MDOC was using only three privately run prisons for its inmates. In early 2017, Interim Commissioner Pelicia Hall (appointed in March 2017 as Commissioner) conducted raids for contraband at these private prisons, collecting much material. She is determined to reduce the traffic in contraband, which contributes to corruption in the prisons, including among the guards and staff.

===Operation Mississippi Hustle===

As a result of a five-year statewide investigation known as Operation Mississippi Hustle, in November 2014 the federal Department of Justice announced indictments of former Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps (who resigned the day before) and Cecil B. McCrory, a businessman and former Republican state legislator, on 49 counts of corruption, bribery and kickbacks. Newspaper reports have indicated widespread corruption related to contracts for prison services, and within the prisons themselves. This includes millions paid in bribes related to awarding of state contracts, drugs and other contraband being smuggled into facilities by the guards, sex between staff and inmates, and other abuses. Epps was charged with receiving $1.47 million in bribes and kickbacks, related to $800 million worth of state contracts made over about a decade.

Both Epps and McCrory pleaded guilty in 2015 and cooperated with investigators on identifying others responsible. Eight other indictments followed, with one waived and more expected. Defendants include consultant and businessman Robert Simmons, who was sentenced to 87 months; former mayor of Walnut Grove, Mayor William Grady Sims, who was prosecuted earlier and sentenced to 7 months; former legislator and Republican businessman Sam Waggoner, former Harrison County Supervisor William Martin, who committed suicide before arraignment; former Alcorn County warden and Democratic state Senator Irb Benjamin, Dr. Carl Reddix, Terese Malone, Mark Longoria, and Guy &quot;Butch&quot; Evans.

On February 8, 2017, Mississippi Attorney General, Democrat Jim Hood, announced he had filed civil cases against 15 corporations (including those that had operated Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility and had provided other services to prisons) and numerous individuals who had engaged in contracts with the MDOC and Epps, seeking damages and punitive damages. Hood said, 
These individuals and corporations that benefited by stealing from taxpayers must not only pay the state&#x27;s losses, but state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state. We are also seeking punitive damages to punish these conspirators and to deter those who might consider giving or receiving kickbacks in the future.&quot; Besides Teresa Malone and Carl Reddix, the defendants included Michael Reddix; Andrew Jenkins; Management &amp; Training Corporation; The GEO Group, Inc.; Cornell Companies, Inc.; Wexford Health Sources, Inc.; The Bantry Group Corporation; AdminPros, L.L.C.; CGL Facility Management, LLC; Mississippi Correctional Management, Inc.; Branan Medical Corporation; Drug Testing Corporation; Global Tel*Link Corporation; Health Assurance, LLC; Keefe Commissary Network, LLC of St. Louis; Sentinel Offender Services, L.L.C. and AJA Management &amp; Technical Services, Inc.

===Commissioner appointments===
In March 2017, Pelicia E. Hall was appointed by Governor Phil Bryant as Commissioner; she is the first woman to hold this position. An attorney, she has extensive criminal justice and private law experience. In 2020 Burl Cain became the commissioner.

==Divisions==
* Division of Institutions: Operates prisons
** Agricultural Enterprises: Oversees agricultural operations at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP) and South Mississippi Correctional Institution (SMCI). The majority of MDOC&#x27;s farming occurs at MSP.
** Division of Classification &amp; Offender Services: Assigns prisoners to security classifications
* Community Corrections Division: Supervises parole and probation

==Operations==

Before going to their assigned facilities and after their transfer from county jails, most prison inmates are sent to the Reception &amp; Classification Center (R&amp;C) in the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility (CMCF) in Rankin County to be classified according to behavior level and assessed for treatment. The classification process takes around 30 days.

Most male inmates who are sentenced to MDOC by the courts or who are returned to MDOC as parole violators, probation violators, intensive supervision program (ISP) (house arrest) violators, earned release supervision (ERS) violators, and suspension violators are placed at R&amp;C. All women inmates who are sentenced to MDOC by the courts or who are returned to MDOC as parole violators, probation violators, ISP violators, ERS violators, and suspension violators are placed in 1A or 2B at CMCF. Male death row inmates transferred from county jails immediately are sent to the Mississippi State Penitentiary, the location of the male death row.

Each prisoner receives a security classification. The classifications are:
* Minimum (Community)
* Minimum (Non-Community)
* Medium
* Close
* Death Row

In November 2014, media reports indicated the department housed each prisoner at a cost of about $42.12 per day, one of the lowest costs in the nation.

===Health care===
The system&#x27;s chief medical officer is Gloria Perry. She has been in that position since 2008. She is certified in family-practice.

MDOC contracts with Centurion of Mississippi, LLC. Previously, MDOC contracted with Wexford Health Sources, Inc., headquartered in Green Tree, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Wexford provides medical services to inmates at state-operated facilities. Each privately operated facility has its own contracted medical services provider.

Wexford was awarded the $95 million MDOC contract in 2006. Previously MDOC contracted with Correctional Medical Services (CMS), headquartered in Creve Coeur, Missouri, near St. Louis. CMS&#x27;s contract began on July 1, 2003.

===Intensive Supervision Program===
MDOC&#x27;s Intensive Supervision Program (ISP) is the authority&#x27;s house arrest program.

===Death row===
MDOC performs executions at the Mississippi State Penitentiary. Male death row offenders are housed in the Mississippi State Penitentiary, while female death row offenders are housed in the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility.

===Conjugal and family visits===
The Mississippi state prison system ended conjugal visits in February 2014. The commissioner at the time, Chris Epps, argued that the possibility of creating single parents and the expenses were the reasons why conjugal visits ended.

===Employment programs===
Previously MDOC contracted prisoners to local and county governments, in essence paying a subsidy to the jurisdictions to manage the prisoners. The prisoners, often classified as trusties, would get reductions in their sentences in exchange for doing work. On April 30, 2015 MDOC stated that it would end this program and save $3.2 million per year. Many jurisdictions have complained they will be unable to replace the labor of the prisoners.

===Costs of state prisons===
In 2014, media reported that Commissioner Chris Epps had said that the department housed each prisoner at a cost of about $42.12 per day, one of the lowest costs in the nation. He also noted that the state&#x27;s recidivism rate was among the &quot;lowest in the nation.&quot;

But, the state spends more than $15,000 annually for each prisoner, about three times what it spends for each school student. In 2013, the agency budget for prisons was about $389 million, according to the Brookings Institution. Journalist Jerry Mitchell explored the consensus by experts who have found that the state could keep more people out of prison by stressing good education from a young age, and recommended improving schools in poor rural areas rather than building prisons. African Americans are incarcerated at a rate three times that of whites in the state but could be helped by good education from a young age.

Prison guards start at just twelve dollars an hour. They receive just six week&#x27;s training. 
===Recidivism===
Nationwide, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (of the US Department of Justice) says that about three-quarters of those released from prison are arrested again in the next five years. That figure spans a wide range of actions for which a person may be arrested. Mississippi measures its recidivism differently: whether a person released from prison is convicted of another crime and imprisoned within three years. Based on those criteria, its recidivism rate is about 33%. Its parolees have had considerable success after the state officials adopted a risk assessment instrument in 2009, to evaluate which candidates for parole under a new law designed to reduce the prison population of persons convicted of non-violent crime.

==Demographics==
As of September 1, 2008, the Mississippi Department of Corrections has 26,274 inmates in its custody. 17,677 (67.28%) are Black, 8,269 (31.47%) are White, 236 (0.9%) are Hispanic, 43 (.16%) are Asian, 27 (.01%) are Native American, and 22 (.06%) have that data unavailable. Of the 23,692 male inmates, 16,366 (69.08%) are Black, 7,030 (29.67%) are White, 222 (.94%) are Hispanic, 35 (.15%) are Asian, 23 (.1%) are Native American, and 16 (.07%) have that data unavailable. Of the 2,582 female inmates, 1,311 (50.77%) are Black, 1,239 (47.99%) are White, 14 (.54%) are Hispanic, 8 (.31%) are Asian, 4 (.15%) are Native American, and 6 (.23%) have that data unavailable.

===Private prisons===
Since 2012, MDOC has reduced the number of prisoners it has in private prisons due to an overall reduction of prisoners in the state, aided by changes to sentencing and parole laws in 2008 and 2014. As of March 2017, three private prisons hold Mississippi prisoners:
* East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) -(unincorporated Lauderdale County) - Operated since July 2012 on a 10-year contract by Management and Training Corporation (MTC), which replaced GEO Group. East Mississippi is the state&#x27;s main &quot;special needs&quot; facility (for inmates with disabilities and/or severe mental illness).
* Marshall County Correctional Facility (MCCF)- Operated by GEO Group until June 2012; now under 10-yr contract to MTC.
* Wilkinson County Correctional Center (WCCC) - Operated by CCA through early 2013; since 2013 by MTC.

The remaining three are closed for MDOC operations.
* Delta Correctional Facility (Greenwood) - Opened, formerly operated by Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) - Facility suspended January 2012
* Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility (in unincorporated Tallahatchie County) - Opened, operated by Corrections Corporation of America (CCA); as of January 2017 holding no Mississippi inmates, but prisoners from California.
* Walnut Grove Correctional Facility Walnut Grove, (formerly the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility) - Opened 2001 and operated by Cornell Corrections 2003–2010, then GEO Group until June 2012. Operated as an adult facility under 10-yr contract by MTC July 2012-September 16, 2016, when it was closed.

==Prisoner rules==
Men may have hair that is not more than in length. Men may have beards and goatees up to in length.

===Prisoner uniforms===
Most prisoner outfits are striped. As of 1997, green stripes indicate lower security prisoners, black stripes indicate prisoners with a level higher than the ones with green stripes, and red stripes indicate high security prisoners.

Reception and Classification Center inmates wear yellow jumpsuits. Condemned prisoners are required to wear red jumpsuits.

==Fallen officers==

Since the establishment of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, six officers have died in the line of duty.

==Media campaigns==
The New Jersey Department of Corrections, the state prison system of New Jersey, established the &quot;Be Smart Choose Freedom&quot; television advertisement campaign in 2005. The State of New Jersey produced 30–60 second public service announcements to warn state residents against going to prison. MDOC decided to start its own &quot;Be Smart Choose Freedom&quot; campaign and use the commercials that aired in New Jersey.

<text>Galicia, also known by its variant name Galizia ( ; , ; , ; ; see below), is a historical and geographic region spanning what is now southeastern Poland and western Ukraine, long part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It covers much of the other historic regions of Red Ruthenia (centered on Lviv) and Lesser Poland (centered on Kraków).

The name of the region derives from the medieval city of Halych, and was first mentioned in Hungarian historical chronicles in the year 1206 as &quot;Galiciæ&quot;. The eastern part of the region was controlled by the medieval Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia before it was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland in 1352 and became part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. During the partitions of Poland, it was incorporated into a crown land of the Austrian Empire – the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

The nucleus of historic Galicia lies within the modern regions of western Ukraine: the Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts near Halych. In the 18th century, territories that later became part of the modern Polish regions of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, and Silesian Voivodeship were added to Galicia after the collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Eastern Galicia became contested ground between Poland and Ruthenia in medieval times and was fought over by Austria-Hungary and Russia during World War I and also Poland and Ukraine in the 20th century. In the 10th century, several cities were founded there, such as Volodymyr and Jaroslaw, whose names mark their connections with the Grand Princes of Kiev, Vladimir the Great and Yaroslav the Wise. There is considerable overlap between Galicia and Podolia (to the east) as well as between Galicia and south-west Ruthenia, especially in a cross-border region (centred on Carpathian Ruthenia) inhabited by various nationalities and religious groups.

==Origins and variations of the name==


The name of the region in the local languages is:
* ; romanized: &quot;Halychyna;&quot;
* ; 
* Czech and ; 
* ; 
* .

Some historians speculated that the name had to do with a group of people of Thracian origin (i.e. Getae) who during the Iron Age moved into the area after the Roman conquest of Dacia in 106 CE and may have formed the Lypytsia culture with the Venedi people who moved into the region at the end of La Tène period. The Lypytsia culture supposedly replaced the existing Thracian Hallstatt (see Thraco-Cimmerian) and Vysotske cultures. Some other scholars assert that the name &quot;Halych&quot; has Slavic origins – from &quot;halytsa&quot;, meaning &quot;a naked (unwooded) hill&quot;, or from &quot;halka&quot; which means &quot;jackdaw&quot;.
(The jackdaw featured as a charge in the city&#x27;s coat of arms
and later also in the coat of arms of Galicia-Lodomeria.
The name, however, predates the coat of arms, which may represent canting or simply folk etymology). Although Ruthenians drove out the Hungarians from Halych-Volhynia by 1221, Hungarian kings continued to add &quot;&quot; to their official titles.

In 1349, in the course of the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, King Casimir III the Great of Poland conquered the major part of Galicia and put an end to the independence of this territory. Upon the conquest Casimir adopted the following title: Casimir by the grace of God king of Poland and Rus (Ruthenia), lord and heir of the land of Kraków, Sandomierz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Kuyavia, Pomerania (Pomerelia). . 

Under the Jagiellonian dynasty (Kings of Poland from 1386 to 1572), the Kingdom of Poland revived and reconstituted its territories. In place of historic Galicia there appeared the Ruthenian Voivodeship.

In 1526, after the death of Louis II of Hungary, the Habsburgs inherited the Hungarian claims to the titles of the Kingship of Galicia and Lodomeria, together with the Hungarian crown. In 1772 the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary, used those historical claims to justify her participation in the First Partition of Poland. In fact, the territories acquired by Austria did not correspond exactly to those of former Halych-Volhynia – the Russian Empire took control of Volhynia to the north-east, including the city of Volodymyr-Volynskyi () – after which Lodomeria was named. On the other hand, much of Lesser Poland – and (1772–1918), (1772–1809), (1795–1809), and (1846–1918) – became part of Austrian Galicia. Moreover, despite the fact that Austria&#x27;s claim derived from the historical Hungarian crown, &quot;Galicia and Lodomeria&quot; were not officially assigned to Hungary, and after the of 1867, the territory found itself in Cisleithania, or the Austrian-administered part of Austria-Hungary.

The full official name of the new Austrian territory was the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria with the Duchies of and Zator. After the incorporation of the Free City of Kraków in 1846, it was extended to &quot;Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, and the Grand Duchy of Kraków with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator&quot; ().

Each of those entities was formally separate; they were listed as such in the Austrian emperor&#x27;s titles, each had its distinct coat-of-arms and flag. For administrative purposes, however, they formed a single province. The duchies of Auschwitz () and Zator were small historical principalities west of , on the border with Prussian Silesia. Lodomeria, under the name Volhynia, remained under the rule of the Russian Empire – see Volhynian Governorate.

==History==

In Roman times, the region was populated by various tribes of Celto-Germanic admixture, including Celtic-based tribes, the Lugians, Cotini, Vandals and Goths (the Przeworsk and Púchov cultures). During the Migration Period, a variety of nomadic groups invaded the area. The East Slavic tribes White Croats and Tivertsi dominated the area since the 6th century until it was annexed to Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 10th century.

In the 12th century, the Principality of Galicia was formed, which merged at the end of the century with neighbouring Volhynia into the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Galicia and Volhynia had originally been two separate Rurikid principalities, assigned on a rotating basis to younger members of the Kievan dynasty. The line of Prince Roman the Great of Volodymyr had held the Principality of Volhynia, while the line of Yaroslav Osmomysl held the Principality of Galicia. Galicia–Volhynia was created following the death in 1198 or 1199 (and without a recognised heir in the paternal line) of the last Prince of Galicia, Vladimir II Yaroslavich; Roman acquired the Principality of Galicia and united his lands into one state. Roman&#x27;s successors would mostly use Halych (Galicia) as the designation of their combined kingdom. In Roman&#x27;s time Galicia–Volhynia&#x27;s principal cities were Halych and Volodymyr. In 1204, Roman captured Kyiv in alliance with Poland, signed a peace treaty with the Kingdom of Hungary and established diplomatic relations with the Byzantine Empire.
In 1205, Roman turned against his Polish allies, leading to a conflict with Leszek the White and Konrad of Masovia. Roman was killed in the Battle of Zawichost (1205), and Galicia–Volhynia entered a period of rebellion and chaos, becoming an arena of rivalry between Poland and Hungary. King Andrew II of Hungary styled himself &quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;king of Galicia and Vladimir [in-Volhynia]&quot;, a title that later was adopted in the House of Habsburg. In a compromise agreement made in 1214 between Hungary and Poland, the throne of Galicia–Volhynia was given to Andrew&#x27;s son, Coloman of Lodomeria.

In 1352, when the principality was divided between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the territory became subject to the Polish Crown. With the Union of Lublin in 1569, Poland and Lithuania merged to form the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted for 200 years until conquered and divided up by Russia, Prussia, and Austria in the 1772 partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The south-eastern part of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was awarded to the Habsburg Empress Maria-Theresa, whose bureaucrats named it the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, after one of the titles of the princes of Hungary, although its borders coincided but roughly with those of the former medieval principality. Known informally as Galicia, it became the largest, most populous, and northernmost province of the Austrian Empire. After 1867 it was part of the Austrian half of Austria-Hungary, until the dissolution of the monarchy at the end of World War I in 1918.
During the First World War, Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of the Russian Empire and the Central Powers, on the Eastern Front of World War I. The Russian forces overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian army in a chaotic frontier battle in the opening months of the war. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a combined German/Austro-Hungarian offensive.

In 1918, Western Galicia became a part of the restored Republic of Poland, which absorbed the Lemko-Rusyn Republic. The local Ukrainian population declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the short-lived West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. During the Polish-Soviet War, the Soviets tried to establish the puppet-state of the Galician SSR in East Galicia, but the territory was then conquered by the Poles.

The 1921 Peace of Riga confirmed Galicia&#x27;s status as part of the Second Polish Republic. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainian nationalists, this was ratified by the Conference of Ambassadors on 14 March 1923 and internationally recognized on 15 May 1923.

The Ukrainians of Eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of Volhynia made up about 12% of the Polish Republic&#x27;s population, and were its largest minority. As Polish government policies were discriminatory towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving rise to the militant underground Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.

==People==

In 1773, Galicia had about 2.6 million inhabitants in 280 cities and market towns and approximately 5,500 villages. There were nearly 19,000 noble families, with 95,000 members (about 3% of the population). The serfs accounted for 1.86 million, more than 70% of the population. A small number were full-time farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions.

Galicia had arguably the most ethnically diverse population of all the countries in the Austrian monarchy, consisting mainly of Poles and &quot;Ruthenians&quot;; the peoples known later as Ukrainians and Rusyns, as well as ethnic Jews, Germans, Armenians, Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Roma and others. In Galicia as a whole, the population in 1910 was estimated to be 45.4% Polish, 42.9% Ruthenian, 10.9% Jewish, and 0.8% German. This population was not evenly distributed. The Poles lived mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians predominant in the eastern region (&quot;Ruthenia&quot;). At the turn of the twentieth century, Poles constituted 88% of the whole population of Western Galicia and Jews 7.5%. The respective data for Eastern Galicia show the following numbers: Ruthenians 64.5%, Poles 22.0%, Jews 12%. Of the 44 administrative divisions of Austrian eastern Galicia, Lviv (, ) was the only one in which Poles made up a majority of the population. Anthropologist Marianna Dushar has argued that this diversity led to a development of a distinctive food culture in the region.

The Polish language was the most spoken language in Galicia as a whole, although the eastern part of the region was predominantly Ruthenian-speaking. According to the 1910 census, 58.6% of Galicia spoke Polish as its mother tongue, compared to 40.2% who spoke a Ruthenian language. The number of Polish-speakers may have been inflated because Jews were not given the option of listing Yiddish as their language. Eastern Galicia was the most diverse part of the region, and one of the most diverse areas in Europe at the time. 

The Galician Jews immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to by the region of Germany where they originated (such as Saxony or Swabia). For those who spoke different native languages, e.g. Poles and Ruthenians, identification was less problematic, and the widespread multilingualism blurred ethnic divisions.

Religiously, Galicia is predominantly Catholic, and Catholicism is practiced in two rites. Poles are Roman Catholic, while Ukrainians belong to the Greek Catholic Church. Other Christians belong to one of the Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. Until the Holocaust, Judaism was widespread, and Galicia was the center of Hasidism.

==Economy==

The new state borders cut Galicia off from many of its traditional trade routes and markets of the Polish sphere, resulting in stagnation of economic life and decline of Galician towns. Lviv lost its status as a significant trade center. After a short period of limited investments, the Austrian government started the fiscal exploitation of Galicia and drained the region of manpower through conscription to the imperial army. The Austrians decided that Galicia should not develop industrially but remain an agricultural area that would serve as a supplier of food products and raw materials to other Habsburg provinces. New taxes were instituted, investments were discouraged, and cities and towns were neglected. The result was significant poverty in Austrian Galicia. Galicia was the poorest province of Austro-Hungary, and according to Norman Davies, could be considered &quot;the poorest province in Europe&quot;.

===Oil and natural gas industry===
Near Drohobych and Boryslav in Galicia, significant oil reserves were discovered and developed during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. The first European attempt to drill for oil was in Bóbrka in western Galicia in 1854. By 1867, a well at Kleczany, in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters. On 31 December 1872, a railway line linking Borysław (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened. British engineer John Simeon Bergheim and Canadian William Henry McGarvey came to Galicia in 1882. In 1883, their company bored holes of 700 to 1,000 meters and found large oil deposits. In 1885, they renamed their oil developing enterprise the Galician-Karpathian Petroleum Company (), headquartered in Vienna, with McGarvey as the chief administrator and Bergheim as a field engineer, and built a huge refinery at Maryampole near Gorlice, south of Tarnow. Considered the biggest, most efficient enterprise in Austro-Hungary, Maryampole was built in six months and employed 1,000 men. Subsequently, investors from Britain, Belgium, and Germany established companies to develop the oil and natural gas industries in Galicia. This influx of capital caused the number of petroleum enterprises to shrink from 900 to 484 by 1884, and to 285 companies manned by 3,700 workers by 1890. However, the number of oil refineries increased from thirty-one in 1880 to fifty-four in 1904. By 1904, there were thirty boreholes in Borysław of over 1,000 meters. Production increased by 50% between 1905 and 1906 and then trebled between 1906 and 1909 because of unexpected discoveries of vast oil reserves of which many were gushers. By 1909, production reached its peak at 2,076,000 tons or 4% of worldwide production. Often called the &quot;Polish Baku&quot;, the oil fields of Borysław and nearby Tustanowice accounted for over 90% of the national oil output of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From 500 residents in the 1860s, Borysław had swollen to 12,000 by 1898. At the turn of the century, Galicia was ranked fourth in the world as an oil producer. This significant increase in oil production also caused a slump in oil prices. A very rapid decrease in oil production in Galicia occurred just before the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913.

Galicia was the Central Powers&#x27; only major domestic source of oil during the Great War.

<text>Jean Baptiste Charbonneau (February 11, 1805 – May 16, 1866), sometimes known in childhood as Pompey or Little Pomp, was an American explorer, guide, fur trapper, trader, military scout during the Mexican–American War, &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor) of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and a gold digger and hotel operator in Northern California. His mother was Sacagawea, a Lemhi Shoshone who worked as a guide and interpreter for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jean Baptiste&#x27;s father was also a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition, a French Canadian explorer and trader named Toussaint Charbonneau. 

Jean Baptiste was born at Fort Mandan in North Dakota. In his early childhood, he accompanied his parents as they traveled across the country with the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first group to cross the U.S. to the Pacific coast. The expedition co-leader William Clark nicknamed the boy Pompey (&quot;Pomp&quot; or &quot;Little Pomp&quot;). After the death of his mother, he lived with Clark in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended St. Louis Academy. Clark paid for his education. 

Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau also had a second child, a daughter named Lizette Charbonneau; however, because she receives only occasional mention in Clark&#x27;s papers, her life remains unclear beyond her third birthday.

Jean Baptiste and Sacagawea appear on the United States Sacagawea dollar coin. He is the second child depicted on United States currency. Pompeys Pillar on the Yellowstone River in Montana and the community of Charbonneau, Oregon are named for him.

==Childhood==

===Lewis and Clark Expedition===
Jean Baptiste Charbonneau was born to Sacagawea, a Shoshone, and her husband, the French Canadian trapper Toussaint Charbonneau, in early 1805 at Fort Mandan in North Dakota. This was during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which wintered there in 1804–05. The senior Charbonneau had been hired by the expedition as an interpreter and, learning that his pregnant wife was Shoshone, the captains, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, agreed to bring her along. They knew they would need to negotiate with the Shoshone for horses at the headwaters of the Missouri River. Meriwether Lewis noted the boy&#x27;s birth in his journal:


The infant traveled from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean and back, carried along in the expedition&#x27;s boats or upon his mother&#x27;s back. His presence is often credited by historians with assuring native tribes of the expedition&#x27;s peaceful intentions, as they believed that no war party would travel with a woman and child.

===After the expedition===
In April 1807, about a year after the end of the expedition, the Charbonneau family moved to St. Louis, at Clark&#x27;s invitation. Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagawea departed for the Mandan villages in April 1809 and left the boy to live with Clark. In November 1809, the parents returned to St. Louis to try farming, but left again in April 1811. Jean Baptiste continued to reside with Clark.
Clark&#x27;s two-story home, built in 1818, contained an illuminated museum long by wide. Its walls were decorated with national flags and life-size portraits of George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, Native artifacts, and mounted animal heads. Upon visiting the museum, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a geologist and ethnographer, wrote:
 As a boy, Charbonneau learned from the vast collection.

Clark paid for Charbonneau&#x27;s education at St. Louis Academy, a Jesuit Catholic school (now called St. Louis University High School), although the expense was considerable for the time. The school&#x27;s single classroom was then located in the storehouse of Clark&#x27;s friend, the trader Joseph Robidoux. Brothers James and George Kennerly paid for Charbonneau&#x27;s supplies for 1820 and were reimbursed by Clark.

From June through September 1820 and in 1822, Jean Baptiste boarded with Louis Tesson Honoré, a Clark family friend and member of his church, Christ Episcopal. The general had helped organize the church in 1819. They lived in St. Ferdinand Township in St. Louis County, Missouri near Charbonneau&#x27;s father&#x27;s of land.

==Adult life==
On June 21, 1823, at age eighteen, Charbonneau met Duke Friedrich Paul Wilhelm of Württemberg, the nephew of King Friedrich I Wilhelm Karl of Württemberg. Charbonneau was working at a Kaw trading post on the Kansas River near present-day Kansas City, Kansas. Wilhelm was traveling in America on a natural history expedition to the northern plains with Jean Baptiste&#x27;s father as his guide. On October 9, 1823, he invited the younger Charbonneau to return to Europe with him, which was agreed upon.

The two set sail on the &quot;Smyrna&quot; from St. Louis in December 1823. Jean Baptiste lived at the duke&#x27;s palace in Württemberg for nearly six years, where he learned German and Spanish and improved his English and French. The latter was still the dominant language of St. Louis, which had first enabled his conversations with the Duke. According to a 1932 translation of Wilhelm&#x27;s journal by the historian Louis C. Butscher, Wilhelm wrote that Charbonneau was &quot;…a companion on all my travels over Europe and northern Africa until 1829.&quot; In 2001, Albert Furtwangler, PhD, questioned the accuracy of Butscher&#x27;s German translation, noting two more recent translations of the duke&#x27;s journals, and suggests that Charbonneau&#x27;s role in Wilhelm&#x27;s court may have been less intimate than Butscher&#x27;s perhaps romanticized account implied. Charbonneau may have been hired as a servant, rather than invited as a companion. As support, he notes the apparent lack of further contact between the two men after Charbonneau&#x27;s return to America. However, lack of contact in itself does not mean Charbonneau was a hired hand. Such an act may have been an insult to Clark, which the duke likely would have avoided. As with many aspects of his life, little is known for certain about Charbonneau&#x27;s time in Europe.

==Children==
Parish records in Wuerttemberg show that while there, Charbonneau fathered a child with Anastasia Katharina Fries, a soldier&#x27;s daughter. The baby, Anton Fries, died about three months after his birth.

Nearly two decades later, while in California as an alcalde or magistrate, Charbonneau was recorded as being the father of another child. On May 4, 1848, Maria Catarina Charguana was born to her mother Margarita Sobin, a Luiseño woman, and Charbonneau. Sobin, 23 at the time, traveled to Mission San Fernando Rey de España near Los Angeles for the infant girl&#x27;s baptism, performed on May 28, 1848, and recorded by Father Blas Ordaz as entry #1884. Margarita Sobin later married Gregory Trujillo, and some of their descendants may be members of the La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians.

==Trapper and hunter==
In November 1829, Charbonneau returned to St. Louis, where he was hired by Joseph Robidoux as a fur trapper for the American Fur Company, to work in Idaho and Utah. He attended the 1832 Pierre&#x27;s Hole rendezvous while working for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. There he fought in the bloodiest non-military conflict that preceded the Plains Indian wars, which began in 1854.

From 1833–1840 Charbonneau worked in the fur trade in the Rocky Mountain Trapping System with other mountain men, such as Jim Bridger, James Beckwourth and Joe Meek.
From 1840–42 he worked from Fort Saint Vrain, floating bison hides and tongues down the South Platte River to St. Louis. On one of the voyages, he camped with Captain John C. Frémont on his cartographic expedition. In 1843, he guided Sir William Drummond Stewart, a Scottish baronet, on his second long trip to the American West, which was a lavish hunting expedition.

Seeking employment again, in 1844 Charbonneau went to Bent&#x27;s Fort in Colorado, where he was a chief hunter, and worked also as a trader with southern Plains Indians. William Boggs, a traveler who met him, wrote that Charbonneau &quot;…wore his hair long, [and] was…very high strung…&quot; He reported, &quot;…it was said Charbonneau (sic) was the best man on foot on the plains or in the Rocky Mountains.&quot;

==Mexican–American War==
In October 1846, Charbonneau, Antoine Leroux and Pauline Weaver were hired as scouts by General Stephen W. Kearny. Charbonneau&#x27;s experience with military marches, such as with James William Abert in August 1845, along the Canadian River, and his fluency in Native languages qualified him for the position. Kearny directed him to join Colonel Philip St. George Cooke on an arduous march from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to San Diego, California, a distance of . Their mission was to build the first wagon road to Southern California and to guide some 20 huge Murphy supply wagons to the west coast for the military during the Mexican–American War.

A contingent of soldiers made up of some 339 Mormon men and six Mormon women, known as the Mormon Battalion, were the builders of that new road over the uncharted southwest from Santa Fe to San Diego and Los Angeles. A memorial to the historic trek of the Mormon Battalion and their guide Charbonneau has been erected at the San Pedro River, north of the U.S.–Mexico border near the present-day town of Palominas, Arizona. Other monuments or historic markers are in Tucson, Arizona and in California at Box Canyon near Warner Springs, at Temecula, at Old Town San Diego and at Fort Moore in Los Angeles. Colonel Cooke&#x27;s diary mentions Charbonneau some 29 times from November 16, 1846, to January 21, 1847. Eight of the twenty wagons reached Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, from today&#x27;s Oceanside, California, and the leaders counted the expedition as a success.

Cooke wrote of the Mormon Battalion, &quot;History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry.&quot; Known as Cooke&#x27;s Road or the Gila Trail but more currently known as the Mormon Battalion Trail, the wagon road was used by settlers, miners, stagecoaches of the Butterfield Stage line and cattlemen driving longhorns to feed the gold camps. Parts of the route became the Southern Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 66. Currently, the Boy Scouts of America gives an award for those who hike sections of this historic trail. In February 1848, knowledge gained about the region was used as the basis of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which established the United States-Mexico border in December 1853, following the Mexican-American War.

==Alcalde==
In November 1847, Charbonneau accepted an appointment from Colonel John D. Stevenson as &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor) at Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. This position made him the only civilian authority, a combined sheriff, lawyer and magistrate, in a post-war region covering about . From 1834–50, the lands were owned by rancheros through legally questionable land grants.

The rancheros hired local Luiseño people to do agricultural work. Many functioned in virtual servitude, and some rancheros paid them only with liquor. Trying to correct abuses and also facilitate post-war control, in November 1847, Colonel Richard Barnes Mason, the territorial governor, ordered Charbonneau to force the sale of a large ranch owned by the powerful Jose Antonio Pico, whose family was politically connected. His brother Pio Pico had been the last governor of California under Mexico. On January 1, 1848, Mason banned the sale of liquor to Native Americans. Such ordinances attacked the foundation of ranchero power and ability to do business. Eventually, the changes led to United States civilian control of California. Although Charbonneau was assisted by Captain J. D. Hunter as he negotiated with Pico, he saw that local resistance would make enforcing Mason&#x27;s orders difficult. Charbonneau resigned his post in August 1848 and was soon followed by Hunter. California statehood on September 9, 1850, ended the post-war difficulties.

==Gold mining==
In September 1848, Charbonneau arrived in Placer County, California at the American River, near what is now Auburn. Arriving early in what became known as the California Gold Rush, he joined only a handful of prospectors. Panning was not done during the hard Sierra Nevada winter or spring runoff, so in June 1849, he joined Jim Beckwourth and two others at a camp on Buckner&#x27;s Bar to mine the river at the Big Crevice. This claim &quot;…was shallow and paid well&quot;. Charbonneau lived at a site known as Secret Ravine, one of 12 ravines around Auburn. A successful miner, he kept working in the area for nearly sixteen years.

A measure of his success was that Charbonneau could afford the mining region&#x27;s highly inflated cost of living. For example, at a time when a good wage in the West was $30 per month, it cost $8–16 per day to live in Auburn. Transiency was high but Charbonneau was still there in 1860, working as the hotel manager at the Orleans Hotel in Auburn. By 1858, many miners had left the California fields for other gold rushes. In April 1866, he departed for other opportunities at age 61. He may have headed for Montana to prospect for gold, although sites such as at Silver City and DeLamar in Idaho Territory were much closer.

==Final journey and death==

It is not clear exactly why Charbonneau left Auburn, but the recessionary local economy was certainly a motivation. Before leaving he visited the &quot;Placer Herald&quot; newspaper and visited with an editor, who wrote later in his obituary, &quot;...he was about [his purpose was] returning to familiar scenes&quot;. Some of those &quot;familiar scenes&quot; may have been where he had lived and worked as a mountain man east of the Great Basin. His destination also may have been the Owyhee Mountains, where rich placer deposits were discovered in May 1863. Or perhaps he sought to reach Alder Gulch near Virginia City, Montana, because it had produced $31 million in gold by late 1865. Other possible destinations were the Bannock, Montana gold strikes or—as noted above—the mines at Silver City (formerly Ruby City), Delamar or Boonville.

His route and travel method likely took him on a stagecoach over Donner Summit and east along the well-traveled Humboldt River Trail to Winnemucca, Nevada, then north to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Camp McDermitt at the Oregon border. Passing the camp in rugged terrain, the men reached an Owyhee River crossing at present-day Rome, Oregon, where an apparent accident occurred and Charbonneau went into the river. The accident&#x27;s cause is unknown, but there are several possibilities. He may have been on a stagecoach operated by the Boise-Silver City-Winnemucca stage company that began its route in 1866 out of Camp McDermitt and in crossing the river, the coach sank. Or he may have been on horseback and fallen off the river bank or slipped out of the saddle while crossing. The Owyhee River in snow melt may have turned into whitewater. Other possibilities are he was injured on the land journey, inhaled alkali dust, or fell ill from drinking contaminated water.

The ill Charbonneau was taken to Inskip Station in Danner, Oregon, built in 1865, about from the river and west of Jordan Valley. It is now a ghost town. The former stagecoach waystation, mail stop, and general store served travelers to Oregon and the California gold fields. It had its own well, and Charbonneau may have deteriorated from drinking the water. After his death there, his body was taken approximately north and buried.

Charbonneau died at age 61 on May 16, 1866. A death notice was sent by an unknown writer, likely one of two fellow travelers on the journey east, to the &quot;Owyhee Avalanche&quot; newspaper and it said he died of pneumonia. This is the first documented evidence of his death. The &quot;Placer Herald&quot; obituary writer opined that he succumbed to the infamous &quot;Mountain Fever&quot;, to which many illnesses in the West were attributed.

=== Gravesite memorial ===

Charbonneau&#x27;s gravesite, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, sits on of land within sight of the Inskip Station ruins. (The site is also within half a mile of Danner&#x27;s abandoned Anderson General Store, which is still intact.) Located amidst the Ruby Ranch grounds, the encircled memorial area was donated to Malheur County by the landowners for historic preservation, and features three historical markers within walking distance: 

* In 1971, the Malheur County Daughters of the American Revolution placed a standing stone marker.

* In 1973, the Oregon Historical Society erected a second standing marker made of wood, which reads:


* In 2000, a third marker was dedicated in bronze by an Idaho-based group which included descendants of the Lemhi Shoshone tribe. As the son of Sacagawea, a Northern Shoshone who lived in the Lemhi Valley, Charbonneau is considered one of their people.

Also known as the Jordan Valley Hamlet Cemetery, the interment site itself is additionally host to five other graves from the late 1880s. A plaque laid nearby at Inskip Station lists their names beside that of &quot;J.B. Charbonneau&quot;, along with the inscription: 
=== Disputed timelines ===
Earlier in the twentieth century, Dr Grace Raymond Hebard of the University of Wyoming, a political economist, not a historian or anthropologist, argued that Charbonneau died and was buried at the Shoshone Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Dr. Charles Eastman, a Santee Sioux and not of the Shoshone language group, did research that attempted to establish that Charbonneau&#x27;s mother Sacagawea died at the reservation on April 9, 1884. Some believe that Charbonneau died in 1885 and was buried next to her. Memorials in their names were erected in 1933 at nearby Fort Washakie. Eastman did his research in 1924–25, interpreting oral history. But his translation has been superseded by documentary evidence for both Charbonneau and Sacagawea.

In 1964, an edited nineteenth-century journal was published stating that Sacagawea died much earlier, on December 20, 1812, of a &quot;putrid fever&quot; (possible following childbirth) at Fort Lisa on the Missouri River. Four 19th-century documents support this earlier date, including a statement by William Clark years after the 1805–07 Lewis and Clark expedition that &quot;Sacajawea was dead.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==
* Charbonneau&#x27;s image appears with that of his mother in the United States Sacagawea dollar coin. He was the second infant to be depicted on U.S. currency, after Virginia Dare on the 1937 Roanoke half-dollar. The portrait design is unusual, as the copyrights have been assigned to and are owned by the United States Mint. Therefore the portrait is not in the public domain, as most U.S. coin designs are.
* Pompeys Pillar on the Yellowstone River in Montana and the community of Charbonneau, Oregon are named after him.
* Pomp Peak in Montana&#x27;s Bridger Range is named after him. The peak is next to Sacagawea Peak.
* A memorial plaque was established in his honor under the cedar tree near the Old Fire House in Old Town, Auburn, California.

<doc id="402349" wikidata="Q4793763" url="?curid=402349" title="Armory Square">
<text>Armory Square is a small neighborhood on the west side of Downtown Syracuse, New York. It began life as a busy commercial and industrial area just to the west of the central city. After World War II, Syracuse&#x27;s central city became less and less populated as more housing and business facilities were built in the suburbs. In the 1980s, plans were first made to transform the languishing district into a small shopping/arts/nightlife district surrounding the former Syracuse Armory. These plans came to fruition during the 1990s, when new stores and restaurants opened, and several new buildings were constructed in a compatible style to the middle and late 1800s and early 1900s architecture dominating the district.

==Current day==
Today, Armory Square is the home of some of Syracuse&#x27;s better restaurants, at least two coffeehouses, a radio station company, dozens of small shops selling everything from band instruments to used records to women&#x27;s clothing, several bars and nightclubs, Urban Outfitters, Armory Massage Therapy, a newly restored upscale hotel and two tattoo parlors. A number of professional firms are also located in Armory Square, including Eric Mower and Associates, O&#x27;Brien &amp; Gere, and the Sugarman Law Firm. The area is popular with students from Syracuse University and Le Moyne College.

Its borders are generally considered to be the circular road around the armory (Jefferson Street) to the south, Onondaga Creek to the west, Washington Street to the north, and Clinton Street to the east.
Armory Square is also home to the Shot Clock Monument, which includes a 24-second shot clock whose invention, here, was crucial to the successful development of basketball as a major sport.

A paved multi-use trail, the Onondaga Creekwalk, connects the neighborhood with Onondaga Lake.
==Armory Square Historic District==

Forty-six industrial and commercial buildings make up the Armory Square Historic District. West Fayette Street is the northern boundary of the district, the rear property lines of the buildings on South Clinton Street the eastern boundary. The southern boundary is a raised railroad track, while the western boundary includes the buildings on Walton Street. The buildings in the district include the Armory, a former Lackawanna Railroad passenger station (1941), hotels, warehouses and commercial buildings. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

<doc id="402351" wikidata="Q1432842" url="?curid=402351" title="List of colleges and universities in Massachusetts">
<text>There are 114 colleges and universities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that are listed under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. These institutions include fourteen research universities, twenty-one master&#x27;s universities, and thirty-four special-focus institutions. Eighty-five of Massachusetts&#x27; post-secondary institutions are private, of which five are for-profit. Thirty of the state&#x27;s post-secondary institutions are public, a number which excludes the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was founded by the Morrill Land-Grant Acts, but later became a private institution.

Harvard University is the state&#x27;s oldest post-secondary institution, having been founded in 1636. Boston University is the state&#x27;s largest institution of higher learning in terms of enrollment, having 32,603 students in the fall of 2013 while Conway School of Landscape Design is the state&#x27;s smallest college with an enrollment of 18. The University of Massachusetts Amherst is the state&#x27;s largest public university, with an enrollment of 28,518 students. Massachusetts is also home to a number of internationally recognized universities, including Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which are ranked among the top ten universities in the world.

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is the state&#x27;s sole public land-grant university, and is the flagship institution of the University of Massachusetts system. There are also eleven Catholic post-secondary institutions, including Boston College, the College of the Holy Cross, Merrimack College and Stonehill College. There are also two Judaic post-secondary institutions in Massachusetts, including Brandeis University and Hebrew College. The state has four medical schools, Boston University School of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and Tufts University School of Medicine. There are nine law schools, which are accredited by the American Bar Association, including Boston College Law School, Harvard Law School and the University of Massachusetts School of Law. One hundred and seven of Massachusetts post-secondary institutions are officially recognized by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), while most are accredited by multiple higher education accreditation agencies.

==Current institutions==


==Defunct institutions==
At least eighty-two colleges and universities have closed in Massachusetts, beginning with Worcester Medical Institute in 1859. Defunct institutes include multiple private institutions, and the public Hyannis State Teachers College. Many schools were also merged into modern public universities, which form the origins of the Boston, Dartmouth, and Lowell campuses of the University of Massachusetts system. Many of these were private institutions, which either merged with private institutions and ceased to grant degrees, or institutions like the Swedenborg School of Religion, which merged with the Pacific School of Religion upon its relocation to California. The Bible Normal School was founded in Massachusetts but moved to Connecticut before it was merged into the Hartford Seminary. However, this excludes institutions which operated as part of for-profit corporations incorporated in other states, such as Empire Beauty Schools and the University of Phoenix, as they were not operated as separate college campuses and operated more as corporate entities.

==Forbes National Rankings==
The &quot;Forbes&quot; National Colleges Ranking is a ranking system for the best four-year colleges in the United States. These colleges are ranked for their alumni salary, debt, return on investment, graduation rate, membership in Forbes honors lists such as Forbes 30 Under 30, student retention, and academic achievement. As of 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; recognizes the University of Massachusetts Amherst as the flagship public university and Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the flagship private university in Massachusetts.

<text>This is a list of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston. Some are located within Boston proper while some are located in neighboring cities and towns, but all are within the 128/95/1 loop. This is closer to the &quot;inner core&quot; definition of Metropolitan Boston, which excludes more suburban North Shore, South Shore and MetroWest regions. Although larger institutions may have several schools, some of which are located in cities other than that of the main campus (such as Harvard Medical School and Tufts University School of Medicine), each institution is listed only once and location is determined by the site of each institution&#x27;s main campus. Three universities—Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, as well as Tufts in Somerville—make up the &quot;brainpower triangle&quot; of greater Boston, a region defined by universities that have a large local and national influence.

There are a total of 44 institutions of higher education in the defined region, including three junior colleges, 11 colleges that primarily grant baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degrees, eight research universities, and 22 special-focus institutions. Of these, 39 are private ventures while five are public institutions (four are run by the state of Massachusetts and one is operated by the city of Quincy).

In 2023, enrollment at these colleges and universities ranged from 33 students at Boston Baptist College to 36,624 students at Boston University. The first to be founded was Harvard University, also the oldest institution of higher education in the United States, while the most recently established institution is Sattler College. All but five of these schools are accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

<text>Danner is an unincorporated community located in Malheur County, Oregon, (Western United States). It lies along the Danner Road off U.S. Route 95 west of the Jordan Valley. Jordan Creek, a tributary of the Owyhee River (leading eventually to the Snake and Columbia Rivers) flows by Danner.

==History==
The old Idaho-Oregon-Nevada highway ran through Danner, following the route of the old Skinner Toll Road which opened the area for settlement in 1863, during the era of the American Civil War (1861-1865), back east.

Danner is also the location of the burial site of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau (a.k.a. &quot;Pompey&quot; or &quot;Little Pomp&quot;, 1805-1866)&#x27;s resting place. He was the youngest member of the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806 as the infant son of their Lemhi Shoshone Native American woman guide Sacagawea (c.1788-1812), who carried him as a baby / toddler strapped to her back in a papoose as she guided the white Americans William Clark (1770-1838) and Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809), and their Corps of Discovery on orders from third President Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826, served 1801-1809), charting the newly-acquired immense tract of unexplored lands west of the Mississippi River from the First French Empire (France) of their new Emperor Napoleon I of the enormous tract of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. After traveling northwest upstream on the Missouri River, she guided them through the wilderness passes in the Rocky Mountains chain going westward eventually through the uncharted Pacific Northwest region, along the Snake and Columbia Rivers to the West Coast and the Pacific Ocean, then eventually returning back east. Charbonneau died here on May 16, 1866 at the age of 61 years old after developing pneumonia while passing through the area, crossing the Owyhee River. His burial site (which coincidentally also happens to lie a short distance from the trans-continental route of Lewis and Clark&#x27;s trek west, 61 years before), was located decades later in the 20th century, was marked and fenced off through the efforts of local Danner residents Kirt and Johanna Skinner, and it was entered into the National Register of Historic Places (lists maintained by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior), on March 14, 1973. Mixed ancestry Lemhi Shoshone-French Charbonneau&#x27;s resting place lies among five other resting places near the Inskip Station, a fortified stone ranch house that operated as a stagecoach line station in the 1860s. Inskip&#x27;s property was later known as the Ruby Ranch. A plaque marks the ruins / remains of the Inskip Station within sight of the resting place of Charbonneau.

A town had been platted and promoted as Ruby Townsite by Harley J. Hooker, who sold land for $1.25 per acre when the Jordan Valley Irrigation District began constructing an irrigation dam and canal system near Danner around 1910. The proposed agricultural town never grew as anticipated, however, since the high desert&#x27;s harsh climate did not allow farmers to produce a wide enough range of crops. Hooker then built a single story office building of lava rock in Danner about 1915. After his death in 1919, it was used as the Danner community hall for a number of years. It became unsafe and was unfortunately demolished a few years ago.

The name of the community comes from John H. Danner, an early area settler. The old United States Post Office Department (today&#x27;s United States Postal Service after 1970) denied an application to call the local post office as Ruby for the nearby Ruby Ranch, but in 1920 the post office site name ofDanner was approved. The post office operated until 1942.

By the time of the 1930s and the Great Depression, Danner had a general store run by Jesse Anderson, a Danish immigrant. The building he constructed is still standing today, a half mile south of the site of old stagecoach Inskip Station.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Danner has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="402356" wikidata="Q1480059" url="?curid=402356" title="List of universities in India">
<text>The higher education system in India includes both private and public universities. Public universities are supported by the Government of India and the state governments, while private universities are mostly supported by various bodies and societies. Universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the &quot;University Grants Commission Act, 1956&quot;. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and co-ordination.

The types of universities include:
* Central universities, or Union universities, are established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education. the list of central universities published by the UGC includes 56 central universities.
* State universities are run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. , the UGC lists 479 active state universities. The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai. Most State Universities are affiliating universities administering many affiliated colleges (often located in small towns) that typically offer a range of undergraduate courses, but may also offer post-graduate courses. More established colleges may even offer PhD programs in some departments with the approval of the affiliating university.
* Deemed university, or &quot;Deemed to be University&quot;, is a status of autonomy granted by the Department of Higher Education on the advice of the UGC, under Section 3 of the UGC Act. , the UGC lists 124 institutes which were granted the deemed to be university status. According to this list, the first institute to be granted deemed university status was Indian Institute of Science, which was granted this status on 12 May 1958. In many cases, the same listing by the UGC covers several institutes. For example, the listing for Homi Bhabha National Institute covers the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and other institutes.
* Private universities are established by an Act of a State Legislative Assembly and approved by the UGC. , the UGC consolidated list of universities lists 455 state private universities.

, these four types of universities total 1114 universities together. There are universities of some kind in each of the 28 states of India as well as five of the eight union territories: Chandigarh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry. The state with the most universities is Gujarat with 97 universities, and Gujarat has also by far the most state private universities, 63 in number. Tamil Nadu is the state with the most deemed universities, numbering 28, and Karnataka has the most state universities, 42. Delhi has 7 central universities, the largest number of all the states and territories.

* Institutes of National Importance Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. However, they do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called &quot;universities&quot; but &quot;autonomous organizations&quot; or &quot;autonomous institutes&quot;. They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education. These organisations include the Indian Institutes of Information Technology, Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Management and other autonomous institutes. These institutes are not listed below.

Also not listed are institutes which are under the control of the professional councils, without an approval of the UGC, e.g. Agricultural Universities, which are under the control of the Agricultural Education Division of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), one of the professional councils.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has also maintains a list fake Universities operating in India. UGC has said that these 24 self-styled, unrecognised institutions functioning in contravention of the UGC Act have been declared as fake and are not entitled to confer any degrees. , the list contains 20 institutions.

<doc id="402373" wikidata="Q1303926" url="?curid=402373" title="USS Saipan (CVL-48)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Saipan&quot; (CVL-48/AVT-6/CC-3) was a light aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, the lead ship of her class of carrier. She was later selected for conversion into a command ship in 1963–1964, but instead of becoming a command ship she was converted to the Major Communications Relay Ship &quot;Arlington&quot; (AGMR-2) in 1965.

&quot;Saipan&quot; was laid down on 10 July 1944 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, launched on 8 July 1945, sponsored by Mrs. John W. McCormack, and commissioned on 14 July 1946, Capt. John G. Crommelin in command.

==Service history==
===Commissioned===
Commissioned 11 months after the close of World War II, &quot;Saipan&quot; trained student pilots out of Pensacola, Florida, from September 1946 to April 1947 when, reassigned to Norfolk, Virginia, as homeport, she departed the Gulf of Mexico; participated in exercises in the Caribbean; then proceeded to Philadelphia for overhaul. In November, she returned to Pensacola; but, in late December, after training midshipmen, steamed back to the east coast to serve with the Operational Development Force.

In February 1948, however, her work in jet operational techniques, carrier support tactics, and electronic instrument evaluation was interrupted briefly. From the 7th to the 24th, she was engaged in transporting the United States delegation to the Venezuelan Presidential inauguration and back. On her return, she conducted local operations off the Virginia Capes, and in April, after a visit to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, she resumed work for the Operational Development Force. On 18 April, she also relieved as flagship of Carrier Division 17 (CarDiv 17).

===Fighter Squadron 17A===
On 19 April, she departed Norfolk for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where, on 3 May, she embarked Fighter Squadron 17A. Three days later, all squadron pilots had qualified in FH-1 Phantom jets. The squadron had become the first carrier-based jet squadron.
Back at Norfolk by the end of the month, &quot;Saipan&quot; was relieved of flagship duties. In June, she returned to New England waters; and, in July, she commenced overhaul at Norfolk. In December, she resumed local operations. On 24 December, she was ordered to embark two of the Navy&#x27;s latest type helicopter, the XHJS-1, and three Marine Corps HRP-1 helicopters and proceeded north to Greenland to assist in the rescue of eleven airmen downed on the ice cap. Departing Norfolk on Christmas Day, she arrived off Cape Farewell on 28 December and prepared to launch the helicopters as soon as weather allowed. On 29 December however, a C-47, equipped with jet assist takeoff and skis, landed on the ice, took on the marooned airmen and made it out again.

===1949-1954===
&quot;Saipan&quot; then returned to Norfolk, arrived on 31 December, and sailed again on 28 January 1949. Steaming south, she conducted exercises out of Guantanamo Bay into March and returned to Hampton Roads on 10 March. From 11 to 19 March, she conducted operations for the development force; then made a reserve training cruise to Canada. At the end of May, she again commenced work for the Operational Development Force. Three months later, she conducted her second reservist cruise of the year, then qualified Royal Canadian Navy pilots in carrier landings.

From November 1949 – March 1951, &quot;Saipan&quot; remained on the east coast, operating from the Virginia Capes south. On 6 March 1951, she got underway as flagship, CarDiv 14, and sailed for duty with the Sixth Fleet. Deployed for three months, she plied the waters of the western Mediterranean until the end of May, then headed for home. On 8 June, she was back at Norfolk, whence she resumed operations in the western Atlantic from Greenland to the Caribbean.

For over two years, &quot;Saipan&quot; continued Second Fleet operations, interrupting them for midshipman cruises during the summers of 1952 and 1953 and for an overhaul. In October 1953, she departed the east coast and steamed for the Panama Canal and the Pacific. On 30 October, she arrived at San Diego, whence she continued on to Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, and duty off the coast of Korea in support of the uneasy truce agreement.
Assigned to TF 95, &quot;Saipan&quot; was primarily engaged in surveillance and reconnaissance missions along the coast and in inspection patrols of the islands just south of the 38th parallel. In January 1954, she interrupted her patrols to provide air support for Japanese manned LSTs ferrying former Chinese POWs from Inchon to new homes on Taiwan. In early February, she participated in amphibious exercises in the Ryukyus, then returned to Inchon to stand by in the event she was needed for an evacuation of Indian troops from Panmunjom. In March, amphibious exercises took her to the Bonins. She then returned to Japan, but instead of resuming truce patrols, she took on 25 AU-variant Corsairs and five H-19A helicopters at Yokosuka and steamed south. On 18 April, VMA-324 pilots flew the AUs off her flight deck and landed them at Tourane (now Danang) Air Base, to support the French Aéronavale fighting at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in the latest days of the First Indochina War. There the aircraft were turned over to French forces. Later in the day, &quot;Saipan&quot; entered the harbor, offloaded spare parts and maintenance personnel, and departed for Manila.

On 20 April, she delivered the helicopters to Air Force personnel in the Philippines; and, at the end of the month, she resumed operations off the coast of Korea. On 8 May, &quot;Saipan&quot; put into Sasebo, and, through the 24th, remained in Japanese waters. On the 25th, she got underway to return to Norfolk via the Suez Canal. On 20 July, she completed her round the world cruise.

====Hurricane Hazel====
In October, &quot;Saipan&quot; again sailed south to the Caribbean. Arriving as Hurricane Hazel hit the Greater Antilles, razing areas of Hispaniola, the carrier was immediately assigned to relief work. From 13 to 20 October 1954, she delivered food and medical supplies and personnel to isolated areas of Haiti; then, after being honored by the Haitian government, she returned to Norfolk. On 1 November, she entered the shipyard there for overhaul, and, in April, resumed operations with a cruise to the Caribbean. In June, she was again attached to the aviation training center at Pensacola; and, through the summer, conducted qualification exercises. At the end of September, she was ordered to Mexico to again assist in hurricane relief work. From 1–9 October, her helicopters evacuated survivors, flew in rescue personnel, and distributed food, water and medical supplies, primarily in the flooded Tampico area. On 12 October, she returned to Pensacola, where she remained until April 1957. Between her two training stints from 1946 to 1947 and 1955–1957, carrier pilots were trained on , and . On the first of that month, she sailed for Bayonne, New Jersey, where she began inactivation and was decommissioned on 3 October 1957.

===Conversion===
Reclassified AVT-6 on 15 May 1959, &quot;Saipan&quot; remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until March 1963. She then entered the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company yard at Mobile, Alabama, to begin conversion to a command ship. Very briefly designated CC-3, she was instead reclassified as Major Communications Relay Ship AGMR-2 on 1 September 1964 while still undergoing conversion. On 8 April 1965, she was renamed Arlington, in honor of Arlington County, Virginia, the site of one of the Navy&#x27;s first radio stations; and, on 12 August 1966, she completed her conversion. As &quot;Arlington&quot; (AGMR-2), she sailed for Norfolk where she was recommissioned on 27 August 1966.

Fitting out occupied the remainder of the year. In January 1967, she conducted shakedown exercises in the Caribbean, and, in February, she sailed for the Bay of Biscay and exercises off northern Europe. At the end of March, she returned to Norfolk, whence in April, she again steamed to the Caribbean. On her return to the Hampton Roads area, she prepared for deployment to the western Pacific.

===Vietnam===
Departing Norfolk on 7 July 1967, the communications ship transited the Panama Canal and proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, and Subic Bay, when, with , she rotated on station off Vietnam. During her first patrol in the Tonkin Gulf from 21 August to 18 September 1967, she provided reliable message handling facilities for ships of the 7th Fleet in support of combat operations; and, in addition, assisted ships in repairing and better utilizing their electronic equipment. On returning to the Philippines after her first patrol, &quot;Arlington&quot; received a new satellite communications terminal; and, on 2 October, she departed Subic for Taiwan.

There for only three days, she continued on to Tonkin Gulf, where she resumed her communications relay duties. At the end of the month, she shifted south to provide communications support to ships in the &quot;Market Time&quot; area off South Vietnam. After 34 days on station, she spent five days in Hong Kong, then returned to Subic Bay, whence she steamed to Tonkin Gulf in early December 1967 for her third &quot;Yankee Station&quot; communications patrol. On 27 December, she departed the area and headed north. On 4 January 1968, she arrived at Yokosuka, and, on 19 January, she got underway to return to Vietnam.

Arriving back on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 24 January 1968, she departed again on 26 January, participated in exercises in the Sea of Japan; then returned to &quot;Yankee Station.&quot;

On station from 13 February to 10 March, she returned to Yokosuka on 14 March, remained until 3 April, and resumed operations in Tonkin Gulf on 10 April. A visit to Sydney followed completion of her April patrol; but, by mid-June 1968, she was back on station. From 20 to 22 July, she again visited Hong Kong, then sailed for Yokosuka.

====Manned Spacecraft Recovery Force====
Between the end of August and mid-November 1968, she completed two more tours on &quot;Yankee Station&quot;, and in early December, she got underway for Pearl Harbor. There at mid-month, she conducted communications tests; and, on 18 December, she departed Hawaii in TF 130, the Manned Spacecraft Recovery Force, Pacific. Acting as primary landing area communications relay ship, she participated in the recovery of Apollo 8 and returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 December 1968. Two days later, she sailed for the Philippines, and, on 17 January 1969, she resumed direct communications support for naval units in Tonkin Gulf. On 6 February, she departed &quot;Yankee Station,&quot; and, after upkeep at Yokosuka, conducted operations off southern Japan and in the Ryukyus. Toward the end of March, she sailed for Hong Kong, whence she returned to Vietnam.

Remaining on station from 6 to 14 April 1969, she tested her Apollo communications equipment, and, on the 15th, headed back to Pearl Harbor. On 2 May, she arrived in Hawaii and once again joined TF 130. Again assigned as primary landing area communications relay ship, she departed Pearl Harbor on 11 May and steamed for the Apollo 10 recovery area, some 2,400 miles south of Hawaii. On 26 May, the capsule was recovered and the assigned ships returned to Hawaii. From there, &quot;Arlington&quot; proceeded to Midway Atoll where she provided communications support for the Nixon-Thieu conference on 8 June 1969, and, the next day, she sailed west.

On 27 June 1969, the communications ship returned to the Vietnamese coast. On 7 July, however, she was ordered east for her third Apollo recovery mission. Arriving in the recovery area on 21 July, she tested her equipment; and, on the following day, moved to Johnston Island. On 23 July, she embarked President Richard Nixon for an overnight visit; and, on 24 July, supported the recovery of Apollo 11. Crew and capsule successfully recovered, &quot;Arlington&quot; headed for Hawaii, whence she steamed to the west coast.

===Deactivation and decommissioning===
On 21 August 1969, she arrived, for the first time, at her nominal homeport, Long Beach, and four days later shifted to San Diego to begin inactivation. She was decommissioned on 14 January 1970 and berthed with the Inactive Fleet at San Diego. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 15 August 1975, and was sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 1 June 1976.

<text>USS &quot;Wright&quot; (CVL-49/AVT-7) was a light aircraft carrier of the U.S. Navy, later converted to the command ship CC-2. It is the second ship named &quot;Wright&quot;. The first was named for Orville Wright; the second honored both Wright brothers: Orville and Wilbur.

==Construction==
&quot;Wright&quot; was laid down on 21 August 1944, at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 1 September 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Harold S. Miller, a niece of the Wright brothers, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 9 February 1947, with Captain Frank T. Ward in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Wright&quot; departed Philadelphia on 18 March 1947 and stopped briefly at Norfolk, Virginia, en route to the Naval Air Training Base at Pensacola, Florida. After her arrival there on 31 March, &quot;Wright&quot; soon commenced a rigorous schedule of air defense drills and gunnery practice while acting as a qualification carrier for hundreds of student pilots at the Naval Air Training Base, relieving &quot;Saipan&quot;. &quot;Wright&quot; would embark on 40 operational cruises—each of between one and four days&#x27; duration off the Florida coast. In addition, the carrier embarked a total of 1,081 naval reservists and trained them in a series of three two-week duty tours.

On 3 September 1947, &quot;Wright&quot; embarked 48 Midshipmen for temporary training duty and later welcomed 62 Army officers when she stood out to sea on 15 October, in company with to let her guests observe flight operations in the Pensacola area. The exercises included the catapulting of Grumman F6F Hellcats for rocket-firing operations.

That exercise was her last prior to her departure from Pensacola on 24 October, to return north. She arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard soon thereafter and from 1 November to 17 December, underwent post-shakedown repairs and alterations before she returned to Pensacola two days before Christmas, where she resumed her regular schedule of pilot qualification training under the operational control of the Chief of Naval Air Training, Commander Air Atlantic. &quot;Wright&quot; spent the year 1948 engaged in those pilot carrier qualification operations, before she put into the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 26 January 1949, to commence a four-month overhaul. She was relieved as training carrier by .
Following refresher training in Cuban waters, &quot;Wright&quot; returned to Norfolk on 1 August 1949, and four days later shifted to Newport, Rhode Island, for two weeks of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training in the Narragansett Bay area with submarines and destroyers. She also visited New York City before taking up a steady schedule of carrier qualifications, air defense tactics, and exercises out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island, Key West, and Pensacola. But for 10 days of maneuvers with the 2d Task Fleet from 21 to 31 October 1949, she continued that duty until 7 January 1951, when she embarked the last increment of personnel from Fighter Squadron 14 (VF-14) for temporary duty.

==Service with 6th Fleet==
&quot;Wright&quot; sailed from Norfolk, on 11 January 1951, with a fast carrier task group and reached Gibraltar on 21 January, for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. &quot;Wright&#x27;s&quot; first Mediterranean deployment took her from Gibraltar to Oran, Algeria. She proceeded thence to Augusta Bay, Sicily; Suda Bay, Crete; Beirut, Lebanon; and Golfe Juan, France—her replenishment and liberty ports during the never-ending cycle of fleet training and readiness exercises with the 6th Fleet. Departing Golfe Juan on 19 March, &quot;Wright&quot; made port at Newport on 31 March 1951.

The carrier later entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and underwent an overhaul there before she took part in Atlantic Fleet maneuvers out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; engaged in ASW tactics and carrier operations in Narragansett Bay, received further repairs at the Boston Naval Shipyard, and participated in a convoy exercise that ran from 25 February to 21 March 1952; and ranged from Newport to waters of the Panama Canal Zone and Trinidad in the British West Indies.

As flagship for Carrier Division 14, &quot;Wright&quot; sailed on 9 June 1952, in company with four destroyers forming Task Group (TG) 81.4 for ASW operations along the Atlantic seaboard until 27 June, when the ships arrived at New York City. Returning to Quonset Point on 1 July, &quot;Wright&quot; trained units of the organized Naval Reserve concurrently with hunter–killer tactics and pilot training in operations out of Narragansett Bay until 26 August. On that day, she set course from Quonset Point and later rendezvoused with Vice Admiral Felix Stump&#x27;s 2d Task Fleet en route to northern Europe for combined defense exercises and maneuvers with naval units of other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) navies.

En route, &quot;Wright&quot;, escorted by &quot;Forrest Royal&quot;, was detached to ferry men and gear of Marine Night Fighter Squadron (VMF(N)) 114 to Port Lyautey, Morocco, an operation she completed on 4 September. Two days later, &quot;Wright&quot; and her escort rejoined the task force; and they reached the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, on 10 September.

Three days later, &quot;Wright&quot; put to sea with two British destroyers acting as her plane guard for NATO Operation Mainbrace. She conducted air defense maneuvers and tactics evolutions with the British carriers and en route to Rotterdam, Netherlands, where the force arrived on 25 September. On 29 September, &quot;Wright&quot; departed Rotterdam, bound for the United States, and arrived at Newport on 9 October.

That day, she embarked Rear Admiral W. L. Erdman, Commander, Carrier Division 4, and spent the next few months engaged in carrier qualification duties in waters ranging from Newport to the Virginia Capes, before she began her second deployment to the Mediterranean. She reached Golfe Juan on 21 February 1953, and operated with the 6th Fleet until 31 March, when she sailed for home, via the Azores.

&quot;Wright&quot; returned to Newport, and after a rigorous schedule of training in Narragansett Bay, sailed on 5 May, for the Gulf of Mexico. During that training cruise, she visited Houston, Texas, where she hosted some 14,000 visitors on 16 and 17 May. Returning to Quonset Point on 28 May, &quot;Wright&quot; operated locally for another month before shifting south for a stint of operations out of Mayport, Florida.

==Service with 7th Fleet==

&quot;Wright&quot; was overhauled at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 31 July to 21 November 1953, and then conducted refresher training in Cuban waters from 4 January to 16 February 1954. Next, after departing Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 5 April, &quot;Wright&quot; sailed for Norfolk, Virginia where she took on necessary stores and supplies in preparation for her transfer to the Pacific Fleet. On 20 April, &quot;Wright&quot; set sail for the Western Pacific via the Panama Canal; San Diego, California; and Pearl Harbor—and reached United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, on 28 May. The carrier, with Marine Attack Squadron 211 embarked, operated with the 7th Fleet off both coasts of Korea and also off Okinawa before she visited Hong Kong from 24 to 30 September. Departing Yokosuka on 15 October, &quot;Wright&quot; arrived at San Diego on the last day of October and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where she remained until 23 February 1955.

At that point, &quot;Wright&quot; was attached to CarDiv 17, Pacific Fleet, and operated locally out of San Diego until 3 May, when she put to sea as part of TG 7.3—formed around the flagship —for the atomic test, Operation Wigwam, carried out in Pacific waters. Returning to the West Coast on 20 May, &quot;Wright&quot; subsequently cruised to Pearl Harbor briefly before she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 14 July to commence preparation for inactivation. After shifting to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, on 17 October, for the final phase of preservation for inactivation, &quot;Wright&quot; was decommissioned at Puget Sound on 15 March 1956, and assigned to the Bremerton group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

==Reclassification==
During her time in reserve, &quot;Wright&quot; was reclassified on 15 May 1959, an auxiliary aircraft transport, AVT-7. However, she never served in that role but remained inactive until 15 March 1962, when she was taken to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for conversion to a command ship and reclassified as CC-2. The conversion—which lasted a year—included extensive alterations to enable the ship to function as a fully equipped mobile command post afloat for top-echelon commands and staff for strategic direction of area or worldwide military operations. Facilities were built into the ship for worldwide communications and rapid automatic exchange, processing, storage, and display of command data. A portion of the former hangar deck space was utilized for special command spaces and the extensive electronics equipment required, while a major portion of the flight deck was utilized for specially designed communications antenna arrays. In addition, facilities were provided to enable the ship to operate three helicopters.

Recommissioned at Puget Sound on 11 May 1963, Capt. John L. Arrington II, in command, &quot;Wright&quot; (CC-2) operated locally on trials and training evolutions in the waters off the Pacific Northwest until 3 September, when she departed Seattle and proceeded to San Diego, which she reached three days later. For the next three weeks, the ship trained in nearby waters before she returned to Puget Sound on 30 September to commence her post-shakedown availability.

Following those repairs and alterations—which took up all of the month of October and most of November—&quot;Wright&quot; prepared to shift to her new home port, Norfolk. She departed Seattle on 26 November, stopped briefly at San Diego three days later to embark civilian engineers and personnel who were to conduct surveys of communications and-air conditioning equipment, and was steaming south off the coast of northern Mexico when she picked up a distress message from the Israeli merchantman , on 1 December. &quot;Wright&quot; altered course and rendezvoused with &quot;Velos&quot; later that same day. The command ship&#x27;s medical officer was flown across to the Israeli ship and treated a seaman suffering from kidney stones. The medical officer was then flown back to &quot;Wright&quot;. Upon completion of that mission of mercy, &quot;Wright&quot; resumed her voyage to Balboa.

Transiting the Panama Canal on 7 and 8 December, &quot;Wright&quot; steamed via St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and moored at the Hampton Roads Army Terminal on 18 December. After a subsequent brief operational period off the Virginia Capes, &quot;Wright&quot; entered port on 21 December, and remained there through Christmas and New Year&#x27;s.

==NECPA duties==
For the next six years, &quot;Wright&quot; operated out of Norfolk, training to perform her assigned mission as the National Emergency Command Post Afloat. Regular overhauls performed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard saw the ship receiving the repairs and alterations that continually improved her capabilities to carry out her task. She operated primarily off the Virginia Capes, but ranged as far north as Bar Harbor, Maine, and as far south as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay. Her other ports of call included Newport, Quonset Point, Jacksonville, Mayport, Fort Lauderdale and Port Everglades, Florida; Boston; Portsmouth; New York City; Atlantic City; Annapolis; Philadelphia; Little Creek; Norfolk; and Guantánamo Bay. As part of NECPA duties, she alternated on alert status with .

There were highlights and breaks from the cycle of periods in port and at sea. From 11 to 14 April 1967, &quot;Wright&quot; lay at anchor off the coast of Uruguay, providing a worldwide communications capability in support of President Lyndon B. Johnson as he attended the Latin American summit conference at Punta del Este. On 8 May 1968, &quot;Wright&quot; went to the aid of after that amphibious assault ship had suffered a machinery failure and had gone dead in the water, south of Norfolk. &quot;Wright&quot; towed the helpless assault ship before other ships arrived on the scene to help out. Later that same year, &quot;Wright&quot; received the coveted Captain Edward F. Ney Memorial Award in the large mess afloat category. That award is given annually to the ship that maintains the highest food standards. During the &quot;Pueblo&quot; crisis in February 1969, &quot;Wright&quot;, while en route to Port Everglades, Florida, was hurriedly recalled to Norfolk and, upon her arrival there, stood by, on alert.

==Decommissioning==
Ultimately decommissioned on 27 May 1970, &quot;Wright&quot; was placed in reserve at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 1 December 1977, and sold by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping on 1 August 1980.

<doc id="402377" wikidata="Q1515169" url="?curid=402377" title="USS Belleau Wood (CVL-24)">
<text>USS &quot;Belleau Wood was a [[United States Navy]] [[light aircraft carrier]] active during [[World War II]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] from 1943 to 1945. The &quot;Independence&quot; class were ordered as [[light cruiser]]s of the , but during construction, they were converted into light carriers owing to the need for additional vessels of that type during the war. The ship was originally named New Haven&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; after conversion work had begun, after the Battle of Belleau Wood of World War I.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; saw extensive action during World War II, participating in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns in late 1943 and early 1944, and the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944. There, she saw action at the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where her aircraft contributed to the sinking of the Japanese carrier . She fought in the Philippines campaign later that year, and saw action at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Shortly thereafter, she was damaged by a . After repairs, she supported the invasion of Iwo Jima in March 1945 and operations against the Japanese Home Islands. After the war, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet missions before being placed in reserve in 1947.

The ship was loaned to the French in the 1950s and served in the First Indochina War. During this period, she was renamed Bois Belleau, the French equivalent of her original name. The ship was returned to the United States in 1960, but was not retained in US Navy service; she was instead broken up for scrap that same year.

==Design==

The of light carriers came about as a result of a decision made in 1942 to convert a number of light cruisers then under construction. At the time, senior leaders in the US Navy had concluded that no new fleet carriers would enter service before 1944, when the first s would be completed. Therefore, they hoped that converting ships already being built would provide reinforcements for the fleet&#x27;s carrier force. Ironically, was completed in December 1942, two months before entered service.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. Her superstructure consisted of a small island style conning tower on the starboard side of the flight deck. Her crew numbered 1569 officers and enlisted men.

The &quot;Independence&quot;-class carriers were powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Each boiler was vented through its own small funnel, each of which was placed on the starboard side, directly behind the island. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of .

The ship&#x27;s flight deck was long, and it was fitted with two elevators. She carried a total of thirty aircraft, divided into twelve fighters, nine dive bombers, and nine torpedo bombers. For self defense, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; carried an anti-aircraft battery of twenty-four Bofors guns, which were carried in two quadruple and eight twin mounts, along with twenty-two Oerlikon autocannon, all in individual mounts. These guns were primarily distributed along the length of the flight deck, though the quad 40 mm guns were placed on the main deck, on either end of the flight deck.

==Service history==
===United States Navy===
====Construction and initial service====

The keel for &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was laid down on 11 August 1941 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. She was originally ordered as a &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class cruiser under the name &quot;New Haven&quot;, which was to be designated with the hull number CL-76. Starting in January 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered the first of several of the new cruisers to be converted into light carriers, and &quot;New Haven&quot; was among those selected for conversion on 10 February. On 31 March, the ship was renamed &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, after the Battle of Belleau Wood, a major battle fought by the Marine Corps during World War I. She also received an updated hull number: CV-24. The third member of what was now the &quot;Independence&quot; class of light carriers, the ship was launched on 6 December 1942, and after completing fitting out work, the ship, now renamed &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, was commissioned on 31 March 1943.

Beginning in late May, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; got underway for initial training in Chesapeake Bay, before a brief stay at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia. On 8 June, she sailed to begin her shakedown cruise in the West Indies. She stopped in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, on 13 June, and thereafter conducted various training exercises, including damage control practice, flight training, and tactical maneuvers in the Gulf of Paria. She sailed back to the United States in early July, arriving in Philadelphia on 3 July. There, she underwent repairs and modifications to correct issues identified during the shakedown; on 15 July, she also received a new hull number: CVL-24. On 21 July, she departed for the Pacific Ocean, passing through the Panama Canal on 26 July, before meeting her sister ship , the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier , and six escorts in Balboa, Panama. The ships then sailed together for Pearl Harbor on 28 July, arriving there on 9 August. The ship&#x27;s crew spent the following two weeks preparing to join the operation to seize Baker Island.

====Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign====

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was assigned to Task Group (TG) 11.2, which also included &quot;Princeton&quot; and seven escorts. The ships sortied from Pearl Harbor on 25 August, bound for Baker Island, which they reached on 1 September. That day, fighters from &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s combat air patrol (CAP) intercepted and shot down a Japanese Kawanishi H8K flying boat. Over the following two weeks, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and &quot;Princeton&quot; covered ground forces on the island as they constructed an airfield that would be used to support the impending Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. The two light carriers rejoined &quot;Lexington&quot; in mid-September to carry out strikes on Japanese positions in the Gilbert Islands on 18 and 19 September, as part of the preparatory attacks before the Battle of Tarawa. Her CAP also shot down a Mitsubishi G4M bomber that attempted to attack the fleet. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; then returned to Pearl Harbor on 23 September to rearm and refuel, before sailing again to launch a raid on Wake Island on 29 September. For this operation, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was transferred to Task Group 14.5, which included five other carriers. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was primarily occupied with maintaining CAP defense for the fleet, but her air group launched two raids on the island. Two of her Grumman F6F fighters were lost during the raids, one of which was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft guns, and the other crashed on attempting to land. Four deck crewmen were killed in the accident. The ships then returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 October.

The ship spent the next month training off Pearl Harbor as the fleet readied for the invasion of Tarawa and Makin. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, now part of Task Group 50.2, which included her sister and the fleet carrier , sortied on 10 November. The three carriers struck Makin on 19 November, the day before the invasion of Tarawa began, and they continued to support the fighting on the two islands until 26 November, when the last Japanese resistance was defeated. The following day, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; were transferred to Task Group 50.3, which also included &quot;Essex&quot;. The ships of TG 50.3 and TG 50.1 were sent to raid the Marshall Islands, both to weaken Japanese air power in the area and to reconnoiter Kwajalein Atoll, which was the target of the next major amphibious operation in the campaign. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; provided the CAP that defended the task group on 4 December, while the other two carriers struck Kwajalein and Wotje. That evening, in a Japanese counter-attack, a G4M bomber nearly hit &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; with a torpedo that passed some to starboard. &quot;Lexington&quot;, of TG 50.1, was hit by a torpedo in the attack, and the two groups covered the damaged carrier as she withdrew to Pearl Harbor for repairs.

The fleet conducted training operations off Pearl Harbor for the next five weeks, and the ships&#x27; crews replenished fuel and ammunition for the next major operation, which was codenamed Flintlock: the invasion of the Marshall Islands. The fleet left Pearl Harbor on 16 January 1944; for the operation, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; had been transferred to Task Group 58.1, along with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the carrier . The carriers began raids on Japanese airfields on the Kwajalein, Wotje, and the Maloelap Atolls on 29 January to suppress Japanese air power in the area before the invasion. As before, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was primarily occupied with maintaining the CAP for the rest of the task group, but she did launch one raid on Taroa Airfield on the island of Taroa, one of the constituent islands of Maleolap. During that attack, two of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The carriers then transitioned to providing direct support to the soldiers and marines fighting in the Battle of Kwajalein, during which another three of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s planes were shot down.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and the rest of her task group sailed to Majuro to refuel and replenish munitions and other supplies on 4 February. They then returned to Kwajalein to resume operations against the Japanese defenders. The bulk of the Fast Carrier Task Force, including &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, sailed west on 12 February to launch Operation Hailstone, a major attack on the Japanese base in Truk. The raid was intended to cover the next amphibious assault in the campaign, the invasion of Eniwetok. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; once again provided air defense for the task group, and on the afternoon of 16 February, one of her fighters shot down a Nakajima B5N torpedo bomber. Following another series of attacks the next day, the task group withdrew to the east to refuel. The carriers sailed back west to attack Japanese positions on Tinian and Saipan in the Mariana Islands; &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; covered the rest of the carriers as usual. On 22 February, a pair of G4M bombers slipped through the CAP aircraft and attempted to bomb &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, but her anti-aircraft battery shot both planes down before they could hit the ship. In the same attack, a Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter attacked &quot;Essex&quot;, but as it attempted to withdraw, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;&#x27;s guns shot it down as well. Two Kawasaki Ki-48 light bombers were also shot down by &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; fighters.

====Operations in New Guinea====
The fast carrier task force withdrew back to Majuro on 26 February for another period of replenishment and repairs. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; also took on replacement aircraft after her losses in the campaign. Task Group 58.1, which by then included only &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; and their escorts, sailed on 7 March for Espiritu Santo in the south Pacific, which they reached five days later. There, they joined an amphibious assault force that struck the island of Emirau on 20 March. The landing on Emirau went unopposed, permitting TG 58.1 to sail north to strike airfields in the western Caroline Islands and on New Guinea to suppress Japanese air power in the region as other forces landed in Humboldt Bay and Tanahmerah Bay in the Battle of Hollandia. The carriers then steamed north to hit the Carolines again; &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s aircraft targeted Palau on 30 March, and the next day, she launched raids on Yap, Ulithi, and Ngulu. That same day, her fighters shot down two G4M bombers. The ships withdrew on 1 April, and while leaving the area, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; sent her fighters to raid Woleai, destroying seven Japanese aircraft on the ground in the process.

The task group then returned to Majuro for another period of maintenance and resupply, which lasted for about a week. The ships sortied again on 13 April to return to operations in support of the ground troops fighting in Hollandia in New Guinea. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; once again provided air cover to the rest of the carriers as they struck Japanese positions at Sawar, Wakde, and Sarmi. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; refueled at sea on 23 April, then returned to launch raids of her own on Sawar and Sarmi. Task Group 58.1 then got underway for Seeadler Harbor on Manus Island, where they refueled. On 29 April, the fleet carriers raided Truk again, while &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; provided the CAP defense; the same pattern was repeated the following day against Pohnpei in the Carolines. On 1 May, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters swept the island while American battleships bombarded it. The ships departed for Kwajalein that day, arriving there on 4 May. Over the course of the preceding month&#x27;s operations, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; lost one F6F fighter and two TBF Avenger torpedo bombers.

====Marianas campaign====

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and the rest of TG 58.1 then returned to Majuro to rejoin the rest of the fleet as it made preparations for Operation Forager, the invasion of the Mariana Islands in the central Pacific. In the course of the preparations, TG 58.1 was reorganized, and now consisted of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and the carriers and , the latter being a sister to &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;. The fast carrier task force sortied on 6 June to begin the first phase of the operation, a series of large-scale air attacks on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam to suppress Japanese air power in the area. The attacks began five days later, and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; contributed fighters to a raid on Guam, which shot down four Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters over Agana, the capital of Guam. The carrier&#x27;s fighters shot down another Zero and a Kawasaki Ki-45 fighter in a second attack on 12 June, though one of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s F6Fs was also shot down in the engagement. With the initial round of strikes over, the carriers withdrew to refuel on 14 June and then sailed north to strike the Bonin Islands.

The American command hoped that raiding airfields in the Bonins would catch Japanese planes being ferried to reinforce the Marshalls. On 15 June, the American carriers struck Hahajima and Chichijima, though &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters once again filled the CAP role. Her bombers attacked and sank a large cargo ship in the area that day. While attempting to land that evening, one of her F6Fs crashed through the barrier and into the island, starting a major fire. Damage-control parties put out the fire after 23 minutes, and no one was injured in the accident, and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; resumed flight operations the next day. That morning, the carriers sent a group of fighters to raid Iwo Jima, but reports of a Japanese fleet approaching the American invasion fleet in the Marianas led TG 58.1 to cancel a larger raid on the island planned for that afternoon and steam south at high speed to rendezvous with the rest of the fast carrier task force. The American fleet assembled on 18 June at a position about west of Saipan to await the Japanese fleet.

In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Japanese located the American fleet first, allowing them to make the first strike. On the morning of 19 June, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and &quot;Bataan&quot; launched their CAP fighters to defend the task group, but none of the fourteen Japanese attack groups approached TG 58.1. Those groups were all disrupted by fighters from the other American task groups. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; instead sent some of her fighters to sweep Guam again, where they shot down another ten Zero fighters that had been based on the island. The lopsided American victory, which saw some 300 Japanese aircraft destroyed, was dubbed the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. That evening, the Japanese carriers began withdrawing to the west, and on the morning of 20 June, the American carriers turned to pursue them. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; again sent her CAP fighters aloft that morning, but the fleet&#x27;s search planes did not locate the retreating Japanese until late in the day. The American carriers nevertheless launched a major strike, and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; contributed four TBF torpedo bombers and six F6F fighters to the force. The planes sank the Japanese carrier at dusk and then had to make a difficult night landing.

The American fleet continued its pursuit of the retreating Japanese on 21 June, but the latter had too far of a head start, and the Americans soon broke off the chase to return to the invasion beaches. While the fleet steamed to the Marianas, one of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters shot down a G4M bomber. The carriers also reorganized their air groups, as many planes had landed on other carriers in the confused night landing the previous evening. The ships of TG 58.1 detached from the main fleet and steamed north to resume their attacks on the Bonin Islands that had been interrupted by the Battle of the Philippine Sea. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; once again provided the task group&#x27;s fighter defense while the rest of the carriers raided Iwo Jima and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese aircraft on the island. TG 58.1 then departed for the Marshalls to replenish and refuel, and they arrived in Eniwetok on 27 June. The same day, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; left the fleet to return to Pearl Harbor for modifications that included storage for rocket ammunition for her aircraft. She arrived in Hawaii on 2 July, entered the dry dock the next day, and the work was carried out over the following week. She conducted a short training period in Hawaiian waters before departing for the fleet anchorage in the Marshalls on 22 July. She reached Eniwetok on 30 July and joined TG 58.4 on 2 August.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and the rest of the fast carrier task force were then sent to support the invasion of Guam, and the carrier contributed her aircraft to strikes against Japanese positions on the island during the fighting. She returned to Eniwetok on 13 August to refuel and rearm before the last major phase of the Mariana and Palau campaign. The carriers were ordered to raid Japanese airfields on Yap, Mindanao in the southern Philippines, and the Bonin Islands again, to neutralize any aircraft that might attempt to interfere with the invasion of the Palau Islands and Morotai in New Guinea. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; joined &quot;Wasp&quot; and two other carriers in what was now Task Group 38.1, which sortied on 29 August to begin raids on the Palaus. The following day, one of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s F6F fighters crashed on landing, killing three men, including the assistant air operations commander. On 7 August, the carriers began attacking targets in the Palaus, and several of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s planes struck a phosphate plant on Anguar. The task group continued westward to make their attack on Mindanao. While the carriers steamed off the island, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters shot down a Yokosuka P1Y bomber and a Kawasaki Ki-45 fighter, though one of her F6Fs was shot down as well.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters carried out sweeps over the airfields at Buayan and Digos on 10 September, while her TBF Avengers raided the field at Cotabato, though they found few Japanese aircraft to destroy. The task group then turned north to raid the Visayas in the central Philippines, where the ship&#x27;s fighters raided Negros and Cebu, claiming a pair of Zeros, a Nakajima Ki-43 fighter, and a Nakajima B6N torpedo bomber on 12 September. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s aircraft also launched a series of rocket attacks on Japanese installations and coastal shipping in the area. The next day, her fighters destroyed another Ki-43 and a P1Y. TG 38.1 then sailed south to provide cover for the landings on Morotai, where &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters destroyed five G4M bombers and a Ki-45 fighter on the ground. The landing was carried out between 15 and 17 September, but the carriers saw no further significant combat during that period, and on the 18th, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was transferred to TG 38.4; she departed for Seeadler Harbor to refuel and rearm before joining her new unit, which included &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the fleet carrier , and the light carrier . The group left Seeadler Harbor on 24 September to patrol off Palau, remaining there until 5 October because of a typhoon in the area, before rejoining the rest of the fast carrier task force west of the Marianas.

====Philippines campaign====

The American fleet then began operations to prepare for its next major amphibious assault in the central Pacific: the invasion of the Philippines. After refueling at sea on 7 October, the fast carrier task force got underway to begin a series of raids on nearby targets that would try to interfere with the coming invasion, beginning with the Ryukyu Islands. Three days later, the carriers raided airfields on Okinawa and two other islands in the group, destroying dozens of Japanese aircraft and many coastal ships. The carriers then turned south, struck airfields on Luzon in the northern Philippines, before turning west to raid the island of Formosa. In the course of the so-called Formosa Air Battle, which lasted from 12 to 16 October, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; carried out a series of raids against Japanese infrastructure on the island, claiming to have destroyed five aircraft in strikes on airfields. Her fighters on CAP also shot down three Zeros, a Ki-43 fighter, and five G4M bombers that attempted to hit the carriers on 13 October. Later that day, another six G4Ms slipped through the CAP aircraft, but &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s anti-aircraft guns assisted with the destruction of four of the bombers.

The ships of TG 38.4 turned south on 14 October to begin preparatory attacks on Leyte, which was the target of the impending amphibious assault. The carrier planes raided airfields at Aparri on the island of Luzon first, and then struck targets around Manila Bay as they made their way south to Leyte. In the course of these raids, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters claimed another eleven Japanese aircraft of various types. They also claimed a pair of cargo ships and an oil tanker. The Battle of Leyte began on 20 October, and over the following three days, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; provided CAP over the invasion beach.

In response to the American invasion of the Philippines, the Japanese sent four major fleet units to attack the invasion fleet in a synchronized action. The ensuing action, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, consisted of a series of separate battles between American and Japanese forces. TG 38.4 launched search planes on the morning of 24 October to try to locate the Japanese fleet in the Visaya islands; after locating the Japanese Center Force, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and the other carriers launched a major attack on it, which resulted in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. In that action, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s TBFs claimed to have made torpedo hits on one of the Japanese battleships. Later that evening, Halsey received reports of the aircraft carriers of the Northern Force, and the fast carrier task force steamed north to intercept them. The following morning, all four Japanese carriers were sunk in the Battle off Cape Engaño, though &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; did not contribute any aircraft to their destruction. Her TBFs did assist with the sinking of the light cruiser , however. A separate action fought between surface forces—the Battle of Surigao Strait—saw the destruction of the Southern Force on the night of 24–25 October. Center Force, not dissuaded from its attacks the previous day, pressed on and nearly broke through to the invasion fleet in the Battle off Samar, but was eventually driven off by the escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts providing local defense to the fleet.

The ships of TG 38.4 refueled on 26 October and then returned to direct support of the soldiers fighting on Leyte for the next four days. The carriers also struck airfields around Manila to interdict reinforcements being sent to the Philippines. The Japanese began the first suicide attacks in response to the worsening strategic situation; the first struck the carrier on 29 October, and another attack was carried out the next day. At around 14:00, five slipped past the CAP defense by flying at an altitude of around . Three of the planes were shot down by the fleet&#x27;s antiaircraft fire, but one crashed into &quot;Franklin&quot;; the last plane, identified as a Zero fighter, dropped a bomb on &quot;Franklin&quot; before diving on &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; at 14:27 and slamming into her flight deck. The Zero landed in the middle of eleven loaded F6F fighters and started a series of explosions and serious fires. The damage control teams worked for three hours to suppress the blaze. The attack killed 92 and wounded another 97, and damaged the flight deck, which prevented further air operations. The ship detached from the fleet and sailed east to the Caroline Islands.

While stopped at Ulithi from 3 to 10 November, the ship&#x27;s crew made some temporary repairs, before she departed for San Francisco for permanent repairs. She passed through Pearl Harbor on the way, finally arriving on the West Coast on 29 November. There, she was dry docked at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard the following day. Along with repair work, the ship was overhauled and additional 40 mm Bofors guns were installed. The work was completed by mid-January 1945, and she thereafter got underway to rejoin the fleet. She reached Ulithi on 7 February, where she joined TG 58.1, which included &quot;Hornet&quot;, &quot;Wasp&quot;, and the fleet carrier .

====Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign====

On 10 February, the ships of TG 58.1 sortied to carry out a series of strikes against Japanese positions in the Japanese Home Islands to disrupt forces that would interfere with the planned invasions of the Bonin and Ryukyu Islands in the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign, which was to prepare the way for the eventual invasion of Japan. By 16 February, TG 58.1 had reached a position about southeast of Tokyo, and they began their attacks on airfields in Japan. The American carrier planes claimed several hundred Japanese aircraft destroyed in these raids. That morning, one of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters on CAP shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-46 reconnaissance plane that approached the fleet. Poor weather forced the remaining planned attacks to be canceled, and the fast carrier task force instead sailed south to provide cover for the invasion of Iwo Jima on 19 February.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; provided air defense over Iwo Jima for the following five days to prevent Japanese aircraft from supporting the garrison as US marines fought for control of the island. Her aircraft also raided the airfield at Susaki on Chichi Jima to reduce Japanese counterattacks on the invasion force. The Japanese were mounting increasingly severe attacks on the fleet, so the fast carrier task force sailed north to launch another major raid on the Tokyo area. They were again blocked by bad weather on 25 February, and they instead diverted to raid Okinawa. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters once again provided CAP defense, and her TBFs were used to carry out rocket attacks on Japanese installations on Okinawa on 1 March. The fleet then sailed south to replenish stores and ammunition at Ulithi to prepare for the next phase of the campaign.

The ships lay at Ulithi for ten days, until 14 March, when they sortied to begin preparatory attacks for the last major invasion of the war: the invasion of Okinawa. TG 58.1 was ordered to attack Japanese airfields on Kyushu, the southern-most of the Home Islands, to reduce the considerable air power assembled for the final defense of Japan. Four days later, the ships were in position and launched a large-scale raid on the island, along with secondary raids on the naval bases at Kure and Kobe. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters again served in the CAP for the following three days and saw extensive combat. On 21 March alone, her aircraft and eight fighters from &quot;Hornet&quot; claimed the destruction of twenty-one Japanese planes between them. The carriers then turned their attention to Okinawa itself from 23 to 28 March, and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters conducted sweeps over the Ryukyus to catch any Japanese aircraft that may be in the area. On 29 March, she contributed her aircraft to a major raid on Kyushu airfields in concert with Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers flying from the Mariana Islands. She thereafter resumed strikes on Okinawa.

American forces went ashore on Okinawa on 1 April, and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; provided air defense over the invasion fleet. She also provided close air support to the marines fighting their way across the island. On 6 April, a Zero fighter attempted to crash into the ship, but her antiaircraft guns shot it down before it could collide with the ship. The shock wave from the underwater explosion of the sinking Zero threw one man overboard, who was not recovered. The next day, the ship took part in the destruction of the battleship , which had been sent on a final suicide mission to attack the invasion fleet. Aircraft from &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; claimed hits on several of the destroyers escorting &quot;Yamato&quot;; carrier aircraft from the American fleet sank most of the Japanese ships, including &quot;Yamato&quot;.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; resumed air operations over Okinawa, both to defend the fleet and ground forces from Japanese air attack, and to degrade Japanese airfields on nearby islands. Over the course of the following three weeks, the ship&#x27;s fighters destroyed fourteen Japanese aircraft. She thereafter withdrew to Ulithi to refuel and rearm. She arrived there on 30 April, but arrived back on station off Okinawa by 12 May. There, she replaced the carrier in TG 58.3, which had been badly damaged by a . The unit at that time also included &quot;Essex&quot;, the fleet carrier , and the light carrier . &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; resumed her previous activities, her fighters patrolling over Okinawa and attacking Japanese airfields in the region. During this period, her fighters shot down a Nakajima Ki-84 fighter and a G4M bomber, though one of her TBFs was shot down by antiaircraft fire. By early June, the onset of typhoon season forced the carriers to halt flight operations, though &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was able to launch one raid on 7 June. On 10 June, the fast carrier task force withdrew to the Philippines to avoid the severe weather.

====Japan campaign and the end of the war====

The carriers spent the next two weeks in the Philippines training and making repairs, before departing on 1 July to return to operations off Japan. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s aircraft participated in a strike on airfields near Tokyo on 10 July, followed by attacks on various targes on Hokkaido on 14 and 15 July. The carriers returned to attacking the Tokyo area two days later before breaking off to refuel at sea from 19 to 23 July. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s aircraft next raided the naval base at Kur on 24 July, where they assisted in the sinking of the hybrid battleship-carrier and another fifteen smaller vessels. On 25 July, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s fighters were attacked by a group of Japanese fighters while over Yōkaichi, and in the ensuing battle, the Americans claimed to have shot down five Ki-84s and two Ki-61s, and lost two fighters to the Japanese. Further attacks were cancelled due to bad weather for most of the rest of the month, until 29 July, when &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; and the other carriers launched another series of raids then and on 30 July. The ships then withdrew to refuel again, and coupled with another typhoon, the carriers were not back on station again to resume air attacks until 9 August. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;″s aircraft struck airfields on the northern end of Honshu, which disrupted a Japanese strike on the Marianas using long-range bombers. Operations around Tokyo resumed on 13 August, and two days later, a patrol of four F6Fs from &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; engaged a group of Japanese fighters that had attempted to intercept a strike of TBFs operated by the British Pacific Fleet. In that action, the American fighters shot down five Zeroes and a Ki-43 fighter; this was to be the ship&#x27;s last action of the war. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese indicated they would surrender, leading to a cessation of all combat missions.

&quot;Belleau Wood&quot; cruised for the next week in Japanese waters, waiting on instructions for the final Japanese surrender. From 22 August to 10 September, the ship&#x27;s aircraft patrolled over Japan, searching for downed aircrew and dropping supplies to prisoner of war camps. Over the course of her career during the war, the ship received twelve battle stars. On 10 September, she entered Tokyo Bay for maintenance, before departing on the 15th for Eniwetok to take on a load of supplies to bring back to Japan. She arrived off Japan on 7 October, and proceeded to Tokyo Bay, which she reached five days later. After embarking several hundred men, she departed again on 20 October, this time bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving there eight days later. &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was then assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of thousands of American servicemen after the end of the war. Her crew installed some 600 additional bunks in the hangar to accommodate additional passengers. On her first mission, she took on 1,248 men from the Army and Navy, departing on 1 November and arriving in San Francisco five days later. She made two further Magic Carpet trips, the first to Guam from 11 November to 10 December and carrying 2,053 men home, and the second from 18 December to 31 January 1946, also to Guam. The ship was thereafter placed in reserve at San Francisco. She underwent modifications through 1946 and into 1947 and was eventually decommissioned on 13 January 1947 and placed at the Alameda Naval Air Station.

===French Navy===
The ship remained laid up until 5 September 1953, when she was transferred to the French Navy as aid according to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. During this period, she was renamed . The French, then at the height of the First Indochina War, was in need of additional aircraft carriers to support the two light carriers— (formerly ), and (formerly HMS &quot;Colossus&quot;)—then operating off French Indochina. The loan of &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; was ordered by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The French Navy initially had trouble putting together a crew to man the ship, which delayed her delivery to France until December. In addition, her boilers were found to be in poor condition upon her reactivation, which required repairs once she arrived in France.

&quot;Bois Belleau&quot; arrived in southeast Asian waters on 30 April 1954, during the final stages of the Indochina War. The Battle of Dien Bien Phu had reached a critical stage by that point, and the French garrison soon surrendered on 7 May. The French carriers operated in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Indochina War, and their aircraft were hampered by the long flight time to Dien Bien Phu in western Indochina.} &quot;Bois Belleau&quot; served in the area until November 1955. For the rest of the 1950s, &quot;Bois Belleau&quot;, &quot;La Fayette&quot;, and &quot;Arromanches&quot; formed the core of the French carrier fleet until the French-built carriers of the were completed in the early 1960s.

In June 1957, &quot;Bois Belleau&quot; joined a contingent of six ships to participate in an international naval review held in Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the United States. The French squadron, led by the anti-aircraft cruiser , was the largest foreign delegation to the review. The squadron also included the destroyers and and the frigates and .

The French Navy returned the ship to the United States in early September 1960 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October, and was sold to ship breakers for scrap on 21 November.

<text>USS &quot;Cowpens&quot; (CV-25/CVL-25/AVT-1), nicknamed &quot;The Mighty Moo&quot;, was an 11,000-ton light aircraft carrier that served the United States Navy from 1943 to 1947.

&quot;Cowpens&quot;, named for the Battle of Cowpens of the Revolutionary War, was launched on 17 January 1943 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, in Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Bradford Spruance (née Halsey, daughter of Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey Jr.) and commissioned on 28 May 1943 by Captain R. P. McConnell. She was reclassified CVL-25 on 15 July 1943. &quot;Cowpens&quot; completed her active service at the end of 1946.

==Service history==

===World War II===

====1943====
Departing Philadelphia, on 29 August 1943, &quot;Cowpens&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 19 September to begin the active and distinguished war career which was to earn her a Navy Unit Commendation. She sailed with Task Force 14 for the strike on Wake Island on 5–6 October, then returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for strikes on the Marshall Islands preliminary to invasion. The ship was slightly damaged on 18 October in a collision with the destroyer while patrolling near Hawaii. &quot;Abbot&quot; was much more heavily damaged, requiring three months to repair at Pearl Harbor. &quot;Cowpens&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor 10 November to launch air strikes on Mille and Makin atolls from 19 to 24 November, and Kwajalein and Wotje on 4 December, returning to her base on 9 December.

====1944====
Joining Task Force 58, &quot;Cowpens&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on 16 January 1944 for the invasion of the Marshalls. Her planes pounded Kwajalein and Eniwetok the last three days of the month to prepare for the assault landing on 31 January. Using Majuro as a base, the force struck at Truk on 16–17 February and the Mariana Islands on 21–22 February before putting into Pearl Harbor on 4 March. Returning to Majuro, Task Force 58 based here for attacks on the western Carolines; &quot;Cowpens&quot; supplied air and antisubmarine patrols during the raids on Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai from 30 March to 1 April. After operating off New Guinea during the invasion of Hollandia from 21 to 28 April, &quot;Cowpens&quot; took part in the strikes on Truk, Satawan and Ponape from 29 April to 1 May, returning to Majuro on 14 May for training.

From 6 June to 10 July 1944, &quot;Cowpens&quot; operated in the Marianas operation. Her planes struck the island of Saipan to aid the assault troops, and made supporting raids on Iwo Jima, Pagan Island, Rota, and Guam. They also took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June, accounting for a number of the huge tally of enemy planes downed. After a brief overhaul at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Cowpens&quot; rejoined the fast carrier task force at Eniwetok on 17 August. Then, on 29 August, she sailed for the pre-invasion strikes on the Palaus, whose assault was an essential preliminary for the return to the Philippines. From 13 to 17 September, she was detached from the force to cover the landings on Morotai, then rejoined it for sweep, patrol, and attack missions against Luzon from 21 to 24 September.

&quot;Cowpens&quot;, with her task group, sent air strikes to neutralize Japanese bases on Okinawa and Formosa from 10 to 14 October, and when and were hit by torpedoes, &quot;Cowpens&quot; provided air cover for their safe withdrawal, rejoining her task group on 20 October. En route to Ulithi, she was recalled when the Japanese Fleet threatened the Leyte invasion, and during the Battle of Surigao Strait phase of the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf on 25–26 October, provided combat air patrol for the ships pursuing the fleeing remnant of the Japanese fleet. Continuing her support of the Philippines advance, &quot;Cowpens&quot;&#x27; planes struck Luzon repeatedly during December. During the disastrous Typhoon Cobra on 18 December, &quot;Cowpens&quot; lost a man: ship&#x27;s air officer Lieutenant Commander Robert Price, several planes, and some equipment, but skillful work by her crew prevented major damage, and she reached Ulithi safely on 21 December to repair her storm damage.

====1945====

From 30 December 1944 to 26 January 1945, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was at sea for the Lingayen Gulf landings. Her planes struck targets on Formosa, Luzon, the Indochinese coast and the Hong Kong-Canton area and Okinawa during January. On 10 February, &quot;Cowpens&quot; sortied from Ulithi for the Iwo Jima operation, striking the Tokyo area, supporting the initial landings from 19 to 22 February, and hitting Okinawa on 1 March.

On 13 June, following an overhaul at San Francisco and training at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Cowpens&quot; sailed on for San Pedro Bay, Leyte. Along the way she struck Wake Island on 20 June. Rejoining Task Force 58, &quot;Cowpens&quot; sailed from San Pedro Bay on 1 July to join in the final raids on the Japanese mainland. Her planes pounded Tokyo, Kure, and other cities of Hokkaidō and Honshū until 15 August. &quot;Cowpens&quot; was the first American carrier to enter Tokyo Harbor. Remaining off Tokyo Bay until the occupation landings began on 30 August, &quot;Cowpens&quot; launched photographic reconnaissance missions to patrol airfields and shipping movements, and to locate and supply prisoner-of-war camps. Men from &quot;Cowpens&quot; were the first Americans to set foot on the Japanese mainland, and were largely responsible for the emergency activation of Yokosuka airfield for Allied use and the liberation of a POW camp near Niigata. From 8 November 1945 to 28 January 1946 &quot;Cowpens&quot; made two voyages to Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Okinawa to return veterans on &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; runs.

===Post-war===
On 3 December 1946, &quot;Cowpens&quot; was placed in commission reserve at Mare Island. On 15 May 1959, she was reclassified as an aircraft transport, with a new hull number, AVT-1. Then, on 1 November, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap.

==Awards==
In addition to her Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Cowpens&quot; received 12 battle stars for World War II service.

==Commemoration==
Each year, the town of Cowpens, South Carolina, holds a 4-day festival honoring veterans of &quot;Cowpens&quot;. &quot;The Mighty Moo Festival&quot; was first held in 1977, with one crewmember of CVL-25 attending. Since then, as many as 115 CVL-25 veterans have attended the festival at once. Also, since the launch and commissioning of the in 1991, the festival has included actively serving crewmen or women of CG-63 sent by the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, as well as previously serving veterans of CG 63. The festival is held from Wednesday through Saturday preceding Father&#x27;s Day each June. During the 1980s, the town of Cowpens, South Carolina, actively petitioned Congress to name another ship &quot;Cowpens&quot;, which may have played a direct role in choosing this name for CG-63.

<text>USS &quot;Monterey&quot; (CVL-26) was an light aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, in service during World War II and used in training for several years thereafter.

Originally laid down as light cruiser Dayton&quot; (CL-78)on 29 December 1941 by [[New York Shipbuilding]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], the ship was reclassifiedCV-26on 27 March 1942 and renamed Monterey&quot; four days later, launched on 28 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Patrick N. L. Bellinger, and commissioned on 17 June 1943, Captain Lestor T. Hundt in command. It was the third US Navy vessel to be named after the Battle of Monterey. Future U.S. President Gerald R. Ford served aboard the ship during World War II.

==Service history==

===World War II===
&quot;Monterey&quot; was reclassified CVL-26 on 15 July 1943, shortly before commissioning, and after shakedown, departed Philadelphia for the western Pacific. She reached the Gilbert Islands on 19 November 1943, in time to help secure Makin Island. She took part in strikes on Kavieng, New Ireland on 25 December, as part of Task Group 37.2 (TG 37.2), and supported the landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 8 February 1944. The light carrier then operated with Task Force 58 (TF 58) during raids in the Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, northern New Guinea, and the Bonin Islands from February–July 1944. During this time she was also involved in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June.

&quot;Monterey&quot; then sailed to Pearl Harbor for overhaul, departing once again on 29 August. She launched strikes against Wake Island on 3 September, then joined TF 38 and participated in strikes in the southern Philippines and the Ryukyus. October through December 1944 were spent in the Philippines, supporting first the Leyte, and then the Mindoro landings.

Though enemy planes had been unable to damage &quot;Monterey&quot;, she did not complete her first full year of service unscathed. In December, she steamed into the path of Typhoon Cobra, with winds over . At the height of the storm, which lasted two days, several planes tore loose from their cables, causing several fires on the hangar deck. During the storm future US President Gerald Ford, who served on board the ship, was almost swept overboard. Ford, serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck, was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship&#x27;s crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.

&quot;Monterey&quot; arrived Bremerton, Washington, for overhaul in January 1945. She rejoined TF 58 and supported Okinawa operations by launching strikes against Nansei Shoto and Kyūshū from 9 May to 1 June. She rejoined TF 38 for the final strike against Honshū and Hokkaidō from 1 July to 15 August.

===Post-War===
&quot;Monterey&quot; departed Japanese waters on 7 September, having embarked troops at Tokyo, and steamed home, arriving in New York City on 17 October. &quot;Monterey&quot; left behind an impressive and enviable war record. Her planes sank five enemy warships, and damaged others. She was responsible for the destruction of thousands of tons of Japanese shipping, hundreds of planes, and vital industrial complexes. She was assigned &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty, and made several voyages between Naples and Norfolk. She was decommissioned on 11 February 1947, and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Philadelphia Group.

===Korea===
With the outbreak of hostilities in the Korean War, &quot;Monterey&quot; was recommissioned on 15 September 1950. She departed Norfolk on 3 January 1951, and proceeded to Pensacola, Florida, where she operated for the next four years under Naval Training Command, training thousands of naval aviation cadets, student pilots, and helicopter trainees. &quot;Monterey&quot; was relieved as a training carrier by , which had previously served at Pensacola as a training carrier between 1946 and 1947. From 1 to 11 October 1954, she took part in a flood rescue mission in Honduras. She departed Pensacola on 9 June 1955 and steamed to rejoin the reserve fleet. She was decommissioned on 16 January 1956. Reclassified AVT-2 on 15 May 1959, she remained berthed at Philadelphia until she was sold for scrapping in May 1971.

==Awards==
&quot;Monterey&quot; received 11 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>USS &quot;Cabot&quot; (CVL-28/AVT-3) was an light aircraft carrier in the United States Navy, the second ship to carry the name, after the explorer John Cabot. &quot;Cabot&quot; was commissioned in 1943 and served until 1947. She was recommissioned as a training carrier from 1948 to 1955. From 1967 to 1989, she served in Spain as . After attempts to preserve her failed, she was scrapped in 2002.

USS &quot;Cabot&quot; was laid down as &quot;Wilmington&quot; (CL-79), a light cruiser, redesignated CV-28 on 2 June 1942, renamed &quot;Cabot&quot; on 23 June 1942 and converted while building. She was launched on 4 April 1943 by New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. A. C. Read. She was reclassified CVL-28 on 15 July 1943 and commissioned on 24 July 1943, with Captain Malcolm Francis Schoeffel in command.

==Service history==

===United States===

====World War II (1943–1945)====

&quot;Cabot&quot; sailed from Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island with Air Group 31 aboard, on 8 November 1943 for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 2 December. Clearing for Majuro on 15 January 1944, she joined TF 58 to begin the consistently high quality of war service which was to earn her a Presidential Unit Citation. From 4 February to 4 March 1944, she launched her planes in strikes on Roi, Namur, and the island stronghold of Truk, aiding in the neutralization of these Japanese bases as her part in the invasion of the Marshalls.

&quot;Cabot&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for a brief repair period, but was back in action from Majuro for the pounding raids on the Palaus, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai at the close of March 1944. She sailed to provide valuable air cover for the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) operation from 22 to 25 April, and 4 days later began to hurl her air power at Truk, Satawan, and Ponape. She cleared Majuro again on 6 June for the preinvasion air strikes in the Mariana Islands, and on 19 and 20 June launched sorties in the key Battle of the Philippine Sea, the famous &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, which hopelessly crippled Japanese naval aviation. &quot;Cabot&quot;″s Air Group 31 pounded Japanese bases on Iwo Jima, Pagan, Rota, Guam, Yap and Ulithi as the carrier continued her support of the Marianas operation until 9 August.

Preinvasion strikes in the Palaus in September 1944 along with air attacks on Mindanao, the Visayas, and Luzon paved the way for the long-awaited return to the Philippines. On 6 October, Air Group 29 relieved Air Group 31, and &quot;Cabot&quot; sailed from Ulithi for raids on Okinawa to provide air cover for her task group during the heavy enemy attacks off Formosa on 12 and 13 October. Cabot joined the group which screened &quot;Cripple Division 1&quot;, and which had been torpedoed off Formosa, to the safety of the Carolines, then rejoined her group for continued air strikes on the Visayas, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 25 and 26 October.

&quot;Cabot&quot; remained on patrol off Luzon, conducting strikes in support of operations ashore, and repelling desperate &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. On 25 November, a particularly vicious one occurred. &quot;Cabot&quot; had fought off several &quot;kamikazes&quot; when one, already flaming from hits, crashed the flight deck on the port side, destroying the still-firing 20 mm gun platform, disabling the 40 mm Mounts and a gun director: Another of &quot;Cabot&quot;″s victims crashed close aboard and showered the port side with shrapnel and burning debris. 62 men were killed or wounded but careful training had produced a crew which handled damage control smoothly and coolly. While she continued to maintain her station in formation and operate effectively, temporary repairs were made. On 28 November, she arrived at Ulithi for permanent repairs.

&quot;Cabot&quot; returned to action on 11 December 1944, steaming with the force striking Luzon, Formosa, Indo-China, Hong Kong, and the Nansei Shoto in support of the Luzon operations during the South China Sea raid. From 10 February to 1 March 1945, her planes pounded the Japanese homeland and the Bonins to suppress opposition to the invasion of Iwo Jima. Continued strikes against Kyūshū and Okinawa in March prepared for the invasion of the latter island. After these prolonged, intensive operations, &quot;Cabot&quot; was homeward bound for San Francisco for a much-needed overhaul completed in June.

After refresher training at Pearl Harbor with Air Group 32 aboard, the carrier launched strikes on Wake Island on 1 August while en route to Eniwetok. Here she remained on training duty until the end of the war. Sailing on 21 August, she joined TG 38.3 to support the landings of occupation troops in the Yellow Sea area in September and October. Embarking homeward-bound men at Guam, &quot;Cabot&quot; arrived at San Diego on 9 November, then sailed for the east coast. &quot;Cabot&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia on 11 February 1947.

====Post-War (1948–1955)====
Recommissioned 27 October 1948, Cabot was assigned to the Naval Air Reserve training program. She operated out of Pensacola as a training carrier qualifying carrier-based pilots before being relieved in that role by &quot;Monterey&quot; in 1951. Later, she was reassigned to Quonset Point, on cruises to the Caribbean, and had one tour of duty in European waters from 9 January to 26 March 1952. &quot;Cabot&quot; was again placed out of commission in the reserve fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Yard on 21 January 1955. She was reclassified AVT-3 on 15 May 1959.

===Spanish Navy===

====1967–1989====

In 1967, after over twelve years in &quot;mothballs&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot; was loaned to Spain, in whose navy she served with the name of and was equipped with the AV-8S Matador. The loan was converted to a sale and USS &quot;Cabot&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1972. &quot;Dédalo&quot; was stricken from the Spanish Navy in August 1989 and given to a private organization in the U.S. for conversion to a museum ship.

===Preservation attempts (1990–2002)===

&quot;Cabot&quot; was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 29 June 1990. The ship spent most of the 1990s berthed in New Orleans. The private groups attempting to preserve her as a memorial were unable to pay creditors, and on 10 September 1999 the ship was auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service to Sabe Marine Salvage of Brownsville, Texas. Its designation as a National Historic Landmark was withdrawn on 7 August 2001. Scrapping of the hulk was completed in 2002.

Her island and stern plate, along with the island of , were obtained for preservation by the Texas Air Museum, at Rio Hondo, Texas. However, that museum subsequently closed, and &quot;Cabot&quot;″s island was demolished. &quot;Cabot&quot;″s stern plate is on display at the Texas Air Museum, at Slaton, Texas. The National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola constructed a replica of &quot;Cabot&quot;″s island using original plans, along with a reconstructed section of flight deck.

The USS &quot;Lexington&quot; aircraft museum in Corpus Christi, Texas, has a large collection of items from &quot;Cabot&quot;, including all the guns and the anchor. A museum room contains information, artifacts, and pictures of &quot;Cabot&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Bataan&quot; (CVL-29/AVT-4), originally planned as USS &quot;Buffalo&quot; (CL-99) and also classified as CV-29, was an 11,000 ton light aircraft carrier which was commissioned in the United States Navy during World War II on 17 November 1943. Serving in the Pacific Theatre for the rest of the war, taking part in operations around New Guinea, the Invasion of the Mariana Islands, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Battle of Okinawa, and attacks on the Japanese home islands. After World War II&#x27;s end she was converted into an anti-submarine carrier and placed in reserve on 11 February 1947.

She was reactivated on 13 May 1950 at Philadelphia in order to participate in the Korean War. After the war she returned to Pearl Harbor, and reported for a preinactivation overhaul on 26 August 1953. After moving to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, &quot;Bataan&quot; was decommissioned on 9 April 1954 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Francisco. Although she was reclassified an auxiliary aircraft transport and redesignated AVT-4 on 15 May 1959, her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1959. She was sold to Nicolai Joffe Corp., Beverly Hills, California, on 19 June 1961 for scrapping.

==Design and construction==

The vessel that eventually became the light aircraft carrier &quot;Bataan&quot; was originally planned as the &quot;Buffalo&quot; (CL-99). Following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the need for more carriers became urgent. In response, the Navy ordered the conversion of nine &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers then under construction to completion as light aircraft carriers. These became known as the s. Thus, CL-99 was reclassified CV-29 and renamed &quot;Bataan&quot; on 2 June 1942. She was further reclassified as CVL-29 on 15 July 1943.

&quot;Bataan&quot; displaced light and at full load. She had an overall length of and a waterline length of . Her extreme beam was and her beam at the waterline was . Her draft was maximum. For armament she was equipped with 24 Bofors 40 mm gun and 22 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for anti-aircraft protection. She normally carried 30 aircraft. Her armor consisted of of belt armor, on the decks, and on the conning tower. She was powered by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox steam boilers and General Electric geared turbines producing for her four screws. She had a design speed of and had a range of at . She normally carried a complement of 1569.

The vessel was ordered 16 December 1940 as a light cruiser and reordered as a light aircraft carrier on 2 June 1942. She was laid down on 31 August 1942 and launched on 1 August 1943 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Corinne DeForest Murray, wife of Rear Admiral George D. Murray. She was commissioned on 17 November 1943.

&quot;Bataan&quot; was named after Bataan Peninsula and the Battle of Bataan where American and Filipino troops were besieged by Japanese forces from 24 December 1941 until 9 April 1942 when the remaining 78,000 troops surrendered to avoid unnecessary slaughter.

==Service history==
===World War II===
After fitting out at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, &quot;Bataan&quot; conducted preliminary shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay before sailing to the West Indies on 11 January 1944. Two days later, while en route to Trinidad, she suffered her first loss when a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter crashed into her number 2 stack and burst into flames, killing three crewmen.

Returning to Philadelphia on 14 February, she underwent post-shakedown repairs and inspections until 2 March when she got underway for the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal on 8 March, she arrived in San Diego on the 16th. Two days later, she sailed for Hawaii with her flight and hangar decks full with passengers, aircraft and cargo. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 22 March, she conducted a week of pilot qualification drills in preparation for &quot;forward area deployment&quot;. The warship lost her second aircraft on 31 March when a &quot;Hellcat&quot; crashed the landing barrier and went over the side, although the pilot survived without injury.

&quot;Bataan&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 4 April accompanied by her escorting destroyers and steamed to the Marshall Islands. She arrived at Majuro Atoll on 9 April and reported for duty with the fast carriers of Task Force 58 (TF 58) that same day. On 13 April, she sailed with the carriers , , and the rest of Task Group (TG) 58.1 for air operations against Hollandia, New Guinea (now known as Jayapura). These raids were intended to support American amphibious operations in the Humboldt Bay-Tanahmerah Bay region of New Guinea.

On 21 April, &quot;Bataan&quot; launched five fighter sweeps to attack Japanese aircraft and ground installations on New Guinea. The pilots claimed hits on numerous buildings, flak guns, coastal barges and three aircraft on the ground. Meanwhile, the carrier&#x27;s Combat Air Patrol (CAP) shot down a Mitsubishi G4M1 Betty bomber and a Mitsubishi Ki-21 Sally.

The Task Group then headed north and struck the Japanese base at Truk Lagoon on 29 April. &quot;Bataan&quot; launched a fighter sweep and three bombing raids, with the Grumman/General Motors TBM Avenger torpedo bombers dropping of bombs on the Japanese base. One TBM Avenger was shot down during the attack, but the crew was rescued by submarine , which was engaged in lifeguard duty - patrolling for such survivors during the battle. On 30 April, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s task group turned toward Ponape (now Pohnpei), Caroline Islands; and, the next day, she flew CAP and Anti-Submarine Patrol (ASP) missions over the battleships bombarding that island. The warships then steamed to the Marshall Islands, arriving at Kwajalein lagoon on 4 May.

====Invasion of the Mariana Islands====
&quot;Bataan&quot; moved to Majuro on 14 May for repairs to her forward elevator but local repair crews could not fix the problem. She sailed to Pearl Harbor for repairs and returned to Majuro on 2 June. Once there, &quot;Bataan&quot; began hurried preparations for Operation Forager, the planned invasion of the Marianas. Tasked with neutralizing Japanese airfields in the Marianas, the 15 fleet carriers of TF 58 planned to attack Saipan, Guam, and nearby island groups. They also prepared for a major fleet battle in case the Japanese carriers attempted to interfere.

&quot;Bataan&quot; joined &quot;Hornet&quot;, , and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; in TG 58.1 and put to sea on 6 June. Five days later, &quot;Bataan&quot; launched fighters against the Japanese base on Rota in support of operations against Saipan. One section of four F6F Hellcats flying &quot;rescue submarine cover patrol&quot; near that island shot down three Mitsubishi A6M Zeke carrier fighters without American losses. Another F6F Hellcat, flying CAP over &quot;Bataan&quot;, shot down a Japanese Army Nakajima Ki-49 Helen bomber. That evening, TG 58.1 sailed south toward Guam.

On 12 June, &quot;Bataan&quot; flew CAP and ASP over the task group while the three other carriers launched strikes at Orote air field on Guam. Her F6F Hellcats spotted two Japanese Yokosuka D4Y Judy bombers close to the task group and shot both down. Another attack of Rota on 13 June, &quot;Bataan&quot; aircraft concentrated on bombing Japanese antiaircraft gun positions and Piti Harbor. During recovery operations, a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bomber jumped &quot;Bataan&quot;″s landing barrier and damaged four aircraft. The task group sailed for the Bonin Islands on the evening of 14 June.

The task group was ordered to strike Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima in an effort to catch the airfields full of Japanese aircraft staging to the Marianas, fighter and bomber raids hit the islands on 15 June. Meanwhile, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft, flying CAP and ASP as usual, bombed and heavily damaged the &quot;Tatsutagawa Maru&quot;. On 16 June, after a morning fighter sweep over Iwo Jima, the task group received reports of a large Japanese force closing the Marianas from the Philippines. The planned afternoon strikes on Iwo Jima were canceled and &quot;Bataan&quot;″s task group hurried south to rejoin TF 58.

====Battle of the Philippine Sea====
&quot;Bataan&quot; and her task group rendezvoused with the other three fast carrier groups about noon on 18 June, approximately west of Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, while waiting to hear from dawn search missions, &quot;Bataan&quot; launched CAP and ASP aircraft to guard TG 58.1. At 0925, a TBM Avenger shot down a Nakajima A6M2-N Rufe seaplane fighter. Less than an hour later, starting at 1014, reports of multiple enemy raids caused the light carrier to launch all her available fighters. Over the next six hours, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s fighters helped break up four major raids, disrupting the Japanese attacks. Only one enemy formation approached TG 58.1 and only one out of the 16 torpedo bombers got close enough to be shot down by antiaircraft fire from the screening ships. The light carrier also sent a TBM Avenger strike against Rota around mid-day to help suppress Japanese land-based aircraft. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft claimed 10 Japanese aircraft out of the approximately 300 enemy aircraft lost in the battle dubbed the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.&quot;

On the morning of 20 June, &quot;Bataan&quot; launched CAP and ASP as normal and steamed west as the task force prepared for a second day of battle. The enemy carriers, however, had turned toward Japan the previous evening, and American search aircraft could not find them. The only activity for &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft occurred at 1320 when a Hellcat splashed a lone Betty near the task group. Finally, upon hearing a sighting report at 1613, the light carrier launched 10 fighters to accompany a massive 206-aircraft strike. The raid, catching the retreating Japanese at dusk, sank and damaged another. The American aircraft then returned to their carriers, landing with difficulty in the darkness after the task force turned on its deck and search lights. Eventually, two of &quot;Yorktown&quot;s aircraft landed on &quot;Bataan&quot;, the second of which crashed and fouled the deck. Nine of &quot;Bataan&quot;″s own fighters landed on other carriers, and one was lost.

After a futile search for the Japanese carriers on 22 June, the American task force turned back toward the Marianas. On 23 June, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft bombed Pagan Island, damaging the airfield and shooting down four Zekes and a Betty. That afternoon, TG 58.1 turned northwest toward the Bonin Islands, attempting to complete the attacks canceled on 16 June. &quot;Bataan&quot; launched 17 fighters for the attack on Iwo Jima at dawn on 24 June but these, and the 34 Hellcats from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;, met a Japanese incoming strike about halfway to the target. A second melee developed near the carriers when another Japanese raid met with task force&#x27;s CAP. &quot;Bataan&quot;″s air group lost three aircraft in these battles but claimed 25 in return. The task group then retired toward the Marshalls, anchoring at Eniwetok on 27 June.

The brief rest ended when the task group sailed back to the Bonins on 30 June. The task force&#x27;s aircraft struck at Iwo Jima on 3 and 4 July, interdicting Japanese efforts to reinforce Guam. The warship&#x27;s crew, however, suffered another loss on 4 July when an arresting gear cable snapped and killed one man and injured three others. In preparation for the landings planned for Guam in mid-July, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft conducted sweeps over Pagan Island on 5 July and then repeatedly bombed Guam from 6 to 11 July. On 12 July, her forward elevator failed permanently and she received orders to head home for repairs. She steamed by way of Eniwetok and Oahu before arriving in San Francisco on 30 July.

====Drydock refit and training====
&quot;Bataan&quot; entered the naval dry docks at Hunters Point on 30 July 1944 and, over the next two months, the yard workers repaired her elevator, painted the hull, and installed a second catapult, an air-search radar, deck lighting, rocket stowage, and a second aircraft landing barrier. She got underway for Hawaii on 7 October, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 13 October.

Assigned to TG 19.5, &quot;Bataan&quot; spent the next four months preparing for operations against the Bonin and Ryukyu Islands which were the targets of invasions planned by the Americans for early 1945. Iwo Jima was needed to provide emergency airfields for B-29s bombing Japan from the Marianas and a base for their fighter escorts, while Okinawa was needed to support any future invasion of the Japanese home islands.

&quot;Bataan&quot; spent most of November and December conducting pilot training exercises and night-fighter operations in Hawaiian waters. Seven aircraft were lost in accidents, including one Wildcat that crashed into her number 2 stack but only two pilots were injured. In January and February 1945, the focus of training operations shifted to night-fighter direction and ground-attack exercises. Accidents claimed another five aircraft, including a Vought F4U Corsair fighter that burned on the flight deck on 28 January 1945, but again no pilots were lost. The carrier entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on 16 February, undergoing repairs to her flight deck and receiving three new 40-millimeter antiaircraft guns.

====Battle of Okinawa====
On 3 March 1945, &quot;Bataan&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Ulithi, arriving at that atoll on 13 March. There she joined Task Unit (TU) 58.2.1, an ad hoc convoy comprising carriers , , , two battleships, two heavy cruisers and a host of destroyers formed for the short trip back to the Fast Carrier Task Force (TF-58). The task force conducted a series of raids to support the last major amphibious operation of the war, the invasion of Okinawa. Tasked with suppressing Japanese aircraft on Kyushu, one of the Japanese home islands, fighter sweeps and bomber strikes hit airfields on 18 March and struck at Japanese naval bases at Kure and Kobe. Over the next three days, vigorous counter-attacks by Japanese aircraft were mostly broken up by CAP, although a few aircraft got through and severely damaged &quot;Franklin&quot;. Other attacks targeted &quot;Bataan&quot;, whose antiaircraft guns claimed kills on two Judys and a Nakajima B6N Jill bomber. &quot;Bataan&quot;″s air group lost four aircraft in these actions while the ship&#x27;s company suffered one man killed and eleven injured from shell fragments.

Between 23 and 28 March, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft struck at Kerama Retto and conducted fighter sweeps over Okinawa. She then launched a raid on Kyushu on 29 March where her fighters claimed a Judy before returning to Okinawa operations. After the amphibious landings there on 1 April, the light carrier flew CAP over the amphibious forces and began intensive air strikes in support of Marine Corps operations ashore. Her aircraft also raided southern Kyushu, where Japanese kamikazes tended to congregate before major attacks.

On 7 April, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft took part in the Battle of the East China Sea, when American search aircraft spotted a Japanese task force built around battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;. Swarms of carrier aircraft attacked the Japanese force as it steamed south in an effort to disrupt the American invasion of Okinawa. &quot;Bataan&quot;″s pilots claimed four torpedo hits on the giant battleship, as well as hits on a cruiser and two destroyers, that helped sink most of the Japanese task force.

&quot;Bataan&quot; spent the next 10 days alternating between CAP sweeps over Okinawa and air strikes on southern Kyushu and nearby islands. Every three days or so, she retired eastward to refuel, rearm, and replenish at sea. During four enemy attacks on the task group over this period, one crew member was killed and 24 wounded when the ship was sprayed with shell fragments.

====Attack on Japanese home islands====
On 18 April, &quot;Bataan&quot; launched an antisubmarine patrol that assisted in the sinking of at . Following this, her aircraft returned to several weeks of air attacks on Okinawa and Kyushu. The heaviest Japanese counter-attack took place on 14 May when eight crewmen were killed and 26 others wounded. During these April and May operations, her gunners and pilots claimed a share in dozens of kills at a cost of nine aircraft and four air crewmen. Finally, on 29 May, she steamed south to the Philippines anchoring in San Pedro Bay on 1 June.

Following a month of minor repairs to the warship and liberty for her crew, &quot;Bataan&quot; sailed in company with TG 38.3 on 1 July for the Japanese home islands. There her aircraft struck airfields in the Tokyo Bay area on 10 July, hit shore installations in northern Honshu and Hokkaido on 14 and 15 July, and helped to damage in Yokosuka Harbor on 18 July. Then her aircraft struck the naval base at Kure on 24 July, helping to sink and 15 small craft in the harbor. Bad weather canceled most of her air strikes late in the month, limiting her aircraft to attacks on 28 and 30 July, and, because a typhoon passed through the area, raids did not resume until 9 August. On that day her aircraft struck Misawa Air Base in northern Japan and on 10 August they battered Aomori. She returned to Honshu on 13 August working over the Tokyo area until 0635 on 15 August 1945 when all strikes were canceled following news that the Japanese intended to surrender.

===Post-war===
After the formal surrender ceremony on 2 September, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft air-dropped supplies to Allied prisoners of war at Zentzuji Camp in Shikoku. The carrier then steamed into Tokyo Bay on 6 September to pick up crew members ashore before departing for Okinawa that afternoon. After picking up 549 passengers there, she sailed for home on 10 September, steaming via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal and arriving in New York on 17 October.

Bataan then sailed to the Boston Naval Shipyard on 30 October. Following two weeks of repairs, she was converted to a troop transport in preparation for Operation Magic Carpet, the return of soldiers from overseas. &quot;Bataan&quot; sailed for Europe on 21 November and moored in Naples harbor on the 29th where she embarked 2,121 Army officers and men. Arriving at Norfolk on 8 December, the troop-carrying warship then transported 890 Italian prisoners of war back to Naples, arriving there on 23 December. The following day, &quot;Bataan&quot; steamed out of the Bay of Naples with 2,089 Army troops embarked and arrived at Norfolk on 2 January 1946.

On 10 January 1946, &quot;Bataan&quot; reported for inactivation at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. After conversion to an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) carrier, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 11 February 1947.

===Korean War===
In 1949, heightened international tensions between the United States and NATO on the one hand, and the Soviet Union and communist China on the other, led to increased military spending. As a result, the Navy began to expand in 1950. &quot;Bataan&quot; was recommissioned on 13 May 1950 at Philadelphia, Captain Edgar T. Neale in command. On 25 June, North Korean forces invaded into South Korea. Two days later, under United Nations (UN) auspices, the United States intervened in the conflict. Suddenly needed to train and deliver pilots and aircraft to the Korean theater, &quot;Bataan&quot; steamed for the west coast on 15 July and arrived at San Diego via the Panama Canal on 28 July.

&quot;Bataan&quot; spent the next four months conducting training operations out of San Diego. She embarked naval air squadrons for carrier landing qualifications and antisubmarine warfare exercises. On 16 November, &quot;Bataan&quot; loaded Air Force cargo and personnel and sailed for Japan. After unloading her cargo there, she sailed on 14 December to report for duty with Task Force (TF) 77 off Korea&#x27;s northeastern coast.

====First deployment====
&quot;Bataan&quot; joined the task force at a critical juncture in the conflict. Since 24 November, when some 30 Chinese divisions had intervened in the Korean war, bitter fighting had forced UN troops to retreat from the Yalu and Taedong Rivers. By mid-December, the American and South Korean troops on the east coast had fallen back to Hungnam. The soldiers, along with their vehicles, supplies, and almost 100,000 Korean refugees, were being shipped south to the Pusan perimeter. On 22 December, &quot;Bataan&quot; began flying Vought F4U-4 Corsair fighters of Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-212 over Hungnam to help cover the final phase of this evacuation. Her aircraft, along with aircraft from the carriers and , provided air cover to ground forces and shipping in the port area. Following the end of the evacuation on 24 December, her Corsairs then flew armed reconnaissance and close air support missions over the central mountains along the 38th parallel.

On 31 December, a second communist offensive pushed south toward Seoul and Hanchon. In an attempt to stem the tide, &quot;Bataan&quot; was reassigned to Task Group (TG) 96.9 on the west coast of Korea. There, her aircraft attacked enemy troop concentrations below Seoul. After a replenishment period at Sasebo between 9 and 15 January 1951, &quot;Bataan&quot; relieved in the Yellow Sea on 16 January.

Wearing the flag of Commander, Task Element (CTE) 95.1.1, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s mission was to blockade the west coast of Korea. While on station, &quot;Bataan&quot; generally flew 40 sorties a day - eight defensive CAP flights with the remainder divided between close air support (CAS), armed reconnaissance (AR), and interdiction missions. For CAS of ground forces, tactical air controllers usually called in &quot;Bataan&quot;″s Corsairs for bomb, rocket, and napalm attacks on known enemy positions. Daylight AR missions concentrated on halting enemy road traffic and bombing rail yards and bridges. The first patrol revealed the dangerous nature of this work when, between 16 and 26 January, VMF-212 lost three Corsairs, along with two pilots, to enemy small-arms fire.

Over the next two months, &quot;Bataan&quot; conducted three more Yellow Sea patrols. In February and March, the light carrier supported the UN counterattack toward Inchon and Seoul, concentrating her air attacks on the Chinnampo area. These flights also included air spotting missions when cruisers and fired on targets ahead of advancing UN troops. Of the three Corsairs shot down by communist antiaircraft fire during these missions, two pilots were safely rescued by search and rescue (SAR) helicopters.

On 8 April, after the fast carriers of TF 77 sailed south to Formosa to counter a perceived threat there, &quot;Bataan&quot; and HMS &quot;Theseus&quot; replaced them in the Sea of Japan. The two light carriers, screened by a pair of American destroyers and four British Commonwealth escorts, maintained the west coast blockade. Corsairs from Marine Attack Squadron VMF-312 along with British Fairey Firefly and Hawker Sea Fury fighters, bombed and strafed communist supply routes near Wonsan, Hamhung, and Songjin. Five aircraft and one pilot were lost to communist antiaircraft defenses.

After a short visit to Sasebo between 16 and 20 April, &quot;Bataan&quot; resumed her alternating patrols with HMS &quot;Theseus&quot; off the west coast of Korea. On 21 April, in an unusual incident, two Corsairs of VMF-312 were attacked by four Russian-made Yakovlev Type 3U Yak fighters near Chinnampo. Marine Corps Capt. Philip C. DeLong shot down two of the Yaks, and heavily damaged a third, while 1st Lt. Harold D. Daigh, USMCR, shot down the fourth. According to Capt. DeLong, the North Korean pilots &quot;were considerably inferior in flying ability to the Japanese of World War II.&quot;

The following day, 22 April, communist troops began another heavy attack toward Seoul, and &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft flew 136 close air support sorties against them over the next four days. After a brief period of replenishment and upkeep at Sasebo between 27 and 30 April, &quot;Bataan&quot; returned to the Yellow Sea on 1 May. In company with the British carrier , she launched 244 offensive sorties against enemy troop concentrations, helping to stall and then reverse the communist offensive by 10 May. Later in the month, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s Corsairs concentrated on the destruction of junks and sampans in the Taedong Gang estuary until bad weather canceled flight operations. During these strikes, one pilot and aircraft was lost after being hit by 40-millimeter ground fire east of Anak.

Relieved on 3 June by a British carrier, &quot;Bataan&quot; offloaded the aircraft and personnel of VMF-312 and proceeded for home via Japan, eventually mooring in San Diego harbor on 25 June. Following two weeks of rest and recreation for her crew, &quot;Bataan&quot; steamed to Bremerton, Washington, on 9 July for an extensive overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. When those repairs were complete, &quot;Bataan&quot; steamed to San Diego on 7 November for underway refresher training. Over the next 10 weeks, she conducted carrier landing qualifications and ASW exercises in preparation for a second deployment to the Far East.

====Second deployment====
&quot;Bataan&quot; got underway for Yokosuka on 27 January 1952, arriving in Tokyo Bay on 11 February after weathering a severe winter storm. There she embarked Scouting Squadron 25 (VS-25) and steamed south to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, for ASW exercises. Between 24 February and 12 April, &quot;Bataan&quot; conducted three &quot;hunter-killer&quot; antisubmarine warfare exercises in the waters around Okinawa. Intended to prepare Allied forces to fight the Soviet submarine fleet in the event of Soviet intervention in Korea, these exercises pitted &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft, including helicopters, against &quot;enemy&quot; submarines , , and .

After refueling and replenishing at Yokosuka and Sasebo, the light carrier embarked VMA-312 at Kobe and departed Japan for operations off Korea on 29 April. She relieved HMS &quot;Glory&quot; as CTE-95.1.1 that same day and began combat sorties the following day. Ever since June 1951, the war in Korea had been bogged down in a military stalemate, with both sides heavily dug in along the 38th parallel. Tasked with interdicting communist supply routes between Hanchon and Yonan, &quot;Bataan&quot;″s aircraft flew 30 offensive sorties a day, bombing supply dumps, railway tracks, bridges, and road traffic.

Her only aircraft loss of this line tour took place on 22 May when a Corsair was shot down by ground fire north of Pyongyang. While two other fighters provided cover, the pilot was rescued by an Air Force helicopter. That same day, another Corsair ejected a hung rocket while landing on &quot;Bataan&quot;. The rocket bounced forward on the flight deck and exploded, injuring three crewmen. She suffered no other losses that month and on 28 May she was relieved by . After sailing to Yokosuka for repairs to her flight deck, &quot;Bataan&quot; conducted three more Yellow Sea line tours in June and July, continuing the task of attacking communist supply lines. On 4 August, the warship turned for home and arrived in San Diego, via Pearl Harbor, on 26 August.

&quot;Bataan&quot; entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 11 September for an overhaul, remaining there for three weeks. She then conducted two weeks of carrier qualification landings with VS-21, VS-23, and VS-871 until she began preparations for her third Far Eastern deployment. The warship steamed for Okinawa on 28 October, via Pearl Harbor, and anchored in Buckner Bay on 15 November.

====Third deployment====

Although fears of Soviet intervention in Korea had diminished, ASW exercises remained important to the units operating off Korea. &quot;Bataan&quot; conducted two such operations, one between 23 and 29 November 1952 and another between 17 and 23 December. The first operation included an &quot;opposed&quot; sortie against and , &quot;hunter-killer&quot; submarine searches, and general ASW patrols. She also practiced jet aircraft tracking with North American F-86 Sabre fighters operating out of Kadena airfield in Japan. The second exercise included electronic counter-measure (ECM) intercept exercises against and long-range ASW training with Lockheed P2V Neptunes.

On 9 February 1953, after two more transit ASW exercises between Buckner Bay and Yokosuka, &quot;Bataan&quot; embarked VMA-312 for operations off Korea. She relieved HMS &quot;Glory&quot; as Commander, Task Unit (CTU) 95.1.1 on the 15th and began flying combat missions that same day. In addition to the usual armed reconnaissance patrols along the coast, her Marine Corps Corsairs attacked Chinese troop concentrations south of Chinnampo and on the Ongjin peninsula. These attacks were ordered because friendly partisan reports indicated Chinese troops were massing for attacks on UN-controlled islands close to the mainland.

&quot;Bataan&quot; conducted four more line tours between 7 March and 5 May. Despite the bad flying weather associated with the spring thaw, VMA-312 continued to attack the enemy troop concentrations and supply dumps reported by friendly partisans. The Corsairs also attacked roads, railways, and especially bridges, as flood waters hampered communist repair efforts.

After liberty at Yokosuka, &quot;Bataan&quot; sailed for home, via Pearl Harbor, on 10 May, arriving in San Diego on 26 May. She was undergoing repairs there on 27 July when the armistice was signed at Panmunjom in Korea. She then loaded aircraft and equipment destined for Japan and sailed on 31 July for a round-trip voyage to Kobe and Yokosuka.

===Decommissioning and scrapping===
Returning to Pearl Harbor, she reported for a preinactivation overhaul on 26 August 1953. After moving to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, &quot;Bataan&quot; was decommissioned on 9 April 1954 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Francisco. Although she was reclassified an auxiliary aircraft transport and redesignated AVT-4 on 15 May 1959, her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1959. She was sold to Nicolai Joffe Corp., Beverly Hills, California, on 19 June 1961 for scrapping.

<text>USS &quot;San Jacinto&quot; (CVL-30) of the United States Navy was an light aircraft carrier that served during World War II. She was named for the Battle of San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. Future U.S. President George H. W. Bush served aboard the ship during World War II.

== Operational history ==

Originally laid down as the light cruiser &quot;Newark&quot; (CL-100), on 26 October 1942 by the New York Shipbuilding Co., Camden, New Jersey; redesignated CV-30 and renamed &quot;Reprisal&quot; on 2 June 1942; renamed &quot;San Jacinto&quot; on 30 January 1943, converted, while building, to a light aircraft carrier and reclassified as CVL-30; launched on 26 September 1943; sponsored by Mary Gibbs Jones (wife of U.S. Commerce Secretary Jesse H. Jones); and commissioned on 15 November 1943, Capt. Harold M. Martin, in command.

After shakedown in the Caribbean, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; sailed, via the Panama Canal, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor, for the Pacific war zone. Arriving at Majuro, Marshall Islands, she joined Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s Task Force 58/38, the fast carrier striking force of the Pacific Fleet. There, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; embarked Air Group 51, whose fighters and torpedo planes would be the ship&#x27;s chief weapons in battle.

=== Marianas actions ===

After providing search patrols to protect other carriers striking at Marcus Island, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; rejoined the Fast Carrier Task Force, Task Force 58, on 21 May 1944 and was part of effective strikes against a weakened Japanese-held Wake Island on 23 May (there were no US troop landings in this action, Wake remained in Japanese hands until their surrender); Wake Island had previously been attacked by Task Force 14 on 5–6 October 1943. These were &quot;San Jacinto&quot;″s first offensive missions, and no combat casualties were incurred, but one TBF Avenger was lost and its aircrew listed as missing when it failed to return from an anti-submarine patrol.
By 5 June 1944, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was ready to participate in the largest fleet action since the Battle of Midway, almost exactly two years before. On that day, Task Force 58 sortied from Majuro and headed toward the Marianas to conduct air strikes preparatory to American seizure of Saipan and to protect the invasion forces from enemy air and naval attack.

This American thrust triggered a strong Japanese reaction; on 19 June, the Japanese Fleet launched more than 400 planes against the invasion fleet and the covering carrier force. In the ensuing air battle, known to American pilots as the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot,&quot; more than 300 enemy planes were shot down. While &quot;San Jacinto&quot;″s planes were achieving their most one-sided victory of the war, her gunners helped to shoot down the few attackers able to get near the American ships. Then, at dusk, Admiral Mitscher dispatched an all-carrier attack after the retreating enemy fleet. The night recovery of the returning planes was accomplished amid considerable confusion. Reportedly, a Japanese carrier plane attempted a landing approach on &quot;San Jacinto&quot;, only to be waved off by the landing signal officer because its hook was not down.

&quot;San Jacinto&quot; then participated in strikes against Rota and Guam and furnished combat air patrol (CAP) and antisubmarine patrol (ASP) for her task group. During these raids, a &quot;San Jacinto&quot; fighter pilot was shot down over Guam and spent 17 days in a life raft trying to attract attention and 16 nights hiding on the island.

After a refueling and replenishment stop at Eniwetok Atoll, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; joined in carrier strikes against the Palaus on 15 July. On 5 August, her targets were Chichi, Haha and Iwo Jima. A brief stop at Eniwetok preceded dawn-to-dusk CAP and ASP duty while other carriers struck at Yap, Ulithi, Anguar and Babelthuap, pinning down Japanese air forces while the Palaus were being assaulted on 15 September.

On 2 September, while piloting a TBF Grumman Avenger #46214 from VT-51, future-President George H. W. Bush was shot down by anti-aircraft fire while attacking Japanese installations on the island of Chichijima. Bush for a time was considered the youngest navy pilot in history, and is known as the youngest pilot in WWII history to join an American torpedo bomber squadron. Bush completed his bombing run, then guided his crippled plane out to sea. The two other crew members were lost, but Lieutenant (J.G.) Bush parachuted into the sea and was rescued by the submarine from capture by cannibalistic Japanese Officers stationed on Chichijima. For his actions in the successful attack, 20-year-old Bush received the Distinguished Flying Cross.

Following a replenishment stop at Manus, Admiralty Islands, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; joined in strikes against Okinawa and furnished photographic planes to get information necessary for future invasion plans. After refueling at sea, she once again supplied dawn-to-dusk air protection as other carriers sent strikes against Formosa, northern Luzon, and the Manila Bay area from 12 to 19 October. During operations on 17 October, a fighter plane made a very hard landing and inadvertently fired its machine guns into the ship&#x27;s island structure, killing two men and wounding 24, including her commanding officer, and causing considerable damage to radar. Despite this accident, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; remained battle-worthy.

=== Philippines ===

As American troops landed on Leyte in the central Philippines on 20 October, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; provided close air support. On 24 October, this mission was interrupted by news of the three-pronged approach of the Japanese fleet which precipitated the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which was the largest fleet battle in naval history.

&quot;San Jacinto&quot; sent planes against the central force in the Sibuyan Sea, then raced north to launch strikes against the northern force, resulting in heavy damage to the Japanese carriers and surface combatants off Cape Engaño. On 30 October, her fighters furnished air protection over Leyte while her guns shot down two planes attempting suicide attacks on the ship. After a pause at Ulithi, the carrier joined in attacks on the Manila Bay area; then took a side trip to Guam to exchange air groups, receiving Air Group 45. She received slight damage during a typhoon in December 1944.

After completing repairs at Ulithi, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; and the rest of her fast carrier force entered the South China Sea and launched massive air attacks on the airfields of Formosa and against shipping at Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, and at Hong Kong. By refueling and replenishing at sea, Task Force 38 was able to continue its pressure on the enemy and strategic support for the American invasion of Luzon by strikes against the Ryukyu Islands.

=== Attacks over Japan ===

Next, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; joined in the first carrier strikes against the home islands of Japan. During the raids on 16 and 17 February 1945, carrier-based aircraft shot down many enemy planes during fierce dogfights over airfields in the Tokyo area. These operations were designed to cover the imminent invasion of Iwo Jima. Next came air support for the landing Marines, followed by further strikes against Tokyo and Okinawa before &quot;San Jacinto&quot; returned to Ulithi.
While conducting operations off Kyūshū, Japan, she witnessed the conflagration on the carrier ; and, on 19 March 1945, escaped destruction when a kamikaze narrowly missed her. More massive enemy attacks came with Operation &quot;Iceberg&quot; as the carrier force furnished air support for the invasion of Okinawa. On 5 April, more than 500 planes, primarily kamikazes, attacked. Fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down about 300, but many got through. &quot;San Jacinto&quot;″s gunners shot the wing off a would-be suicide plane, deflecting its dive; it splashed down only 50 feet off her port bow. Her mission of covering the Okinawa invasion entailed heavy air activity and kept the ship almost constantly at general quarters while supporting ground forces and repelling frequent attacks by suicide planes.

On 7 April, &quot;San Jacinto&#x27;s&quot;″s bombers torpedoed the Japanese destroyers and , part of a naval suicide attack in which the super battleship was also sunk. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; then returned to the dangerous job of defending against the suicide plane attacks, striking at the kamikaze airfields on Kyūshū, and providing close air support for ground forces fighting on Okinawa.

On 5 June, she successfully rode out another typhoon, and after replenishing at Leyte sortied for her final raids as part of Task Force 58. Her aircraft struck at Hokkaidō and Honshū, Japan, on 9 July and continued to operate off the coast of Japan until the end of hostilities on 15 August 1945.

After the ceasefire preceding Japan&#x27;s formal surrender, her air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. Her wartime mission completed, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; returned home and tied up at NAS Alameda, California, on 14 September 1945.

== Fate ==

The Spanish Navy considered acquiring &quot;San Jacinto&quot; but instead chose the carrier , which was renamed &quot;Dédalo&quot;.

&quot;San Jacinto&quot; was decommissioned on 1 March 1947 and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet berthed at San Diego. She was reclassified as an auxiliary aircraft transport (AVT-5) on 15 May 1959, and struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1970; her hull was sold for scrapping in December 1971.

<text>USS &quot;Midway&quot; (CVB/CVA/CV-41) is an aircraft carrier, formerly of the United States Navy, the lead ship of her class. Commissioned eight days after the end of World War II, &quot;Midway&quot; was the largest aircraft carrier in the world until 1955, as well as the first U.S. aircraft carrier too big to transit the Panama Canal. She operated for 47 years, during which time she saw action in the Vietnam War and served as the Persian Gulf flagship in 1991&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm. Decommissioned in 1992, she is now a museum ship at the USS &quot;Midway&quot; Museum, in San Diego, California.

USS Midway is the only retired aircraft carrier that is not an , as the rest have been scrapped.

==Service history==
===Early operations and deployment with the 6th Fleet===

&quot;Midway&quot; was laid down 27 October 1943 in Shipway 11 at Newport News Shipbuilding Co., Newport News, Virginia; launched 20 March 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Bradford William Ripley, Jr.; and commissioned on 10 September 1945 (eight days after the surrender of Japan) with Captain Joseph F. Bolger in command.

After shakedown in the Caribbean, &quot;Midway&quot; joined the U.S. Atlantic Fleet training schedule, with Norfolk as her homeport. From 20 February 1946, she was the flagship for Carrier Division 1. In March, she participated in Operation Frostbite testing the Ryan FR Fireball and helicopter rescue techniques for cold-weather operations in the Labrador Sea. In September 1947, a captured German V-2 rocket was test-fired from the flight deck in Operation Sandy, the first large-rocket launch from a moving platform, and the only moving-platform launch for a V-2. While the rocket lifted off, it then tilted and broke up at .

On 29 October 1947, &quot;Midway&quot; sailed for the first of her annual deployments with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Between deployments, &quot;Midway&quot; trained and received alterations to accommodate heavier aircraft as they were developed.

In June 1951, &quot;Midway&quot; operated in the Atlantic off the Virginia Capes during carrier suitability tests of the F9F-5 Panther. On 23 June, as Cdr. George Chamberlain Duncan attempted a landing in BuNo &quot;125228&quot;, a downdraft just aft of the stern caused Duncan to crash. His plane&#x27;s forward fuselage broke away and rolled down the deck, and he suffered burns. Footage of the crash has been used in several films, including &quot;Men of the Fighting Lady&quot;, &quot;Midway&quot;, and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

In 1952, the ship participated in Operation Mainbrace, North Sea maneuvers with NATO forces. &quot;Midway&quot; had an angled runway painted on the flight deck in May for touch-and-go landings following early trials of the technique aboard . Successful demonstration of the possibilities caused widespread adoption of the angled flight deck in future aircraft carrier construction and modifications of existing carriers. On 1 October, the ship was redesignated CVA-41.

&quot;Midway&quot; left Norfolk 27 December 1954 for a world cruise, sailing via the Cape of Good Hope for Taiwan, where she became the first large carrier in the 7th Fleet for operations in the Western Pacific until 28 June 1955. During these operations, &quot;Midway&quot; pilots flew cover for the evacuation from the Tachen Islands during the Quemoy-Matsu crisis of 15,000 Chinese nationalist troops and 20,000 Chinese civilians, along with their livestock.

=== 1950s &amp; 60s ===

Controversy arose during the cruise when &quot;Midway&quot; around January 1955 docked in Cape Town, South Africa. Democratic senator Herbert Lehman sent a telegram to Secretary of the Navy Charles Thomas when he learned of a supposed United States Navy plan to segregate 400 non-white members of the crew of &quot;Midway&quot; while it was in Cape Town. Fellow Democratic senator Hubert Humphrey soon joined Lehman, additionally sending a letter to the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, asking that &quot;immediate steps be taken to see that equal treatment is given to American service personnel allowed shore leave in South Africa, or eliminate Cape Town as a port of call&quot;, and saying that &quot;To me this is a shocking act of discrimination that should not be tolerated by our Government. Every American soldier or sailor is an American regardless of race, colour or creed, and is entitled to be respected and treated as such anywhere in the world.&quot;

An anonymous Navy official stated that the Department of the Navy did not know of the arrangements that were to be made between the officers of &quot;Midway&quot; and South African authorities, and that African-American members of the crew would not be segregated while still aboard &quot;Midway&quot;.

Clarence Mitchell Jr. also urged Thomas not to allow &quot;Midway&quot; to dock at Cape Town. James H. Smith Jr., Acting Secretary of the Navy at the time, replied that the stop at Cape Town was merely to &quot;satisfy an operational logistic requirement&quot; and that it was customary to observe local laws and regulations while visiting foreign ports.

Captain Reynold Delos Hogle of &quot;Midway&quot; stated that while in port, &quot;Midway&quot; would be United States territory and federal United States laws would apply. In the end, the crew of &quot;Midway&quot; were not made to abide by apartheid, Captain Hogle stating that &quot;At Hartleyvale (Stadium) this afternoon and at the concert to-night, European and non-European members of the crew have been asked to attend. There will be no segregation whatsoever&quot;.

====Modernizations====
On 28 June 1955, the ship sailed for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where &quot;Midway&quot; underwent an extensive modernization program (SCB-110, similar to SCB-125 for the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers). &quot;Midway&quot; received an enclosed hurricane bow, an aft deck-edge elevator, an angled flight deck, and steam catapults, before returning to service on 30 September 1957.

Home ported at Alameda, California, &quot;Midway&quot; began annual deployments bringing McDonnell F3H Demons, North American FJ-4 Furys, Vought F-8 Crusaders, Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, and Douglas A-3 Skywarriors to the 7th Fleet in 1958, and into the South China Sea during the Laotian Crisis of spring 1961. During the 1962 deployment, &quot;Midway&quot; recorded her 100,000th arrested landing as the ship&#x27;s aircraft tested the air defense systems of Japan, Korea, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Taiwan. &quot;Midway&quot; again sailed for the Far East 6 March 1965, and from mid-April flew strikes against military and logistics installations in North and South Vietnam, including the first combat use of AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-surface missiles. On 17 June 1965 two VF-21 McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom IIs flying from &quot;Midway&quot; were credited with the first confirmed MiG kills of the Vietnam conflict, using AIM-7 Sparrow missiles to down two MiG-17Fs. Three days later, four of &quot;Midway″s&quot; A-1 Skyraiders used the World War II vintage Thach Weave tactic to down an attacking MiG-17F.

&quot;Midway&quot; lost an F-4 Phantom and two A-4 Skyhawks to North Vietnamese S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missiles before returning to Alameda on 23 November to enter San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard on 11 February 1966 for a massive modernization (SCB-101.66), which proved expensive and controversial. The flight deck was enlarged from , and the angle of the flight deck landing area was increased to 13.5 degrees. The elevators were enlarged, moved, and given almost double the weight capacity. &quot;Midway&quot; also received new steam catapults, arresting gear, and a centralized air conditioning plant. Cost overruns raised the price of this program from $88 million to US$202 million, and precluded a similar modernization planned for . After &quot;Midway&quot; was finally recommissioned on 31 January 1970, it was found that the modifications had worsened the ship&#x27;s seakeeping capabilities and ability to conduct air operations in rough seas, which made further modifications necessary to correct the problem.

===Return to Vietnam===
&quot;Midway&quot; returned to Vietnam and on 18 May 1971, after relieving at Yankee Station, began single carrier operations. &quot;Midway&quot; departed Yankee Station on 5 June, completing the vessel&#x27;s final line period on 31 October 1971, and returned to the ship&#x27;s homeport on 6 November 1971.

&quot;Midway&quot;, with embarked Carrier Air Wing 5 (CVW 5), again departed Alameda for operations off Vietnam on 10 April 1972. On 11 May, aircraft from &quot;Midway&quot;, along with those from , , and , began laying naval mines off North Vietnamese ports, including Thanh Hóa, Đồng Hới, Vinh, Hon Gai, Quang Khe, and Cam Pha, as well as other approaches to Haiphong. Ships that were in port in Haiphong had been warned that the mining would take place and that the mines would be armed 72 hours later.
&quot;Midway&quot; continued Vietnam operations during Operation Linebacker throughout the summer of 1972. On 7 August 1972, an HC-7 Det 110 helicopter, flying from &quot;Midway&quot;, and aided by planes from the carrier and from , searched for the pilot of an A-7 Corsair II aircraft from &quot;Saratoga&quot; who had been downed the previous day by a surface-to-air missile about inland, northwest of Vinh. Flying over mountains, the HC-7 helicopter spotted the downed aviator with her searchlight and, under heavy ground fire, retrieved him before returning to an LPD off the coast. This was the deepest penetration by a rescue helicopter into North Vietnam since 1968. By the end of 1972, HC-7 Det 110 had rescued a total of 48 pilots, 35 in combat conditions.

On 5 October 1973, &quot;Midway&quot;, with CVW 5, put into Yokosuka, Japan, marking the first forward-deployment of a complete carrier task group in a Japanese port, the result of an accord arrived at on 31 August 1972 between the U.S. and Japan. The move allowed sailors to live with their families when in port; more strategically, it allowed three carriers to stay in East Asia even as the economic situation demanded the reduction of carriers in the fleet. CVW 5 became based at the nearby Naval Air Facility Atsugi.

For service in Vietnam from 30 April 1972, to 9 February 1973, &quot;Midway&quot; and CVW 5 received the Presidential Unit Citation from Richard Nixon. It read:

Aircraft from Midway made both the first MIG kills in the Vietnam War, and the last air-to-air victory of the war. On 17 June 1965, aviators of &quot;Midway&quot;″s Attack Carrier Wing 2, VF-21, had downed the first two MiGs credited to US forces in Southeast Asia. On 12 January 1973 a combat aircraft from &quot;Midway&quot; made the last air-to-air victory of the Vietnam War.

===Operation Frequent Wind===
On 19 April 1975, after North Vietnam had overrun two-thirds of South Vietnam, &quot;Midway&quot;, along with &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, &quot;Hancock&quot;, and , were sent to the waters off South Vietnam. Ten days later, U.S. 7th Fleet forces carried out Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon. For this, &quot;Midway&quot;, which had offloaded half of the ship&#x27;s regular combat air wing at NS Subic Bay, Philippines, steamed to Thailand and took aboard eight U.S. Air Force CH-53 from 21st Special Operations Squadron and two HH-53 helicopters from 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. As Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces, these helicopters transported hundreds of U.S. personnel and Vietnamese people to &quot;Midway&quot; and other U.S. ships in the South China Sea.
On 29 April 1975, Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) Major Lý Bửng (also spelled Buang-Ly or Buang Lee) loaded his wife and five children into a two-seat Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and took off from Con Son Island. After evading enemy ground fire, Buang headed out to the South China Sea, found &quot;Midway&quot;, and began to circle overhead with his landing lights turned on. &quot;Midway&quot;″s crew unsuccessfully attempted to contact the aircraft on emergency frequencies. When a spotter reported that there were at least four people in the two-seater aircraft, all thoughts of forcing the pilot to ditch alongside were abandoned. After three tries, Major Buang managed to drop a note from a low pass over the deck: &quot;Can you move the helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly for one hour more, we have enough time to move. Please rescue me! Major Buang, wife and 5 child.&quot; Captain Larry Chambers, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, ordered that the arresting wires be removed and that any helicopters that could not be safely and quickly moved should be pushed over the side. He called for volunteers, and soon every available seaman was on deck to help. An estimated worth of UH-1 Huey helicopters were pushed overboard. With a ceiling, visibility, light rain, and of surface wind, Chambers ordered the ship to sail at into the wind. Warnings about the dangerous downdrafts created behind a steaming carrier were transmitted blind in both Vietnamese and English. To make matters worse, five more UH-1s landed and cluttered up the deck. Without hesitation, Chambers ordered them jettisoned as well. Captain Chambers recalled that

Buang was escorted to the bridge where Chambers congratulated him on his outstanding airmanship, and his bravery in risking everything on a gamble beyond the point of no return without knowing for certain a carrier would be where he needed it. The crew of &quot;Midway&quot; was so impressed that they established a fund to help him and his family get settled in the United States. The O-1 that Major Buang landed is now on display at the Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Major Buang became the first Vietnamese pilot ever to land a fixed-wing aircraft on an aircraft carrier deck.

Upon completion of ferrying people to other ships, &quot;Midway&quot; returned to Thailand and disembarked the Air Force helicopters at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield. The CH-53s then airlifted over 50 RVNAF aircraft to the ship. With almost 100 helicopters and aircraft of the former RVNAF aboard, the ship steamed to Guam where the aircraft and helicopters were offloaded in twenty-four hours. While transiting back to the Philippines to pick up the ship&#x27;s air wing, &quot;Midway&quot; was rerouted to act as a floating airfield in support of special operation forces rescuing the SS &quot;Mayagüez&quot;. &quot;Midway&quot; picked up the ship&#x27;s regular air wing again a month later when the aircraft carrier returned NAS Cubi Point, Philippines.

On 30 June 1975, &quot;Midway&quot; was redesignated from &quot;CVA-41&quot; to &quot;CV-41&quot;.

===After Vietnam===
On 21 August 1976, a Navy task force headed by &quot;Midway&quot; made a show of force off the coast of Korea in reaction to an attack on two U.S. Army officers who were killed by North Korean soldiers on 18 August when they attempted to cut down a tree. The U.S. response to this incident was given the name Operation Paul Bunyan. &quot;Midway&quot;″s participation was part of a U.S. demonstration of military concern vis-à-vis North Korea.

&quot;Midway&quot; relieved &quot;Constellation&quot; as the Indian Ocean contingency carrier on 16 April 1979. This unscheduled deployment was due to colliding with the tanker &quot;Liberian Fortune&quot; near the Straits of Malacca, with &quot;Midway&quot; taking over &quot;Ranger&quot;″s mission while she went in for repairs. &quot;Midway&quot; and her escorts continued a significant American naval presence in the oil-producing region of the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf. On 18 November, the aircraft carrier steamed to the North Arabian Sea in connection with the continuing hostage crisis in Iran. Militant followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini, who had come to power following the overthrow of the Shah, seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran on 4 November and held 63 US citizens hostage. On 21 November &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived, and both carriers, along with their escort ships, were joined by and her escorts on 22 January 1980. &quot;Midway&quot; was relieved by &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on 5 February.

===Missions in the 1980s===
Following a period in Yokosuka, &quot;Midway&quot; relieved &quot;Coral Sea&quot; 30 May 1980 on standby south of Jeju-Do Island in the Sea of Japan following the potential of civil unrest in the Republic of Korea.

While transiting the passage between Palawan Island of the Philippines and the coast of Northern Borneo on 29 July, the Panamanian merchant ship &quot;Cactus&quot; collided with &quot;Midway&quot;. &quot;Cactus&quot; was southwest of Subic Bay and heading to Singapore when she struck near the carrier&#x27;s liquid oxygen plant; two sailors working in the plant were killed and three were injured. &quot;Midway&quot; sustained light damage and three F-4 Phantom aircraft parked on the flight deck also were damaged.

On 17 August, &quot;Midway&quot; relieved &quot;Constellation&quot; to begin another Indian Ocean deployment and to complement the task group still on contingency duty in the Arabian Sea. &quot;Midway&quot; spent a total of 118 consecutive days in the Indian Ocean during 1980.

On 16 March 1981, an A-6E Intruder from VA-115 aboard &quot;Midway&quot; sighted a downed civilian helicopter in the South China Sea. &quot;Midway&quot; immediately dispatched HC-1 Det 2 helicopters to the scene. All 17 people aboard the downed helicopter were rescued and brought aboard the carrier. The chartered civilian helicopter was also retrieved from the water and lifted to &quot;Midway&quot;″s flight deck.

On 25 March 1986, the final carrier launching of a Navy fleet F-4S Phantom II took place off &quot;Midway&quot; during flight operations in the East China Sea. ABF2 Paul F. Morehead, Jr., fueled aircraft number 111 for the last time. The Phantoms were replaced by the new F/A-18A Hornets.
&quot;Midway&quot; continued serving in the western Pacific throughout the 1980s. In order to alleviate persistent seakeeping issues, &quot;Midway&quot; received hull blisters in 1986. During her 1986 refit (named &quot;Extended Incremental Selected Repair Availability&quot;), blisters were added to improve the ship&#x27;s stability. The modification proved counterproductive, as it actually increased the ship&#x27;s instability in rough seas. She took water over the flight deck during excessive rolls in moderate seas, thereby hampering flight operations. Before another $138 million refit was approved to rectify the stability problems, it was even proposed to decommission &quot;Midway&quot;. Nevertheless, she had earned herself the nickname &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll carrier.&quot; During a typhoon while in the Sea of Japan during the Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea, on 8 October 1988, &quot;Midway&quot;, which was not supposed to be able to sustain more than 24 degrees of roll, survived a 26-degree roll.

On 30 October 1989, an F/A-18A Hornet aircraft from &quot;Midway&quot; mistakenly dropped a general-purpose bomb on the deck of during training exercises in the Indian Ocean, creating a hole in the bow, sparking small fires, and injuring five sailors. &quot;Reeves&quot; was south of Diego Garcia at the time of the incident.

Tragedy struck &quot;Midway&quot; on 20 June 1990. While conducting routine flight operations approximately northeast of Japan, the ship was badly damaged by two onboard explosions. These explosions led to a fire that raged more than ten hours. In addition to damage to the ship&#x27;s hull, two crew members were killed and 9 others were wounded; one of the injured later died of his injuries. All 11 crewmen belonged to the at sea fire-fighting team known as the Flying Squad. When &quot;Midway&quot; entered Yokosuka Harbor the next day, 12 Japanese media helicopters flew in circles and hovered about above the flight deck. Three bus loads of reporters were waiting on the pier. About 30 minutes after &quot;Midway&quot; cast her first line, more than 100 international print and electronic journalists charged over the brow to cover the event. The news media made a major issue out of the incident, as it had happened amid several other military accidents. It was thought that the accident would lead to the ship&#x27;s immediate retirement due to her age, but &quot;Midway&quot; was retained to fight in one last major conflict.

===Operation Desert Storm===

On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait, and U.S. forces moved into Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield to protect that country against invasion by Iraq. On 1 November 1990, &quot;Midway&quot; was again on station in the North Arabian Sea as the carrier of Battle Force Zulu (which included warships from the U.S., Australia, and other countries), relieving . On 15 November, the carrier participated in Operation Imminent Thunder, an eight-day combined amphibious landing exercise in northeastern Saudi Arabia which involved about 1,000 U.S. Marines, 16 warships, and more than 1,100 aircraft. Meanwhile, the United Nations set an ultimatum deadline of 15 January 1991 for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.

Operation Desert Storm began the next day. On January 17, 1991 at 2:00AM, &quot;Midway&quot; launched aircraft from CVW-5 for the first carrier strikes of the Gulf War. An A-6E TRAM Intruder from VA-185 Nighthawks from the &quot;Midway&quot; was the first carrier aircraft over the coast. Around 17 other aircraft from the &quot;Midway&quot; provided support during the strikes.

At around 4:05AM, four A-6E TRAM Intruders from VA-185 and VA-115 Eagles attacked Shaibah Air Base at around 350 ft, encountering heavy AAA fire, with two of the four aircraft not dropping their bombs. At around the same time, three A-6E TRAM Intruders from VA-115, each loaded with six Mk.83 bombs; attacked Ahmad Al-Jaber Air Base in occupied Kuwait. The AAA fire at Shaibah led to the &quot;Midway&quot;&#x27;s pilots avoiding low-level attacks for the rest of the war. No &quot;Midway&quot; aircraft were lost on the strikes. The Navy launched 228 sorties that day from &quot;Midway&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot; in the Persian Gulf, and from and &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the Red Sea. The Navy also launched more than 100 Tomahawk missiles from nine ships in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Midway&quot; later launched an F/A-18 Hornet that used the first AGM-62 Walleye television-guided glide bomb in combat. The Hornet from VFA-195 destroyed a T-shaped building at Umm Qasr Naval Base with a Walleye II. The pilot, LCDR Jeffery Ashby, led a mission on 13 February 1991 that successfully destroyed an Iraqi Super Frelon helicopter armed with Exocet missiles (which had posed a threat to the US Carriers) with a Walleye I. The removal of the threat allowed &quot;Midway&quot; and the other carriers &quot;Ranger&quot; and to move closer to Kuwait. &quot;NF-104&quot; was painted with a kill marking for the helicopter and was displayed when &quot;Midway&quot; returned to Japan. Some of &quot;Midway&#x27;s&quot; F/A-18As also unsuccessfully attempted to intercept Iraqi Mirage F1s during the Attack on Ras Tanura on January 24, with an RSAF F-15C later shooting down both of the Mirages.

Desert Storm officially ended 28 February, and &quot;Midway&quot; departed the Persian Gulf on 11 March 1991 and returned to Yokosuka.

=== Rest of 1991 ===

In June 1991, &quot;Midway&quot; left for her final deployment, this time to the Philippines to take part in Operation Fiery Vigil, which was the evacuation of 20,000 military members and their families from Clark Air Base, on the island of Luzon, after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. &quot;Midway&quot;, along with twenty other U.S. naval ships, ferried the evacuees to the island of Cebu, where they were taken off the ship by helicopter. After taking part in the evacuation, the aircraft carrier once again returned to Yokosuka.

===Final cruise===
In August 1991, &quot;Midway&quot; departed Yokosuka for the last time and returned to Pearl Harbor. There, she turned over with &quot;Independence,&quot; which replaced &quot;Midway&quot; as the forward-deployed carrier in Yokosuka. Rear Admiral Joseph Prueher and the staff of Carrier Group ONE moved to &quot;Independence&quot;. Prueher was the last admiral to lower his flag on &quot;Midway&quot;. She then sailed to Seattle for a port visit. There the ship disembarked &quot;tigers&quot; (guests of crew members) before making her final voyage to San Diego.

==As museum ship==


&quot;Midway&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Air Station North Island on 11 April 1992 in a ceremony in which the main speaker was Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. During decommissioning, &quot;Midway&quot;, her sailors, and their families were filmed for the movie &quot;At Sea&quot;, a documentary on carrier life shown only at the Navy Museum in Washington, D.C. The ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 March 1997.

On 30 September 2003, ex-&quot;Midway&quot; began her journey from the Navy Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Bremerton, Washington, to San Diego, California, in preparation for use as a museum and memorial. The aircraft carrier was docked in early October at the Charles P. Howard Terminal in Oakland, California, while work proceeded on the Navy Pier in downtown San Diego. On 10 January 2004, the ship was moored at her final location, where she was opened to the public on 7 June 2004 as a museum. In the first year of operation, the museum had 879,281 visitors, double the expected attendance.

On 11 November 2012, a college basketball game between the Syracuse Orange and the San Diego State Aztecs was played on the flight deck. The Orange won, 62–49.

On 15 July 2015, museum personnel were evacuated from ex-&quot;Midway&quot; due to smoke caused by an apparent fire. The San Diego fire department responded quickly, but no fire was found, and the museum was able to open for the day on schedule.

<doc id="402389" wikidata="Q1663013" url="?curid=402389" title="USS Coral Sea (CV-43)">
<text>USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot; (CV/CVB/CVA-43), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Battle of the Coral Sea. She earned the affectionate nickname &quot;Ageless Warrior&quot; through her long career. Initially classified as an aircraft carrier with hull classification symbol CV-43, the contract to build the ship was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding of Newport News, Virginia, on 14 June 1943. She was reclassified as a &quot;Large Aircraft Carrier&quot; with hull classification symbol CVB-43 on 15 July 1943. Her keel was laid down on 10 July 1944 in Shipway 10. She was launched on 2 April 1946 sponsored by Mrs. Thomas C. Kinkaid and commissioned on 1 October 1947 with Captain A.P. Storrs III in command.

Before 8 May 1945, the aircraft carrier CVB-42 had been known as USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot;; after that date, CVB-42 was renamed in honor of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the late President, and CV-43 was named the &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; was one of the last U.S Navy carriers to be completed with a straight flight deck, with an angled flight deck added on during later modernizations. All subsequent newly built U.S Navy carriers have had the angled deck included as part of the ship&#x27;s construction, and the other two ships of this class were also converted. While the USS Coral Sea (CV-43) was eventually decommissioned and scrapped in Australia, its sistership, the USS Midway (CV-41) is preserved as a Museum Ship in San Diego, California in the 21st century.

==Early milestones==
The ship promptly began a series of career milestones when, on 27 April 1948, two P2V-2 Neptunes, piloted by Commander Thomas D. Davies and Lieutenant Commander John P. Wheatley, made jet assisted takeoffs (JATO) from the carrier as she steamed off Norfolk, Virginia. This was the first carrier launchings of planes of this size and weight. The &quot;Coral Sea&quot; sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 June 1948 for a midshipmen cruise to the Mediterranean and Caribbean, and returned to Norfolk, Virginia 11 August.

After an overhaul period, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was again operating off the Virginia Capes. On 7 March 1949, a P2V-3C Neptune, piloted by Captain John T. Hayward of VC-5, was launched from the carrier with a 10,000-lb load of dummy bombs. The aircraft flew across the continent, dropped its load on the West Coast, and returned nonstop to land at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The mission proved the concept of carrier-based atomic bomb attacks. Following training in the Caribbean, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; sailed 3 May 1949 for her first tour of duty in the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet, returning 28 September.

==Operations in the 1950s==
On 21 April 1950, the first carrier takeoff of an AJ-1 Savage heavy attack bomber was made from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; by Captain John T. Hayward of VC-5. The remainder of the pilots of the squadron completed carrier qualifications on board &quot;Coral Sea&quot; in this aircraft on 31 August, marking the introduction of this long-range atomic-attack bomber to carrier operations. At this time, she returned to the Mediterranean for duty with the Sixth Fleet from 9 September 1950 to 1 February 1951.

An overhaul and local operations upon her return, as well as training with Air Group 17, prepared her for a return to the Mediterranean once more on 20 March 1951. As flagship for Commander, Carrier Division 6, she took part in a NATO Exercise, Beehive I. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia 6 October for local and Caribbean operations, next sailing for the Mediterranean on 19 April 1952. While on service with the Sixth Fleet, she visited Yugoslavia in September and carried Marshal Josip Broz Tito on a one-day cruise to observe carrier operations. The ship was reclassified as an &quot;Attack Aircraft Carrier&quot; with hull classification symbol CVA-43 on 1 October 1952 while still at sea and returned to Norfolk, Virginia, for overhaul 12 October.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; trained pilots in carrier operations off of the Virginia Capes and Naval Station Mayport, and in April 1953 the ship embarked the Judiciary Committee of the United States House of Representatives for a three-day cruise. On 26 April, she sailed for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean. This cruise was highlighted by a visit to Spain, and participation in NATO Exercise Black Wave with Deputy Secretary of Defense R. M. Kyes on board as an observer. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 October, she carried out tests for the Bureau of Aeronautics and trained members of the Naval Reserve at Mayport, and Guantánamo Bay.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; returned to the Mediterranean from 7 July to 20 December 1954, and during this tour was visited by Spanish Generalissimo Francisco Franco as she lay off of Valencia. On her next tour of duty in the Mediterranean from 23 March to 29 September 1955, she called at Istanbul and participated in NATO exercises.

Sailing from Norfolk, Virginia 23 July 1956 for Mayport, Florida, to embark Carrier Air Group 10, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; continued on to the Mediterranean on her next tour. She participated in NATO exercises and received King Paul of Greece, and his consort, Friederike Luise Thyra of Hanover on board as visitors in October. During the Suez Crisis, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; evacuated American citizens from the troubled area and stood by off of Egypt until November.

Sometime between late 1956 and early 1957, a so far unnamed crew member of Hungarian origin, possibly the ship&#x27;s helmsman, managed to convince the crew of the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; to donate their annual Christmas funds to the refugees of the Hungarian Revolution instead. Having made a unified decision, the crew members donated $7,500 and lined up for an aerial publicity shot, displaying &quot;Isten Segítsen!&quot; (Eng: God Help You). The U.S. government continued to promote this generous gesture by organising trips for Hungarian refugees to see &quot;Coral Sea&quot; at Naples.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 11 February 1957. She cleared that port on 26 February and visited Santos, Brazil; Valparaíso, Chile; and Balboa, Canal Zone, before arriving at Bremerton, Washington, on 15 April.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; was decommissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 24 May 1957 to receive a major conversion (SCB 110A), which included a longer angled deck canted 3 degrees more than the previous overhauls of her sister ships. As the centerline elevators were relocated to the starboard deck edge forward and aft of the island, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; became the first carrier to mount an elevator on the port quarter resembling the more efficient deck layout of the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class then under construction. Other improvements included new steam catapults, an enclosed hurricane bow, hull blisters, and removal of the armor belt and several anti-aircraft guns. Upon completion, she was recommissioned on 25 January 1960 and rejoined the fleet. During September 1960, she conducted training with her new air group along the West Coast, then sailed in September for a tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet in the Far East on her first WestPac (Western Pacific cruise). She recorded her 100,000th arrested landing in October 1961.

==Vietnam and operations in the 1960s to early 1970s==

Installation of the Pilot Landing Aid Television (PLAT) system was completed on &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on 14 December 1961. She was the first carrier to have this system installed for operations use. Designed to provide a videotape of every landing, the system proved useful for instructional purposes and in the analysis of landing accidents, thereby making it an invaluable tool in the promotion of safety. By 1963, all attack carriers had been equipped with PLAT and plans were underway for installation in the CVSs and at shore stations.

Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; departed on 7 December 1964 for duty with the Seventh Fleet. On 7 February 1965, her aircraft, along with those from and , conducted Operation Flaming Dart against the military barracks and staging areas near Đồng Hới in the southern sector of North Vietnam. The raids were in retaliation for a damaging Viet Cong attack on installations around Pleiku in South Vietnam. On 26 March, the Seventh Fleet units began their participation in Operation Rolling Thunder, a systematic bombing of military targets throughout North Vietnam. Pilots from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; struck island and coastal radar stations in the vicinity of Vinh. On 3 April Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force MiG-17s attacked aircraft from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and &quot;Hancock&quot; in the first United States aerial combat of the Vietnam conflict. A &quot;Coral Sea&quot; RF-8 took the first photographs of a North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile site on 5 April. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; remained on deployment until returning home on 1 November 1965.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; made another Westpac/Vietnam deployment from 29 July 1966 to 23 February 1967. 
On 25 October 1967, while &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin, a Zuni rocket ignited during a routine test in the forward assembly area. The accident resulted in nine sailors suffering burns, with three in critical condition. The injured were promptly flown to Clark Air Force Base for intensive treatment. The rocket motor caused damage when it tore into a bulkhead approximately 20 feet from the testing area; however, the flames were quickly extinguished by the crew, and the injured men were transported to the sick bay for emergency care. Despite the incident, damage to the ship was minimal, and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; remained fully operational. The carrier continued its scheduled operations, launching airstrikes the following morning before departing Yankee Station on 27 October.

In the summer of 1967, the city of San Francisco adopted the ship as &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s Own,&quot; and the city and ship enjoyed a formal, official relationship. However, there were probably many times the crew did not enjoy the attitudes of Bay Area residents at all. The feeling was mutual. In July 1968, prior to a deployment to Vietnam, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; participated in the carrier trials of the US Navy&#x27;s proposed new interceptor, the General Dynamics–Grumman F-111B.

The ship continued to make WestPac/Vietnam deployments until 1975: 26 July 1967 to 6 April 1968; 7 September 1968 to 15 April 1969; 23 September 1969 to 1 July 1970; 12 November 1971 to 17 July 1972; 9 March 1973 to 8 November; and from 5 December 1974 to 2 July 1975. Operations by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps aircraft in Vietnam expanded significantly throughout April 1972 with a total of 4,833 Navy sorties in the south and 1,250 in the north. &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, along with &quot;Hancock&quot;, was on Yankee Station when the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive began. They were joined in early April by and . On 16 April 1972, their aircraft flew 57 sorties in the Haiphong area in support of U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress strikes on the Haiphong petroleum products storage area in an operation known as Freedom Porch.

After refitting, from 1970 through to 1971, and during refresher training (REFTRA) down to San Diego, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on her return trip to Alameda caught fire in the communications department. The fire spread so fast that Captain William H. Harris commanded that the carrier be placed just offshore between San Mateo and Santa Barbara in order to abandon ship if the fire could not be put under control. Several communications personnel were trapped, and RM-2 Robert Bilbo and RM-3 Billy Larremore pulled many shipmates out of the burning and smoke-filled compartments. They received the Navy &amp; Marine Corp Medal. L/Cpl Thomas P Howard Jr. of ships Mar/Det received a &quot;Meritorious Mast&quot; from Captain Harris as a result of his location and rescue of shipmates overcome by toxic smoke in security weapon space. An OBA was L/Cpl Howard&#x27;s only breathing protection at the time.

Operation Pocket Money, the mining campaign against principal North Vietnamese ports, was launched 9 May 1972. Early that morning, an EC-121 aircraft took off from Da Nang Air Base to provide support for the mining operation. A short time later, &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; launched 17 ordnance-delivering sorties against the Nam Định railroad siding as a diversionary air tactic. Poor weather, however, forced the planes to divert to secondary targets. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; launched three A-6A Intruders and six A-7E Corsair II aircraft loaded with naval mines and one EKA-3B Skywarrior in support of the mining operation directed against the outer approaches to Haiphong Harbor. The mining aircraft departed the vicinity of &quot;Coral Sea&quot; timed to execute the mining at precisely 09:00 local time to coincide with President Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s public announcement in Washington that naval mines had been seeded. The Intruder flight led by the CAG, Commander Roger E. Sheets, was composed of Marine Corps aircraft from VMA-224 and headed for the inner channel. The Corsairs, led by Commander Leonard E. Giuliani and made up of aircraft from VA-94 and VA-22, were designated to mine the outer segment of the channel. Each aircraft carried four MK52-2 mines. Captain William R. Carr, USMC, the bombardier/navigator in the lead plane, established the critical attack azimuth and timed the naval mine releases. The first mine was dropped at 08:59 and the last of the field of 36 mines at 09:01. Twelve mines were placed in the inner harbor and the remaining 24 in the outer. All mines were set with 72-hour arming delays, thus permitting merchant ships time for departure or a change in destination consistent with the President&#x27;s public warning. It was the beginning of a mining campaign that planted over 11,000 MK36 type destructor and 108 special Mk 52-2 mines over the next eight months. It is considered to have played a significant role in bringing about an eventual peace arrangement, particularly since it so hampered the enemy&#x27;s ability to continue receiving war supplies.

==1971: Crewmen petition against the Vietnam War==
In 1971, widespread dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War led to an unusual action by at least 1000 crew members who formed the on-ship organization named Stop Our Ship (SOS) and signed a petition against the war. The petition stated that the signers &quot;do not believe in the Vietnam War&quot; and that &quot;Coral Sea&quot; &quot;should not go to Vietnam&quot;.

On 6 November 1971, over 300 men from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; marched in an anti-war demonstration in San Francisco and on 12 November 1971 around 600-1200 protestors demonstrated outside of Naval Air Station Alameda to encourage sailors to not sail with the ship. Thirty-five men missed her departure after the Berkeley City Council and 10 churches offered sanctuary. While this number is not unusual for a ship this size, at least one military service member sought sanctuary.

The petition and demonstrations by the sailors of &quot;Coral Sea&quot; were part of a larger movement of anti-war protests by military service members. Earlier in 1971, about 400 servicemen in Saigon signed a petition against the war, and nine sailors in Hawaii took sanctuary in a church and missed the sailing of the . (In contrast, the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; crewmen did not want their protest &quot;to be a thing like the &quot;Constellation&quot;&quot; and therefore likely were not looking for sanctuary.) &quot;These &#x27;flattop revolts&#x27; expanded the next year, as sailors signed petitions or disrupted operations on &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, , , , and . Sabotage on and prevented their scheduled port departures while aviators became increasingly concerned about their role in the bombing campaign and questioned the war openly.&quot;

==Paris Peace Accords, Fall of Saigon, Mayaguez incident==
The Paris Peace Accords, ending hostilities in Vietnam, were signed on 23 January 1973, ending four years of talks. North Vietnam released nearly 600 American prisoners by 1 April 1973, and the last U.S. combat troops departed Vietnam on 27 January 1973. However, the war was not over for the Vietnamese. By spring 1975, the North was advancing on the South. &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, , &quot;Hancock&quot;, , and responded on 19 April 1975 to the waters off South Vietnam when North Vietnam overran two-thirds of South Vietnam. On 29–30 April 1975, Operation Frequent Wind was carried out by Seventh Fleet forces. Hundreds of U.S. personnel and Vietnamese were evacuated from Saigon to the ships of the Seventh Fleet lying off Vũng Tàu. South Vietnam surrendered to the North on 30 April 1975.

On 12 to 14 May 1975, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; participated with other Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps forces in the Mayaguez incident, the recovery of the U.S. merchant ship SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and her 39 crew, illegally seized on 12 May in international waters by Khmer Rouge gunboats. Protective air strikes flown from the carrier against the Cambodian mainland naval and air installations as Air Force helicopters with 288 Marines from Battalion Landing Teams 2 and 9 were launched from U Tapao, Thailand, and landed at Koh Tang Island to rescue the &quot;Mayaguez&#x27;s&quot; crew and secure the ship. Eighteen Marines, Airmen, and Navy corpsmen were lost in the action. For her action, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation on 6 July 1976. Meanwhile, she had been reclassified as a &quot;Multi-Purpose Aircraft Carrier&quot;, returning to hull classification symbol CV-43, on 30 June 1975.

==Iran hostage crisis, final Western Pacific cruise==

On 4 November 1979, militant followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini (who had come to power following the overthrow of the Shah of Iran) seized the US Embassy in Tehran and held 63 Americans hostage. Thus began the Iran hostage crisis.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; relieved &quot;Midway&quot; in the northern part of the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Iran, on 5 February 1980. This operating area was nicknamed Gonzo Station by the men on the ships operating there, apparently because of its vicinity to Iran and the assumption that war with Iran was likely.

Later, along with and other ships in company, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; participated in Operation Evening Light, the unsuccessful and aborted rescue attempt of 24 April 1980. (Their aircraft played a supporting role.) The crew of &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and other ships in the company received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for their efforts. By the time the ship pulled into Subic Bay, the Philippines for a port call on 9 May 1980 the crew had spent 102 consecutive days at sea – mostly off the coast of Iran. (The Iran hostage crisis ended on 20 January 1981 when Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter as President of the United States and Iran released the Americans.)

At this time (1979–1981) the ship was commanded by Captain (later Admiral) Richard Dunleavy, who was to play a role in the Tailhook scandal, which forced him into retirement. However, while commanding &quot;Coral Sea&quot; he was considered an excellent commanding officer by his crew, who respected him greatly, even though they worked long, difficult hours under him and he could be a strict disciplinarian.

On 10 June 1980, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; returned to her homeport of Alameda. Shortly after her return, the San Francisco Bay Area press reported the theft of a set of golden bear statues from the ship. These statues had been presented by the city of San Francisco after the city had adopted the ship as &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s Own&quot;. Two sailors from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; were caught with the statues after attempting to sell them, and the sailors were subsequently court-martialed and sentenced to prison. All of the statues were recovered in good shape.

The ship embarked on her final Western Pacific deployment on 20 August 1981. After making port calls at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay, the Philippines, she operated in the South China Sea. After a port call at Singapore, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; headed to the Indian Ocean where she relieved at Gonzo Station and operated with Royal Navy units in GonzoEx 2-81 (17–23 November).

The &quot;Coral Sea&quot; battle group, under Rear Admiral Tom Brown, was involved in exercises with the Royal Navy under Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward – who operated with as his flagship. During one exercise, Woodward was able to manoeuver &quot;Glamorgan&quot; into a position where he could have &quot;sunk&quot; &quot;Coral Sea&quot; with Exocet missiles. The result of this exercise played a part in the belief of Admiral Woodward that the British should sink the Argentine cruiser because of the fear of a similar situation arising between that ship and the British aircraft carriers and during the Falklands War.

Later, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; participated in Exercise Bright Star 82, an exercise involving the defense of Egypt and the Suez Canal (4–9 December). Relieved on 17 December 1981 by , she departed Gonzo Station and called at Pattaya, Thailand after 98 consecutive days at sea. After departing Pattaya the ship called at Subic Bay and Hong Kong. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; then operated in the Sea of Japan before making a port call at Sasebo, Japan. After departing Japan &quot;Coral Sea&quot; made another port call at Subic Bay, then again at Pearl Harbor before steaming to California. The ship arrived at her home port of Alameda on 23 March 1982. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; then began upkeep, training, and operations off of California. In late July 1982, she served as a movie prop in the filming of portions of the motion picture &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

==World cruise, deployments to the Mediterranean, final years==

On 25 March 1983, &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, having been reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet, left Alameda for her new homeport of Norfolk. The Navy sent the ship on a six-month around-the-world cruise, with ports of call in five countries. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was replaced on the west coast by .

On 1 March 1984, Carrier Air Wing 13 was established. The wing would make three deployments aboard &quot;Coral Sea&quot; from 1 October 1985 to 30 September 1989.

On 11 April 1985, while on refresher training with her air wing in the Guantánamo Bay area, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; collided with the Ecuadorian tanker ship &quot;Napo&quot; and subsequently underwent two months of repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. This resulted in the skipper along with 4 other officers being relieved of duty.

On 13 October 1985, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; returned to the Mediterranean for her first Sixth Fleet deployment since 1957. Commanded by Captain Robert H. Ferguson, with CVW-13 embarked, it was also the first deployment of the new F/A-18 Hornet to the Mediterranean. The Hornets were assigned to VFA-131, VFA-132, VMFA-314 and VMFA-323 on &quot;Coral Sea&quot;.

On 2 January 1986, EA-6B Prowlers from VAQ-135 reported aboard. The Squadron was called on a &quot;No Notice Deployment&quot; by The Joint Chiefs of Staff to augment CVW-13 with Electronic Countermeasures/Jamming Support.

On 24 March 1986, Libyan Armed Forces units fired missiles at Sixth Fleet forces operating in the Gulf of Sidra after declaring international waters as their own. A missile (originating from an SA-5 missile site at Sirte) attack on CV-43&#x27;s aircraft (Prowler/Hornet package) conducting a &quot;Blue Darter&quot; fell short and dropped into the Mediterranean. VFA-131 F/A-18&#x27;s from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and flew combat air patrols, protecting the carrier groups from Libyan aircraft. The Hornets were frequently called upon to intercept and challenge numerous MiG-23s, MiG-25s, Su-22s, and Mirages sent out by Libya to harass the fleet.

On 5 April 1986, in response to the US show of force, the La Belle Discothèque in West Berlin, the Federal Republic of Germany was bombed, resulting in the death of one U.S. serviceman and many injured.

On 15 April 1986, aircraft from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and &quot;America&quot;, as well as USAF F-111Fs from RAF Lakenheath in the UK, struck targets in Libya as part of &quot;Operation El Dorado Canyon&quot;. The Hornets went into action for the first time, flying several ship-to-shore air strikes against Libyan shore installations that were harassing the fleet. During this action, the Hornets from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; attacked and destroyed the SA-5 missile site at Sirte which had been &quot;painting&quot; US aircraft on its radars. This was the combat debut for the Hornet, and incidentally marked the first combat use of the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missile. The Hornets attacked the SAM sites in bad weather and at wave top heights. All of them returned without mishap.

&quot;Coral Sea&quot; continued deployments to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean area throughout the remainder of the 1980s. In 1987, she developed the &quot;&quot;Coral Sea&quot; configuration&quot; in which two attack squadrons on board used a shared maintenance program, helping to streamline aircraft maintenance. On 19 April 1989, while conducting training in the Caribbean, the ship responded to a call for assistance from the battleship , due to an explosion in her number two gun turret in which 47 crew members were killed. The explosive ordnance disposal team from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; removed volatile powder charges from the ship&#x27;s 16 inch (406 mm) guns. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; also dispatched a surgical team and medical supplies. Medevac and logistical support to &quot;Iowa&quot; were provided by &quot;Coral Sea&quot;&#x27;s deployed helicopter squadron HS-17 (Neptune&#x27;s Raiders) flying the Sikorsky SH-3H, along with VC-8 flying the Sikorsky SH-3G aircraft from Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico.

After her last deployment to the Mediterranean, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; returned to Norfolk for the final time on 30 September 1989.

==Decommissioning and scrapping==

After nearly 43 years of service, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was decommissioned on 26 April 1990. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register two days later. She left Naval Station Norfolk on 2 November 1990 under tow from USNS &quot;Apache&quot;. &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was moored at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to await her fate. On 7 May 1993, she was sold for scrap, minus her electronics, weapons, and other usable equipment, by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) to Seawitch Salvage of Baltimore. Scrapping was delayed by numerous financial, legal, and environmental issues. A series of articles by the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; about the problems involved with the scrapping of the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and other navy vessels earned it the 1998 Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting. At nearly 70,000 tons, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was the largest vessel ever scrapped up to that date. The company attempted to sell the hull to China for scrapping, but the Navy blocked the sale in court. The scrapping continued off and on for several years until finally completed on 8 September 2000.

One of her anchors is now on display in the Battle of Coral Sea Memorial, Townsville, Australia. It was presented to the memorial on 8 May 1992, by the Commander of the 7th Fleet and former commanding officer of &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, Vice Admiral Stanley R. Arthur. The other anchor is at the Citadel in Charleston SC.

<text>USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; (CVB/CVA/CV-42) was the second of three s. To her crew, she was known as &quot;&quot;Swanky Franky&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Foo-De-Roo&quot;,&quot; or &quot;&quot;Rosie&quot;,&quot; with the last nickname probably the most popular. &quot;Roosevelt&quot; spent most of her active deployed career operating in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the United States Sixth Fleet. The ship was decommissioned in 1977 and was scrapped shortly afterward. She was the first aircraft carrier of the United States Navy to be named in honor of a president of the United States.

== Early career ==
&quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; was laid down at New York Naval Shipyard on 1 December 1943. Sponsor Mrs. John H. Towers, wife of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, christened the ship &quot;Coral Sea&quot; at the 29 April 1945 launching. On 8 May 1945, President Harry S. Truman approved the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s recommendation to rename the ship &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; in honor of the late president, who had died four weeks earlier.

&quot;Roosevelt&quot; was commissioned on Navy Day, 27 October 1945, at the New York Naval Shipyard. Capt. Apollo Soucek was the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. During her shakedown cruise, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; called at Rio de Janeiro from 1 to 11 February 1946 to represent the United States at the inauguration of Brazilian president Eurico Gaspar Dutra, who came aboard for a short cruise. During April and May, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; participated in Eighth Fleet maneuvers off the East Coast, the Navy&#x27;s first major postwar training exercise.

On 21 July 1946, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; became the first American carrier to operate an all-jet aircraft under controlled conditions. Lieutenant Commander James Davidson, flying the McDonnell XFD-1 Phantom, made a series of successful take-offs and landings as &quot;Roosevelt&quot; lay off Cape Henry, Virginia. Jet trials continued in November, when Lt. Col. Marion E. Carl, USMC, made two catapult launches, four unassisted take-offs, and five arrested landings in a Lockheed P-80A.

Fleet maneuvers and other training operations in the Caribbean preceded &quot;Roosevelt&quot;&#x27;s first deployment to the Mediterranean, which lasted from August to October 1946. &quot;Roosevelt&quot;, flying the flag of Rear Admiral John H. Cassady, Commander, Carrier Division 1, led the U.S. Navy force that arrived in Piraeus on 5 September 1946. This visit showed U.S. support for the pro-Western government of Greece, which was locked in a civil war with Communist insurgents. The ship received thousands of visitors during her calls to many Mediterranean ports. This was the first of twenty Mediterranean deployments &quot;Roosevelt&quot; would make, initiating an American aircraft carrier presence that would develop into the United States Sixth Fleet.

&quot;Roosevelt&quot; returned to American waters and operated off the East Coast until July 1947, when her open bow was destroyed by a storm, which forced her to go to Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul. At that time, her quad 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns were replaced by 40 Mark 22 guns in Mark 33 twin mountings.

From September 1948 to January 1949, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; undertook a second tour of duty with U.S. Naval Forces, Mediterranean. In 1950, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; became the first carrier to take nuclear weapons to sea. In September and October 1952, she participated in Operation Mainbrace, the first major NATO exercise in the North Atlantic. &quot;Roosevelt&quot; operated with other major fleet units, including the aircraft carriers , , and , as well as the battleships and .

&quot;Roosevelt&quot; was reclassified CVA-42 on 1 October 1952. On 7 January 1954, she sailed for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to undergo extensive reconstruction. Too large to pass through the Panama Canal, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; rounded Cape Horn and arrived at the shipyard on 5 March 1954. She was temporarily decommissioned there for her refit on 23 April 1954.

== Refit ==

&quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; was the first of her class to undergo the SCB 110 reconstruction, at a cost of $48 million. She received an enclosed &quot;hurricane bow,&quot; one C-11-2 and two C-11-1 steam catapults, strengthened arresting gear, an enlarged bridge, a mirror landing system, and a angled flight deck. SPS-8 height finding radar and SPS-12 air search radar were mounted on a new tubular mast. The aft elevator was relocated to the starboard deck edge, the forward elevator was enlarged, and all elevators were uprated to capacity. Aviation fuel bunkerage was increased from 350,000 to 450,000 gallons (1,320,000 to 1,700,000 L). Standard displacement rose to 51,000 tons, while deep load displacement rose to 63,400 tons. As weight compensation, several of the Mark 16 anti-aircraft guns were removed, leaving only 10, and the 3,200-ton armor belt was removed. Hull blisters were also added to cope with the increased weight. &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; recommissioned on 6 April 1956.

After post-refit trials, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; sailed for her new homeport of Mayport, Florida. In February 1957, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; conducted cold weather tests of catapults, aircraft, and the Regulus guided missile, in the Gulf of Maine. In July, she sailed for the first of three consecutive Sixth Fleet deployments. Her assignments in the Mediterranean added NATO exercises to her normal schedule of major fleet operations, and found her entertaining a distinguished list of guests each year.

During a 1958 mid-year overhaul, the 22 remaining guns were removed.

On 24 October 1958, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; supported in the evacuation of 56 American citizens and three foreign nationals from Nicaragua, Cuba, as the Cuban Revolution came to a climax.

In late 1960, the Control Instrument Company installed the first production Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS) onboard &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;. She recorded her 100,000th aircraft landing in March 1961. During a 1963 overhaul, six more guns were removed.

While operating in the Eastern Mediterranean in the fall of 1964, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; lost a blade from one of her 20-ton propellers. She proceeded from Naples, Italy, to New York with the number one shaft locked. After replacing the propeller at Bayonne, New Jersey, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; returned to the Mediterranean to complete her cruise.

From August 1966 to January 1967, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; made her only deployment to Southeast Asia, spending a total of 95 days &quot;on the line.&quot; Her embarked airwing, Carrier Air Wing One, consisted mainly of F-4 Phantom IIs and A-4 Skyhawks. &quot;Roosevelt&quot; received one battle star for her service during the Vietnam War.

In January 1968, Italian actress Virna Lisi was invited by &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;″s crew to participate in the ship&#x27;s 22nd birthday celebrations. Lisi helped prepare 5,000 T-bone steaks at a large cook-out staged on the flight deck.

== Austere modernization ==

&quot;Roosevelt&quot; was initially slated to undergo an extensive reconstruction (SCB 101.68) similar to that received by &quot;Midway&quot; from 1966 to 1970. This plan was derailed by massive cost overruns in &quot;Midway&quot;″s reconstruction, which eventually totalled $202 million. 

&quot;Roosevelt&quot; was therefore limited to an austere $46 million refit (SCB 103.68), enabling her to operate the Grumman A-6 Intruder and LTV A-7 Corsair II. In July 1968, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her 11-month modernization program. The forward centerline elevator was relocated to the starboard deck edge forward of the island, the port waist catapult was removed, the crew spaces were refurbished, and all of the four remaining anti-aircraft turrets were removed. The Roosevelt set sail with 4 - 5&quot; guns, 2 on either side controlled by 3 Mk 56 Gunfire control systems and one Mk 37 System. &quot;Roosevelt&quot; also received a deck edge spray system using the new seawater compatible fire-fighting chemical, Light Water. She put to sea again on 26 May 1969.

From 1 August 1969, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; embarked Carrier Air Wing Six, which served as the ship&#x27;s air wing for the next seven cruises. In January 1970, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; returned to the Mediterranean for another Sixth Fleet deployment.

&quot;Roosevelt&quot;″s twenty-first Sixth Fleet deployment was marked by indirect participation in the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, as she served as a transit &quot;landing field&quot; for aircraft being delivered to Israel. The &quot;Roosevelt&quot; battlegroup, Task Force 60.2, also stood by for possible evacuation contingencies.

From 1973 through 1975, VAW-121 operated aboard &quot;Roosevelt&quot; as one of the last Grumman E-1 Tracer squadrons in the fleet. &quot;Roosevelt &quot; received a multipurpose designation, CV-42, on 30 June 1975, but she did not operate any anti-submarine aircraft. 

In June 1976, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; embarked VMA-231 with 14 AV-8A Harrier attack aircraft. The ship embarked Carrier Air Wing Nineteen for its final deployment, which lasted from October 1976 to April 1977. VMA-231 was on board for this deployment, which demonstrated that VTOL aircraft could be integrated into fixed wing air operations, although limited fuel capacity required careful scheduling of their launch and land cycles. The AV-8A concentrated hot exhaust impinging directly perpendicular to the fight deck was unusually destructive to painted non-skid surfaces, and blowing detached pieces of the non-skid coating about created a high risk of foreign object damage (FOD) to nearby jet engines. On 12 January 1977, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; collided with the Liberian grain freighter &quot;Oceanus&quot; while transiting the Strait of Messina. Both ships were able to proceed to port under their own power.

== Decommissioning and disposal ==

By the late 1970s, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; was in poor material condition. Deprived of the upgrades that &quot;Midway&quot; and had received, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; was the least modern and least capable of the class. Furthermore, &quot;Roosevelt&quot; used General Electric turbines, which gave persistent problems and reduced speed compared to the Westinghouse units used on the other ships. The Navy therefore chose to decommission &quot;Roosevelt&quot; when the second carrier, , entered service in 1977. &quot;Roosevelt&quot; completed her final cruise in April 1977. She was officially decommissioned on 30 September 1977. The decommissioning ceremony was held on 1 October 1977 and the ship was stricken from the Navy Directory on the same day. Efforts to preserve &quot;Roosevelt&quot; as a museum ship in New York City failed.

&quot;Roosevelt&quot;″s generally poor condition weighed against retaining her in the reserve fleet. Moreover, her low hangar height of limited the aircraft types that she could handle. It was reasoned that existing s could handle the same types of aircraft at lower cost. Some admirals also feared that if &quot;Roosevelt&quot; were retained, the Carter Administration would use her reactivation as a reason to cancel future &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers.

On 1 April 1978, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service sold the ship to River Terminal Development Company for $2.1 million. After usable equipment was removed from &quot;Roosevelt&quot; at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard&#x27;s Inactive Ships Facility, the carrier was towed to Kearny, New Jersey. She arrived on 3 May 1978 and was scrapped that year. One of USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;&#x27;s 5&quot;/54cal Mk.16 guns is on display at White Sands Missile Range Missile Park.

==Awards and decorations==

While the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon is retroactive to 15 August 1974, the USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; was scrapped before the award was ever established and would have had to still be in active service to have received the award.
