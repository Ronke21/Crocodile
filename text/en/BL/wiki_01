<text>The Historia Augusta (English: &quot;Augustan History&quot;) is a late Roman collection of biographies, written in Latin, of the Roman emperors, their junior colleagues, designated heirs and usurpers from 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the similar work of Suetonius, &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors, collectively known as the &quot;Scriptores Historiae Augustae&quot;, written during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in Ancient Rome. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain the life of a single emperor, but some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.

The true authorship of the work, its actual date, its reliability and its purpose have long been matters for controversy by historians and scholars ever since Hermann Dessau, in 1889, rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include the nature of the sources that it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations.

By the second decade of the 21st century, the consensus supported the position that there was only a single author, who wrote either in the late 4th century or the early 5th century, who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. There is further consensus that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus, in a complex allegorical game. Despite the conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and so is continually being re-evaluated. Modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.

==Title and scope==
The name &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; originated with Isaac Casaubon, who produced a critical edition in 1603, working from a complex manuscript tradition with a number of variant versions. The title as recorded on the &quot;Codex Palatinus&quot; manuscript, written in the 9th century, is &quot;Vitae Diversorum Principum et Tyrannorum a Divo Hadriano usque ad Numerianum Diversis compositae&quot; (&quot;The Lives of various Emperors and Tyrants from the Divine Hadrian to Numerian by Various Authors&quot;). It is assumed that the work may have been originally called &quot;de Vita Caesarum&quot; or &quot;Vitae Caesarum&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Caesars&quot;).

How widely the work was circulated in late antiquity is unknown, but its earliest known use was in a &quot;Roman History&quot; composed by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus in 485. Lengthy citations from it are found in authors of the 6th and 9th centuries, including Sedulius Scottus who quoted parts of the &quot;Marcus Aurelius&quot;, the &quot;Maximini&quot; and the &quot;Aurelian&quot; within his &quot;Liber de Rectoribus Christianis&quot;, and the chief manuscripts also date from the 9th or 10th centuries. The six &quot;Scriptores&quot; – &quot;Aelius Spartianus&quot;, &quot;Julius Capitolinus&quot;, &quot;Vulcacius Gallicanus&quot;, &quot;Aelius Lampridius&quot;, &quot;Trebellius Pollio&quot;, and &quot;Flavius Vopiscus (of Syracuse)&quot; – dedicate their biographies to Diocletian, Constantine and various private persons, and so ostensibly were all writing around the late 3rd and early 4th century. The first four &quot;scriptores&quot; are attached to the lives from Hadrian to Gordian III, while the final two are attached to the lives from Valerian to Numerian.

The biographies cover the emperors from Hadrian to Carinus and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilian and all but the end of the reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts, and it has been argued that biographies of Nerva and Trajan have also been lost at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of Suetonius&#x27; &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.

Despite devoting whole books to ephemeral or in some cases non-existent usurpers, there are no independent biographies of the factual, but short reigns of Emperors Quintillus and Florian, whose reigns are merely briefly noted towards the end of the biographies of their respective predecessors, Claudius Gothicus and Tacitus. For nearly 300 years after Casaubon&#x27;s edition, though much of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; was treated with some scepticism, it was used by historians as an authentic source – Edward Gibbon used it extensively in the first volume of the &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. However, &quot;in modern times most scholars read the work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date, however the fundamentalist view still has distinguished support. (...) The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; is also, unfortunately, the principal Latin source for a century of Roman history. The historian must make use of it, but only with extreme circumspection and caution.&quot;

== Textual transmission ==
Existing manuscripts and witnesses of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; fall into three groups:

# A manuscript of the first quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (&quot;Codex Palatinus&quot;), known as P, and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in this manuscript has several &quot;lacunae&quot; marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between &quot;Verus&quot; and &quot;Alexander&quot;, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in &quot;Carus&quot;. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.
# A group of 15th-century manuscripts, designated as Σ. Not only are the lives rearranged in chronological order, but the corruptions present in P have been subjected to drastic emendations or omitted altogether. Beginning with Ernst Hohl, some have asserted that the improvements in the text come from a source independent of P. Although admitting that &quot;this question still remains to be answered definitively&quot;, author Peter Marshall noted that research undertaken through to the 1980s had improved scholarly knowledge concerning the methods and abilities of early Italian humanists, and concludes by saying that &quot;the Σ manuscripts nowhere provide readings which are beyond the powers of the humanists active at the time.
# Three different sets of excerpts, one of which Theodor Mommsen suggested was possibly the work of Sedulius Scottus. How any are related to P is unclear.

In Marshall&#x27;s opinion, the best scholarly editions are those by H. Peter (Teubner, 2nd ed. 1884), and E. Hohl (Teubner, 1971, reissue of 1965 revised by Ch. Samberger &amp; W. Seyfarth).

A copy of the Codex Palatinus (possibly the one made for Petrarch in 1356) was the basis of the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of the &quot;History&quot;, published in Milan in 1475. A subsequent printed version (the Aldine edition) was published at Venice in 1516, and this was followed closely by an edition edited by Desiderius Erasmus, and published by Johann Froben in Basel in 1518.

==Debates on dating==

In 1776, Gibbon observed that there was something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer &#x27;Lampridius&#x27; (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by &#x27;Vopiscus&#x27;, who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305–306. Then, in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. 

In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six &quot;Scriptores&quot; as distinct persons and in favour of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Theodor Mommsen postulated a Theodosian &#x27;editor&#x27; of the &quot;Scriptores&quot;&#x27; work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter, editor of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; and of the &quot;Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae&quot;, proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th-century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate, useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Dessau&#x27;s original arguments received powerful restatement and expansion from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books to the subject and was prepared to date the writing of the work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus&#x27; history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; does in fact make reference to Ammianus&#x27; history.

Not all scholars have accepted the theory of a forger working around the last decades of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th. Arnaldo Momigliano and A. H. M. Jones were the most prominent 20th century critics of the Dessau-Syme theory amongst English-speaking scholars. Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as &quot;res iudicanda&quot; (i.e. &quot;a matter to be decided&quot;) and not as &quot;res iudicata&quot; (&quot;a matter that has been decided&quot;). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme&#x27;s arguments. 

For instance, the reference in the &quot;Life of Probus&quot; about the emperor&#x27;s descendants which has been taken to refer to Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as Petronius Probinus (consul in 341) and Petronius Probianus (consul in 322). Momigliano&#x27;s opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of Constantius II or Julian.

Other opinions included H Stern&#x27;s, who postulated that the &quot;History&quot; was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of Magnentius on behalf of the senatorial aristocracy who had supported the usurper. In the 21st century, Alan Cameron rebutted a number of Syme&#x27;s and Barnes&#x27; arguments for a composition date c. 395–400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.

==Authorship debate==
Linked to the problem of dating the composition of the &quot;History&quot; is the question about the authorship of the work. Taking the &quot;History&quot; at face value, there is clearly a division between the authors named prior and after the presence of the interrupting lacuna. For the first half of the &quot;History&quot;, four &quot;scriptores&quot; are present, and the biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion:
* Aelius Spartianus (7 lives): &quot;Hadrian&quot;, &quot;Aelius&quot;, &quot;Didius Julianus&quot;, &quot;Severus&quot;, &quot;Niger&quot;, &quot;Caracalla&quot; and &quot;Geta&quot;.
* Julius Capitolinus (9 lives): &quot;Antoninus&quot;, &quot;Marcus&quot;, &quot;Lucius Verus&quot;, &quot;Pertinax&quot;, &quot;Albinus&quot;, &quot;Macrinus&quot;, &quot;The Maximini&quot;, &quot;The Gordiani&quot;, and &quot;Maximus and Balbinus&quot;.
* Vulcacius Gallicanus (1 life): &quot;Avidius Cassius&quot;.
* Aelius Lampridius (4 lives): &quot;Commodus&quot;, &quot;Diadumenus&quot;, &quot;Heliogabalus&quot; and &quot;Severus Alexander&quot;.

Of these four, Spartianus and Gallicanus claim to be undertaking a complete set of imperial biographies from Julius Caesar onwards, while Lampridius&#x27; stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with the Gordians, Claudius II, Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian and the four rivals of Constantine. Capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in the &quot;History&quot;.

The second half of the &quot;History&quot; is divided between two &quot;scriptores&quot;. Unlike the first half, the emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically, and are divided roughly in half between the two &quot;scriptores&quot; in chronological sequence:
* Trebellius Pollio (4 lives): &quot;Valerian&quot;, &quot;Gallienus&quot;, &quot;Tyranni Triginta&quot; and &quot;Claudius&quot;.
* Flavius Vopiscus Syracusanus (5 lives): &quot;Aurelian&quot;, &quot;Tacitus&quot;, &quot;Probus&quot;, &quot;Quadrigae Tyrannorum&quot; and &quot;Carus, Carinus and Numerian&quot;.

In terms of any acknowledgement of the mutual existence between the &quot;scriptores&quot;, only Flavius Vopiscus, ostensibly writing in 305 or 306, refers to any of the other authors, specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius. None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their &#x27;colleagues&#x27;. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the &quot;Albinus&quot;, &quot;Maximini&quot; and &quot;Gordiani&quot; he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.

The theory that there was a single author, as initially postulated by Hermann Dessau, is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the &quot;scriptores&quot;. If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must have been involved in the project in order to select one &quot;scriptor&quot;&#x27;s life over another&#x27;s.

The presence of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodor Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of the second half of the &quot;History&quot;, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the &quot;History&quot; means they cannot have been written by the same author.

If the validity of six independent authors is accepted, there are still issues, as the way they approached their work shows similar themes and details. All six not only provide biographies for the emperors, but also for the &quot;Caesars&quot; and usurpers. They describe their work and approach in very similar language, and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers, such as Junius Cordus. They collectively share many errors, such as calling Diadumenianus &quot;Diadumenus&quot;. They share much idiosyncratic content and similar language, with particular focus on women, wine and military discipline, and were fixated on poor-quality plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors, for instance Verus was truthful, while Severus was a severe individual. 

The authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately. For instance, the authors all happen to use the word &quot;occido&quot; with respect to killing, a total of 42 occurrences, but only once do any of them use the alternative word of &quot;interficio&quot;. This ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre. Each of the six &quot;scriptores&quot; authored fictional lives for some of their biographies, all of them using fake sources, documents and acclamations.

It has been postulated that the names of the &quot;scriptores&quot; themselves are a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but the narrative itself. The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from Cicero&#x27;s writings, as is the name Capitolinus. The word &quot;vopiscus&quot; is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died &quot;in utero&quot;. This has been interpreted to refer to &quot;Flavius Vopiscus&quot; as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the &quot;History&quot;. Vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of Volcatius Sedigitus, who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two &quot;scriptores&quot;, Spartianus and Lampridius, have eluded interpretation.

It should also be noted that the results of recent computer-assisted stylistic analysis concerning the single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive:
&quot;Computer-aided stylistic analysis of the work has, however, returned ambiguous results; some elements of style are quite uniform throughout the work, while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship. To what extent this is due to the fact that portions of the work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear. Several computer analyses of the text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors. Many of them conclude that there was but a single author, but disagree on methodology. However, several studies done by the same team concluded there were several authors, though they were not sure how many.&quot;

==Primary and secondary Vitae==
A unique feature of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; is that it purports to supply the biographies not only of reigning Emperors, called &quot;primary lives&quot; by modern scholars, but also &quot;secondary lives&quot; of their designated heirs, junior colleagues, and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed the supreme power. Thus among the biographies of 2nd-century and early 3rd-century figures are included Hadrian&#x27;s heir Aelius Caesar, and the usurpers Avidius Cassius, Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, Caracalla&#x27;s brother Geta and Macrinus&#x27; son Diadumenianus. None of these pieces contain much in the way of solid information: all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction. The biography of Marcus Aurelius&#x27; colleague Lucius Verus, which Mommsen thought &#x27;secondary&#x27;, is rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by Syme as belonging to the &#x27;primary&#x27; series.

The &#x27;secondary&#x27; lives allowed the author to exercise freedom in the invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts. As the work proceeds the author&#x27;s inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the &quot;biographies&quot; of the &quot;Thirty Tyrants&quot;, whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under Gallienus. After the biography of Caracalla the &#x27;primary&#x27; biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to the &#x27;secondary&#x27; ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the &quot;Life of Caracalla&quot;.

The biography of Macrinus is notoriously unreliable, and after a partial reversion to reliability in the &quot;Life of Elagabalus&quot;, the &quot;Alexander Severus&quot;, one of the longest biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise philosopher king. Clearly the author&#x27;s previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – Herodian up to 238, and probably Dexippus in the later books, for the entire imperial period the &quot;Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte&quot; as well as Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Ammianus Marcellinus and Jerome – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.

Even where recognisable facts are present, their use in the &quot;History&quot; cannot be taken at face value. In the &quot;Life of Alexander Severus&quot;, the &quot;History&quot; makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip later banned the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true – the source of this is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who sourced it from the &quot;Kaisergeschichte&quot;), and the &quot;History&quot; even copies Victor&#x27;s style of moralising asides, which were not in the &quot;Kaisergeschichte&quot;. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the &quot;Kaisergeschichte&quot;.

==Genre and purpose==
Interpretations of the purpose of the &quot;History&quot; also vary considerably, some considering it a work of fiction or satire intended to entertain (perhaps in the vein of &quot;1066 and All That&quot;), others viewing it as a pagan attack on Christianity, the writer having concealed his identity for personal safety. Under this anti-Christianity theory, the lacuna covering the period from Philip the Arab through to the end of Valerian&#x27;s reign is seen as deliberate, as it freed the author from addressing Philip&#x27;s reign, as by the late 4th century, Philip was being claimed as a Christian emperor, as well as not discussing Decius and Valerian&#x27;s reigns, as they were well known persecutors of the Church. It avoided dealing with their fates, as Christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions. 

Where mentioned, both Decius and Valerian are viewed very positively by the author of the &quot;History&quot;. It is noted that the &quot;History&quot; also parodies Christian scripture. For instance, in the &quot;Life of Alexander Severus&quot; there is: &quot;It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea&quot;, while &quot;where, save at Rome, is there an imperial power that rules an empire?&quot; is considered to be a response to 2 Thessalonians 2:6–7.

Syme argued that it was a mistake to regard it as a historical work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the &quot;History&quot; is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a &#x27;rogue scholiast&#x27; catering to, and making fun of or parodying, the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. The &quot;History&quot; implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian.

In a passage on the &quot;Quadriga tyrannorum&quot; – the &#x27;four-horse chariot of usurpers&#x27; said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus – the &quot;History&quot; itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of &#x27;mythical history&#x27;: &quot;homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit&quot; (&#x27;the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction&#x27;). The term &quot;mythistoricis&quot; occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which &#x27;Flavius Vopiscus&#x27; records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.
Other examples of the work as a parody can be taken from the names of the &quot;Scriptores&quot; themselves. It has been suggested that &quot;Trebellius Pollio&quot; and &quot;Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius&quot; were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero&#x27;s letters and speeches in the 1st century BC. With respect to &quot;Trebellius Pollio&quot;, this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of Mark Antony who was mentioned in the Philippics (&quot;Phil&quot;, 11.14), and another reference to him in &quot;Epistulae ad Familiares&quot; along with the term &quot;Pollentiam&quot; reminded the &quot;History&#x27;s&quot; author of Asinius Pollio, who was a fellow plebeian tribune alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well. 

This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of &quot;Trebellius Pollio&quot; by &quot;Flavius Vopiscus&quot; at the start of the &quot;Life of Aurelian&quot;, with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar&#x27;s published &quot;Commentaries&quot;. Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the cognomen &quot;Fides&quot; for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts. Later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it is no coincidence that, in selecting the name &quot;Trebellius Pollio&quot;, the author is playing with the concepts of &quot;fides&quot; and &quot;fidelitas historica&quot; at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to &quot;Trebellius Pollio&quot; and &quot;Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius&quot;.

In the case of &quot;Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius&quot;, it was argued that it too was inspired by the Philippics&#x27; reference to &quot;Caesar Vopiscus&quot; (&quot;Phil&quot;, 11.11), with Cicero&#x27;s reference to Vopiscus immediately preceding his reference to Lucius Trebellius. The cognomen &quot;Syracusius&quot; was selected because Cicero&#x27;s &quot;In Verrem&quot; is filled with references to &quot;Syracusae&quot; and &quot;Syracusani&quot;. Further, in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Oratore&quot;, Cicero refers to Strabo Vopiscus as an authority on humour, during which he refers to the reputation of Sicilians when it came to humour, and Syracuse was one of the principal cities of Sicily. 

Such references were intended as a &quot;knowing wink&quot; to the readers of the &quot;History&quot;, who would recognise the mockery of the historical material by the author. This corresponds with David Rohrbacher&#x27;s view of the &quot;History&quot;, who maintains that the author has no political or theological agenda; rather that the &quot;History&quot; is the equivalent of a literary puzzle or game, with the reader&#x27;s understanding and enjoyment of the numerous elaborate and complicated allusions contained within it being the only purpose behind its existence.

In support of this theory, Rohrbacher provides an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus&#x27; work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II&#x27;s attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: &quot;si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret&quot; (&quot;For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint&quot;). There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the &quot;Life of Caracalla&quot; (5.7), which makes no sense in Caracalla&#x27;s time, and is worded in almost exactly the same way: &quot;qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent&quot; (&quot;wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever&quot;).

Other theories include André Chastagnol&#x27;s minimalist opinion that the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the &quot;History&quot; are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into the fabric of a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.

==Historical value==
From the sixth century to the end of the 19th century, historians had recognized that the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution. Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon&#x27;s account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the &quot;Historia Augusta&#x27;s&quot; biased and largely fictional account of that reign. So when Gibbon states &quot;The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul&quot;, he is reworking the passage in &quot;The Two Gallieni&quot;:

I am ashamed to relate what Gallienus used often to say at this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, he is said to have exclaimed &quot;What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!&quot; and when informed that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, &quot;What! We cannot do without saltpetre!&quot; and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, &quot;Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?&quot; Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.

Gibbon then noted after this passage: &quot;This singular character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus.&quot; Modern scholars now believe that Gallienus&#x27; reputation was posthumously maligned, that he was one of the main architects of the later Roman imperial structure, and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors.

Nevertheless, it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus, mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus, was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as praetorian prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was constructed during Hadrian&#x27;s reign and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.

===False documents and authorities===
A peculiarity of the work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages. In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians – it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself – and on the few occasions when historians, such as Sallust in his work on Catiline or Suetonius in his &quot;Twelve Caesars&quot;, include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine. Almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.

The &quot;History&quot; cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians, biographers, letter-writers, knowledgeable friends of the writers, and so on, most of whom must be regarded as expressions of the author&#x27;s creative imagination. For example, the biographer &quot;Cordus&quot; is cited twenty-seven times in the &quot;History&quot;. Long considered to be a real, but lost, biographer until midway into the 20th century, with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from Cordus is in reality from Suetonius or Cicero, every other citation is fake, providing details which have been invented and ascribed to Cordus. Cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those Vitae where the &quot;History&quot; used Herodian as the primary source, and his appearances vanish once Herodian&#x27;s history comes to an end.

The author also misattributes material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author. For instance, Herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in the &quot;History&quot;. In addition to the ten times he is correctly cited, three times his material is cited as &quot;Arrianus&quot;, probably to multiply the author&#x27;s sources. Not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation, either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations, he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.

Then there is the deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed to legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the &quot;History&#x27;s&quot; sixteen citations of Dexippus are considered to be fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the &quot;Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte&quot;. In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.

===Examples of false historical events and personages===
The untrustworthiness of the &quot;History&quot; stems from the multifarious kinds of fraudulent, as opposed to simply inaccurate, information that run through the work, becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds. The various biographies are ascribed to different invented &#x27;authors&#x27;, and continue with the dedicatory epistles to Diocletian and Constantine, the quotation of fabricated documents, the citation of non-historical authorities, the invention of persons, extending even to the subjects of some of the minor biographies, presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity, deliberately false statements, and the inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of the late 4th century rather than the period supposedly being written about. For example:
* The biography of Geta states he was born in Mediolanum on 27 May. The year is not specified but it was &#x27;in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius&#x27;. He was actually born in Rome on 7 March 189. There was no such pair of suffect consuls in this or any other year. It has been suggested that the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192.
* In the &quot;Vita Commodi&quot;, the biography on emperor Commodus, there is much doubt about the authenticity of the sources used and cited. Lampridius, the pseudonym the author works with here, claims to have used Marius Maximus on multiple occasions for his work. One instance forms a case in point: Lampridius supposedly quotes the senatorial speeches in Maximus’ work which were held after Commodus’ death. It is unclear whether the references to Maximus are genuine or made up by the author to give himself a sense of authority and expertise. Baldwin thinks that the senatorial speeches are probably a figment of Lampridius’ imagination. Molinier-Arbo believes in their authenticity. She suggests that the full report of the &quot;acta senatus&quot; (lit. acts of the senate) was handed down in the &quot;acta urbis&quot; (a kind of city gazette). Marius Maximus could have used this report for his work and Lampridius could have used it later on.
* A letter of Hadrian written from Egypt to his brother-in-law Servianus is quoted at length, and was accepted as genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century. Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his adopted son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus&#x27; consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter is said to have been published by Hadrian&#x27;s freedman Phlegon, with the letter&#x27;s existence not mentioned anywhere except in the &quot;History&quot;, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.
* Decius revives the office of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy to hold it in a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius, on campaign against the Goths, and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.
* Valerian holds an imperial council in Byzantium, attended by several named dignitaries, none of them otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general &#x27;Ulpius Crinitus&#x27;, a name apparently chosen to evoke the military glories of the Emperor Trajan, takes the young Aurelian, destined to be another military Emperor, as his adopted son. There are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention.
* In the &quot;Tyranni Triginta&quot;, the author &#x27;Trebellius Pollio&#x27; sets out to chronicle &#x27;the 30 usurpers who arose in the years when the Empire was ruled by Gallienus and Valerian&#x27;. The number 30 is evidently modelled on the notorious &#x27;Thirty Tyrants&#x27; who ruled Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War. The chapter contains 32 mini-biographies. They include two women, six youths, and seven men who never claimed the imperial power, one usurper of the reign of Maximinus Thrax, one of the time of Decius, and two of the time of Aurelian, and a number who are not historical personages: Postumus the Younger, Saturninus, Trebellianus, Celsus, Titus, Censorinus, and Victorinus Junior.
* In the &quot;Life of Tacitus&quot;, the emperor is acclaimed by the Senate, meeting in the &quot;Curia Pompiliana&quot;, which never existed. The &quot;History&quot; then lists a number of individuals, all of whom are invented by the author: the consul &#x27;Velius Cornificius Gordianus&#x27;, &#x27;Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus&#x27;, the Prefect of the City &#x27;Aelius Cesettianus&#x27;, and the Praetorian Prefect &#x27;Moesius Gallicanus&#x27;. Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators &#x27;Autronius Tiberianus&#x27; and &#x27;Claudius Sapilianus&#x27;, both of whom are assumed to be non-historical personages. Most of the &#x27;Maecii&#x27; and &#x27;Gallicani&#x27; in the &quot;History&quot; are believed to be inventions of the author.
* In the &quot;Quadrigae Tyrannorum&quot; (&quot;Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus&quot;), the author includes Firmus, said to have been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian. There is no certainty that this person ever existed. There was a &quot;Corrector&quot; named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province. Nevertheless, the &quot;History&#x27;s&quot; wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented. For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.
* In the &quot;Life of Probus&quot;, the author &#x27;Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse&#x27; states that the Emperor&#x27;s descendants (&quot;posteri&quot;) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers &#x27;that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts&#x27;, though Vopiscus, supposedly writing under Constantine, says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This is one of the strongest indications of the &quot;History&#x27;s&quot; late 4th-century date, as it seems to be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.

==Marius Maximus or &#x27;Ignotus&#x27;?==
Certain scholars have always defended the value of specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, has argued that the lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot;. As a result, his translation of the &quot;History&quot; for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as &quot;Lives of the Later Caesars&quot;, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these are not part of the original texts, which begin with Hadrian).

His view (part of a tradition that goes back to J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius&#x27; claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled &#x27;Ignotus (&quot;the unknown one&quot;), the good biographer&#x27;. 

His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the &quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot;, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that &quot;Princeps&quot; in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that &#x27;Ignotus&#x27; only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. 

Finally, that the composer of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; wrote the lives of the emperors through to the &quot;Life of Caracalla&quot;, including Lucius Verus, using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the &quot;Life of Geta&quot;.

A similar theory to Syme&#x27;s has been put forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was probably a satirical poet, in the same vein as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the &quot;History&quot;, the only extant referencing of Marius&#x27; work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the &quot;History&#x27;s&quot; description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.

==Literary value==
The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; has been described by Ronald Syme as &quot;the most enigmatic work that Antiquity has transmitted&quot;. Although much of the focus of study throughout the centuries has been on the historical content, since the 20th century there has also been an assessment of the literary value of the work. For much of that time the assessment has been critical, as demonstrated by the analysis put forward by David Magie:

The literary, as well as the historical, value of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; has suffered greatly as a result of the method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.

M. L. W. Laistner was of the opinion that &quot;even if the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; was propaganda disguised as biography, it is still a wretched piece of literature&quot;, while Ronald Syme noted that with respect to the author&#x27;s Latin prose:

He was not an elegant exponent. His normal language is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions ... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.

Further, the work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees an example of the carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius&#x27; biography, where midway through the &quot;Life of Marcus Aurelius&quot; the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus&#x27;. 

The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus&#x27; principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative&#x27;s ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus&#x27; reign after the death of Verus.

Although these criticisms still form the prevailing view on the &quot;History&#x27;s&quot; literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, making it one of the most unusual pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.

<text>Emil Constantinescu (; born 19 November 1939) is a Romanian professor and politician, who served as the President of Romania, from 1996 to 2000.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Constantinescu became a founding member and vice president of the Civic Alliance (AC). In addition, he also served as the acting president of the &quot;Democratic Romanian Anti-Totalitarian Forum&quot;, the first associative structure of the democratic opposition in post-1989 Romania, which was later transformed into a centre-right political and electoral alliance known as the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR). He had also subsequently presided the People&#x27;s Action (AP) party from the early 2000s until it merged into the National Liberal Party (PNL) in 2008. Nowadays, Constantinescu remains involved in Romanian politics solely to a limited extent.

== Early life and education ==
Emil Constantinescu was born on November 19, 1939, in Tighina, Ținutul Nistru, Kingdom of Romania, which today is named Bender and &quot;de facto&quot; part of Transnistria. His mother, Maria Georgeta Colceag, was born in Ploiești on April 24, 1916, and, after graduating from high school, was a student at the Bucharest Conservatory in the harp class, but gave up her career in music to follow her husband, Ion Constantinescu. He was originally from Oltenia, he had 8 brothers, and after becoming an agronomist engineer, he was assigned to Bessarabia. The Constantinescu family took refuge in 1943 in Brădetu village, Argeș County where Emil Constantinescu spent his childhood. His sister, Marina, was born in 1942, and in 1946, his brother, Cristian, was born.

In the period 1953–1956 Emil Constantinescu was a student of the &quot;Nicolae Bălcescu&quot; High School in Pitești (currently Colegiu IC Bratianu) and obtained his Matriculation Diploma on July 19, 1956, in the same year he enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University Bucharest. He obtained a Diploma in Legal Sciences in 1960 and after completing his military internship in Piatra Neamț, he began his work as a trainee judge at the Pitesti Regional Court, economic section. The political climate causes him to give up this position and become a student at the Faculty of Geology – Geography, between 1961 and 1966. He holds a PhD in Geology from the University of Bucharest and a Doctor of Sciences from Duke University, US. In 1963, he married Nadia Ileana, a lawyer, who was his colleague at the Faculty of Law in Bucharest. His father died in 1991 and his mother died at Elias Hospital on November 25, 2011.

== Professional career ==

He went through all stages of his university career as an assistant and lecturer at the Faculty of Geology (1966–1990). Since 1991 onwards, he is a professor of Mineralogy at the University of Bucharest. He was also a visiting professor at Duke University in the United States between 1991 and 1992. He was elected vice-rector (1990–1992) and rector (1992–1996) of the University of Bucharest; president of the National Council of Rectors from Romania (1992–1996); member of the Permanent Committee of the Association of European Universities – CRE (1992–1993; 1994–1998); member of the International Association of University Presidents – IAUP (1994–1996).

== Political activity (1990–1996) ==

After the fall of the communist dictatorship, he engaged along with other university colleagues and renowned Romanian intellectuals in the effort to re-democratize Romania, in the defense of fundamental human rights and freedoms as well as in the establishment of the civil society. He was one of the personalities who protested against the anti-democratic actions of the new authorities during a 42-day rally, between April and May 1990, in Bucharest&#x27;s University Square.

After the bloody violence committed by the miners who, at the call of the then president Ion Iliescu, invaded Bucharest in June 1990, he founded, together with his colleagues, professors, and students, the association &quot;Solidaritatea Universitară&quot; (i.e. &quot;Academic Solidarity&quot;).

He was also a founding member and vice-president of the Civic Alliance (1990), the most important non-governmental organization in the country, and president of the Civic Academy. These associations joined the opposition democratic parties and together formed the Romanian Democratic Convention (or CDR for short) in 1991. At the proposal of the Academic Solidarity, supported by the Civic Alliance (PAC), Emil Constantinescu was designated the CDR candidate in the presidential elections of 1992. He entered the second round and obtained 38% of the votes in the confrontation with then incumbent president Ion Iliescu who was supported by the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN). After this first important political experience, the CDR elected, in 1992, its president and sole candidate for the presidential elections of 1996 (which was represented by Constantinescu). He continued to act to strengthen the democratic opposition throughout this period of time from 1992 until 1996, alongside other notable CDR political leaders.

== Presidency (1996–2000) ==

In 1996, he competed once again for the presidency as the CDR&#x27;s candidate and managed to defeat Iliescu in the second round, securing a victory by a margin of roughly 10%. CDR&#x27;s success in the 1996 general election marked the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania. On the day he took office, he suspended his membership from the PNȚ-CD, as the Constitution precludes a president holding formal membership of a political party during his term(s).

Throughout his sole four-year term, Constantinescu struggled with the ineffective implementation of the processes of privatization, which, bogged down by excessive bureaucracy, increased unemployment and poverty in the short term. After another two Mineriads which took place in 1999 (one in January and the other in February), culminating with the arrest of Miron Cozma, the remainder of his term suffered a political crisis between the majority parties that, at the time, formed the governing coalition (i.e. CDR, PD, PSDR, and UDMR/RMDSZ). The country was further damaged by a drought in 2000. At the end of his term in 2000, he decided not to run for re-election, stating that the system had defeated him.

One of the last gestures made as president of Romania was the pardon of Ion Coman, the one who had led the repression of the 1989 revolution in Timișoara.

== Post-presidency ==
Constantinescu&#x27;s presidency along with CDR&#x27;s governance were marred by an economic recession. Despite this, his presidency has been eventually credited with putting an end to the Mineriads, a reform of the banking system as well as with the attraction of the first major foreign investments in Romania after 1989. With dashed expectations of an immediate improvement in daily life, Romanians exhibited strong disillusionment with the major parties and politicians of the CDR at the end of the 1996–2000 legislature, with the Greater Romania Party (PRM) subsequently gaining the second place in the 2000 legislative election.

A disenchanted Emil Constantinescu, who lost popularity and had failed to fulfil his reformist agenda announced on 17 July 2000 that he would not run for a second term. He temporarily withdrew from political life at the end of his term in November 2000. Constantinescu&#x27;s direction in foreign affairs continued however after the comeback of Ion Iliescu in 2000. Eventually, Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union (EU) three years later, in 2007, alongside Bulgaria.

The former president returned to the political scene in 2002 as head of the People&#x27;s Action (AP; &quot;Acţiunea Populară&quot;) party, which subsequently merged within the National Liberal Party (PNL) in 2008.

Constantinescu had occasionally criticized the policies of the 2004–2014 president, Traian Băsescu, accusing him of authoritarian tendencies, and supported Crin Antonescu in the first round of the 2009 presidential elections.

Nowadays, he still remains heavily involved in politics through working for many NGOs, both in Romania and internationally. Emil Constantinescu is the current president of the Association of Citizenship Education, of the Romanian Foundation for Democracy and also the founding president of the Institute for Regional Cooperation and Conflict Prevention (INCOR).

A frequent speaker at the Oslo Freedom Forum, in 2010 he presented the OFF with a presidential medal. He is also a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

<doc id="393372" wikidata="Q914780" url="?curid=393372" title="Graham scan">
<text>Graham&#x27;s scan is a method of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane with time complexity O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;). It is named after Ronald Graham, who published the original algorithm in 1972. The algorithm finds all vertices of the convex hull ordered along its boundary. It uses a stack to detect and remove concavities in the boundary efficiently.

== Algorithm ==

The first step in this algorithm is to find the point with the lowest y-coordinate. If the lowest y-coordinate exists in more than one point in the set, the point with the lowest x-coordinate out of the candidates should be chosen. Call this point &quot;P&quot;. This step takes O(&quot;n&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of points in question.

Next, the set of points must be sorted in increasing order of the angle they and the point &quot;P&quot; make with the x-axis. Any general-purpose sorting algorithm is appropriate for this, for example heapsort (which is O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;)).

Sorting in order of angle does not require computing the angle. It is possible to use any function of the angle which is monotonic in the interval formula_1 . The cosine is easily computed using the dot product, or the slope of the line may be used. If numeric precision is at stake, the comparison function used by the sorting algorithm can use the sign of the cross product to determine relative angles.

If several points are of the same angle, either break ties by increasing distance (Manhattan or Chebyshev distance may be used instead of Euclidean for easier computation, since the points lie on the same ray), or delete all but the furthest point.

The algorithm proceeds by considering each of the points in the sorted array in sequence. For each point, it is first determined whether traveling from the two points immediately preceding this point constitutes making a left turn or a right turn. If a right turn, the second-to-last point is not part of the convex hull, and lies &#x27;inside&#x27; it. The same determination is then made for the set of the latest point and the two points that immediately precede the point found to have been inside the hull, and is repeated until a &quot;left turn&quot; set is encountered, at which point the algorithm moves on to the next point in the set of points in the sorted array minus any points that were found to be inside the hull; there is no need to consider these points again. (If at any stage the three points are collinear, one may opt either to discard or to report it, since in some applications it is required to find all points on the boundary of the convex hull.)

Again, determining whether three points constitute a &quot;left turn&quot; or a &quot;right turn&quot; does not require computing the actual angle between the two line segments, and can actually be achieved with simple arithmetic only. For three points formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4, compute the &quot;z&quot;-coordinate of the cross product of the two vectors formula_5 and formula_6, which is given by the expression formula_7. If the result is 0, the points are collinear; if it is positive, the three points constitute a &quot;left turn&quot; or counter-clockwise orientation, otherwise a &quot;right turn&quot; or clockwise orientation (for counter-clockwise numbered points).

This process will eventually return to the point at which it started, at which point the algorithm is completed and the stack now contains the points on the convex hull in counterclockwise order.

== Time complexity ==

Sorting the points has time complexity O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;). 
While it may seem that the time complexity of the loop is O(&quot;n&quot;2), because for each point it goes back to check if any of the previous points make a &quot;right turn&quot;, it is actually O(&quot;n&quot;), because each point is considered at most twice in some sense.
Each point can appear only once as a point formula_8 in a &quot;left turn&quot; (because the algorithm advances to the next point formula_9 after that),
and as a point formula_8 in a &quot;right turn&quot; (because the point formula_8 is removed). The overall time complexity is therefore O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), since the time to sort dominates the time to actually compute the convex hull.

== Pseudocode ==
The pseudocode below uses a function ccw: ccw &gt; 0 if three points make a counter-clockwise turn, ccw &lt; 0 if clockwise, and ccw = 0 if collinear. (In real applications, if the coordinates are arbitrary real numbers, the function requires exact comparison of floating-point numbers, and one has to beware of numeric singularities for &quot;nearly&quot; collinear points.)

Then let the result be stored in the codice_1.

 let points be the list of points
 let stack = empty_stack()
 find the lowest y-coordinate and leftmost point, called P0
 sort points by polar angle with P0, if several points have the same polar angle then only keep the farthest
 for point in points:
 # pop the last point from the stack if we turn clockwise to reach this point
 while count stack &gt; 1 and ccw(next_to_top(stack), top(stack), point) &lt;= 0:
 pop stack
 push point to stack
 end

Now the stack contains the convex hull, where the points are oriented counter-clockwise and P0 is the first point.

Here, codice_2 is a function for returning the item one entry below the top of stack, without changing the stack, and similarly, codice_3 for returning the topmost element.

This pseudocode is adapted from &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;.

== Notes ==
The same basic idea works also if the input is sorted on x-coordinate instead of angle, and the hull is computed in two steps producing the upper and the lower parts of the hull respectively. This modification was devised by A. M. Andrew. It has the same basic properties as Graham&#x27;s scan.

Graham&#x27;s original description involved sorting around an interior point of the convex hull, rather than one of its vertices. For the same choice of a pivot point for the sorting algorithm, connecting all of the other points in their sorted order around this point rather than performing the remaining steps of the Graham scan produces a star-shaped polygon, a polygonalization of the input.

The stack technique used in Graham&#x27;s scan is very similar to that for the all nearest smaller values problem, and parallel algorithms for all nearest smaller values may also be used (like Graham&#x27;s scan) to compute convex hulls of sorted sequences of points efficiently.

==Numerical robustness==

Numerical robustness is an issue to deal with in algorithms that use finite-precision floating-point computer arithmetic. A 2004 paper analyzed a simple incremental strategy, which can be used, in particular, for an implementation of the Graham scan. The stated goal of the paper was not to specifically analyze the algorithm, but rather to provide a textbook example of what and how may fail due to floating-point computations in computational geometry. Later D. Jiang and N. F. Stewart elaborated on this and using the backward error analysis made two primary conclusions. The first is that the convex hull is a well-conditioned problem, and therefore one may expect algorithms which produce an answer within a reasonable error margin. Second, they demonstrate that a modification of Graham scan which they call Graham-Fortune (incorporating ideas of Steven Fortune for numeric stability) does overcome the problems of finite precision and inexact data &quot;to whatever extent it is possible to do so&quot;.

<text>Statue Square (; lit. &quot;Empress&#x27; Statue Square&quot;) is a public pedestrian square in Central, Hong Kong. Built entirely on reclaimed land at the end of the 19th century, Statue Square consists of two parts separated by Chater Road into a northern and a southern section. It is bordered by Connaught Road Central in the north and by Des Voeux Road Central in the south.

The name is a reference to the statues, mainly of British royalty, which stood on the square until the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II. Today, the only statue on the square is the one of Sir Thomas Jackson, 1st Baronet, an early HSBC banker.

==History==
The square was built at the end of the nineteenth century on land reclaimed by the Praya Reclamation Scheme. The idea of a square of statues dedicated to royalty was conceived by Sir Catchick Paul Chater. Initially named &quot;Royal Square&quot;, it gradually became known as &quot;Statue Square&quot;, as it originally contained the statue of Queen Victoria, in commemoration of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887. The statue of the Queen should have been made not in bronze but in marble, an error that was not discovered until the bronze statue was almost completed. It was officially unveiled at the centre of the square on 28 May 1896, the day officially appointed for the celebration of the 77th birthday of the Queen.

A statue of Sir Thomas Jackson, 1st Baronet, the chief manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was unveiled in 1906. Apart from Jackson&#x27;s statue and the two bronze lions in front of the HSBC building, the rest of the statues were displaced to Japan to be melted by the Japanese occupiers during World War II.

The Cenotaph, a replica of the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, was unveiled on 24 May 1923 (Empire Day) by the Governor Sir Reginald Edward Stubbs. It was built on the northeastern section of Statue Square, facing the Hong Kong Club Building. This area is now only uncommonly referred to as part of Statue Square.

After the war, some of the statues were brought back to Hong Kong. Sir Thomas Jackson&#x27;s now stands roughly in the middle of the square, facing the Court of Final Appeal Building. Queen Victoria&#x27;s statue was placed in Victoria Park, and the two HSBC lions returned to the front of the HSBC building. The bronze statue of George V, also removed by the Japanese, was lost and never replaced after the war.

Since the 1980s, it has been a tradition for thousands of Filipina domestic workers to congregate in and around Statue Square every Sunday, their usual rest day of the week. A parallel tradition has since been developed in Victoria Park for Indonesian domestic helpers in Hong Kong.

==Surrounding buildings==
;South
The HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building is located along the southern side of the square, across Des Voeux Road Central. The site was previously occupied by the old City Hall (built 1869, demolished 1933) and smaller earlier generations of the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building.
;East
* Legislative Council Building, along the eastern side of the southern section of the square
* Hong Kong Club Building, along the eastern side of the northern section of the square
;West
Several buildings with names reminiscent of British royalty were built on the western side of the square. Prince&#x27;s Building and Queen&#x27;s Building were built directly along the square (southern section and northern section respectively), while the others were built further west.
* Prince&#x27;s Building 1904–1963, replaced by the current Prince&#x27;s Building (1965)
* Queen&#x27;s Building 1899–1961, replaced by the Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong hotel (1963)
* King&#x27;s Building 1905–1958, home to Marconi Wireless and now part of the footprint for Chater House
* St George&#x27;s Building (聖佐治大廈) 1904–1966, home to Millington Limited and replaced by the current St. George&#x27;s Building office tower (1969)
* Alexandra Building (亞歷山大行) 1904–1950, named for Princess of Wales, later Queen Alexandra, replaced by modernist Alexandra Building (1952–1974) and now Alexandra House (歷山大廈) (1976)
;North
The square was initially bordered by Victoria Harbour on its northern side, but following land reclamation, it is now separated from it by Edinburgh Place, which housed the Star Ferry pier, among others, until 2007.

==The statues==
Today, the only freestanding statue on the Square is the statue of Sir Thomas Jackson. Additionally, a 2.7 m high blind-folded statue of Themis, the Greek Goddess of Justice and Law, stands on top of the pediment of the Court of Final Appeal Building, and is facing the Square. The statues that have been historically on display on the square include:
* Statue of Queen Victoria. Unveiled on 28 May 1896. Taken by the Japanese during World War II and returned to Hong Kong in 1952. It is now in Victoria Park.
* Statue of Prince Albert, added before 1902.

Erected by public subscription following his death at sea in 1883, it was unveiled in November 1887 by the newly arrived Governor William Des Vœux and stood &quot;above the second terrace looking down on the fountain&quot;. It was removed during the Japanese occupation, and never recovered.
* Statue of King George VI, in Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens. Erected in 1941 and still standing.

<doc id="393375" wikidata="Q3270129" url="?curid=393375" title="Admiralty, Hong Kong">
<text>Admiralty () is the eastern extension of the central business district (adjacent to, but separate from, Central) on the Hong Kong Island of Hong Kong. It is located on the eastern end of the Central and Western District, bordered by Wan Chai to the east and Victoria Harbour to the north.

The name of &quot;Admiralty&quot; refers to the former Admiralty Dock in the area which housed a naval dockyard. The dock was later demolished when land was reclaimed and developed northward as the naval base . The Cantonese name, &quot;Kam Chung&quot; (), &quot;Golden Bell&quot;, refers to a gold-coloured bell that was used for timekeeping at Wellington Barracks.

==History==
The area was developed as a military area by the British military in the 19th century. They built the Wellington Barracks, Murray Barracks, Victoria Barracks and Admiralty Dock at the site. Following the urbanisation of the north shore of Hong Kong Island, the military area split the urban area. The Hong Kong Government tried many times to get the land from the British military to connect the two urban areas, but the military refused. It was not until the 1970s that the land was gradually returned to government and changed to commercial buildings and gardens.

The Admiralty station of the MTR was built on the former site of the Hong Kong dockyards which was built in 1878 and demolished in the 1970s. After its completion, the area became increasingly known as Admiralty, rather than Central.

During the 2014 Hong Kong protests (aka &quot;Umbrella Revolution&quot;), substantial tracts of the area were occupied by suffragists, who dubbed it Umbrella Square.

Admiralty was also a focal point in the 2019 Hong Kong extradition law protests.

==Features==
Buildings in Admiralty consist primarily of office buildings, government buildings, shopping malls and hotels. There are also several parks in the area: Hong Kong Park, Tamar Park and Harcourt Garden.

The main development of the area in recent years has been the development of the Tamar site into the Central Government Complex, which started operating in 2011. Facing Victoria Harbour, the complex houses the Office of the Chief Executive, the Legislative Council Complex and the Central Government Offices.

As one of the main financial areas in Hong Kong, there are plenty of Grade-A commercial buildings in Admiralty including:
* Admiralty Centre
* Asia Society Hong Kong Centre, housed in the former Former Explosive Magazine of the Victoria Barracks
* Bank of America Tower
* Bank of China Tower
* British Consulate General Hong Kong
* Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building
* CITIC Tower
* Cheung Kong Centre 
* High Court Building
* Lippo Centre, which houses the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
* Pacific Place, a complex featuring a shopping mall, several hotels and office towers, that opened in Admiralty in phases between 1988 and 1991. The complex is connected to the MTR Admiralty station via an underground walkway. A later phase, Three Pacific Place, is located in Wan Chai
* Queensway Government Offices
* Queensway Plaza, a shopping centre located above Admiralty station
* United Centre

==Transport==
Queensway and Harcourt Road are the major roads in the area. Both roads run from west to east and connect Central to Wan Chai. Other streets include Rodney Street and Tim Mei Avenue. Trams are running across Admiralty along Queensway. Most of the buildings of the area are connected through the Central Elevated Walkway, an extensive footbridge network which extends to the western part of Central.

The area is served by the peaktram and Admiralty station of the MTR. It is an interchange station between Island line, Tsuen Wan line, South Island line and East Rail line. The Admiralty (East) Public Transport Interchange, a major bus terminus, is located above the station.

==Economy==

Corporations headquartered in Admiralty include:
* Everbright International, in the 
* Lippo Ltd, in the Lippo Centre
* CITIC Pacific Ltd, in the CITIC Tower
* Culturecom (formerly Jademan), in the Far East Finance Centre

<text>Luo Binwang (, ca. 619–684?), courtesy name Guanguang (觀光/观光), was a Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty. His family was from Wuzhou, modern Yiwu, Zhejiang, but he was raised in Shandong. Luo is grouped with Lu Zhaolin, Wang Bo, and Yang Jiong as the Four Paragons of the Early Tang, the most outstanding poets of their time.

== Early career ==
It was said that Luo Binwang could recite poetry when he was six years old. In adulthood, after a period serving on the staff of Li Yuanqing (李元慶) Prince of Dao, an uncle of then-ruling Emperor Gaozong, Luo worked in the central government in Chang&#x27;an from 665. In 670, he was exiled to Xinjiang, after which he travelled to Yunnan with the army. He later served on staff of the prominent general Pei Xingjian (裴行儉) while Pei was serving as the commandant at Tao Prefecture (洮州, roughly modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), and was in charge of the military correspondences, but he did not have a good relationship with Pei, who also disapproved of the other three greater writers grouped with Luo — Wang, Yang, and Lu, instead favoring the talents of Wang Bo&#x27;s brother Wang Ju (王勮) and Su Weidao. Eventually, Luo became a secretary at the county government of Chang&#x27;an County — one of the two counties making up the capital Chang&#x27;an — a low position that was however considered fairly prestigious due to its location at the capital.

== Participation in Li Jingye&#x27;s rebellion ==
In 678, Luo Binwang was dismissed and imprisoned for criticising Wu Zetian, but was released the following year. After Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s death and the subsequent takeover of Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s wife Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) as regent over initially their son Emperor Zhongzong, whom she quickly deposed, and then Emperor Ruizong, Luo made a number of suggestions to her, which she did not accept, and he was in turn demoted to the post of secretary general of Linhai County in 684. He and a number of similarly demoted officials met at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and they, supporting Li Jingye the Duke of Ying as their leader, rose against Empress Dowager Wu at Yang Prefecture, claiming as their goal Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s restoration. Luo was in charge of the resistance forces&#x27; correspondences, and he wrote a particularly sharp-worded declaration against Empress Dowager Wu:



It was said that when Empress Dowager Wu read the declaration, she smiled and laughed at what he wrote. However, when she reached the portion that read, &quot;The soil on the new imperial tomb is not yet dry, and to whom can the two-meter-tall orphan be entrusted?&quot; she turned solemn, and she commented, &quot;It is the fault of the chancellors that we lost this man&#x27;s service.&quot; After Li Jingye&#x27;s defeat later that year, Luo was also killed, and Empress Dowager Wu, impressed with his writing, sent people to gather them and publish them.

== Style ==

In prose, he was a master of the ornate &quot;pianwen&quot; 駢文 &quot;parallel prose&quot; style. His poetry (mostly &quot;gushi&quot;) is often similarly complex. Among his works is a long, autobiographical verse narrative, but he is best known for his poem &quot;Ode to the Goose&quot;, said to have been written when he was seven years old. His &quot;Ode to the Cicada&quot; is also of great renown and influence.

<text>Suncheon (; ) is the largest city in South Jeolla Province, South Korea, with a population of 280,719 as of 2022. It is located in the southeast of the province and is a scenic agricultural and industrial city, known for tourist attractions, such as Suncheon Bay. The port city of Yeosu is around forty minutes south of Suncheon and Gwangyang twenty minutes to the east of the city.

It is currently experiencing strong development due to being included as part of the &quot;Gwangyang Bay Free Economic Zone&quot;, one of three newly created Free Economic Zones (FEZs) in South Korea due to open within the next decade. As of October 14, 2007 plans are being set up and a referendum is being planned for a merging of the cities of Yeosu, Suncheon and Gwangyang into a new metropolitan city, taking advantage of the Gwangyang Bay Free Economic Zone, Yeosu&#x27;s Expo 2012 bid and port facilities, Suncheon&#x27;s educational institutes and Gwangyang&#x27;s POSCO plant.

The rebel forces killed a number of ROK soldiers, police, officials, and landlords. A couple days later, the rebellion was crushed by the South Korean military. Civilians thought to have aided the rebellion were also summarily executed.

==Tourism==

=== 2013 Suncheon Garden Exposition ===

*2013 Suncheon Garden Expo Korea: The 2013 Suncheon Garden Expo Korea was the first of its kind to be held in Korea. The Expo focused on green industry development such as solar energy, sustainable garden development and electronic transportation. It showcased green technologies, international garden exhibits, and wetland conservation. The Expo grounds, its permanent gardens, arboretum, wetland center, and connecting monorail to Suncheon Bay are maintained for continued tourism.

=== Temples ===

*Songgwang Temple: It is one of the Three Jewel Temples of Korea and a popular place for Jinul. The temple is located in Sinpyeong-ri, Songgwang-myeon. It is one of the Sambosachal along with Haein temple of Habcheon and Tongdo Temple of Yangsan. Jinul strived here to renew the tradition of Buddhism 800 years ago. The temple bore 16 state monks in the past. Today, the temple is home for monks from overseas and is a place to study the Buddhist culture of Korea. The temple was first built at the end of Silla Kingdom and named Gilsang Temple. It was then renamed in the Goryeo dynasty under the reign of Myeongjong, to Songgwang Temple. Reconstructions were done after it was burnt down in the Joseon period, but was severely damaged again in 1948 and 1951. At present, 33 complexes have been restored after 8 reconstruction projects from 1984 to 1988. The temple has a total of 26 cultural assets, including 17 national cultural assets and 9 local ones.
*Seonamsa: Seonamsa of Mount Jogye is located in Jukak-ri, Seungju-eup, Suncheon. In the Baekje Kingdom, Adohwasang had first built a small temple in the mountain and named it Biroam of Cheongnyangsan Mountain. The temple was named Seonamsa later in the Silla Kingdom by state monk Doseon. Seonamsa is known to be a mixture of the various sects of Buddhism of the Goryeo dynasty. Cheontaejong was established here 900 years ago by Ui Cheon and the monk&#x27;s heirs have been carried down to the present age. Seonamsa, like Songgwangsa, is a library for studies of Korean Buddhist culture. A total of 18 cultural assets are found here, including 7 treasures and 11 local cultural assets.
*Cheonjaam, Ssanghyangsu: Belongs to the Chinese juniper family, and is technically named Juniperus Chinensi Limme. The height is 12.5 m and the circumference is 3.98m.

<text>County Longford () is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Leinster. It is named after the town of Longford. Longford County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 46,634 at the 2022 census. The county is based on the historic Gaelic territory of Annaly (&quot;Anghaile&quot;), formerly known as Teffia (&quot;Teathbha&quot;).

== Geography ==

Most of Longford lies in the basin of the River Shannon with Lough Ree forming much of the county&#x27;s western boundary. The north-eastern part of the county, however, drains towards the River Erne and Lough Gowna. Lakeland, bogland, pasture-land and wetland typify Longford&#x27;s generally low-lying landscapes: the highest point of the county is in the north-west – Carn Clonhugh (also known as Cairn Hill or Corn Hill) between Drumlish and Ballinalee in the parish of Killoe, at . Cairn Hill is the site of a television transmitter broadcasting to much of the Irish midlands.

In the list of Irish counties by highest point, Longford ranks third lowest – only Meath and Westmeath have lower maxima. In general, the northern third of the county is hilly, forming part of the drumlin belt and Esker Riada stretching across the northern midlands of Ireland. The southern parts of the county are low-lying, with extensive areas of raised bogland and the land being of better quality for grazing and tillage. The River Shannon marks the county&#x27;s border with Roscommon while the Rivers Inny and Tang form much of the boundary with Westmeath.

The Royal Canal flows through the south of the county terminating at Cloondara at the Shannon. The canal was refurbished and reopened in 2010. Notable lakes include Lough Kinale and Lough Gowna on the County Cavan border, Lough Forbes on the County Roscommon border and Lough Ree in the south where counties Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon meet.

==Governance and politics==
The county is part of the Dáil constituency of Longford–Westmeath.

==History==

The territory corresponding to County Longford was presumably a frontier colony of the Kingdom of Meath in the first millennium. Between the fifth and twelfth centuries, the territory was called the kingdom of Tethbae ruled by various tuath such as the Cairpre Gabra in the north. Tethbae () originally referred to an area north of the River Inny approximating to present-day County Longford.

In the year AD 1070, Tethbae was conquered by the Ó Cuinns, Ó Fearghails and other Conmhaícne tribes, henceforth being known as &quot;Muintir Annaly&quot;, so named after &quot;Anghaile&quot; the great-grandfather of Fearghail O&#x27;Farrell. Furthermore, County Longford was often called Upper Conmaicne, to distinguish it from south Leitrim, then called Lower Conmaicne, because both districts were ruled by the descendants of Conmac, son of Fergus and Queen Meadbh of Connacht.

Following the Norman invasion of the 12th century, Annaly was granted to Hugh de Lacy as part of the Liberty of Meath. An English settlement was established at Granard, with Norman Cistercian monasteries being established at Abbeylara and Abbeyshrule and Augustinian monasteries at Abbeyderg and at Saints&#x27; Island on the shore of Lough Ree. Monastic remains at Ardagh, Abbeylara, Abbeyderg, Abbeyshrule, Inchcleraun Island in Lough Ree and Inchmore Island in Lough Gowna are reminders of the county&#x27;s long Christian history. However, by the 14th century, English influence in Ireland was on the wane. The town of Granard was sacked by Edward Bruce&#x27;s army in 1315, and the O&#x27;Farrells soon recovered complete control over the territory. Annaly later became Longphoirt, now Longford, after O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s fortress of this name.

The county was officially shired in 1586 in the reign of Elizabeth I from the northern portion of Westmeath, but English control was not fully established until the aftermath of the Nine Years&#x27; War. County Longford was added to Leinster by James I in 1608 (it had previously been considered part of Connacht), with the county being divided into six baronies and its boundaries being officially defined. The county was planted by English and Scottish landowners in 1620, with much of the O&#x27;Farrell lands being confiscated and granted to new owners. The change in control was completed during the Cromwellian plantations of the 1650s. On these lands in County Longford, are the historic ruins of the Coolamber Hall House, which was besieged by one of the Cromwells.

The county was a centre of the 1798 rebellion, when the French expeditionary force led by Humbert, which had landed at Killala, was defeated outside the village of Ballinamuck on 8 September by a British army led by Cornwallis. General Humbert had hoped to amalgamate his forces with other rebels located in Granard but Cornwallis aware of the danger had defeated these forces in the second battle of Granard prior to defeating General Humbert in Ballinamuck. Considerable reprisals were inflicted by the British on the civilian inhabitants of the county in the aftermath of the battle.

A revolutionary spirit was again woken in the county during the Irish War of Independence when the North Longford flying column, led by Seán Mac Eoin, became one of the most active units on the Irish side during that war.

==Education==
There are many national and secondary schools located in the county such as Moyne Community School, St. Mels and the Convent (Longford, Granard, Ballymahon, Lanesborough).

==Demographics==

With an area of and a population of 46,634, Longford is the fourth smallest of the 32 counties in area and second smallest in terms of population. It is also the fourth smallest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties by size and smallest by population. It borders counties Cavan to the northeast, Westmeath to the southeast, Roscommon to the southwest and Leitrim to the northwest.

Longford&#x27;s population growth during the period 2002–2006 (10.6%) has been stronger than the National average (8.2%).

Agriculture is an important facet in the way of life and for the economy in County Longford. There are 73,764 hectares of area (67.6% of the county&#x27;s total area) farmed in the county. There are approximately 126,904 cattle in the county too.

Founded in 1501, the city is a collection of seigniorial houses, ancient palaces, churches and convents.

The name comes from the former menceyato of Icoden, together with a reference to the local wine (&quot;vino&quot; in Spanish). The Spanish conquerors were quick to colonize this fertile and well-watered region, and introduced the cultivation of sugarcane and grapevines; the latter came to predominate.

== Monuments and places of interest ==

In the &quot;Plaza de Lorenzo Cáceres&quot; stands the monument to General José Antonio Páez, founder of Venezuela&#x27;s independence, whose great-grandfather came from Icod. The town&#x27;s neighborhoods are sprinkled with innumerable hermitages and other buildings that give Icod great symbolic and artistic value, which can be appreciated at the &quot;Museo de Arte Sacro&quot; in the church of San Marcos.

=== Ancient Dragon Tree ===

In Parque del Drago, close to the Church of San Marcos, stands a famous dragon tree (22 m high, lower trunk diameter 10 m, estimated weight 70 t), which is reputed to be a thousand years old (hence its local name, &quot;El Drago Milenario&quot;: the Thousand-Year-Old Dragon). While no study seems to have confirmed such longevity for the tree (dracos do not produce annual rings with which to tell their ages; the tree is more likely to have an age in the hundreds of years), it is the long-time symbol of Icod. 

After an abortive attempt by the city council in 2002, another bid to list the Icod Dragon Tree as a UNESCO World Heritage Site was made in 2011.

=== Church of San Marcos ===

The Church of San Marcos (St. Mark) is located on the &quot;Plaza de Lorenzo Cáceres&quot;, the spot where, according to tradition, the Guanches already venerated the saint&#x27;s icon - &quot;una pequeña talla gótica-flamenca&quot; - before the conquest.

=== Plaza de La Pila ===

The Plaza de La Pila, near the &quot;Parque del Drago&quot;, is bordered by grand old homes, among which the &quot;Casa de los Cáceres&quot; (house of the Cáceres family), now a museum, is distinctive. The plaza itself has a small botanic garden.

=== Plaza de Lorenzo Cáceres ===

The &quot;Plaza de Lorenzo Cáceres&quot; with its varied vegetation is located in the environment of the &quot;Parque del Drago&quot;. This is also the location of the parish church of San Marcos, a Canary-Islands-style church built in the first half of the 16th century. The church has five naves, three of them separated by columns, and two of them having side chapels. Worth seeing on the church&#x27;s exterior are the stone bell tower and facade. In the interior are kept important images, as well as valuable sculptures; among those that stand out are the statues of St. Mark the Evangelist and Our Lady of the Kings, in late Gothic style, and interesting paintings, including one of the Annunciation.

=== Playa de San Marcos ===

This sheltered bay on the north coast of Tenerife takes its name from the image of St. Mark the Evangelist venerated in the parish church of Icod which bears his name. This is the same image which appeared in a cave near the seashore during the conquest of the island. Several historians, including Licentiate Juan Nuñez de la Peña, mention its strange and mysterious discovery.

The safety provided by this harbor, protected against almost all winds, sheltered by its high encircling cliffs, having good anchorages and a beach, has led navigators ever since the conquest of Tenerife to choose it as a refuge in stormy weather. These advantageous conditions, and the proximity of the rich pine woods which Icod then had in much greater abundance than today, promoted the timber trade and the fabrication of ships. Many galleons and frigates were built in its shipyards for the service of the King of Spain.

Don Luis de la Cueva y Benavides, Governor-General of the Canary Islands and President of their Royal Audiencia, chose this sheltered harbor for the construction of the frigates he had undertaken for the Royal Armada, and for this reason the people who stayed in this place while the ships were being built, including many naval carpenters and caulkers, came to Icod. Timbers were cut in the forest which then existed in the vicinity of the &quot;Ermita del Amparo&quot;, a place which still records this fact in the name of &quot;Corte de Naos&quot; (place where wood was cut for ships) which it retains. 

The soldiers of the three companies of militia which were then stationed in Icod assisted with great willingness and care, during the construction of the frigates, in everything they were instructed to do by the persons who directed them, and everyone who lived nearby gave up their beds to give comfortable accommodations to the soldiers and workmen Don Luis de la Cueva had brought with him.

The Governor-General was so pleased with the comportment of the militiamen in Icod that before he left, on November 30, 1601, he issued a letter of praise through his scribe, Juan Nuñez de Cain y Zaraza. The letter granted them privileged exemption from forced lodging, participation in night vigils or contributions to them, and exemption from personal service. Furthermore, he ordered that his lieutenants, militia leaders, captains and all other military officers should not compel their men to go to other towns for military parades, but rather that others should come to Icod to perform them. Only when other garrisons were on alert would they have to travel to attend them.

Those were times of constant alarm and fear for the inhabitants of the Canary Islands, because of the frequent appearance of pirates and corsairs in Canarian waters, and every town lived on a war footing to forestall their surprises and excesses. The inhabitants of Icod, attentive to its defense, kept an arsenal of 500 muskets and a reserve of gunpowder in a strategic and secret location. But since the chief danger was at Puerto de San Marcos, even though the latter had been fortified by nature, a strong wall was constructed on the beach, to make the place more accessible to disembarkation, and a watchtower was built on a prominent place in the town, from which its watchmen, which commanded a wider view of the sea than those on the coast, constantly surveyed the horizon.

Today the Playa de San Marcos, protected by shell-shaped cliffs and covered with the black sand characteristic of northern Tenerife, is a place of recreation.

=== Cueva del Viento ===

Thought to be the largest volcanic cave in the world, the Cueva del Viento (Cave of the Wind) has a known length of over 17 kilometers. It consists of a complex lava tube with several entrances, is the largest lava tube in the European Union. It presents great internal complexity, a wide variety of geomorphological structures, and a unique fauna, both living and fossilized. Other caves, also very extensive, are found in other nooks of the town: these include San Marcos, Punto Blanco, El Rey, and Felipe Reventón.

=== Casa de Los Cáceres ===

This was formerly the residence of Lorenzo Cáceres, a colonel of engineers. Its three-story neoclassical facade presents traditional quartered windows; a high arched central gate with a stone frame, cornice, and balustrade; this gate between large flowerpots; and a pretty hidden balcony sporting turned balusters in the main window.

=== Icod Public Library ===

The Icod Public Library has returned to its original venue. The new installations in which it is housed now can—and should—transform it into one of the best bibliographic and cultural centers of reference on the Islands. Today, the library has three branches. 
* The Central Library is still situated in the San Francisco convent, and already contains close to 13,200 volumes.
* The Library of the Institute of Lucas Martín Espino (11,000 volumes)
* The Santa Barbara Library (2,500 volumes, specialized in children&#x27;s literature)

With an openly creative purpose, the library publishes a literary collection of Canary art and publications. These short notebooks were created in order to offer visitors some of the most exceptional artistic, literary, and written prospects of the Canary Islands specifically, and Spain generally. Titled &quot;Trama interior&quot; (The Interior Plot), the documents reunite three young Canary painters: Cristina Gámez, Eva Ibarria and Rosa Rodríguez.

== Folklore and Customs ==

=== Tablas de San Andrés ===

On 29 November each year, the eve of San Andrés’ day and the official festival of new wine, the storehouses open for all to taste the juice of the year&#x27;s harvest, accompanied by roasted chestnuts. This festival, deeply rooted among Icod&#x27;s citizens, involves sliding on &quot;tablas&quot; or boards (originally by torchlight [?]) down the steeply sloping neighborhood streets. The greatest spectacle of the party is seen in Plano street, where these slippery boards are seen speeding along, steered by daring and youthful riders.

This tradition was born from the need to transport wood from the highest zones of the municipality down to the workshops where it was used in handicrafts and in naval construction. The wood traveled down El Amparo street (then unpaved) on the back of a large board or plank, while &quot;oars&quot; of heather or fayatree (&quot;Myrica faya&quot;) branches were used to brake and steer, thus avoiding the endless obstacles that might be in the way. Nowadays other types of &quot;boards&quot; are used—metal, plastic, automotive suspensions [?], etc. -- which leave the practice dull and far-removed from the origin of the San Andrés boards. Every year the municipal authorities call for an end to these different variations in an effort to preserve the tradition of the &quot;tablas&quot;. Many visitors come from other parts of the island to see the annual festival, as do tourists.

=== Los Hachitos ===

Los Hachitos (literally, &quot;the little torches&quot;) is a holiday of pagan origin, a remnant of a summer solstice fire cult that has remained well established, and its celebration never forgotten. Today, this parade takes place in Icod de los Vinos from San Marcos to El Amparo, passing through Las Charnecas and El Lomo de Las Canales. It is possible that the parade route approaches the sea in anticipation of the coming of the sun. To the &quot;son&quot; rhythm of the tajaraste drums, &quot;los hachitos&quot; come out during the festival of San Juan Bautista on 23 June. They are made of rags soaked in petroleum and placed in the high areas of the city, forming pictures out of light (stars, hearts, crosses, and so on), or are thrown down the mountain to evoke a lava flow. Others are decorated with branches, flowers and ribbons and carried up the mountain, giving rise to a magical, multicolored spectacle.

=== &quot;El Diablo y La Diabla&quot; ===

This is a tradition that was frequent in the neighborhoods and settlements in the time of Corpus Christi. In this they represented the fight of the forces of hell against the archangel Saint Michael. The male and female devils (&quot;el diablo y la diabla&quot;) left accompanied by their court of giants and dwarves, which amused the town with the rhythm of the &quot;tajaraste&quot;. This custom was prohibited, it being said that it only invited disorder and the distraction of religious devotion. But this custom continues to be practiced, evidence of this being that today &quot;el diablo y la diabla&quot; continue leaving in the middle of September through the neighborhood of Las Angustias (The Anguishes) in honor of the Virgin.

=== Los Guanches de La Candelaria ===

In the zone known as La Candelaria, each August 15, the Virgin is put on procession, where townsfolk dressed like Guanches stage the first encounter of the Guanches with the Virgin. After this unique performance, the spectators accompany the procession to an area where they are honored with a shower of artificial fireworks.

=== The Pilgrimage of the Poleo ===

In El Amparo, with the holiday of the patron saint, there is a pilgrimage to the rhythm of the &quot;tajaraste,&quot; which consists of going to the mountain to collect the branch and the poleo to adorn the neighborhood during the festival days. In these festivals, at the beginning of August, the decoration of the better half of the church has always had a special character. The adornment of the main door, called &quot;bollo&quot; is an enormous sponge cake, coated with small sugar figurines, the &quot;alfeñiques&quot;, all adorned with many colored ribbons. The rest of the arch is adorned with palm, poleo, etc... and some baskets of fruit which hang from the roof. Finally, in the corners of the roof, hang the &quot;madamas&quot;, large bread figures, adorned with bows and dressed very colorfully.

=== Baskets and Pastries of Santa Bárbara ===

In August, in honor of its patron, St. Barbara, the characteristic fair of baskets and pastries is celebrated. This popular rite is typified by its ingenious offering, based on garden produce. The baskets are decorated with fruits and vegetables that are placed in the plaza, in the portico of the church, in order to give a colorful and dynamic aspect to the festivities with these spectacular artisanal works. The pastries are nothing more than figurines made out of sugar in the shape of animals, and adorned with multicolored ribbons by the artisans of the neighborhood. These singular figures are carried on the heads of the single women and matchmakers of the neighborhood to place them among the baskets in the church portico, as an offering and homage to the saint.

== Icod Cuisine ==

The gastronomy of Icod de los Vinos is unique; some dishes can only be made locally, as they require indigenous ingredients that can only be found in the Canary Islands. In fact, Canarian cuisine is eclectic, due to the Islands having been a port of call for centuries. Its most characteristic features include &quot;los mojos&quot;, or sauces (&quot;mojo verde&quot;, made from cilantro, and &quot;mojo picón&quot;, a spicy sauce, are the most common) that serve as the preferred accompaniment to fish of great texture and flavor, such as &quot;bogas&quot;, &quot;samas&quot;, &quot;salemas&quot;, &quot;chernes&quot;, and the famous &quot;vieja&quot; (&quot;old woman&quot;). &quot;Papas arrugadas&quot; (&quot;wrinkled potatoes&quot;) , potatoes cooked in salted water and served in their skins: Of all their varieties, the &quot;black&quot; is considered to be best. Icod is also home to a varied assortment of confections; &quot;bienmesabe&quot;, &quot;arroz a la miel&quot; (honeyed rice), &quot;piononos&quot; (stuffed fried plantains), &quot;leche asada&quot; (&quot;roasted milk&quot;), quesadillas and &quot;truchas&quot; (fried, filled sweet potato pastries; lit. &quot;trout&quot;) are some of Icod&#x27;s most prized desserts.

== Heraldry ==

=== Coat of Arms of Icod de los Vinos ===

To speak of the &quot;Drago milenario&quot; (declared a National Monument in 1917) is to speak of the essence of the town&#x27;s fame. It is because of this ancient example of Canary Island flora, a symbol which evokes the lively community of the hospitable northern population, that in the conduct of its festivals in honor of Christ on Calvary, the islands&#x27; feelings of patriotism and religion are given tribute. This tribute recalls the numerous glorious dates of the isles&#x27; history, so closely linked from the initial conquest that began its recorded history.

The Drago and the Teide (which symbolizes the rise of the island toward all things great and noble) figure prominently in the city&#x27;s coat of arms, which was bestowed upon the city by Royal Decree on 9 November 1921. As one can see in the accompanying picture, it consists of two divided quarters. In one, the Teide appears over a field of blue; in the other, the Drago is over a field of silver. The blazon is encircled by eight clusters of golden grapes over a field of &quot;sinople&quot; (2). Four &quot;tenantes&quot; (3) symbolize the history of the island&#x27;s conquest upon evoking a change of impressions between the menceyes Belicar de Icod, Rosmeu de Daute, Pelinor de Adeje, and Adjoña de Abona, with the aim of ending their valiant resistance against the Spanish troops which had already triumphed at two crucial points in the present-day areas of La Victoria de Acentejo and Los Realejos. The heraldic elements exalt the traditional courtesy and hospitality of the people of Icod; their laboriousness and extremely fertile countryside; their profound sense of patriotism and their dedication to the memory of the history uniting their two races under the auspices of Santa Cruz. As an official blazon, the coat of arms of Icod affirms and underscores all of the acts of the city. 
(1) CANARIAS - Magazine which is published in Villa de La Orotava. 
(2) Sinople - Heraldic color which in painting is represented by green, and in engraving by oblique lines which run from the &quot;cantón diestro del jefe al siniestro de la punta&quot;. It is also used as a noun. 
(3) Tenantes - Each one of the figures of men/angels that the shield displays.&quot;

=== The Flag of Icod de los Vinos ===

The plenary council of Icod de los Vinos unanimously resolved to adopt the first official flag of the municipality following the proposal of the Department of Culture and Heritage. In accordance with the legal autonomous community&#x27;s legal requirements in respect of heraldic shields, coats of arms and banners, the flag was commissioned by the DCH to the Garachican heraldist Pascual González Regalado.

The resolution required the proceedings to be kept as public record for one month, and in order to avoid claims arising therefrom, the proceedings were remitted to the Viceconsulry of the Government of the Canary Islands for Territorial Administration so that, following the report of the Institute of Canary Island Studies, the flag could be granted official approval. Aside from technical references to specifications for material, mast, hoist, etc., the author provides the following description of the flag of Icod: three vertical stripes of equal width, those at the sides being maroon and the central stripe being white.

The flag also bears the heraldic shield of the locality, positioned in the centre with a height of two thirds that of the flag. The colours chosen by Pascual González bear a close relationship to two essential symbols of Icod de los Vinos by which they are inspired – the Canarly Islands Dragon Tree and Mount Teide. According to the author, the maroon (or purple) colour is featured on the flag &quot;in memory of and as passionate homage to the sapling of the venerable, magnificent and exemplary millennium of the dragon tree which is found in the town. A sapling which has been the subject of wars and legends and, in ancient times, a substance used in medicine&quot;. On the other hand, the inclusion of the white symbolises &quot;the extreme wintry whiteness displayed by Mount Teide so close to Icod, which, when viewed from the town, provides an illustration of singulararly extraordinary beauty.&quot;

Around September 2001, the official flag of Icod de los Vinos was blessed and raised amid celebrations organised by the &quot;Corporación Municipal&quot; (Municipal Corporation) in the town hall square, featuring appearances by the president of the Government of the Canary Islands (Román Rodríguez Rodríguez), the deputy of the Government (Pilar Merino), as well as the author of the flag, Pascual González Regalado.

==== Description of the flag of Icod de los Vinos ====

In accordance with the requirements of Order 123/190 of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands dated 29 June, which governs the approval procedure of heraldic shields, blasons and flags of the islands and municipalities of the archipelago (BOC 95 and 177), the flag of the municipality of Icod de los Vinos conforms to the following description:
: The flag is to conform to a ratio of 2:3 (height to width).
: The flag is to feature three equal vertical stripes, the outer stripes being maroon, and the central stripe being white.
: The heraldic arms of the municipality are to be placed in the centre of the flag, and should stand at two-thirds the height of the flag.

<doc id="393399" wikidata="Q182633" url="?curid=393399" title="County Westmeath">
<text>County Westmeath (; or simply ) is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Leinster and is part of the Eastern and Midland Region. It formed part of the historic Kingdom of Meath, which was named Mide because the kingdom was located in the geographical centre of Ireland (the word Mide meaning &#x27;middle&#x27;). Westmeath County Council is the administrative body for the county, and the county town is Mullingar. At the 2022 census, the population of the county was 95,840.

== History ==
Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the territory of the Gaelic Kingdom of Meath formed the basis for the Anglo-Norman Lordship of Meath granted by King Henry II of England to Hugh de Lacy in 1172. Following the failure of de Lacy&#x27;s male heirs in 1241, the Lordship was split between two great-granddaughters. One moiety, a central eastern portion, was awarded to Maud (de Geneville) as the liberty of Trim; the other moiety, comprising north-eastern and western portions, went to Maud&#x27;s sister Margery (de Verdun) and in 1297 became the royal county of Meath. The liberty and royal county were merged in 1461. While the east of the county was in the English Pale, the west was Gaelicised in the fourteenth century and outside the control of the sheriff of Meath.

As a part of the better administration of the newly established Kingdom of Ireland, the Parliament of Ireland passed the Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543, the eastern portion retaining the name Meath and the western portion called Westmeath.

== Geography and subdivisions ==
Westmeath is the 20th largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties by area and the 22nd largest in terms of population. It is the sixth largest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties in size and eighth largest in terms of population. The Hill of Uisneach in the barony of Moycashel is sometimes regarded as the notional geographical centre of Ireland although the actual geographic centre of Ireland lies in neighbouring County Roscommon. The summit of Mullaghmeen is the highest point in County Westmeath. At just 258 metres this makes it the lowest county top in Ireland.

==Local government and politics==
The head office of Westmeath County Council is located in Mullingar. There are currently 20 councillors. The three local electoral areas of Westmeath are Athlone (7 seats), Mullingar–Coole (7 seats) and Mullingar–Kilbeggan (6 seats). The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 provided the framework for the establishment of County Councils throughout Ireland. The first meeting of Westmeath County Council was held on 22 April 1899.

Westmeath&#x27;s population growth has been stronger than the national average. After the Great Famine, the population of Westmeath declined dramatically. It stabilised in the middle of the 20th century, and has continued to grow. Westmeath&#x27;s proximity to Dublin, with good motorway facilities and frequent rail service, has made commuting popular.

County Westmeath&#x27;s population fell in the century following the Great Famine, with many leaving for better opportunities in America.
The largest town in the county is Athlone, followed by Mullingar. Westmeath is the largest county by population in the Irish Midlands. Important commercial and marketing centres include Moate, Kilbeggan, Kinnegad, Ballinahown, Delvin, Rochfortbridge, Killucan and Castlepollard. According to the 2011 census, 51.9% of Westmeath households have at least one member reporting an ability in Irish.

Westmeath is one of the few counties in Ireland where some census records from 1841 are still available. Some of the records of that census have been digitised and maintained by the National Archives of Ireland.

As of the 2022 census, Westmeath had a population of 95,840, consisting of 47,522 males and 48,318 females. The Central Statistics Office also said that despite the overall increase in population, the rural population had still fallen (2016 census).

==Economy==

Initially, development occurred around the major market centres of Mullingar, Moate, and Kinnegad. Athlone developed due to its military significance, and its strategic location on the main Dublin–Galway route across the River Shannon. Mullingar gained considerable advantage from the development of the Royal Canal. The canal facilitated cheap transport of produce to Dublin, Britain and Europe. Athlone and Mullingar expanded further with the coming of the Midland Great Western Railway network in the nineteenth century.

Tourism in Westmeath is generally based on its many water amenities. The county lakes include Lough Derravaragh, Lough Ennell, Lough Owel, Lough Lene, Lough Sheelin and Lough Ree. The River Shannon (Ireland&#x27;s key tourism waterway) has a modern inland harbour in Athlone.

In 2017 the largest employment sectors within Westmeath were:

Two major &quot;Greenway&quot; projects are intended to improve cycling facilities. The Athone—Mullingar section of the Dublin—Galway Greenway, along the old railway corridor between Athlone and Mullingar, was constructed in 2015.
The Royal Canal Greenway takes tourists from the county boundary to Mullingar, and then on towards Longford. Those wishing to use the Dublin-Galway Greenway can transfer from the Royal Canal route to the old rail corridor onwards towards Athlone.

The development of industry in Westmeath has been mainly based on food processing and consumer products. Whiskey is distilled in Kilbeggan and tobacco is processed in Mullingar. The county has an extensive beef and dairy trade. In recent times, the manufacturer Alkermes has located in Athlone. The eastern part of the county is home to commuters, many of whom work at the technology parks on the western side of Dublin.

Mullingar is renowned for the high quality of its beef and veal. Weaned cattle from the west of the Shannon are fattened for market on the lush grasslands of Meath and Westmeath. The cattle are also used to maintain grassland to help sustain wildlife in the areas fringing the Bog of Allen.

Westmeath is home to many stud farms. The plains of Westmeath, covered in calcium-rich marl, contribute significantly to calcification of foal bones during their formative years. Westmeath mares are usually put into foal in spring to facilitate summer growth. Pregnancy lasts for approximately 335–340 days and usually results in one foal. Horses mature when they are around four years old.

==Railways==
Westmeath also has railway infrastructure with a number of trains passing through towns in the county. The Dublin–Westport/Galway railway line runs through the county, with services from Dublin Heuston to Galway/Westport/Ballina inter-city train service stops at Athlone, while the Dublin-Sligo railway line service stops at Mullingar. The line from Athlone via Moate railway station to Mullingar is disused and converted into the Dublin-Galway Greenway. Other major infrastructural projects and plans for the county include Transport 21.

==Road transport==
Roads are of good quality in the county. As part of the Transport 21 infrastructure programme undertaken by the government, both the N4 and N6 roads have been upgraded to motorway or dual carriageway standard. All towns that these roads passed through are now bypassed, such as Mullingar, Athlone, Moate and Kinnegad. Both Dublin and Galway are within commuting distance from Westmeath following the completion of the M6 motorway in December 2009.

==Sport==
Westmeath is an active sporting county. The Westmeath GAA senior football team won the Leinster Senior Football Championship, the Delaney Cup, in 2004. They also won the National Football League Division 2 in 2001, 2003 and 2008. The Westmeath senior hurling team has enjoyed much recent success winning the Christy Ring Cup in 2005, 2007 and 2010.

Athlone Town F.C. have won the League of Ireland Championship on two occasions, in 1980 and 1982, and the FAI Cup in 1924.

Westmeath Ladies won the 2011 All-Ireland Intermediate Football Championship.

Athlone Institute of Technology boasts a €10 million international athletics arena, which opened in early 2013. The International Arena has a footprint of 6,818m2 and an overall building floor area of 9,715m2. Some 850 tonnes of structural steel and fifty thousand concrete blocks went into the construction of the facility, which can house two thousand spectators.

<text>Leon Askin (; born Leo Aschkenasy, 18 September 1907 – 3 June 2005) was an Austrian actor best known in North America for portraying the character General Burkhalter on the TV situation comedy &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.

==Life and career==
Askin was born into a Jewish family in Vienna, the son of Malvine (Susman) and Samuel Aschkenasy (both of whom were later murdered in a German concentration camp). According to his autobiography his first experience of show business occurred during World War I when he recited a poem before Emperor Franz Joseph. In the 1920s, he studied acting with Louise Dumont and Max Reinhardt. While working at Vienna&#x27;s &quot;ABC&quot; cabaret theater in the 1930s, he frequently directed the works of dissident political writer Jura Soyfer.
Askin fled Austria to the United States in 1940, after having been beaten and abused by the Nazi SA and SS. His parents were murdered in the Treblinka death camp. He then served in World War II as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Forces. After the war, he went to Hollywood to begin a career in films, invariably portraying foreign characters who speak English with a strong accent. Askin appeared as the Russian composer Anton Rubinstein in a Disneyland anthology episode of the life of Peter Tchaikovsky. Fans of the television series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; recall his portrayals of an eastern European diamond smuggler (Joseph Ferdinand) in the 1953 black-and-white episode &quot;Superman in Exile&quot;, and as a South American prime minister in a color episode. He appeared in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s biblical epic &quot;The Robe&quot; in 1953 as a Syrian guide named Abidor. In 1960, he appeared in the film &quot;Pension Schöller&quot;, and the following year was prominently featured in Billy Wilder&#x27;s film &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;, co-starring with James Cagney.

Askin gained wide recognition and popularity for his recurring role as the stern General Albert Burkhalter in the sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes,&quot; appearing in 67 episodes of the show’s run from 1965 to 1971, including the pilot episode. Burkhalter was the gruff and portly commanding officer of Colonel Klink, the bungling commandant of a German World War II prisoner-of-war camp, manipulated by American Colonel Hogan so that the prisoners would get away with clandestine activities.

Askin made guest appearances on &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; 1957 episode &quot;The Shooting of Jett King&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; and the 1965 episode &quot;Martin Of The Movies&quot; as Von Reinbein. &quot;The Monkees&quot; 1967 episode &quot;The Card Carrying Red Shoes&quot;, as Nicolai, on &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; in its 1969 episode &quot;Benvenuto... Who?&quot; as Roquelinm and in the &quot;Fiddler in the House&quot; episode of the 1974 situation comedy &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot; as a violin virtuoso. Between 1977 and 1979, he appeared in Steve Allen&#x27;s PBS series, &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot;, portraying Martin Luther and Karl Marx. In 1978 he portrayed a psychology professor in season six episode eight of &quot;Happy Days&quot;. In 1979 he portrayed the character Mr. Hoffmeier of Hoffmeier’s Bakery, judging a pie contest in the third season episode 19 of &quot;Three’s Company&quot; titled &quot;The Bake-Off&quot;.

<doc id="393404" wikidata="Q657326" url="?curid=393404" title="Estates of the realm">
<text>The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom (Christian Europe) from the Middle Ages to early modern Europe. Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.

*The best known system is the French &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; (Old Regime), a three-estate system which was made up of a First Estate of clergy, a Second Estate of titled nobles, and a Third Estate of all other subjects (both peasants and bourgeoisie).
* In some regions, notably Sweden and Russia, burghers (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate.
* In Norway, the taxpaying classes were considered as one, and with a very small aristocracy; this class/estate was as powerful as the monarchy itself. In Denmark, however, only owners of large tracts of land had any influence. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights.
* In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and clergy into one lordly estate with &quot;commons&quot; as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
* In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), knights, and burghers was used; this system excluded lower clergy and peasants altogether.
* In Scotland, the Three Estates were the Clergy (First Estate), Nobility (Second Estate), and Shire Commissioners, or &quot;burghers&quot; (Third Estate), representing the bourgeoisie and lower commoners. The Estates made up a Scottish Parliament.

Today, the terms &quot;three estates&quot; and &quot;estates of the realm&quot; may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern separation of powers in government into the legislature, administration, and the judiciary. The modern term &quot;the fourth estate&quot; invokes medieval three-estate systems, and usually refers to some particular force outside that medieval power structure, most commonly the independent press or the mass media.

==Social mobility==
During the Middle Ages, advancing to different social classes was uncommon and difficult, and when it did happen, it generally took the form of a gradual increase in status over several generations of a family rather than within a single lifetime.

One field in which commoners could appreciably advance within a single lifetime was the Church. The medieval Church was an institution where social mobility was most likely achieved up to a certain level (generally to that of vicar general or abbot/abbess for commoners). Typically, only nobility were appointed to the highest church positions (bishops, archbishops, heads of religious orders, etc.), although low nobility could aspire to the highest church positions. Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation. Nepotism was common in this period.

==Dynamics==

Johan Huizinga observed that &quot;Medieval political speculation is imbued to the marrow with the idea of a structure of society based upon distinct orders&quot;. The virtually synonymous terms &quot;estate&quot; and &quot;order&quot; designated a great variety of social realities, not at all limited to a class, Huizinga concluded applying to every social function, every trade, every recognisable grouping.

This static view of society was predicated on inherited positions. Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates&#x27; necessary dependency on the commoners&#x27; production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into burghers (also known as bourgeoisie) of the realm&#x27;s cities and towns, and the peasants and serfs of the realm&#x27;s surrounding lands and villages. A person&#x27;s estate and position within it were usually inherited from the father and his occupation, similar to a caste within that system. In many regions and realms, there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.

Legislative bodies or advisory bodies to a monarch were traditionally grouped along lines of these estates, with the monarch above all three estates. Meetings of the estates of the realm became early legislative and judicial parliaments. Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against false titles of nobility.

One of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called &quot;What Is the Third Estate?&quot; () It was written by Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès in January 1789, shortly before the start of the French Revolution.

==Background==
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, numerous geographic and ethnic kingdoms developed among the endemic peoples of Europe, affecting their day-to-day secular lives; along with those, the growing influence of the Catholic Church and its Papacy affected the ethical, moral and religious lives and decisions of all. This led to mutual dependency between the secular and religious powers for guidance and protection, but over time and with the growing power of the kingdoms, competing secular realities increasingly diverged from religious idealism and Church decisions.

The new lords of the land identified themselves primarily as warriors, but because new technologies of warfare were expensive, and the fighting men required substantial material resources and considerable leisure to train, these needs had to be filled. The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.

In his book &quot;The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined&quot;, the French medievalist Georges Duby has shown that in the period 1023–1025 the first theorist who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm was Gerard of Florennes, the bishop of Cambrai.

As a result of the Investiture Controversy of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the powerful office of Holy Roman Emperor lost much of its religious character and retained a more nominal universal preeminence over other rulers, though it varied. The struggle over investiture and the reform movement also legitimized all secular authorities, partly on the grounds of their obligation to enforce discipline.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders: those who pray, those who fight, and those who labour. The structure of the first order, the clergy, was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the religious reformations of the 16th century. The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous. Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority. The general category of those who labour (specifically, those who were not knightly warriors or nobles) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants, skilled artisans, merchants, financiers, lay professionals, and entrepreneurs, which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements.

By the 12th century, most European political thinkers agreed that monarchy was the ideal form of governance. This was because it imitated on earth the model set by God for the universe; it was the form of government of the ancient Hebrews and the Christian Biblical basis, the later Roman Empire, and also the peoples who succeeded Rome after the 4th century.

==Kingdom of France==

France under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; (before the French Revolution) divided society into three estates: the First Estate (clergy); the Second Estate (nobility); and the Third Estate (commoners). The king was not part of any estate.

===First Estate===
The First Estate comprised the entire clergy and the religious orders, traditionally divided into &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; clergy. Although there was no formally recognized demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from Second Estate families. In the time of Louis XVI, every bishop in France was a nobleman, a situation that had not existed before the 18th century.

The &quot;lower clergy&quot; (about equally divided between parish priests, monks, and nuns) constituted about 90 percent of the First Estate, which in 1789 numbered around 130,000 (about 0.5% of the population).

===Second Estate===
The Second Estate () was the French nobility and (technically, though not in common use) royalty, other than the monarch himself, who stood outside of the system of estates.

The Second Estate is traditionally divided into (&quot;nobility of the sword&quot;), and (&quot;nobility of the robe&quot;), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government.

The Second Estate constituted approximately 1.5% of France&#x27;s population. Under the (&quot;old rule/old government&quot;, i.e. before the revolution), the Second Estate were exempt from the (forced labor on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the (salt tax), and most important, the (France&#x27;s oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes was a major reason for their opposition to political reform.

===Third Estate===
The Third Estate () comprised all of those who were not members of either of the above, and can be divided into two groups, urban and rural, together making up over 98% of France&#x27;s population. The urban included wage-labourers. The rural included free peasants (who owned their own land and could be prosperous) and villeins (serfs, or peasants working on a noble&#x27;s land). The free peasants paid disproportionately high taxes compared to the other Estates and were unhappy because they wanted more rights. In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter&#x27;s inferior status all the more glaring.

There were an estimated 27 million in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started.

They had a hard life of physical labour and food shortages. Most people were born in this group, and most remained in it for their entire lives. It was extremely rare for people of this ascribed status to become part of another estate; those who did were usually being rewarded for extraordinary bravery in battle, or entering religious life. A few commoners were able to marry into the Second Estate, but this was a rare occurrence.

===Estates General===

The Estates General (not to be confused with a &quot;class of citizen&quot;) was a general citizens&#x27; assembly that was first called by Philip IV in 1302 and then met intermittently at the request of the King until 1614; after that, it was not called again for over 170 years.

In the period leading up to the Estates General of 1789, France was in the grip of an unmanageable public debt. In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, Jacques Necker, a foreigner, was appointed Controller-General of Finances. (He could not officially be made the finance minister because he was a Protestant.) Drastic inflation and simultaneous scarcity of food created a major famine in the winter of 1788–89. This led to widespread discontent, and produced a group of Third Estate representatives (612 exactly) pressing a comparatively radical set of reforms, much of it in alignment with the goals of acting finance minister Jacques Necker, but very much against the wishes of Louis XVI&#x27;s court and many of the hereditary nobles who were his Second Estate allies (allies at least to the extent that they were against being taxed themselves and in favour of maintaining high taxation for commoners).

Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates General to deal with the economic problems and quell the growing discontent, but when he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his &#x27;ideal program&#x27;, he sought to dissolve the assembly and take legislation into his own hands. However, the Third Estate held out for their right to representation. The lower clergy (and some nobles and upper clergy) eventually sided with the Third Estate, and the King was forced to yield. Thus, the 1789 Estates General meeting became an invitation to revolution.

By June, when continued impasses led to further deterioration in relations, the Estates General was reconstituted in a different form, first as the National Assembly (June 17, 1789), seeking a solution independent of the King&#x27;s management. (The Estates General, under that name and directed by the King, did continue to meet occasionally.) These independently-organized meetings are now seen as the epoch event of the French Revolution, during which – after several more weeks of civil unrest – the body assumed a new status as a revolutionary legislature, the National Constituent Assembly (July 9, 1789).

This unitary body of former representatives of the three estates began governing, along with an emergency committee, in the power vacuum after the Bourbon monarchy fled from Paris. Among the Assembly was Maximilien Robespierre, an influential president of the Jacobins who would years later become instrumental in the turbulent period of violence and political upheaval in France known as the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794).

==Great Britain and Ireland==
Whilst the estates were never formulated in a way that prevented social mobility, the English (subsequently the British) parliament was formed along the classic estate lines, being composed of the &quot;Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons&quot;. The tradition where the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sat separately from the Commons began during the reign of Edward III in the 14th century.

Notwithstanding the House of Lords Act 1999, the British Parliament still recognises the existence of the three estates: the Commons in the House of Commons, the nobility (Lords Temporal) in the House of Lords, and the clergy in the form of the Church of England bishops also entitled to sit in the upper House as the Lords Spiritual.

===Scotland===

The members of the Parliament of Scotland were collectively referred to as the Three Estates (Older Scots: Thre Estaitis), also known as the community of the realm, and until 1690 composed of:
* the first estate of prelates (bishops and abbots)
* the second estate of lairds (dukes, earls, parliamentary peers (after 1437) and lay tenants-in-chief)
* the third estate of burgh commissioners (representatives chosen by the royal burghs)

The First Estate was overthrown during the Glorious Revolution and the accession of William III. The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.

A &quot;shire commissioner&quot; was the closest equivalent of the English office of &quot;Member of Parliament&quot;, namely a commoner or member of the lower nobility. Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, as opposed to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.

The parliament also had university constituencies (see Ancient universities of Scotland). The system was also adopted by the Parliament of England when James VI ascended to the English throne. It was believed that the universities were affected by the decisions of Parliament and ought therefore to have representation in it. This continued in the Parliament of Great Britain after 1707 and the Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1950.

===Ireland===

After the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, administration of the Anglo-Norman Lordship of Ireland was modelled on that of the Kingdom of England. As in England, the Parliament of Ireland evolved out of the Magnum Concilium &quot;great council&quot; summoned by the chief governor of Ireland, attended by the council (curia regis), magnates (feudal lords), and prelates (bishops and abbots). Membership was based on fealty to the king, and the preservation of the king&#x27;s peace, and so the fluctuating number of autonomous Irish Gaelic kings were outside of the system; they had their own local brehon law taxation arrangements. Elected representatives are first attested in 1297 and continually from the later 14th century. In 1297, counties were first represented by elected knights of the shire (sheriffs had previously represented them). In 1299, towns were represented. From the 14th century, a distinction from the English parliament was that deliberations on church funding were held in Parliament rather than in Convocation. The separation of the Irish House of Lords from the elected Irish House of Commons had developed by the fifteenth century. The clerical proctors elected by the lower clergy of each diocese formed a separate house or estate until 1537, when they were expelled for their opposition to the Irish Reformation. The Parliament of Ireland was dissolved after the Act of Union 1800, and instead Ireland was joined to the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom; 100 Irish MPs instead represented the Third Estate in the House of Commons in London, while a selection of hereditary peers (typically about 28 representative peers) represented the Irish nobility in the House of Lords. In addition, four seats as Lords Spiritual were reserved for Church of Ireland clergy: one archbishop and three bishops at a time, alternating place after each legislative session. After the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, no more seats were created for Irish bishops.

==Sweden and Finland==
The Estates in Sweden (including Finland) and later also Russia&#x27;s Grand Duchy of Finland were the two higher estates, nobility and clergy, and the two lower estates, burghers and land-owning peasants. Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the Riksdag of the Estates. The Riksdag, and later the Diet of Finland was tetracameral: at the Riksdag, each Estate voted as a single body. Since early 18th century, a bill needed the approval of at least three Estates to pass, and constitutional amendments required the approval of all Estates. Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.

After Russia&#x27;s conquest of Finland in 1809, the estates in Finland swore an oath to the Emperor in the Diet of Porvoo. A Finnish House of Nobility was codified in 1818 in accordance with the old Swedish law of 1723. However, after the Diet of Porvoo, the Diet of Finland was reconvened only in 1863. In the meantime, for a period of 54 years, the country was governed only administratively.

There was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no &quot;default&quot; estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner&#x27;s family. A summary of this division is:
* Nobility (see Finnish nobility and Swedish nobility) was exempt from tax, had an inherited rank and the right to keep a fief, and had a tradition of military service and government. Nobility was codified in 1280 with the Swedish king granting exemption from taxation (&quot;frälse&quot;) to land-owners that could equip a cavalryman (or be one themselves) for the king&#x27;s army. Around 1400, letters patent were introduced, in 1561 the ranks of Count and Baron were added, and in 1625 the House of Nobility was codified as the First Estate of the land. Following Axel Oxenstierna&#x27;s reform, higher government offices were open only to nobles. However, the nobility still owned only their own property, not the peasants or their land as in much of Europe. Heads of the noble houses were hereditary members of the assembly of nobles. The Nobility is divided into titled nobility (counts and barons) and lower nobility. Until the 18th century, the lower nobility was in turn divided into Knights and Esquires such that each of the three classes would first vote internally, giving one vote per class in the assembly. This resulted in great political influence for the higher nobility.
* Clergy, or priests, were exempt from tax, and collected tithes for the church. After the Swedish Reformation, the church became Lutheran. In later centuries, the estate included teachers of universities and certain state schools. The estate was governed by the state church which consecrated its ministers and appointed them to positions with a vote in choosing diet representatives.
* Burghers were city-dwellers, tradesmen and craftsmen. Trade was allowed only in the cities when the mercantilistic ideology had got the upper hand, and the burghers had the exclusive right to conduct commerce within the framework of guilds. Entry to this Estate was controlled by the autonomy of the towns themselves. Peasants were allowed to sell their produce within the city limits, but any further trade, particularly foreign trade, was allowed only for burghers. In order for a settlement to become a city, a royal charter granting market right was required, and foreign trade required royally chartered staple port rights. After the annexation of Finland into Imperial Russia in 1809, mill-owners and other proto-industrialists would gradually be included in this estate.
* Peasants were land-owners of land-taxed farms and their families (comparable in status to yeomen in England), which represented the majority in medieval times. Since most of the population were independent farmer families until the 19th century, not serfs nor villeins, there is a remarkable difference in tradition compared to other European countries. Entry was controlled by ownership of farmland, which was not generally for sale but a hereditary property. After 1809, Swedish tenants renting a large enough farm (ten times larger than what was required of peasants owning their own farm) were included as well as non-nobility owning tax-exempt land. Their representatives to the Diet were elected indirectly: each municipality sent electors to elect the representative of an electoral district.
* To no estate belonged propertyless cottagers, villeins, tenants of farms owned by others, farmhands, servants, some lower administrative workers, rural craftsmen, travelling salesmen, vagrants, and propertyless and unemployed people (who sometimes lived in strangers&#x27; houses). To reflect how the people belonging to the estates saw them, the Finnish word for &quot;obscene&quot;, &quot;säädytön&quot;, has the literal meaning &quot;estateless&quot;. They had no political rights and could not vote. Their mobility was severely limited by the policy of &quot;legal protection&quot; (Finnish: &quot;laillinen suojelu&quot;): every estateless person had to be employed by a taxed citizen from the estates, or they could be charged with vagrancy and sentenced to forced labor. In Finland, this policy lasted until 1883.

In Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last ennoblement of explorer Sven Hedin taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new Constitution January 1, 1975, while the status of the House of Nobility continued to be regulated in law until 2003.

In Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner&#x27;s farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or serfs.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.

The political system was reformed as a result of the Finnish general strike of 1905, with the last Diet instituting a new constitutional law to create the modern parliamentary system, ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920. The privileges of the estates were officially and finally abolished in 1995, although in legal practice, the privileges had long been unenforceable. As in Sweden, the nobility has not been officially abolished and records of nobility are still voluntarily maintained by the Finnish House of Nobility.

In Finland, it is still illegal and punishable by jail time (up to one year) to defraud into marriage by declaring a false name or estate (Rikoslaki 18 luku § 1/Strafflagen 18 kap. § 1).

==Low Countries==
The Low Countries, which until the late sixteenth century consisted of several counties, prince bishoprics, duchies etc. in the area that is now modern Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, had no States General until 1464, when Duke Philip of Burgundy assembled the first States General in Bruges. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries, Brussels became the place where the States General assembled. On these occasions, deputies from the States of the various provinces (as the counties, prince-bishoprics and duchies were called) asked for more liberties. For this reason, the States General were not assembled very often.

As a consequence of the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed King Philip II of Spain, who was also overlord of the Netherlands. After the reconquest of the southern Netherlands (roughly Belgium and Luxemburg), the States General of the Dutch Republic first assembled permanently in Middelburg, and in The Hague from 1585 onward. Without a king to rule the country, the States General became the sovereign power. It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands.

During that time, the States General were formed by representatives of the States (i.e. provincial parliaments) of the seven provinces. In each States (a plurale tantum) sat representatives of the nobility and the cities (the clergy were no longer represented; in Friesland the peasants were indirectly represented by the &quot;Grietmannen&quot;).

In the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the Estates General of 1600 and the Estates General of 1632.

As a government, the States General of the Dutch Republic were abolished in 1795. A new parliament was created, called &quot;Nationale Vergadering&quot; (National Assembly). It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution. Eventually, the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under Napoleon (1810:&quot; La Hollande est reunie à l&#x27;Empire&quot;).

After regaining independence in November 1813, the name &quot;States General&quot; was resurrected for a legislature constituted in 1814 and elected by the States-Provincial. In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber. The members of the First Chamber were appointed for life by the King, while the members of the Second Chamber were elected by the members of the States Provincial. The States General resided in The Hague and Brussels in alternate years until 1830, when, as a result of the Belgian Revolution, The Hague became once again the sole residence of the States General, Brussels instead hosting the newly founded Belgian Parliament.

From 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial. As a result, the Second Chamber became the most important. The First Chamber is also called Senate. This however, is not a term used in the Constitution.

Occasionally, the First and Second Chamber meet in a &quot;Verenigde Vergadering&quot; (Joint Session), for instance on Prinsjesdag, the annual opening of the parliamentary year, and when a new king is inaugurated.

==Holy Roman Empire==

The Holy Roman Empire had the Imperial Diet (&quot;Reichstag&quot;). The clergy was represented by the independent prince-bishops, prince-archbishops and prince-abbots of the many monasteries. The nobility consisted of independent aristocratic rulers: secular prince-electors, kings, dukes, margraves, counts and others. Burghers consisted of representatives of the independent imperial cities. Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the Imperial Knights and independent villages. The power of the Imperial Diet was limited, despite efforts of centralization.

Large realms of the nobility or clergy had estates of their own that could wield great power in local affairs. Power struggles between ruler and estates were comparable to similar events in the history of the British and French parliaments.

The Swabian League, a significant regional power in its part of Germany during the 15th Century, also had its own kind of Estates, a governing Federal Council comprising three Colleges: those of Princes, Cities, and Knights.

==Russian Empire==

In the late Russian Empire, the estates were called &quot;sosloviyes&quot;. The four major estates were: nobility (&quot;dvoryanstvo&quot;), clergy, rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein. The division in estates was of mixed nature: traditional, occupational, as well as formal: for example, voting in Duma was carried out by estates. Russian Empire Census recorded the reported estate of a person.

==Kingdom of Portugal==

In the Medieval Kingdom of Portugal, the &quot;Cortes&quot; was an assembly of representatives of the estates of the realm – the nobility, clergy and bourgeoisie. It was called and dismissed by the King of Portugal at will, at a place of his choosing. Cortes which brought all three estates together are sometimes distinguished as &quot;Cortes-Gerais&quot; (General Courts), in contrast to smaller assemblies which brought only one or two estates, to negotiate a specific point relevant only to them.

==Principality of Catalonia==

The Parliament of Catalonia was first established in 1283 as the Catalan Courts (Catalan: &quot;Corts Catalanes&quot;), according to American historian Thomas Bisson, and it has been considered by several historians as a model of medieval parliament. For instance, English historian of constitutionalism Charles Howard McIlwain wrote that the General Court of Catalonia, during the 14th century, had a more defined organization and met more regularly than the parliaments of England or France.

The roots of the parliament institution in Catalonia are in the Peace and Truce Assemblies (&quot;assemblees de pau i treva&quot;) that started in the 11th century.
The members of the Catalan Courts were organized in the Three Estates (Catalan: &quot;Tres Estats&quot; or &quot;Tres Braços&quot;):
* the &quot;military estate&quot; (&quot;braç militars&quot;) with representatives of the feudal nobility
* the &quot;ecclesiastical estate&quot; (&quot;braç eclesiàstic&quot;) with representatives of the religious hierarchy
* the &quot;royal estate&quot; (&quot;braç reial&quot; or &quot;braç popular&quot;) with representatives of the free municipalities under royal privilege
The parliamentary institution was abolished in 1716, together with the rest of institutions of the Principality of Catalonia, after the War of the Spanish Succession.

<text>Boseong County (&quot;Boseong-gun&quot;) is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea. Boseong is famous for its green tea leaves, with 26.71 hectares of land dedicated to its production. It is also the birthplace of the Korean independence activist Philip Jaisohn.

==History==
In the Samhan era, Boseong belonged to the Mahan confederacy and later became Bokhol County (伏忽郡) under the rule of the Baekje dynasty. The name &quot;Boseong&quot; was given in Unified Silla.

==Geography==
Large areas consist of mountains such as Mangil-Bong, Jonje Mountain and Joowol Mountain. The Boseong River flows through the center of Boseong. The multipurpose Juam Dam was built on the Boseong River in 1990.

===Climate===
Boseong is one of the rainiest places in South Korea. It has a moderate climate. The average annual temperature is 12.6 °C. The average temperature in January is −0.5 °C and the average temperature in August is 27.8 °C. Annual mean precipitation is 1,450 mm.

==Administrative district==
Boseong consists of two towns-Boseong town and Beolgyo town. In both towns, the population has gradually decreased.
* The town of Boseong is the seat of a county office. It is also a major transportation hub since 1930 and the distribution center of agricultural products. The largest tea gardens in South Korea are in the southern part of the Boseong County. 
* Beolgyo is also major transportation hub. It had flourished since the Japanese occupation but it has somewhat declined in recent years.

==Boseong Green Tea==

Boseong Green Tea is a special product of the Boseong district.

Boseong County, also called DongguyeojI-Seungnam (meaning &quot;tea house&quot; in the Joseon Dynasty), is known as the green tea capital of Korea. It has produced green tea for the past 1600 years. It is the largest tea-producing area in Korea, accounting for 40 percent of the nation&#x27;s tea production. Almost one third of all tea farmland is located in Boseong, and nearly half of all green tea production in Korea comes from the area. This status has been carefully crafted in recent decades, partly due to the long history green tea has with the area.

The surrounding climate and soil provide good conditions for growing a unique green tea that has a distinct taste and aroma.

The earliest historical mention of green tea in Korea was from the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla in the mid-7th century AD. Nearly two hundred years later, historical records indicate that green tea seeds were planted at the foot of nearby Jirisan Mountain. During the Joseon dynasty, green tea began to fall out of favor due to its close association with Buddhism, but was still enjoyed by certain parts of the population; and the Jirisan plantation continued to thrive. But green tea was not produced on a large-scale basis until the 1930s. By the 1970s, huge, terraced farms as large as 250 acres became commonplace on local mountainsides. The 1980s marked the beginning of a decline in green tea demand, which resulted in lower green tea output and a degradation of crops. The local government then decided to reinvigorate the green tea industry: local green tea businesses were subsidized; newer, more efficient means to increase output and quality were developed through collaboration with local universities and research institutes. Local media outlets also made efforts to present Boseong as the green tea capital of the country, in order to increase dominance in the industry by local businesses and draw in tourists from around the country.
Mt. Hwangseong features the largest plantation in Boseong, the Daehan Green Tea Plantation. This plantation accounts for over one third of all tea production in the area. The mountainside features a terraced design that extends along the lower reaches of the mountain and is carefully manicured, providing an impressive view when seen from the top. This view is accessible by road and has become a well-known stop for tourists. The Boseong Fragrance Tea Festival is also staged in May of each year and 2013 will mark the 38th year of the festival. The festival gives tea enthusiasts the chance to pick tea leaves, make tea bowls or sample local cuisine infused with green tea flavoring.

Boseong Green Tea passed the strict quality inspection of the Russian Medical Biology Lab, and was officially recognized as a beverage suitable for an astronaut&#x27;s special diet.

==Transportation==
National Road No. 2 goes through Boseong, and the Gyeongjeon Line transits several towns. There are mainly five stations including Boseong station, Dukryang Station, Yedang Station, Joseong Station and Beolgyo Station. Coastal region has well-connected transportation. However, inland of Boseong has a poor transportation because of mountains.

==Notable people==

*Paik Hak-soon Director of Inter-Korean Relations and Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in Korea 
*Park Ra-yeon South Korean poet
*Cheong Yang-seog South Korean politician
*Baek Ji-heon, K-pop idol from the K-pop group Fromis 9

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Boseong is twinned with:

* Gangnam-gu, South Korea
* Gangbuk-gu, South Korea
* Yeonje-gu, South Korea
* Buk-gu, South Korea
* Sujiatun, China

Many touristic attractions have been created to leverage that reputation: a Bamboo Theme Park / Daenamugol, a Bamboo Museum, a Bamboo Festival, a park filled with green bamboo (Juknokwon - 죽녹원).

=== Metasequoia ===
A stretch of metasequoia trees just outside Damyang-eup, planted during the Park Chung-Hee administration in the 1970s, has a long walking path of about two kilometers. The trees are particularly striking in late October to early November when their leaves turn bright colors. The walk gained nationwide popularity after a romantic drama was shot here. It was even picked as one of the most beautiful roads in all of Korea.

<doc id="393420" wikidata="Q1740415" url="?curid=393420" title="Vehicle registration plates of the Republic of Ireland">
<text>In Ireland, vehicle registration plates (commonly known as &quot;number plates&quot; or &quot;registration plates&quot;) are the visual indications of motor vehicle registration which has been mandatory since 1903 to display on most motor vehicles used on public roads in Ireland. The alphanumeric marks (or &quot;registration numbers&quot;, officially termed &quot;identification marks&quot;) themselves are issued by the local authority in which a vehicle is first registered.

==Format ==

The current specification for number plates is the format YYY–CC–SSSSSS.

Those issued from 1987 to 2012 had the format YY–CC–SSSSSS.

The components are:

* YYY or YY – an age/year identifier. This is based on date of first registration.
* CC – a one or two-character county/city identifier (e.g. L for Limerick City and County; SO for County Sligo).
* SSSSSS – a one to six-digit sequence number, starting with the first vehicle registered in the county/city that year/period.

=== Year identifiers ===
The YY format was used between 1987 and 2012. This format displayed the last two digits of the year the car was registered. For example, the 12,345th car registered in Dublin in 2001 would display 01-D-12345.

The YYY format has been in use since 2013. This amends the original format to include the digits 1 or 2 after the year. These numbers are used depending on the time of year the vehicle is registered. Vehicles registered in the January–June period display a 1, while vehicles registered from July–December display a 2. Under this format, the 12,345th vehicle registered in Dublin in the second period of 2022 would display 222-D-12345.

== Specifications ==
Since 1991, the design of the standard Irish number plate has been based on European standard guidelines, with a blue vertical band to the left of the plate containing the twelve stars of the Flag of Europe, below which is the country identifier for Ireland: IRL. The rest of the plate has a white background with black characters. There are usually two hyphens; between the year and county code, and between the county code and sequence number. Also required is the full Irish language name of the county/city which must be positioned above the identifier.

The current regulations are set out in the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations, 1999, as amended by the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 2012. These prescribe the format, dimensions and technical specifications of registration plates to be displayed on vehicles. They substitute the First Schedule of the Vehicle Registration and Taxation Regulations, 1992 to allow additional characters to be displayed on the registration plate and to ensure that these are displayed in the correct position and proportion. The changes were necessary to cater for increases in the number of car registrations.

A standard uniform character font is not required. The rules simply require legible black sans serif characters, no more than 70mm high and 36mm wide with a stroke width of 10mm, on a white reflective background. The result is that a large variety of perfectly legal font styles may be seen, on either pressed aluminium or acrylic plates, both of which are allowed. Commonly used fonts include a condensed version of Mandatory, Arial and FE-Schrift. Despite the rather relaxed lack of a specified font, the hyphen between the lettering must lie between the minimum dimensions of 13mm x 10mm or the maximum dimension of 22mm x 10mm. Vehicle owners may be fined if the plate&#x27;s format does not meet the requirements, and the vehicle will fail the mandatory periodic National Car Test.

A vehicle&#x27;s number plate is determined when it is first registered, the county/city code is taken from the first owner&#x27;s postal address. Registration remains fixed on one vehicle until it is de-registered (exported, destroyed, etc.), and cannot be transferred to other vehicles.

==Current implementation==
Sequence numbers may be reserved for new vehicle registrations only on completion of form VRT15A and payment of €1,000. This reservation was withdrawn from used imported vehicles on first Irish registration in 2015.

* Most registration numbers can be reserved, with the exception of the first number of each year issued in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford as these are reserved for the respective mayor/lord mayor of these cities.
Thus, for example, in 2019, Lord Mayor Paul McAuliffe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, was entitled to receive the registration plate 191-D-1 on his official vehicle.
* Luxury cars with numeric names are often registered with a matching, usually pre-reserved sequence number: for example 06-D-911 on a Porsche 911 or 06-D-750 BMW 750 or 03-C-5 for a 2003 Citroen C5 and 08-D-89 for an Aston Martin DB9.
* Dublin radio station FM104 tend to register their vehicles with reserved number sequences ending with &quot;104&quot;, e.g. 05-D-38104.

There are only two pre-1987 codes still issued in Ireland.
* &quot;ZZ&quot;, administered by the AA Ireland as agents for the Revenue Commissioners, is given to registrants who are based outside the state and who only intend keeping the vehicle within Ireland for a period not exceeding one month. This form of temporary registration is usually used for vehicles that are purchased within Ireland but exported by its new owner to another sovereign state directly after purchase. The format of the code is ZZ followed by a five digit number.
* &quot;ZV&quot;, which can be selected as an alternative to the current scheme when registering a vehicle older than 30 years for the first time in Ireland.

==Special formats==
Imported used cars are registered based on the year of first registration in their country of original registration rather than the year of import. Early in this system, each county used to have a continuous sequence of numbers for vehicles so if a new car registered on 31 December 2010 was 10 D 37456, then the next registered car from 2010 registered in 2011 would be 10 D 37457. This changed in late 2011 when each county (prior to 2010) had their next available sequence number increased. For example, 10-D-120006 would be the 6th import in Dublin of a car from 2010, as Dublin&#x27;s re-registration band starts at 120000. Meath&#x27;s starts at 15000.

Vehicles registered to the Irish Defence Forces have plates with silver letters on black background. These do not feature the Irish-language county name.

Trade plates have plates with white letters on a dark green background, but with the reverse style of the normal plates: the trader&#x27;s number for that year is displayed first, the county second, and the applicable year last.

Diplomatic plates are very similar to civilian format, except for the small &quot;CD&quot; between the index mark code and serial number. Code CD is not always shown in Diplomatic plates.

==Index mark codes==

The city codes are a single letter, the initial letter of its English-language name. Most county codes use the first and last letters of the county&#x27;s name. For example, Sligo is SO. The exceptions to this are:
*The &quot;D&quot; code which is used for County Dublin is co-extensive and is in use for the counties of Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and Dublin City.
* Where the county shares its registration function with the city of the same name, in which case both use the single-letter code. An example of this is County Cork, which shares the same name with Cork City, and takes the code &quot;C&quot;.
* Where a conflict exists, i.e. Kerry is KY, so Kilkenny is KK; and County Waterford was (until 2014) WD, (subsequently changed to &quot;W&quot;), so Wexford is WX.
*The &quot;T&quot; code which is used County Tipperary. This is because the county was, until 2014, divided into Tipperary North Riding (TN) and Tipperary South Riding (TS).
The codes are similar to the ISO 3166-2 codes for Irish counties. An exception is that the ISO code for Cork is IE-CO, since IE-C is used for the province of , and the ISO code for Tipperary is IE-TA (from the Irish name &quot;Tiobraid Árann&quot;).

===Current index mark codes===

Note: in the case of Counties Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford, where a vehicle has been first brought into use in another country prior to 1 January 2014 and is subsequently imported into and registered in Ireland, the codes L, LK, TS, TN, W, and WD as formerly applicable continue to be issued for such vehicles. This is to maintain the integrity of the numbering system in place for the years prior to 2014.

===Former index mark codes===
Codes used from 1987 to 2013:
==EU standardised vehicle registration plates==
Ireland was the first country to introduce the now common blue European Union strip (comprising the European flag symbol and the country code of the member state) on the left-hand side of the number plate in 1991, following the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations statute of 1990 (S.I. No. 287/1990). A similar band was adopted by Portugal in 1992 and by Germany in 1994 and was standardised across the EU on 11 November 1998 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98.

==History==
From 1903, the system used in Ireland was part of the original British system of identifiers. This was superseded in Ireland on 1 January 1987.

A two-letter code containing the letter I was allocated to each administrative county in alphabetical order (the full list appears below), with the initial registration format being the code followed by a sequence number from 1 to 9999, as in Great Britain. The codes allocated ran from IA to IZ, then from AI to WI, with the letters G, S, and V skipped as these were intended for Scotland. The full list was as follows:

In 1921, shortly before the creation of the Irish Free State, Belfast and Dublin City completed their original marks and thus took the next available codes, XI and YI respectively, with Dublin City then taking ZI in 1927. After this, most other codes with Z as the first letter (again skipping those containing G, S and V) were allocated in alphabetical order, starting with single-letter Z – the only one-letter code used in Ireland – for County Dublin. (This does not include the ZZ code for temporary imports, introduced in 1925.)

In February 1952, a joint motor taxation authority was set up for Dublin City and county, and their codes were merged. Two years later, with all possible codes (at the time) allocated, a new format was introduced with a serial letter added before the code, and the sequence number running only to 999 (thus limiting the number of characters on a number plate to six). The Dublin joint authority was the first to adopt this format when it issued ARI 1 in May 1954, and each county followed suit once all its two-letter combinations had been issued. In the case of counties with more than one code, all the three-letter marks for the first allocated code would be issued, then all such marks for the second code, and so on (see the lists of series per county below).

G, S and V were not used as serial letters at first, while Z was not used before a code starting with that letter, so as to prevent any clashing with ZZ temporary registrations. Several other three-letter marks were not issued either through oversight or because they were deemed offensive, and the single-letter Z code was left out of this format as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code, particularly one used in Northern Ireland.

Initially, all number plates had been black with white or silver characters, but in 1969 the option of black-on-white at the front and black-on-red at the rear was introduced.
In February 1970, the Dublin joint authority exhausted all its three-letter combinations and thus began issuing &quot;reversed&quot; registrations, starting with the original two-letter codes (plus single-letter Z) in order of allocation. These were followed from July 1974 onwards by the three-letter marks (1 ARI etc.), issued in the same manner as for the forward versions. Again, other counties followed this example over time. Also in 1974, Cork followed Dublin&#x27;s example of setting up a joint motor taxation authority for city and county, though their codes were not merged until August 1985.

In 1982, with Dublin and several other counties having exhausted all possible combinations of their original codes, it was decided to allocate the skipped codes containing G, S and V to these counties. In the cases of these codes, the forward three-letter combinations were issued first in the same manner as before, followed by the forward two-letter combinations.

Under this system, Irish vehicle registration marks could be transferred to Britain for re-registration on other vehicles, even after Irish independence, and even though they could not be re-used within Ireland. The letter I in many combinations made these attractive for collectors, and indeed the Kilkenny issue VIP 1 fetched a record price at auction. Since the introduction of the current system in 1987, such exports have been impossible, even for old-format registrations, although those already exported may still be re-transferred.

In the 1980s, it became apparent that all possible combinations under the numbering system then in force would soon become exhausted. In Northern Ireland, this problem was rectified by the addition of additional digits. In the Republic of Ireland, it was decided to introduce an entirely new system with the format of double digits indicating the year of first registration, followed by one or two letters indicating the county of first registration, followed by a number, assigned to vehicles registered in a particular county in order (for example, 87-RN-9999 indicates that the vehicle was the 9999th to be registered in Roscommon in 1987). The new system was introduced on 1 January 1987.

The 1987 system allocated single-letter codes to the county boroughs (including those shared with counties) and two-letter codes to the other counties. Normally these are the initial and final letter of the English-language name of the county (except where duplicates would result). The full list was as follows:

Until 1991, all plates under this system consisted solely of black characters on white, on both front and rear. However, in that year, the blue EU identifier and the official Irish language name of the county were added, the latter as a result of the controversy arising from using English as the basis, described by Conradh na Gaeilge, an organisation which promotes the Irish language in Ireland and worldwide, as &quot;a fiasco&quot;.

Vehicles first registered outside the state before 1987 are allowed to be re-registered using only the current system, with a year number preceding 87 – for instance, a vehicle from 1964 re-registered in Meath would have 64-MH at the start of its registration.

In 2013, the year was changed to a 3-digit year with the third digit being 1 for January to June and 2 for July to December, for example, 131 for January–June 2013 and 132 for July–December 2013. The decision to change the year was based partly on superstition about an unlucky &#x27;13&#x27; registration, but also to boost sales in the second half of the year.

==Pre-1987 mark codes==

The first codes were allocated in 1903, when all of Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom. The codes were based on the alphabetical order of counties and county boroughs (cities) as they were named at the time. King&#x27;s County and Queen&#x27;s County were renamed Offaly and Laois respectively following the independence of most of Ireland as the Irish Free State. Counties and county boroughs in italics are in Northern Ireland and still use the 1903 system.

Codes with the letters G, S and V were reserved until the 1980s when they were taken by counties that had exhausted all the combinations for their original codes.

On 1 January 1987, a completely new registration plate system was introduced for new vehicles.

Vehicles older than 1987 imported into Ireland from 1987 were not given age-related numbers from the old system but were included in the new system. Their initial year number and county (i.e. A UK reg 1967 Ford Cortina (MHW 7E) would be registered as 67-D-1 (e.g. 67-D (or any county initial) 1) This would state the year of its first registration or manufacture outside the state but since 2011 these numbers have begun at 120000 which is not historical or authentic (e.g. 67-D-120001). A 1986 Opel with right-hand-drive registered in Ireland would have a pre-1987 style registration plate, the same model car with left-hand-drive imported from the rest of Europe or a Vauxhall from England, Scotland or Wales would have new 86 registration plate. Volkswagen Beetle cars that were imported as knock-down kits from Mexico and assembled up to the mid-2000s were registered in Ireland on original Irish reg chassis having pre-1987 number plates. Pre-1987 registration plates are few and far between nowadays and are mostly found at vintage car shows.

<text>Joseph Martin Kraus (20 June 1756 – 15 December 1792), was a German-Swedish composer in the Classical era who was born in Miltenberg am Main, Holy Roman Empire. He moved to Sweden at age 21, and died at the age of 36 in Stockholm. He has been referred to as &quot;the Swedish Mozart&quot;, although his music is rarely performed today. He is best known for having been a sacred music composer, while his symphonic output was much higher than was is extant today. He composed in a wide array of forms, and took his greatest aesthetic influence from F.S. Haydn and W. A. Mozart. His competency and artistic skill was praised almost universally during his time, although his music is seldom performed.

== Life ==

=== Childhood ===
Kraus was born in the South German town of Miltenberg in Lower Franconia, the son of Joseph Bernhard Kraus, a county clerk in the Archbishopric of Mainz, and Anna Dorothea née Schmidt. His father&#x27;s family, originally from Augsburg, had a small restaurant in Weilbach near Amorbach, while his mother was a daughter of the master-builder at Miltenberg Johann Martin Schmidt. They had 14 children, of whom seven died in childhood; Marianne Kraus was a sister of Joseph&#x27;s.

After a short stay in Osterburken, the Kraus family moved in 1761 to Buchen (in the Odenwald), where Joseph Bernhard Kraus found a position as a clerk. Joseph Martin Kraus began his formal education there. His first music teachers were rector Georg Pfister (1730–1807) and cantor Bernhard Franz Wendler (1702–1782), who gave him mainly piano and violin lessons. Kraus showed his musical talent at an early age. When he was 12, he was enrolled in the Jesuit Gymnasium and Music Seminar at Mannheim, where he studied German and Latin literature and music. There he received a rigorous musical training, especially in violin technique, and philological education from P. Alexander Keck (1724–1804) and P. Anton Klein (1748–1810).

=== Studies ===
Kraus&#x27;s parents wished him to matriculate as a student of law at the University of Mainz in 1773. However, he was not satisfied with the situation at that university, and even published a satire about it. After only one year, he applied to the University of Erfurt, where he could study music too. Both Catholic and Protestant (Lutheran) music was flourishing in Erfurt, with a rich musical tradition. Kraus soon neglected his law studies and focused fully on music and literature.

A defamation trial against his father forced him to interrupt his studies for one year and to move back to Buchen. He spent his time there writing his three-act tragedy &quot;Tolon&quot; and several musical works for the town church of St. Oswald, including a &quot;Te Deum&quot; in D major and the motet &quot;Fracto Demum Sacramento&quot;, also in D major. After this one-year break, he continued his studies of law in Göttingen. Although the Göttinger Hainbund (the German poet group that flourished in 1772–74) no longer existed, Kraus found himself very much attracted to the ideas of this group of young poets who were almost fanatically devoted to Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. In this period Kraus composed a recently rediscovered book of 19 poems titled &quot;Versuch von Schäfersgedichten&quot;. He became increasingly involved with the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement, which influenced both his writing and his music.

In 1775, at the age of nineteen, Kraus wrote his Requiem, one of his earliest compositions. There is no way to know for sure whether young Kraus was induced to compose this genre of church music for personal reasons, or whether his choice may have been influenced by his attraction to &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;. The work is full of dramatic force and original, bold ideas.

The Requiem was followed by two oratorios: &quot;Der Tod Jesu&quot; and &quot;Die Geburt Jesu&quot; (lost), and the musical treatise &quot;Etwas von und über Musik: fürs Jahr 1777&quot; (&quot;Something about Music: for the year 1777&quot;; Frankfurt am Main 1778).

The oratorio &quot;Der Tod Jesu&quot; differs from the oratorios of many other composers in that Kraus wrote both the music and the text. As a librettist, Kraus showed a series of scenes that covered the full spectrum of human emotions, from sorrow and fear to joy. The work corresponds fully to a rhetorical question already raised in Kraus&#x27;s treatise &quot;Etwas von und über Musik&quot;:

&quot;Should not church music be mostly for the heart?&quot;
(&quot;Soll die Musik in den Kirchen nicht am meisten fürs Herz sein?&quot;)

During his stay in Göttingen, Kraus had become friendly with a Swedish fellow student, , who persuaded him to accompany him to Stockholm to apply for a position at the court of King Gustav III.

=== At the Swedish court ===
Kraus moved to Stockholm in 1778, when he was not yet twenty-two. His first years there were not easy, and more than once he considered going back home. King Gustav&#x27;s love for the fine arts had quickly become known in the rest of Europe and attracted musicians from many countries. It took Kraus three bitter years, often spent in extreme poverty, before the king noticed him. His opera &quot;Azire&quot; was rejected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, but the Academy decided to give him a second chance. Gustav III himself drafted the opera libretto &quot;Proserpin,&quot; which the poet Johan Henric Kellgren versified. Kraus&#x27;s music to this libretto was successfully premiered at Ulriksdal Palace on 6 June 1781, before the king and the royal household. Kraus was appointed &quot;vice-Kapellmeister&quot; of the Royal Swedish Opera and director of the Royal Academy of Music.

It was the long-awaited breakthrough. Dizzy with the success, Kraus wrote to his parents:

&quot;Immediately after the music ended, the king talked to me for more than a quarter of an hour ... it had simply given him so much satisfaction. Yesterday I was engaged by him. Of course I was not granted any great title, but quite simply that of &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;. What is worth much more to me than 600 guilders is the favour I have been granted, which is that I am to undertake a journey to Germany, France and Italy at the King&#x27;s expense.&quot;

=== Grand Tour ===
Gustav III sent Kraus on a Grand Tour of Europe that lasted five years, to learn all he could about Theater abroad. On this trip, Kraus met Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, Padre Martini, and Joseph Haydn, for whom he wrote a symphony to play at Esterháza; it was first published under Haydn&#x27;s name in Paris. Kraus&#x27;s Symphonies in E minor, VB 141, and F major, VB 145, were first published in Paris in 1787, under the name of Giuseppe Cambini, a very popular composer at the time. During this time, Kraus became a member of the same masonic lodge as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart whom he met and became very friendly with.

During his journey, Kraus also wrote his famous flute quintet in D Major, VB 188, that broke with all the erstwhile conventions that governed such pieces. The outer and inner form of that work were groundbreaking comparing with everything previously composed at the time, with the astoundingly long first movement of 306 bars.

After Vienna, his journey also took him throughout Italy, France, and England, where he witnessed the Handel Centenary celebrations at Westminster Abbey in 1785. While in Paris, he experienced difficulty with cabals back in Stockholm that sought to prevent his return, but their resolution in 1786 made it possible for him to become the leading figure in Gustavian musical life.

=== Back to Sweden ===
When Kraus returned in 1787, he was appointed as director of curriculum at the Royal Academy of Music, and the next year he succeeded Francesco Uttini as &quot;Kapellmästare&quot;, eventually attaining a reputation as an innovative conductor, progressive pedagogue, and multi-talented composer. He also became a member of the literary circle that gathered round the Architect Erik Palmstedt (who was commissioned by King Gustav III to build the first royal opera house), a group that discussed intellectual and cultural life in the Swedish capital.

For the convening of the Riksdag of the Estates in 1789, Gustav III wanted to persuade the parliament to accede to his ongoing war with Russia, where he was opposed by the nobility but supported by the burghers and the peasantry. To further his aims, Gustav III intended to secure parliamentary approval of the Act of Union and Security that would give him broad powers over the administration of the government. The king asked Kraus to write Riksdagsmusiken for the opening ceremonies in St Nicolai Church on 9 March 1789. The music consists of a march based on the March of the Priests from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, and a symphony (&quot;Sinfonia per la chiesa&quot;). The legislature approved the king&#x27;s measures.

Kraus wrote an overture, a march and interludes for the staging of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Olympie&quot; in January 1792. Although he was considered as a composer of stage music, his greatest work, &quot;Aeneas i Cartago&quot;, remained unperformed during his lifetime. 16 March 1792, Gustav III attended a masked ball at the opera, where he was assassinated. (This inspired the plots of operas by several composers, notably Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; premiered in 1859.) The death of Gustav III caused considerable turmoil in the cultural establishment that the monarch had nurtured. Kraus wrote a funeral cantata and the Symphonie funèbre, which were played at the burial ceremony on April 13 and May 14.

Kraus&#x27;s own health deteriorated shortly thereafter, and he died in December 1792 from tuberculosis. He was buried outside Stockholm at Tivoli following a ceremony where his coffin was carried across the ice of the Brunnsviken by torchlight. His tomb (c. 1833) bears the inscription: &quot;Här det jordiska af Kraus, det himmelska lefver i hans toner&quot;, which translates to: &quot;Here the earthly of Kraus; the heavenly lives in his music&quot;

=== Works ===
Bertil H. van Boer divides Kraus&#x27;s sacred music into two periods. The first, from 1768 to 1777, comprises Kraus&#x27;s music written as a Roman Catholic for Catholic services. For the second, from 1778 to 1790, Kraus was still Catholic, but wrote music for Lutheran services. Aside from short hymns and chorales, there was not much use for sacred music in Sweden at that time. There was also an ongoing debate regarding the role music should play in the church, and Kraus participated by writing three articles on the subject in the &quot;Stockholms-Posten&quot;.

Two different catalogues exist of Kraus&#x27;s music, one by Karl Schreiber, &quot;Verzeichnis der Musikalischen Werke von Jos. Kraus&#x27;s&quot;, which gives each composition an A number, and one by Bertil van Boer&#x27;s &quot;Die Werke von Joseph Martin Kraus: Systematisch-thematisches Werkverzeichnis&quot;, which gives each composition a VB number, with renumberings in the 2nd edition (1998). See the list of compositions by Joseph Martin Kraus.

Bertil van Boer edited modern editions for Artaria Editions, recorded on four volumes of the Naxos Records complete set of Kraus symphonies, and also wrote the programme notes for those discs as well as the article on Kraus in the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;. Volume 1 won the Cannes Classical Award in 1999, while Volume 2 contains world première recordings of three of Kraus&#x27;s symphonies. The orchestra Concerto Köln won several prizes for its recordings on period instruments of the complete symphonies of Joseph Martin Kraus.

=== Musical style ===

Kraus&#x27;s music is characterized by sudden dramatic contrasts in register, character, and most striking of all, harmony. His contrapuntal abilities were first-rate, but his motivic development does not seem as advanced as either Mozart&#x27;s or Haydn&#x27;s. Compared to other contemporaries, his lyrical gifts are apparent.

=== Kraus&#x27;s symphonies ===
Many of Kraus&#x27;s symphonies have been lost, or attributed to other composers. Of those definitely of Kraus&#x27;s authorship, only about a dozen remain. Most of Kraus&#x27;s extant symphonies are in three movements, without a minuet. Most are scored for two horns and strings, many include two flutes and two oboes, while the later ones also include two bassoons and two additional horns. The musicologist Bertil van Boer identifies Kraus&#x27;s Symphony in C-sharp minor as &quot;one of only two symphonies in this key written during the eighteenth century.&quot; It was later reworked in a more &#x27;manageable&#x27; key as Symphony in C minor, VB 142.

It is still disputed whether the symphony dedicated to Haydn was the Symphony in D major VB 143 or the Symphony in C minor VB 142. The minor key and the mood of Symphony VB 142 seem to be reminiscent of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period around 1770, comparable with his earlier minor-key works, although based on the first measures of Gluck&#x27;s overture to Iphigénie en Aulide. In any case, Haydn had a very high opinion of the work. Many years after Kraus&#x27;s death, Haydn remarked to a common friend, Swedish diplomat Fredrik Samuel Silverstolpe:

&quot;The symphony he wrote here in Vienna especially for me will be regarded as a masterpiece for centuries to come; believe me, there are few people who can compose something like that.&quot;

=== Kraus viola concerti ===
Kraus wrote two viola concerti that were lost or attributed to other composers in his lifetime. The C major Concerto was attributed to Roman Hoffstetter, but both works have been found to be Kraus&#x27;s compositions and have been recorded professionally by David Aaron Carpenter in 2012.

=== Chamber music ===

Kraus&#x27;s chamber music includes quartets, solo sonatas, and sonatas for violin and piano.

<doc id="393437" wikidata="Q1982051" url="?curid=393437" title="Kang the Conqueror">
<text>Kang the Conqueror (Nathaniel Richards) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #19 (October 1963) as Rama-Tut, an adversary of the Fantastic Four, before being reinvented as Kang in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #8 (September 1964), an adversary of the Avengers. A time-traveler, several alternate versions of Kang have appeared throughout Marvel Comics titles over the years, such as Rama-Tut, Immortus, Scarlet Centurion, Victor Timely, Iron Lad, and Mister Gryphon.

Kang the Conqueror has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful villains. Kang has made media appearances in animated television and video games. Kang made his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023), portrayed by Jonathan Majors, who previously appeared as different versions of the character in the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot; (2021–2023).

==Publication history==
The character who would become best known as Kang first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #19 (October 1963), by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. This issue introduced the pharaoh Rama-Tut, a criminal from the year 3000 who had travelled back in time and conquered ancient Egypt. It was implied that he was a descendant or future incarnation of Fantastic Four villain Doctor Doom. After a second appearance the following year in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #2 (September 1964), the character appeared again, this time under the identity of Kang, in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #8 (published the same month), also by Lee and Kirby. This issue also established that Rama-Tut was a younger version of Kang. A decade later, the character of Immortus, previously introduced in &quot;Avengers&quot; #10 (November 1964), was retroactively established to be a future identity of Kang&#x27;s in &quot;Giant-Size Avengers&quot; #3 (February 1975).

&quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #273 (December 1984) heavily implied that Kang was not descended from Doom, but from Reed Richards&#x27; father Nathaniel, via one of Reed&#x27;s many half-siblings. Building on this, Kang&#x27;s birth name was revealed to also be &quot;Nathaniel Richards&quot; in &quot;What If…?&quot; Vol. 2 #39 (July 1992), a fact later incorporated into the primary continuity of the Marvel Universe. However, subsequent publications, such as &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; #9 (August 1999) and &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; #6 (March 2020), have continued to present Kang&#x27;s ancestry as ambiguous, suggesting he may descended from one, both, or neither of the two men, in particular Kristoff Vernard: Doom&#x27;s adoptive son and a half-sibling of Reed.

Kang featured in an eponymous miniseries in 2021.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Kang===
Nathaniel Richards, a 31st-century scholar and descendant of Reed Richards&#x27;s time traveling father Nathaniel, becomes fascinated with history and discovers the time travel technology created by Victor von Doom, another possible ancestor of his. He then travels back in time to ancient Egypt aboard a Sphinx-shaped timeship and reinvents himself as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, with plans to claim En Sabah Nur—the mutant destined to become Apocalypse—as his heir. The pharaoh&#x27;s rule is cut short when he is defeated by the time-displaced Fantastic Four. An embittered Nathaniel Richards travels forward to the 20th century where he meets Doctor Doom, whom he believes might be his ancestor. He later designs an armor based on Doom&#x27;s and, calling himself the Scarlet Centurion, pits the Avengers team against alternate-reality counterparts. He plans to dispose of all of them, but the Avengers manage to force him from the timeline, where a divergent version of him becomes Victorex Prime, archenemy of the Squadron Supreme.

Nathaniel then tries to return to the 31st century, but overshoots by a thousand years, discovering that humanity has ruined the Earth through endless conflict using advanced weapons they no longer understand. He finds it simple to conquer the planet, expanding his dominion throughout the galaxy, and reinvents himself as Kang the Conqueror. But this future world is dying, and so he decides to take over an earlier, more fertile Earth.

===Early appearances and Ravonna===
On Nathaniel&#x27;s first foray into the 20th century under the Kang identity, he meets and battles the Avengers, capturing everyone but the Wasp and Rick Jones, and informs the world that they have 24 hours to surrender to him. Jones and some friends pretend they want to help Kang, but double-cross him once they gain access to his ship, and the Avengers are freed. In an attempt to stop them, Kang releases radiation that only beings from his time are immune to, but Thor uses his hammer to absorb the rays and send them back at the warlord so even he cannot withstand it, and he is forced to escape. He later attempts to defeat the Avengers using a Spider-Man robot, but the real Spider-Man destroys it.

In his own time, Kang falls for the princess of one of his subject kingdoms, Ravonna, who does not return his feelings. In an attempt to demonstrate his power, he kidnaps the Avengers and, after several escape attempts on their part, subdues them and the rebellious kingdom with the help of his army. When Kang refuses to execute Ravonna, his commanders revolt and he frees the Avengers to fight with him against them. They successfully subdue them, but not before Ravonna is mortally wounded when she leaps in front of a blast meant for Kang, realizing she does love him after all. Kang returns the Avengers to their present, and places Ravonna&#x27;s body in stasis.

Kang appears in modern-day as he attempts to retrieve a rogue Growing Man construct who is growing larger with every blow. Both Thor and the police are not able to subdue the giant, until Kang appears from a time machine disguised as a boulder. He fires a ray, shrinking and subduing the Growing Man to doll-sized so he can be &quot;re-hidden&quot;. He later reactivates the Growing Man to kidnap an incapacitated Tony Stark and draw the Avengers into his game, though the purpose is not revealed. Thor fails to keep Kang from escaping into the time-stream.

In hopes of restoring his love to life, Kang enters a wager with the cosmic entity Grandmaster, using the Avengers as pawns in a game which, if won, can temporarily grant him power over life and death. The first round ends in stalemate when an unaware Black Knight intervenes and prevents a clear victory by the Avengers, although the team definitively wins the second round. Due to the first round&#x27;s stalemate, Kang does not earn the power of both life and death but is forced to choose. He selects the power of death over the Avengers, but is stopped by the Black Knight, who, not being an Avenger at the time, is unaffected.

Next Kang kidnaps the Hulk and sends him to 1917 France to kill the Phantom Eagle before he can save Bruce Banner&#x27;s grandfather from a cannon. This would prevent the Hulk from existing and consequently, the formation of the Avengers. However, the Hulk destroys the cannon which sends him back to the present while Kang is projected into the Limbo.

===The Celestial Madonna===
Some time later Kang reappears at Avengers Mansion seeking the &quot;Celestial Madonna&quot;, who turns out to be Mantis, desiring to marry her as she is apparently destined to have a powerful child. The heroes are aided by a future version of Kang, who, tired of conquest, had returned to ancient Egypt and his identity of Rama-Tut, ruling benevolently for ten years before placing himself in suspended animation to revive in the 20th century, desiring to counsel and change his younger self. While Kang is successfully foiled, Rama-Tut is unable to prevent the accidental death of Swordsman. During an adventure in Limbo, it is revealed that Immortus is the future incarnation of both Kang and Rama-Tut.

While attempting to travel to the time of the Crusades, Hawkeye accidentally comes across Kang, sending both to the Old West. The warlord begins to develop a stronghold to conquer the 19th century, thus also conquering the present. Aided this time by Immortus, the Avengers, with some assistance from the Two-Gun Kid, confront Kang. While trying to muster the strength to defeat Thor, Kang overloads his armor and destroys himself, apparently erasing Immortus and Rama-Tut from existence.

===Prime Kang and creation of alternate selves===
Years later, the Beyonder plucks a living Kang from the timestream to participate on the villains&#x27; side in the first of the Secret Wars. Soon after, it is revealed that while Kang had indeed died, his constant time-traveling had created a number of alternate Kangs. The Kang to discover this had been drawn to Limbo after his time-travel vehicle was destroyed by Thor. Finding Immortus&#x27; remains inside his fortress, Kang assumes the &quot;Lord of Time&quot; to be deceased and discovers the alternate versions of himself using viewing devices he finds, although he does not realize that Immortus is also a version of himself. At one point, he brings Ravonna to Limbo from the moment before her death, unintentionally creating an alternate reality where he was slain. Determined to be the only Kang, he joins with two particularly cunning divergents whom he determines he cannot easily eliminate, the three forming a council that systematically destroys the other alternate versions. He destroys one of the other two Kangs, then brings in the Avengers as part of a plot to destroy the other one, although the latter Kang eventually discovers the plot. This Kang is delayed by Ravonna, who tells him that if he truly loves her he must not kill the first Kang, but he ignores her, goes after him anyway, and is destroyed. Immortus then reveals he faked his death and manipulated everything from behind the scenes. Now only the one &quot;Prime&quot; Kang remains, who Immortus tricks into absorbing the memories of all the slain Kangs, which drives him insane. Immortus then sends the Avengers back to their own timeline.

This Kang diverges into two alternate Kangs, and one is invited to join the Crosstime Kang Corps (or the &quot;Council of Cross-Time Kangs&quot;), which consists of a wide range of Kangs from multiple timelines who are searching for a Celestial &quot;Ultimate Weapon&quot;. This Kang calls himself &quot;Fred&quot; (by his own admission a humorous nod to Fred Flintstone, with a prehistoric name being appropriate for a time-traveler) and has a brief encounter with the Avengers while trying to stop Nebula from interfering with a timeline. The Prime Kang, having recovered, then attempts to manipulate the Avengers from a time vortex, and encounters the Fantastic Four in a bid to capture Mantis and use her to defeat a Celestial and the other Kangs, while &quot;Fred&quot; is incinerated by a Nebula-possessed Human Torch during a later battle with the Fantastic Four in the timestream.

===New Empire, &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;, and &quot;Young Avengers&quot;===
Later, the Prime Kang appears, captures the Vision, and battles both the Avengers and a new foe, Terminatrix, who is revealed to be a revived Ravonna. Kang is critically injured when he intercepts a blow from Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjolnir that was meant for his old love, who is distraught over his sacrifice and teleports away with him. Terminatrix places Prime Kang in stasis to heal his injuries and assumes control of his empire. However, she finds the empire under attack by a chronal being called and is forced to summon the Avengers to assist. She revives Kang, who assists the Avengers in defeating Alioth, but not before allowing the entity to kill the entire Crosstime Kang Corps.

In &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;, flashbacks reveal that many of Kang&#x27;s recent actions were motivated by more of a desire to do something rather than a genuine desire for power, and that Rama-Tut is his past and future self; feeling listless and trapped by the burdens of the empire he has created, Kang at one point returned to life as Rama-Tut for a more simple life where he did not have a vast empire to administer. However, as Kang prepares to become Rama-Tut once again and from there Immortus, he glimpses the future and learns of Immortus&#x27;s servitude to the Time-Keepers of the Time Variance Authority, renewing his horror at the destiny that awaits him as that &#x27;simpering academic&#x27;. As a result, Kang rejects this future to the point of aiding the Avengers in protecting Rick Jones from Immortus&#x27;s latest scheme. When Immortus betrays the Time Keepers to try and save the Avengers, they kill him and attempt to turn Kang into Immortus before Rama-Tut became Immortus. However, the temporal backlash of Kang&#x27;s strength of will in a temporally unstable environment causes Immortus and Rama-Tut to split off from Kang, essentially making them both clear alternate versions of Kang rather than Immortus being Kang&#x27;s definitive future. With the weakened Time Keepers destroyed, Kang rejoices in his freedom from the destiny of Immortus and Rama-Tut, as he has now technically become them while still being himself.

After some months, Kang embarks on an ambitious scheme to conquer the Earth, this time aided by his son Marcus, who uses the &quot;Scarlet Centurion&quot; alias. Kang promises any who aid him on Earth a place in his new order, which puts Earth&#x27;s defenses and the Avengers under strain as they fight off villain after villain. He then takes control of Earth&#x27;s defense systems, and forces a surrender after destroying Washington, D.C., killing millions. The Avengers continue to battle the forces of Kang&#x27;s new empire, and Captain America eventually defeats him in personal combat. Although imprisoned, Kang is freed by his son, revealed to be only one of a series of clones, and kills clone Marcus for betraying him by assisting Warbird during the invasion and keeping it secret despite multiple opportunities to admit the truth; while Kang could tolerate the treachery if it allowed Marcus to become his own man, he cannot tolerate a traitor who remains active in his ranks. Depressed at his new loss, Kang retreats from Earth.

At some point, Kang travels back to his own past to prevent an incident where a confrontation with a bully left him in a coma for a year, but meeting his future self so horrifies Kang&#x27;s past self that he steals Kang&#x27;s armor and retreats to the past, using an emergency protocol created by the Vision to recruit a new team that come to be known as the &#x27;Young Avengers&#x27;. This team consists of teenagers with ties to the Avengers&#x27; history, such as Hulking- the Kree/Skrull hybrid son of Captain Mar-Vell and a Skrull princess- Wiccan and Speed- the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision reborn as teenagers- and Cassie Lang- daughter of the second Ant-Man-, with the young Kang adopting the alias of &#x27;Iron Lad&#x27; using technology stolen from his future self to imitate a variation of Iron Man&#x27;s armor. When Kang tracks his younger self to the past, the Young Avengers are able to kill him, but the subsequent changes to history force the young Kang to return to his time and erase his memory of these events, although the Young Avengers remain as a team with Iron Lad&#x27;s armor now self-operating with a consciousness based on an amalgamation of Iron Lad and the Vision.

Kang travels the multi-verse and recruits Stryfe, Earth-X Venom (Mayday Parker), Doom 2099, Iron Man 2020, Ahab, Magistrate Braddock, and Abomination Deathlok to save the multi-verse and possibly restore the universes that have already been erased. He appears to the remaining members of the Avengers Unity Squad after Earth has been destroyed by a Celestial leaving only the mutants. Temporal barriers prevent Kang simply travelling back himself, but he is able to help the surviving Unity Squad members project their minds back into their past selves so that they can defeat the Celestial that attacked Earth. Kang subsequently attempts to steal the Celestials&#x27; power for himself, requiring Sunfire and Havok to put themselves at risk by absorbing some of his energy themselves so that they can force him to expend his stolen power.

===&quot;Uncanny Inhumans&quot; and All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Before the Inhuman king Black Bolt destroys the city of Attilan to release Terrigen Mist throughout the world, he sends his son Ahura away for Kang to foster. Black Bolt later releases a small amount of Terrigen Mist to activate Ahura&#x27;s terrigenesis and activate his Inhuman ability. While Ahura is going through the change, Black Bolt asks Kang to save his son from the coming end of all things, which Kang agrees to on the condition that the son remain permanently in his care.

While taunting the Inhumans&#x27; efforts to find Ahura, another Kang emerges under the alias of &quot;Mister Gryphon&quot;, claiming that he has become splintered into various alternate versions of himself as a result of recent temporal disruptions. With this Kang confined to the present, he mounts a massive assault on the Avengers with the aid of Equinox and a reprogrammed Vision, intending to use Mjolnir&#x27;s time-traveling ability to return to his era, but is defeated.

When Vision abducts Kang&#x27;s infant self in an attempt to defeat him, the latter, split into increasingly divergent versions of himself by the fractured state of time, retaliates by attacking various Avengers in their infant states. A possible future version of Kang saves key Avengers from his past self&#x27;s attack by bringing them into Limbo until Hercules acquires an amulet from a former Fate that protects him from Kang&#x27;s assault. During a battle inside a temple in Vietnam, the Wasp goes to place baby Kang back where he belongs. Kang is subsequently defeated.

During the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, Kang the Conqueror gains knowledge of the calamity that would come if the Infinity Gems were to be gathered in the same location again. To prevent this from occurring, he abducts Adam Warlock, convinces him to help secure the Soul Gem in exchange for the Time Gem, and sends him back in time to receive counsel from Kang&#x27;s Rama-Tut counterpart.

===Fresh start and &quot;Kang the Conqueror&quot; solo series===
Kang the Conqueror has most recently been seen as a recurring character in the &quot;Pottersville&quot; arc of the &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; solo series, in which he is shown to be tethered to Doom in a quantum entanglement, appearing at random times throughout the series conversing with the Latverian despot. This is later revealed to be a ploy by Kang, as by aiding Doom in saving the world Kang is actually making the world easier for himself to conquer in two hundred years&#x27; time. In the solo series &quot;Kang the Conqueror&quot;, Kang rewrites history by manipulating a younger version of him to go through all of his previous identities – Iron Lad, Scarlet Centurion, Pharaoh Rama-Tut, and finally Kang – into becoming the purest form of would-be conqueror, resurrecting Ravonna by giving her the ability of reincarnation.

During the &quot;Venom War&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Kang the Conqueror created the Ruckus symbiote from a sample of Bedlam, a possible future version of Eddie Brock.

==Powers and abilities==
Kang has no superhuman abilities but is an extraordinary genius, an expert historical scholar, and a master physicist (specializing in time travel), engineer, and technician. He is armed with 40th-century technology, wearing highly advanced battle armor that enhances his strength, is capable of energy, hologram, and force-field projection, has a 30-day supply of air and food, and is capable of controlling other forms of technology. Courtesy of his &quot;time-ship&quot;, Kang has access to technology from any century, and he once claimed his ship alone could destroy the Moon.

As Rama-Tut, he used an &quot;ultra-diode&quot; ray gun that was able to sap the wills of human beings. At a high frequency, it is able to weaken superhuman beings and prevent use of their superpowers. They can be freed from its effects if the gun is fired at them a second time.

==Temporal selves==
There are different variations of Kang the Conqueror:

===Pharaoh Rama-Tut===
Pharaoh Rama-Tut was Kang&#x27;s original alias when he ruled ancient Egypt. Later in life, he retires as Kang, returns to the Rama-Tut identity, and helps the Avengers defeat his past self when he attempts to capture the &quot;Celestial Madonna&quot;. He nearly surrenders to destiny to become Immortus, but changes his mind and returns to the Kang identity when he discovers that Immortus is a pawn of beings called the Time-Keepers.

===Immortus===

Immortus is a future version of Kang who resides in Limbo. Kang was destined to become him until the last issue of the &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; series, in which powerful beings called the Time Keepers unintentionally separate the former from the latter.

===Iron Lad===

Iron Lad is an adolescent version of Kang who learned of his future self when Kang tried to prevent a childhood hospitalization. Attempting to escape his destiny, the teen Nate Richards steals his future self&#x27;s advanced armor and travels back to the past, forming the Young Avengers to help him stop Kang. When his attempt to reject his destiny results in Kang&#x27;s death, the resulting destruction caused by the changes in history forces Iron Lad to return to his time and undo the damage by becoming Kang.

===Victor Timely===

A divergent version of Kang establishes a small, quiet town called Timely, Wisconsin in 1901 to serve as a 20th-century base, where he occasionally resides as Mayor Victor Timely. Posing as his son Victor Timely Jr., he develops an interest in visiting college graduate Phineas Horton and provides him with knowledge that leads to him creating the original Human Torch.

===Doctor Doom===

When an alliance of the founding Avengers—Thor, Giant-Man, Wasp, Hulk, and Iron Man; Avengers from the past—Captain America, Black Knight, Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Namor; the present day Avengers—Hercules, Wasp, Captain America, Thor, Spider-Man, Vision; and the Future-Vision; had all traveled back through time to alter Kang&#x27;s past, and were attacking Kang&#x27;s Fortress, they were suddenly confronted by Kang&#x27;s future selves including the Scarlet Centurion and Immortus. The Avengers could spot Doctor Doom among them, who claimed that the Avengers had &quot;cornered&quot; them at a point where their powers were at their greatest, which implied that this Doctor Doom was actually a future Kang, too.

While these future incarnations of Kang erased the other Avengers from the timestream, Giant-Man was able to flee and gather the Chronal Energy Container, a device used by Kang&#x27;s alien miners to mine time by robbing life forms of their future. Giant-Man then used it to trap the Kangs, which allowed the other Avengers to return to existence. Afterward the Future-Vision used the Chronal Energy Container to send all Avengers back to their own times while erasing their memories save for his past self and the present day Avengers team. He then stayed to guard the imprisoned Kangs at the End of Time.

===Scarlet Centurion===
Numerous versions/relatives of Kang have assumed this alias, typically with a penchant for death games (setting teams of heroes against one another):
* Nathaniel Richards the Second, in a one-time identity he assumed after being the Pharaoh Rama-Tut but before going on to become Kang.
* Marcus Kang aka Marcus XXIII, the son of Kang the Conqueror who was active during &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;.
* A version of Kang who remained the Scarlet Centurion and conquered the alternate universe Earth-712.

===Victorex Prime===
Victorex Prime is a divergent version of the Scarlet Centurion who retained the identity and never became Kang, instead taking over the future of the Squadron Supreme&#x27;s universe of Earth-712, in the 40th century. On becoming bored with his success and dictatorship over a total of fifteen moons and planets, Victorex Prime elects to invade the past for further conquests, coming into conflict with the Squadron Supreme by sending &quot;temporal hard light holograms&quot; of his Scarlet Centurion form to the past to fight on his behalf, and bringing a number of the team to his time in order to compete in death games, serving as the champions of the Earth-616 Grandmaster against Victorex Prime&#x27;s own Institute of Evil. On losing, Victorex Prime inadvertently inspires the Grandmaster to issue similar challenges to other divergent versions of Kang.

While arranging for his fourth invasion into the past, sending a holographic envoy of his Scarlet Centurion form ahead of him as herald, Victorex Prime is left shaken when Hyperion, &quot;not in the mood&quot; for battle, while mourning a loss, informs him that while he has been allowed to live on his previous defeats, he will be executed if he attempts to invade the past when any members of the team are mourning as per the historical record, and that he would slowly kill Victorex Prime personally should he break these rules. Daunted, Victorex Prime flees to the future, resorting to subtle ways to mess with the Squadron by interfering with Tom Thumb&#x27;s attempts to develop a cure for cancer (and all other diseases, as well as ageing), before succumbing to depression, having conquered everything in the past, present, and future, after a temporal bubble emerges around the late 20th century and surrounding decades, preventing him from visiting the time.

Thirty-five years later, still unchallenged and unfulfilled, Victorex Prime&#x27;s followers discover a crack in the temporal bubble, displaying a massive humanoid hand emerging from space and growing large enough to engulf the Earth, the Sun, and all of space itself. Emboldened by this new challenge, and once again able to access the past, Victorex Prime sends a new temporal hologram backwards in time to confer with the Master Menace, the greatest criminal scientist of his age, simultaneously with Hyperion seeking out the scientist. Reached a reluctant truce, the Master Menace conceives of a device for Hyperion to use stop the entity&#x27;s spread over the next ten hours, while Victorex Prime transports Master Menace to his future, where he spends fifteen years perfecting his work before returning the completed device to Hyperion less than an hour after leaving. Holographically accompanying Master Menace and the Squadron Supreme as they journey into space to confront the entity, Victorex Prime realises he enjoys the excitement of being a superhero instead of a supervillain, and holographically accompanies Master Menace and the Squadron Supreme as they journeyed out into space to confront the entity.

However, on calculating the present is diverging from his own future, and seeking to preserve his former foes on the failure of Master Menace&#x27;s device, Victorex Prime retrieves the all-powerful telepath known as the Overmind, believing his power could turn back the entity. After Overmind instead has his head exploded, a terrified Victorex Prime dejectedly admits defeat, and prepares to flee to his future. At the last moment, Arcanna Jones begs Victorex Prime to save the life of her infant son, Benjamin Thomas Jones, which after a moment of consideration, Victorex Prime refuses. With the crack in the temporal bubble sealing shut after returning to the 40th century. Immediately regretting his decision, and unaware of the Squadron&#x27;s fates, Victorex Prime spends the remaining 211 years of his life in abject misery, unaware that the Squadron survived, because of his decision to leave Benjamin behind (who swapped fates with the entity and reversed its annihilation across multiple universes), and deeming the day he left the Squadron behind to die as &quot;the key moment&quot; that he &quot;lost his nerve&quot;, living on in the shame of retreat rather than facing the unknown alongside the worthiest of former foes, and eventually dying of old age, unfulfilled, without the knowledge he coveted most in the world.

===Chronomonitor #616===
Chronomonitor #616 is a variation of Kang the Conqueror who works for the Time Variance Authority (TVA), inducted into the organization on his first attempt to travel back in time. A renegade Chronomonitor from the organization, he is stripped of his power after interfering with history for personal gain as part of a mid-life crisis before escaping custody and killing and replacing a version of himself as Rama-Tut. Ultimately, Chronomonitor #616 is trapped in a time loop by the TVA, swearing revenge upon them and the Fantastic Four.

===Mister Gryphon===
Qeng Gryphon, or simply Mister Gryphon, is a variation of Kang the Conqueror that is confined to the present. He is the CEO of Qeng Enterprises.

===He Who Remains===
He Who Remains is an older variant of Kang the Conqueror and is the final director of the Time Variance Authority at the Citadel at the End of Time, the last reality of the Multiverse.

===Crosstime Kang Corps===
Numerous versions/successor of Kang form the members of this organization, also known as the Council of Cross-Time Kangs:

* Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Kang, who named himself after the cartoon character Fred Flintstone. He is later incinerated by a Nebula-possessed Human Torch.
* Kang Nebula, a variant of the space pirate of the same name, who succeeded Kang&#x27;s kingdom in her timeline.
* Kang Kong, a version of Kang from a dimension occupied by super-intelligent apes (later retroactively established as the &quot;Marvel Apes&quot; universe), named in reference to King Kong.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

Kang the Conqueror and his alternative variants appear in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portrayed by Jonathan Majors:

* He Who Remains appears in &quot;Loki&quot;. This version was an unnamed former &quot;conqueror&quot; and founder of the Time Variance Authority (TVA) based out of an asteroid at the end of time who sought to control the flow of the &quot;Sacred Timeline&quot; and prevent a new multiverse from forming due to a vast multiversal war having broken out in the previous one.
* Kang himself appears in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;. A multiversal traveler in the newly created multiverse who believed that the multiverse was dying due to his variants, he attempted to instigate a war to stop them, only to be captured by the Council of Kangs - led by Immortus, Rama-Tut, and Centurion - and exiled to Earth-616&#x27;s Quantum Realm.

<text>Gangjin County () is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea. Gangjin county proper was established in 1895. The county office is located in Gangjin-eup.

The Gangjin Kiln Sites are a noted area for the production of traditional Goryeo celadon, and annually a big festival and symposium on celadon porcelain at the Goryeo Celadon Museum with participants from all over the world takes place in Gangjin city.

Additionally, it is the birthplace of Korean poet Yeongrang Kim Yun-sik, famous for his work in the 1930s and 1940s in the Jeolla dialect.

The county bird is the magpie. The county flower is the camellia, and the county tree is the ginkgo. There are also two mascots, Gang and Jin, who represent fire and water, respectively, and who appear throughout the county on signs and sidewalks.

A small portion of Wolchulsan National Park is located in Gangjin County.

There is a monument to 17th-century Dutch explorer Hendrick Hamel, the first westerner to experience and write about Korea&#x27;s Joseon Dynasty era. Hamel and his men were shipwrecked on Jeju island, and they remained captives in Korea for 13 years.

<doc id="393443" wikidata="Q1323755" url="?curid=393443" title="Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport">
<text>Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport (commonly known as Winnipeg International Airport or Winnipeg Airport) is an international airport located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is the seventh busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic, serving 4,094,793 passengers in 2023, and the 11th busiest airport in Canada by aircraft movements. Winnipeg International Airport is a hub for Calm Air, Perimeter Airlines, and cargo airline Cargojet, also serving as a focus city for WestJet and an operating base for Flair Airlines. The airport is co-located with Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg, covering a total land area of .

An important transportation hub within the province of Manitoba, Winnipeg International Airport serves as the primary airport for a large geographical area that includes parts of neighbouring Northwestern Ontario and Nunavut. The airport is operated by Winnipeg Airports Authority as part of Transport Canada&#x27;s National Airports System and is one of eight Canadian airports that has U.S. border pre-clearance facilities.

Daily non-stop flights operate from Winnipeg International Airport to destinations across Canada as well as to the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The airport also serves numerous small remote communities in Northern Manitoba, Northwestern Ontario, and Nunavut through regularly scheduled flights.

==History==

The airport opened in 1928 as Stevenson Aerodrome in honour of the noted Manitoba aviator and pioneer bush pilot, Captain Fred J. Stevenson. Stevenson Aerodrome, also known as Stevenson Field, was Canada&#x27;s first international airport with Northwest Airways (which became Northwest Airlines) inaugurating a passenger and mail service between Winnipeg and Pembina, North Dakota on February 2, 1931.

By 1935, Northwest Airlines was operating daily service from the airport with Hamilton H-47 prop aircraft on a routing of Winnipeg – Pembina, ND – Grand Forks – Fargo – Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN – Milwaukee, WI – Chicago, IL.

The City of Winnipeg and the Rural Municipality of St. James agreed to develop Stevenson Field as a modern municipal airport in 1936. In 1938 the Manitoba Legislative Assembly passed the &quot;St. James–Winnipeg Airport Commission Act&quot; creating a commission of the same name with full control over the operation of the airport. In 1940, during the Second World War, the Government of Canada placed the airport under the direction of the Minister of Transport and the Royal Canadian Air Force where it remained until 1997.
Also in 1940, Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) was operating daily round trip transcontinental service across Canada via the airport with a routing of Montreal – Ottawa – North Bay – Kapuskasing – Wagaming – Winnipeg – Regina – Lethbridge – Vancouver flown with Lockheed Model 10 Electra twin prop aircraft with connecting service to and from Toronto being offered via North Bay.

===Post-war===
In 1962, Stevenson Field was officially renamed Winnipeg International Airport, followed in 1997 by the airport&#x27;s transfer to the control of the Winnipeg Airports Authority.

The original main terminal building was built in 1964, and was designed by the architectural firm of Green Blankstein Russell and Associates (subsequently GBR Associates and Stantec Limited). It was expanded and renovated in 1984 by the architectural firm of IKOY, and a hotel was built across from the terminal in 1998. The original main terminal building was closed on Sunday October 30, 2011 and has since been demolished.

Winnipeg Airport was briefly served by Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) during the mid-1950s on the world&#x27;s first regular polar route, which linked Copenhagen and Los Angeles with Douglas DC-6B propliner flights via Søndre Strømfjord, Greenland and Winnipeg.

Two passenger airlines operating jet aircraft were previously based at the Winnipeg International Airport: Transair (Canada) and Greyhound Air (both now-defunct). Transair and Greyhound Air operated scheduled flights across Manitoba, Ontario, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon from its Winnipeg hub in addition to operating charter services from the airport to Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico, Florida, and Hawaii among other destinations in the U.S.

Six airlines were serving the airport with scheduled passenger flights during the 1970s and 1980s. Air Canada, CP Air, the original Frontier Airlines, Midwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and locally based Transair operated scheduled flights from Winnipeg to destinations including London–Heathrow, Amsterdam, Glasgow, New York–JFK, San Francisco, Honolulu, Denver, Las Vegas, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, and Minneapolis/St. Paul.
In the early 2000s, CanJet and Jetsgo (both now-defunct) operated nonstop service from Winnipeg to Toronto Pearson International Airport.

On December 10, 2006, the Minister of Transport, Lawrence Cannon, announced Winnipeg International Airport was to be renamed Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport in honour of the influential businessman and pioneer of Canadian commercial aviation from Winnipeg. WestJet began seasonal flights to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport in May 2016.

==Facilities==

===Main terminal===

Winnipeg&#x27;s main airport terminal was designed by Argentine architect Cesar Pelli and Stantec. The terminal&#x27;s design was inspired by the City of Winnipeg&#x27;s distinctive landscape and the province of Manitoba&#x27;s vast prairies and sky. It was the first airport terminal in Canada to be LEED-certified for its environmentally friendly concept, design, construction and operation. The terminal was constructed in two phases, with construction beginning in 2007 and ending on October 30, 2011, when it was officially opened to the public. Prior to the opening of the current main terminal building, a multi-level access road and four-level, 1,559-stall parkade were both opened in November 2006. All airlines serving Winnipeg International Airport operate at the main terminal building, with the exception of Perimeter Aviation.

Air Canada operates a Maple Leaf Lounge located in the domestic/international departures area, and a &quot;pay-in&quot; lounge, operated by Plaza Premium Lounge, is also located in the domestic/international departures area. Free Wi-Fi is provided by the Winnipeg Airports Authority throughout the entire main terminal building.

The airport offers United States border preclearance facilities.

===Perimeter terminal===

Perimeter Aviation is a regional airline that operates its own small, exclusive terminal building at Winnipeg International Airport to facilitate its passenger, cargo and charter services. Perimeter Aviation does not use the main terminal building due to its varied operations to small remote communities throughout Northern Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario using small propeller aircraft, with which regular airport terminal services (jet bridge, catering, etc.) are unnecessary and can actually be a hindrance to day-to-day operations.

The Perimeter Aviation terminal building is located south of the main terminal building.

===Other facilities===
A large Canada Post mail processing facility was opened at the airport site on June 4, 2010. The facility is located east of the main terminal building, just north of Wellington Avenue. It is responsible for processing all mail and parcels for Manitoba, and some parts of Ontario and Northern Canada.

Three hotels are located on site, adjacent to the main airport terminal.

==== CentrePort Canada ====

Richardson International Airport is included in a new dry port created by provincial legislation—&quot;CentrePort Canada Act&quot;, C.C.S.M. c. C44—that will offer investment opportunities for distribution centres, warehousing and manufacturing. CentrePort Canada will allow companies to take advantage of the cargo capabilities of Richardson International Airport, as well as serviced land, a mid-continent location and highway and rail transport.

On April 14, 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper with Premier Gary Doer announced at James Richardson that both the Federal and Provincial governments will contribute towards a divided four-lane expressway called CentrePort Canada Way. It is now complete, and links Inkster Boulevard to the Perimeter Highway on the north side of the CP Rail Glenboro subdivision parallel to Saskatchewan Avenue to attract new transportation logistics associated development to the city area west and Rosser Municipality northwest of the airport.

Winnipeg International Airport is located at 2000 Wellington Avenue in the City of Winnipeg. Several short and long term parkades are located on site, as well as a curb-side valet parking service.

===Bus===

Winnipeg Transit operates two bus routes that service the airport. A charging port has been added in October 2014 for Winnipeg transit&#x27;s electric bus program. Greyhound Canada intercity buses used a station at the airport from 2009 to 2018, when service to Western Canada ended. The Brandon Air Shuttle provides shuttle transportation between Winnipeg International Airport and Manitoba&#x27;s second largest city, Brandon.

==Accidents and incidents at or near YWG==
*On February 6, 1941, a Trans-Canada Air Lines Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra diverted and crashed into trees on approach to Winnipeg a mile short of the airport after developing engine trouble. All three crew and nine passengers were killed.

*On October 6, 2005, a Morningstar Air Express Cessna 208 Caravan crashed 6.6km (4.1mls) SE of YWG because of in-flight icing conditions and an overweight aircraft. The sole occupant, the pilot, was killed.

<text>Skint Records is a Brighton and Hove based dance music record label owned by JC Reid, Tim Jeffery and Damian Harris. It was created as a sublabel of Loaded Records, also founded by Reid and Jeffery. Along with Wall of Sound, the label was a leader in the big beat music scene of the mid to late 1990s.

The label&#x27;s roster at this time included big beat scene leaders Fatboy Slim, Hardknox, Indian Ropeman, Freq Nasty and X-Press 2. Towards the end of the 1990s and at the start of the 21st century the label expanded its range of releases to include more house based songs. The most prominent example was &quot;Lazy&quot; by X-Press 2, which charted at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. There were also releases by electronic music artist Dave Clarke as well as artists as diverse as Lucky Jim, Freq Nasty, FC Kahuna, Bentley Rhythm Ace, REQ and Ralfe Band. One mainstay band of the label has been the Lo-Fidelity Allstars who have changed and diversified their style along with the label.

Skint were the main kit sponsor for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. for nine years until the relationship ended in 2008, one of the longest football league sponsorship deals. The Skint name does not appear consistently across all the Brighton and Hove shirts, with some variation in logo and even the complete replacement of the company&#x27;s name with Palookaville on one of the shirt designs.

Skint also have a sub-label for more underground releases called &quot;Under 5&#x27;s&quot;, which originally ran from 1997–2001, but was re-launched as a digital only label in 2009 to host new artists such as Linton Brown, Kinzy and Rory Hoy.

In 2002, Skint released a compilation album, &quot;We Are Skint&quot;, featuring tracks from the label&#x27;s artists. From 1996-1998, Skint released a series of albums, &quot;Brassic Beats&quot;, also containing songs from the label, but all of the songs were new, therefore not being a compilation album series.

Skint Records had one UK number one album, Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot; (1998), and also brought about short-lived &quot;intelligent big beat&quot; pioneered by albums such as REQ&#x27;s &quot;One&quot; and Lo-Fidelity Allstars&#x27; &quot;How to Operate with a Blown Mind&quot;.

In April 2014, BMG Rights Management acquired Skint Records. Before the BMG acquisition, Skint Records was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment internationally.

Fatboy Slim&#x27;s catalogue is owned by Skint and BMG internationally, except in USA and Canada, where it is owned by Universal Music Group under the Astralwerks label.

<text>Goheung County () is a county in Jeollanam-do Province, South Korea.

==Naro Space Center==
The Naro Space Center was completed during 2008 in southern Goheung and is operated by the state-run Korea Aerospace Research Institute. The space center includes a launch pad, a control tower, rocket assembly and test facilities, facilities for satellite control testing and assembly, a media center, an electric power station, a space experience hall (visitor center) and a landing field.

==Modern history==

On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1963, some of the townships were classed from Bongrae-myeon to other myeons such as Dohwa-myeon, Podu-myeon and so on.
In 1973 and 1979, two of the townships were promoted to eups (towns)

==Symbols==
* City Tree : Citron tree
* County flower : Camellia blossom
* County bird : Dove

==Location==
Goheung is located in one of the southernmost areas of the Korean peninsula. It is surrounded by ocean on three sides with 19 inhabited islands and 152 uninhabited islands. The depth is not that low and its land spreads along the coast so many shellfish and seaweed industries have developed.

<doc id="393452" wikidata="Q4295899" url="?curid=393452" title="1975 World Series">
<text>The 1975 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1975 season. The 72nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds. The Reds won the series, four games to three. In 2003, ESPN ranked it the second-greatest World Series ever played, trailing only the series, while in 2020, Sam Miller of ESPN named it the best World Series ever.

The Reds, at the height of their Big Red Machine dynasty, recorded a franchise-high 108 victories in 1975 and won the NL West division by 20 games over the Los Angeles Dodgers, then defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, three games to none, in the NL Championship Series. The Red Sox won the AL East division by games over the Baltimore Orioles, then defeated the three-time defending World Series champion Oakland Athletics, three games to none, in the AL Championship Series. The sixth game of the World Series was a 12-inning classic at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park, which culminated with a walk-off home run by Carlton Fisk to extend the series to seven games. The Reds rallied from a 3–0 deficit to win the seventh and deciding game of the series on a ninth-inning single by Joe Morgan.

It was Cincinnati&#x27;s third World Series appearance in six years, losing in 1970 to Baltimore and in 1972 to Oakland. It was the first of back-to-back championships for the Reds. For the Red Sox, the 1975 World Series was their first World Series appearance since losing to St. Louis in seven games in 1967. It would be 11 more years until Boston returned to the World Series in 1986, in which they suffered another seven-game loss to the New York Mets.

This was the fourth time in five years that a seven-game World Series winner (following Pittsburgh in 1971, and Oakland in 1972 and 1973) was outscored.

Reds third baseman Pete Rose was named World Series MVP. Rose batted .370 with 10 hits and two RBIs and scored 3 runs.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 18 due to rain

==Matchups==
===Game 1===

Ace pitchers Luis Tiant and Don Gullett were locked in a scoreless duel until the seventh inning. Tiant led off with a single and later scored Boston&#x27;s first run on a single by Carl Yastrzemski. Then the floodgates opened: Reds reliever Clay Carroll walked Carlton Fisk to force in a run, Rico Petrocelli slapped a two-run single, Rick Burleson had an RBI single, and Cecil Cooper ended the scoring with a sacrifice fly. Tiant finished with a five-hitter against a team that had scored an MLB high 840 runs during the regular season.

===Game 2===


Game 2 proved to be a very pivotal game as the Reds were on the brink of being down two games before rallying for victory in the ninth inning. Red Sox starter Bill Lee held the Reds to four hits and a run through eight innings. Johnny Bench led off the ninth with a double to right field. Lee was then replaced by right-handed closer Dick Drago. Bench moved to third on a groundout by Tony Pérez. After George Foster popped out for the second out, Dave Concepción hit a clutch single up the middle that Boston second baseman Denny Doyle fielded behind second base, but had no play at first as Bench scored to tie the game. After Concepcion stole second base, Ken Griffey hit a double into left-center field scoring Concepcion with the game-winner. Rawly Eastwick retired the Sox in the ninth to get the win and even the series.

The Reds&#x27; only other run scored in the fourth when Joe Morgan walked, went to third on a Bench single, and scored on a Pérez force out.

The Red Sox sandwiched the Reds&#x27; run with single tallies of their own in the first inning on an RBI single by Carlton Fisk, and in the sixth on an RBI single by Rico Petrocelli.

===Game 3===

At home, the Reds prevailed in another squeaker in a game that featured the first major controversy of the series that involved the umpires.

For nine innings, the game was a homer-fest as each team put three over the wall. Fisk put the Sox on the board in the second with a homer off Reds starter Gary Nolan. The Reds countered by taking a 2–1 lead in the fourth when Tony Pérez walked and Johnny Bench hit a two-run shot off Sox starter Rick Wise. The Reds then chased Wise in the fifth when Dave Concepción and César Gerónimo hit back-to-back home runs. Pete Rose followed with a one-out triple and scored on Joe Morgan&#x27;s sacrifice fly to give the Reds a 5–1 lead. The Sox scratched back in the sixth when Reds reliever Pat Darcy issued consecutive walks to Carl Yastrzemski and Fisk, wild-pitched Yastrzemski to third, and then gave up a sacrifice fly to Fred Lynn. In the seventh, former Cincinnati Red Bernie Carbo closed the gap to 5–3 with a pinch-hit homer off Clay Carroll. In the top of the ninth, with Reds closer Eastwick on the mound, Rico Petrocelli singled and Evans hit the game-tying home run, sending the game into extra innings.

After the Red Sox failed to score in the tenth, the Reds sent the bottom of the order to lead off the bottom of the tenth. Cesar Geronimo led off with a single off Jim Willoughby. Reds manager Sparky Anderson then sent pinch-hitter Ed Armbrister up to sacrifice in place of reliever Rawly Eastwick. Armbrister&#x27;s bunt bounced high near the plate toward the first-base line. Boston catcher Carlton Fisk was quick to pounce on the ball in front of the plate as Armbrister was slow to get out of the box. He hesitated before running and appeared to collide with (or at least impede) Fisk as he was retrieving the ball. Fisk&#x27;s hurried throw to second base to force out Geronimo sailed over shortstop Rick Burleson into center field as Geronimo went to third base and Armbrister to second. Fisk and Boston manager Darrell Johnson argued that Armbrister should have been ruled out for interference, but home plate umpire Larry Barnett ruled otherwise. The play stood and the Reds had the potential winning run on third with no outs. Willoughby then intentionally walked Pete Rose to load the bases and set up a force play at any base. Johnson then brought in left-hander Roger Moret, to face Ken Griffey, but Anderson countered with right-handed hitting Merv Rettenmund. Rettenmund struck out for out No. 1, but Joe Morgan knocked in Geronimo with the game-winner by hitting a deep fly to center over a drawn in outfield.

===Game 4===

With the Reds leading the series 2–1, Luis Tiant pitched his second complete game win of the Series. More importantly, this win forced the Reds to win at least one of two games at Fenway Park to win the Series.

The Reds struck first off Tiant in the first on RBI doubles by Ken Griffey and Johnny Bench. The Sox, however, would get all the runs they needed in the fourth. Dwight Evans tied the game with a two-run triple, then Rick Burleson put the Sox ahead by doubling in Evans off Reds starter Fred Norman. Tiant, continuing his surprising hitting, singled Burleson to third. Burleson then scored on a Tony Pérez error on a ball hit by Juan Beníquez, while Tiant went to second. Carl Yastrzemski drove in Tiant with a single for what would turn out to be the winning run.

The Reds were able to counter with two runs in their half of the fourth on an RBI double by Dave Concepción and an RBI triple by César Gerónimo. The Reds had a shot at winning the game in the bottom of the ninth when, with two on and one out, Ken Griffey sent a deep drive into left-center that Fred Lynn made an over the shoulder catch. Joe Morgan then popped out to first on Tiant&#x27;s 163rd pitch of the game. Boston&#x27;s win tied the series at two games apiece and guaranteed a return to Fenway.

===Game 5===

Reds&#x27; lefty Don Gullett pitched like an ace as the Reds won their final home game in Game 5 to put Cincinnati on the brink of their first World Series championship in 35 years. Cincinnati first baseman and cleanup hitter Tony Pérez broke out of an 0–for–15 World Series slump with a pair of home runs while driving in four runs off Boston starter Reggie Cleveland. Pete Rose contributed an RBI double and Dave Concepción hit a sacrifice fly for the other Reds runs, while Gullett pitched innings, limiting the powerful Boston lineup to five hits. Reds closer Rawly Eastwick came on to strike out Boston third baseman Rico Petrocelli for the game&#x27;s final out.

===Game 6===
With a travel day followed by three days of heavy rain in Boston, both pitching staffs got four days of rest. Red Sox manager Darrell Johnson was afforded the luxury of having his top two starting pitchers, Luis Tiant and Bill Lee, available for Games 6 and 7, respectively, while the Reds were able to have their ace, Don Gullett, available for a potential Game 7 after pitching a gem in Game 5.

With the Red Sox in a must win situation, Boston&#x27;s Fred Lynn opened the scoring in the first with a two-out, three-run homer off Reds starter Gary Nolan. Meanwhile, Tiant breezed through the first four innings, holding the Reds scoreless. The Reds finally broke through in the fifth. With Ed Armbrister on third and Pete Rose on first, Ken Griffey tripled to deep center field on a ball that Lynn just missed making a leaping catch against the wall. He suffered a rib injury, but remained in the game; Lynn told moderator Bob Costas during MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 games in the last 50 years&quot; that, for a short time, he was barely conscious and couldn&#x27;t feel his legs. Johnny Bench singled Griffey home to tie the game at 3–3.

With two outs in the seventh, George Foster put the Reds ahead with a two-run double high off the center field wall. In the top of the eighth, César Gerónimo led off and hit the first pitch down the right-field line for a home run to chase Tiant and give the Reds a 6–3 lead.

In the bottom of the eighth, Reds reliever Pedro Borbón gave up an infield single off his leg to Lynn, and then walked Rico Petrocelli to bring the tying run to the plate. Rawly Eastwick replaced Borbón, struck out Dwight Evans, and retired Rick Burleson on a line-out to left. Bernie Carbo was called on to bat for reliever Roger Moret. Sparky Anderson was on the top step of the dugout, ready to call in left-hander Will McEnaney to pitch to the left-hand hitting Carbo. Anderson said later that he was concerned that the Sox would call on right-handed Juan Beníquez to pinch hit for Carbo if he made the move. Carbo looked overmatched by Eastwick, missing on a swing for a 2–2 count; he fouled off two more pitches late, the latter just barely fought off to avoid a strikeout. On the next pitch, Carbo tied the game with a three-run home run to center field. It was his second pinch-hit homer in the series, tying the record set by Chuck Essegian in .

As Carbo approached third base on his home run trot, Carbo yelled out to former teammate Rose, &quot;Hey, Pete, don&#x27;t you wish you were that strong?&quot; To which Rose replied, &quot;This is fun.&quot;

In the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox appeared poised to win. Denny Doyle walked on four pitches and went to third on a Carl Yastrzemski single; McEnaney, the Reds&#x27; seventh pitcher, replaced Eastwick and intentionally walked Carlton Fisk, loading the bases with no outs to face the left-handed hitting Lynn. He flied out to Foster in foul territory in left; Doyle tagged up and attempted to score but was thrown out as Bench caught the ball on a bounce and made a sweeping tag from fair territory to nip him just before his hand touched the plate. With runners at first and third, McEnaney retired Petrocelli with a ground ball to end the jam.

Rose led off the top of the 11th and was awarded first base after a pitch lightly grazed him. Griffey bunted, but Fisk&#x27;s throw forced out Rose at second base. Joe Morgan hit a deep drive to right off Dick Drago that looked to be for extra bases. Evans made a leaping catch near the visitors bullpen in deep right to rob Morgan and doubled-up Griffey at first.

In the top of the 12th, Boston&#x27;s Rick Wise caught Gerónimo looking with two men on to end the threat. In the bottom of the inning, Pat Darcy, the Reds&#x27; eighth pitcher, remained in the game after retiring the previous six batters in order. As the game passed four hours, Fisk led off; with a 1–0 count, he lifted a sinker down the left-field line and the ball struck the foul pole well above the Green Monster. In what has now become an iconic baseball film highlight, NBC&#x27;s left-field game camera (in the scoreboard) caught Fisk wildly waving his arms to his right after hitting the ball and watching its path while drifting down the first base line, as if he was trying to coax the ball to &quot;stay fair.&quot; The ball indeed stayed fair and Fisk triumphantly leaped into the air as the Red Sox tied the Series. (The cameraman in the scoreboard was supposed to follow the flight of the ball but was distracted by a nearby rat and ended up capturing Fisk instead.) This would be the last time in World Series play that a catcher hit a home run in extra innings until J. T. Realmuto did so in the 2022 World Series, 47 years later. To date, this is the last World Series game the Reds have lost.

This game ranked No. 7 in ESPN &quot;SportsCentury&quot; Greatest Games of the 20th Century in 1999.

===Game 7===

The game was scoreless until the third inning when Reds starter Don Gullett experienced control problems. After giving up an RBI single to Carl Yastrzemski, Gullett walked Carlton Fisk to load the bases. He then walked Rico Petrocelli and Dwight Evans to force in two more runs before striking out Rick Burleson for the final out. Gullett pitched a scoreless fourth before being relieved by Jack Billingham. The Reds bullpen pitched five scoreless innings to give the offense a chance to rally.

Boston starter Bill Lee was again sharp, as he shut out the Reds through five innings. In the sixth, with Pete Rose on first base and one out, Johnny Bench hit a routine grounder that appeared would be an inning-ending double play. Shortstop Burleson fielded the grounder and under-handed the ball to Denny Doyle covering second base to force Rose out at second. But as Doyle pivoted to make a throw to first base, Rose slid high and hard into Doyle to force an errant throw that sailed into the Boston dugout preventing the double play as Bench moved onto second base. On a 1–0 count, Lee threw a blooper pitch to Tony Pérez who slammed the ball over the Green Monster and onto Lansdowne Street for a two-run home run, his third home run in the final three Series games, to draw the Reds to within 3–2.

The Reds tied it in the seventh when Ken Griffey walked, stole second, and scored on a two-out single to centerfield by Rose.

In the ninth, Griffey led off with a walk, was sacrificed to second by César Gerónimo, and went to third on a groundout by Dan Driessen. Boston left-handed reliever Jim Burton then walked Rose to set up a forceout, but Joe Morgan reached down and blooped a low breaking ball into center field to score Griffey with the go-ahead run. It was the second time in the series Rose was intentionally walked prior to Morgan driving in the game-winning run. Morgan, the 1975 National League MVP, also knocked in the game-winner in Game 3.

Will McEnaney retired the Sox in order, with Yastrzemski flying out to center fielder Geronimo to end the game, clinching a World Series championship that had eluded the Reds for 35 years, and extending the Curse of the Bambino to 57 years. It would not be broken until 2004, after the Red Sox went 86 years without a championship.

==Composite line score==
1975 World Series (4–3): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) beat Boston Red Sox (A.L.).

==Broadcasting==
NBC aired the series on television and radio. Curt Gowdy and Joe Garagiola alternated the play-by-play between the two mediums along with local team announcers Dick Stockton and Ned Martin (Red Sox) and Marty Brennaman (Reds), while Tony Kubek provided color commentary on the telecasts.

This was the final World Series play-by-play assignment for Gowdy, who had been NBC&#x27;s lead baseball announcer since 1966. Garagiola took over full-time as the network&#x27;s primary play-by-play voice for baseball the following season. It was the only World Series broadcast for Stockton (who later became a prominent national sportscaster for CBS, Fox, and TNT) and for Martin.

This was also the final Series broadcast for NBC Radio, which had retained exclusive rights to the event since 1957. CBS Radio would become the exclusive national radio network for MLB beginning the following season.

This is the earliest World Series telecast for which all games survive today in their entirety. While portions of many previous Series telecasts also survive, the general practice of the networks in earlier years was to reuse old tapes to save money and space. All subsequent World Series telecasts since this one also have had all their games preserved.

<text>Gokseong County () is a county in Jeollanam-do, South Korea and the least densely populated subdivision of the province.

==Attractions==
* Taeansa Temple
* Neungpa Tower
* Seomjin River
* Dongli mountain valley
* Gok-song Haneulnari Village (a farming-themed village)
* Gokseong Train Village (site of historical steam engine train where folks can take a ride on an old fashioned train)

==Transportation==
===Train===
The Jeolla Line comes through Gokseong station, with KTX, ITX-Saemaeul, Saemaeul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho train services. The Saemaeul-ho and Mugunghwa-ho trains all stop on the way to Gokseong.

<doc id="393458" wikidata="Q839820" url="?curid=393458" title="Stilt sandpiper">
<text>The stilt sandpiper (Calidris himantopus) is a small shorebird. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot; is a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;himantopus&quot; means &quot;strap foot&quot; or &quot;thong foot&quot;, and also refers to the stilt.

==Taxonomy==
This sandpiper bears some resemblance to the smaller calidrid sandpipers or &quot;stints&quot;. DNA sequence information is incapable of determining whether it should be placed in &quot;Calidris&quot; or in the monotypic genus &quot;Micropalama&quot;. It appears most closely allied with the curlew sandpiper, which is another aberrant species only tentatively placed in &quot;Calidris&quot; and could conceivably be separated with it in &quot;Erolia&quot;.

==Range &amp; habitat==
The stilt sandpiper breeds in the open arctic tundra of North America. It is a long-distance migrant, wintering mainly in northern South America. It occurs as a rare vagrant in western Europe, Japan and northern Australia.

==Breeding==
This species nests on the ground, laying three or four eggs. The male has a display flight. Outside the breeding season, this bird is normally found on inland waters, rather than open coasts.
==Description==
This species resembles the curlew sandpiper in its curved bill, long neck, pale supercilium and white rump. It is readily distinguished from that species by its much longer and paler legs, which give rise to its common and scientific names. It also lacks an obvious wing bar in flight. Breeding adults are distinctive, heavily barred beneath, and with reddish patches above and below the supercilium. The back is brown with darker feather centres. Winter plumage is basically gray above and white below.
Juvenile stilt sandpipers resemble the adults in their strong head pattern and brownish back, but they are not barred below, and show white fringes on the back feathering.

Measurements:

* Length: 7.9-9.1 in (20–23 cm)
* Weight: 1.8-2.5 oz (50-70 g)
* Wingspan: 38–41 cm

==Diet==
These birds forage on muddy, picking up food by sight, often jabbing like the dowitchers with which they often associate. They mainly eat insects, other invertebrates (such as molluscs), seeds, and the leaves and roots of aquatic plants.

<doc id="393459" wikidata="Q1777502" url="?curid=393459" title="Shi Nai'an">
<text>Shi Nai&#x27;an (, –1372) was a Chinese writer from the Yuan and early Ming periods. &quot;Shuihu zhuan&quot; (&quot;Water Margin&quot;), one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, is traditionally attributed to him. There are few reliable sources for his biography, much less his literary activity.

==Biography==
Little is known about Shi. Traditionally, it was believed that he was a teacher of Luo Guanzhong, the editor or author of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, another of the Four Great Classical Novels. The recent Chinese scholar Ge Liangyan writes that little is known about Luo, and about Shi even less. Late Ming and early Qing scholars claimed that Shi lived near the end of the Yuan dynasty and that he was a native of Hangzhou, but they may have been echoing each other or citing the conjectures that they did not endorse. The early 20th century scholar Lu Xun thought that the name &quot;Shi Nai&#x27;an&quot; might have been invented by composers of a later edition of the novel.

Shortly after World War II, a memorial tablet bearing Shi&#x27;s name was found in Xinghua county, Jiangsu, and in the early 1950s a team of researches was sent to investigate. The chief investigator declared &quot;Not even the faintest vestige of Shi Nai&#x27;an was found to be there.&quot; Evidence in a family genealogy seemed to affirm his identity, but it is not clear that the genealogy was authentic. Ge Liangyan concludes that the debate over the existence of Shi will &quot;never lead to a conclusive end.&quot; He adds that in any case, we will not be able to determine whether either Luo or Shi, if they existed, were involved with the compilation of &quot;Shuihu zhuan&quot;.

The Shi Nai&#x27;an Literary Prize is named in his honour.

<doc id="393460" wikidata="Q661075" url="?curid=393460" title="Metaprogramming">
<text>Metaprogramming is a computer programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyse, or transform other programs, and even modify itself, while running. In some cases, this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution, in turn reducing development time. It also allows programs more flexibility to efficiently handle new situations with no recompiling.

Metaprogramming can be used to move computations from runtime to compile time, to generate code using compile time computations, and to enable self-modifying code. The ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage allows reflective programming, and is termed &quot;reflection&quot;. Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.

Metaprogramming was popular in the 1970s and 1980s using list processing languages such as Lisp. Lisp machine hardware gained some notice in the 1980s, and enabled applications that could process code. They were often used for artificial intelligence applications.

== Approaches ==
Metaprogramming enables developers to write programs and develop code that falls under the generic programming paradigm. Having the programming language itself as a first-class data type (as in Lisp, Prolog, SNOBOL, or Rebol) is also very useful; this is known as &quot;homoiconicity&quot;. Generic programming invokes a metaprogramming facility within a language by allowing one to write code without the concern of specifying data types since they can be supplied as parameters when used.

Metaprogramming usually works in one of three ways.
# The first approach is to expose the internals of the runtime system (engine) to the programming code through application programming interfaces (APIs) like that for the .NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) emitter.
# The second approach is dynamic execution of expressions that contain programming commands, often composed from strings, but can also be from other methods using arguments or context, like JavaScript. Thus, &quot;programs can write programs.&quot; Although both approaches can be used in the same language, most languages tend to lean toward one or the other.
# The third approach is to step outside the language entirely. General purpose program transformation systems such as compilers, which accept language descriptions and carry out arbitrary transformations on those languages, are direct implementations of general metaprogramming. This allows metaprogramming to be applied to virtually any target language without regard to whether that target language has any metaprogramming abilities of its own. One can see this at work with Scheme and how it allows tackling some limits faced in C by using constructs that are part of the Scheme language to extend C.

Lisp is probably the quintessential language with metaprogramming facilities, both because of its historical precedence and because of the simplicity and power of its metaprogramming. In Lisp metaprogramming, the unquote operator (typically a comma) introduces code that is evaluated at program definition time rather than at run time. The metaprogramming language is thus identical to the host programming language, and existing Lisp routines can be directly reused for metaprogramming if desired. This approach has been implemented in other languages by incorporating an interpreter in the program, which works directly with the program&#x27;s data. There are implementations of this kind for some common high-level languages, such as RemObjects’ Pascal Script for Object Pascal.

== Usages ==

=== Code generation ===
A simple example of a metaprogram is this POSIX Shell script, which is an example of generative programming:
#!/bin/sh
# metaprogram
echo &#x27;#!/bin/sh&#x27; &gt; program
for i in $(seq 992)
do
 echo &quot;echo $i&quot; » program
done
chmod +x program
This script (or program) generates a new 993-line program that prints out the numbers 1–992. This is only an illustration of how to use code to write more code; it is not the most efficient way to print out a list of numbers. Nonetheless, a programmer can write and execute this metaprogram in less than a minute, and will have generated over 1000 lines of code in that amount of time.

A quine is a special kind of metaprogram that produces its own source code as its output. Quines are generally of recreational or theoretical interest only.

Not all metaprogramming involves generative programming. If programs are modifiable at runtime, or if incremental compiling is available (such as in C#, Forth, Frink, Groovy, JavaScript, Lisp, Elixir, Lua, Nim, Perl, PHP, Python, Rebol, Ruby, Rust, R, SAS, Smalltalk, and Tcl), then techniques can be used to perform metaprogramming without generating source code.

One style of generative approach is to employ domain-specific languages (DSLs). A fairly common example of using DSLs involves generative metaprogramming: lex and yacc, two tools used to generate lexical analysers and parsers, let the user describe the language using regular expressions and context-free grammars, and embed the complex algorithms required to efficiently parse the language.

=== Code instrumentation ===

One usage of metaprogramming is to instrument programs in order to do dynamic program analysis.

== Challenges ==
Some argue that there is a sharp learning curve to make complete use of metaprogramming features. Since metaprogramming gives more flexibility and configurability at runtime, misuse or incorrect use of metaprogramming can result in unwarranted and unexpected errors that can be extremely difficult to debug to an average developer. It can introduce risks in the system and make it more vulnerable if not used with care. Some of the common problems, which can occur due to wrong use of metaprogramming are inability of the compiler to identify missing configuration parameters, invalid or incorrect data can result in unknown exception or different results. Due to this, some believe that only high-skilled developers should work on developing features which exercise metaprogramming in a language or platform and average developers must learn how to use these features as part of convention.

== Uses in programming languages ==
=== Macro systems ===

* Lisp, most dialects
** Clojure
** Common Lisp
** Racket
** Scheme hygienic macros
* MacroML
* Template Haskell
* Scala
* Nim
* Rust
* Haxe
* Julia
* Elixir

=== Macro assemblers ===

The IBM/360 and derivatives had powerful macro assembler facilities that were often used to generate complete assembly language programs or sections of programs (for different operating systems for instance). Macros provided with CICS transaction processing system had assembler macros that generated COBOL statements as a pre-processing step.

Other assemblers, such as MASM, also support macros.

=== Metaclasses ===

Metaclasses are provided by the following programming languages:
* Common Lisp
* Python
* NIL
* Groovy
* Ruby
* Smalltalk
* Lua

=== Template metaprogramming ===

* C &quot;X Macros&quot;
* C++ Templates
* D
* Common Lisp, Scheme and most Lisp dialects by using the quasiquote (&quot;backquote&quot;) operator.
* Nim

=== Staged metaprogramming ===

* MetaML
* MetaOCaml
* Scala natively or using the Lightweight Modular Staging Framework
* Terra

=== Dependent types ===

Use of dependent types allows proving that generated code is never invalid. However, this approach is leading-edge and rarely found outside of research programming languages.

<text>The Ford Festiva is a four passenger, three-door, front-drive subcompact car manufactured in South Korea by Kia, under license from Mazda and marketed by Ford for model years 1986-2002 over three generations in Japan, the Americas, and Australia as the Festiva and as the Aspire in North America during its second generation. 

Designed by Mazda using the DA platform and B series straight-four engines, the Festiva was manufactured in South Korea by Kia, under license.

Kia began marketing the first generation in South Korea under license — as the Kia Pride. Australasia and Europe received the first version between 1987 and 1991 as the &quot;Mazda 121&quot;. After 1991, Australasian sales began under the &quot;Ford Festiva&quot; name, while European sales continued as the &quot;Kia Pride&quot;. Kia ended production of the Pride in 2000. 

Ongoing production of the first generation overlapped its second generation, introduced in 1993 and marketed as the Ford Aspire in North America and as the Kia Avella in South Korea and other markets. The second generation was marketed for model years 1993-2000, and a third generation was sold between 1996 and 2002 in Japan as a badge-engineered version of the Mazda Demio.

The &quot;Festiva&quot; namelplate derived from the Spanish word for &quot;&quot;. 


== First generation (WA; 1986) ==
The first generation Ford Festiva was designed by Mazda in Japan at the request of parent company Ford. The Mazda-designed and built three-door hatchback was launched in Japan in February 1986 under the name &quot;Ford Festiva&quot;, with the 1.1 and 1.3-liter engines. 

The Festiva used a front-wheel drive layout with rack and pinion steering, independent front suspension with struts, coil springs and sway bar, and a torsion beam rear suspension. The Festiva was facelifted in 1989, receiving a redesigned grille insert and tail lamp lenses. In Japan at launch, the Festiva three-door was offered in L, L Special, S, Ghia, and Canvas Top specification levels. Ford retailed the Japanese market Festiva via the &quot;Autorama&quot; dealership network. At the 1986 Tokyo Motor Show, the sporty GT and GT-X models were shown, with a unique twin-cam 1.3-liter engine (BJ). It has a special body kit and a prominent bonnet bulge, and went on sale on 1 December 1986. By then, the Festiva Cargo L (commercial version) had also been added to the lineup, in either a two- or a five-seat version.

Beginning in 1989, Autorama also began selling left-hand drive, Korean-assembled five-door hatchbacks (and later the four-door sedan as well). The Hatchback was sold as the Ford Festiva 5, while the four-door sedan was called the Festiva β. Neither version sold particularly well in Japan. 973 cars were brought in during 1989, with the aim of selling 2,000 the following year. Production of the Japanese market Ford Festiva ended in December 1992, with sales from stock continuing for another month.

===Markets===
====North America====
In mid-1986, another Ford partner, Kia Motors in South Korea began production of the Festiva under license as the &quot;Kia Pride&quot;. Starting from late 1987 for the 1988 model year, Kia began exports to the United States under the &quot;Ford Festiva&quot; name. Canadian sales began in January 1989, marketed at Ford and Mercury dealerships. Ford offered a single 1.3-liter &quot;B3&quot; four-cylinder engine and three trim levels: L, L Plus, and LX. The two base models featured a four-speed manual overdrive transmission, with the LX upgraded to a five-speed unit. A tachometer and tilt steering wheel also featured on the LX trim, as did alloy wheels, remote mirrors, cloth interior seating, and an AM/FM cassette radio.

Ford released a minor facelift in North America for the 1990 model year, shifting from carburetor to fuel injection with five-speed manual or optional three-speed automatic transmissions. Ford also replaced the manual front seat belts with motorized versions (Canadian market models kept the manual front seat belts), and fitted manual rear seat belts as standard. For the 1991 model year, the L Plus and LX models were combined into a single GL trim. Optional power steering was deleted for 1992, and the GL gained alloy wheels and an available sport package. The final 1993 model year brought no changes. 

Over its life, Ford marketed roughly 350,000 Kia-manufactured Festiva models in the United States. The agreement with Ford materialized in accordance with Kia&#x27;s strategy implemented in the mid-1980s to progressively fill the void at the low-cost end of the market slowly being abdicated by the Japanese brands pursuing more expensive models with higher profit margins. Compared to rival automakers in Japan, and also Europe and North America, Kia&#x27;s main competitive advantage was its lower-paid South Korean workforce—which translated into lower-priced cars.

The 2008 edition of Monash University&#x27;s &quot;Used Car Safety Ratings&quot; (UCSR), found that the first generation Festiva provides a &quot;worse than average&quot; (two out of five stars) level of safety in the event of an accident, in a comparison to other &quot;light cars&quot;. The safety rating was not calculated solely on the basis of the protection of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants, with protection for &quot;cyclists, pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles&quot; included to give a &quot;better guide to the total community impact of vehicle safety.&quot;

In 1990, racer/journalist Rick Titus and engineer Chuck Beck (creator of the Beck Roadster kit car) built the Festiva Shogun. Inspired by the Australian Giocattolo project, they started a company called Special Editions, Inc., to produce a limited run of 250 cars. These cars were powered by a mid-mounted Yamaha V6 sourced from the first generation Ford Taurus SHO, producing . The Festiva Shogun was displayed in the Ford tent at the 1990 Monterey Historics and Ford was considering providing SHO engines directly; the deal fell through after executives test drove the car and deemed it a little too raucous for the company to put their imprimatur on. With the car not being an official Ford product, Special Editions had to buy SHOs from dealers and remove the engines, increasing the price by over ten percent. The price increase, the cancellation of a Japanese order, and the economy slowing down because of the first Gulf War, conspired against the project taking off and only seven cars (plus the prototype) were built.

====Australia====
Mazda began producing the Festiva as the &quot;Mazda 121&quot; for Australia (and Europe) in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan. The 121 ended production in 1990, and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991. From October 1991, Ford Australia began importing the car as the &quot;Ford Festiva&quot; from Kia&#x27;s South Korean production facility. Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only. From January 1993, a Festiva three-door, badged &quot;Festiva Trio&quot; was launched in Australia. Both versions were powered by the overhead camshaft carbureted 1.3-liter &quot;B3&quot; engine with the five-speed manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional for the five-door. Standard equipment in Australia included an AM/FM radio, tachometer, intermittent windscreen wipers, remote releases for the rear door and fuel tank filler door, with air-conditioning available as an option. Ford discontinued the WA Festiva in the Australian market in March 1994 in way for the WB Festiva.

Ford Australia&#x27;s action was paralleled in Europe where Kia started exporting three- and five-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and five-door wagon variants of the Kia Pride in 1991 under their own name. These additional sedan and five-door hatchback body variants were also imported from South Korea to Japan in left-hand drive form (Japan officially being a right-hand drive market) as the &quot;Ford Festiva 5&quot; (from May 1991) and &quot;Festiva β&quot;, respectively.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, it was assembled using complete knock-down kits from 1989 via the local joint venture Ford Lio Ho.

=== Mazda 121 (DA) ===
Mazda began selling the 121 as a single three-door hatchback body variant in 1987 to sit below the larger 323 model. Despite being manufactured there, the 121 was not sold in Japan under the &quot;Mazda&quot; brand. Australian specification 121s were fitted with the 1.3-liter &quot;B3&quot; engine, mated to a five-speed manual transmission. European markets also received the 1.1-liter &quot;B1&quot; engine with a four-speed manual transmission.

The 121 was sold in Australia from March 1987. It featured a sliding rear bench seat, which increased cargo space by as much as . Levels of trim in Australia comprised the base-line &quot;deluxe&quot;, the &quot;super deluxe&quot;, and the &quot;fun top&quot; (based on the super deluxe), featuring a large electric sliding canvas sunroof. From October 1988, the super deluxe was discontinued and replaced by the &quot;shades&quot; trim. The European premiere for the 121 was at the Geneva Auto Salon in March 1988. The 1.1-liter version was added in July 1989. Trim levels were L and LX, with an SR version also available in the UK. In Europe, the car&#x27;s ventilation system, developed with American consumers in mind, was notable for its refinement for the class. An interesting design feature was that the rear seat back could be reclined somewhat, and the seat could be moved longitudinally, adding up to of space to the otherwise very small luggage compartment.

Mazda issued an update for the 121 (released in October 1989 for the Australian market) with a new grille insert, body-hued exterior trim, redesigned instrumentation and interior seats and trim. The Mazda variant was discontinued in 1991, being replaced by a new generation Mazda 121, based on the Japanese market Autozam Revue.


=== Kia Pride (Y) ===
The Kia Pride badged version of the Festiva was manufactured in South Korea by Kia Motors from March 1987 to January 2000. Prior to its South Korean market release, exports as the Festiva had begun in December 1986 to Japan and the United States. The Pride was sold in four-door sedan form (in LX, GTX, and β trim levels), as well as three- and five-door hatchback forms (the CD-5) and five-door wagon body styles. The original Pride was only available as a three-door hatchback, while the five-door was added in June 1988. The four-door sedan model, the Pride Beta, arrived in November 1990, and the range was completed by the three-door van and five-door wagon in February 1992. In November 1993 the Pride received a minor facelift and production was also moved to Kia&#x27;s Asia Motors subsidiary&#x27;s Gwangju plant as Kia focused on the new Avella (Ford Aspire/WB Festiva). Until the Mazda 121 was replaced in late 1990, Kia-badged cars were only exported to certain tertiary markets. The Pride was replaced by the Rio beginning in 1999.

The Pride launched in the United Kingdom in June 1991, fitted with either the 1.1- &quot;B1&quot; or 1.3-litre &quot;B3&quot; engines. The 1.1 was only available as a three-door in the basic L trim (whitewall tyres were a commonplace feature on them). There was also a panel van two-seater version in the UK and some other markets. Fuel injection appeared on the 1.3-litre-engined models in November 1994, referred to as the &quot;1.3i&quot;. At this time, the 1.1-litre version was deleted. December 1995 saw the Start 1.3i three-door replace the L, and the Pride was then briefly discontinued in the UK in January 1999. In June 1999, it was relaunched in an entry-level three-door now called S with the higher-level three- and five-doors known as the SX. Sales of the relaunched model ended in June 2000.

=== SAIPA Pride ===
SAIPA has built the Kia Pride in Iran under license since 1993 and using up to 85 percent local parts as the SAIPA Pride from 2001 to 2005. Since 2003, SAIPA has produced a new five-door liftback model based on the Pride called the SAIPA 141, while continuing to sell the Iranian version of the Pride under the names SAIPA Saba GLXi (four-door sedan), SAIPA Nasim Safari (five-door wagon) and SAIPA Nasim DMi (five-door hatchback). Compared to these versions, the SAIPA 141 features revised rear styling with a longer liftback tail, and different interior design. Beginning in 2007, the SAIPA 141 was assembled and sold in Venezuela under the name Venirauto Turpial. The plan was to reach 92 percent local parts content, but this was generally regarded as unrealistic and Venirauto&#x27;s total annual production generally hovered around 2,000 cars.

Another variant, known as the SAIPA 132 began production in 2008 and differs from the Saba with its revised front and rear styling. The company introduced a coupe utility body style in 2008 under the name SAIPA 151, with a payload. The platform/engine of the Kia Pride also formed the basis for the Iranian P.K (2000 to 2005) and New P.K (2005 to 2007) models, which utilize Renault 5 bodies. In Iran, the Pride continues to be the most common car with approximately 40 percent of vehicles in the country being a Pride-derived SAIPA.

Arab American Vehicles (AAV) manufactured the Pride in Cairo, Egypt, circa 1998.

=== Kia Pride in China ===
The Kia Pride firstly involved in a joint venture in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province with automobile company Guangtong Motors, where they were producing cars under a licence. The batch of cars would firstly be imported into China where parts are brought in later and the company would assemble the finished product. Jiangsu Yueda Auto Works (later Yueda Kia Motors, currently Jiangsu Yueda Kia Motors) began assembly of the Pride in 1997. The sedan was called the Yueda Kia Pride YQZ6390, the hatchback either YQZ6370 or YQZ7141. Chinese production ended in December 2003.
== Second generation (WB, WD, WF; 1993) ==
The second model Ford Festiva, launched in 1993, was jointly developed between Kia and Ford, retaining most of the drivetrain of the previous model with a more rounded body style. This new Festiva was slightly longer, wider, more aerodynamic, and suspended by MacPherson struts in the front and a torsion beam axle in the rear. While it was sold in certain markets as a second generation Festiva, Ford renamed it the &quot;Aspire&quot; in North American markets, where the five-door model was offered for the first time. In South Korea, the car was badged &quot;Kia Avella&quot;. The sedan version was mainly restricted to the South Korean market, although it was also available with Festiva badging in Taiwan.

Depending on the market, some retained the SOHC, throttle-body injected motor, while others received an engine with a DOHC cylinder head and MPI also designed by Mazda. These engines were:
* B3 EGi: 1.3 L (1,323 cc) fuel injected 8-valve I4 making at 5000 rpm and at 3000 rpm
* B5 EGi: 1.5 L (1,498 cc) fuel injected 16-valve I4 making at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm (Asia and Oceania only)

Transmission options comprised a 5-speed manual transmission, although all models could be optioned with a 4-speed automatic. Australian and U.S. models were equipped with a 3-speed automatic.

In 1997, the Festiva received a new front bumper with an oval grille, reshaped headlamps, and other minor changes. The Aspire was dropped from the Ford range in the United States after 1997.

The second generation Festiva continued to be sold in Australia until 2000 when it was replaced by the Ford Ka. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. side marker light cut-outs on each side of the vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side indicator repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.

Kia developed their following model, the Kia Rio, completely independently, and finished their relationship with Ford.

Like the first generation, the 2008 edition of the &quot;Used Car Safety Ratings&quot; (UCSR) by Monash University in Australia found the second series Festiva to provide a &quot;worse than average&quot; (two out of five stars) safety protection level in the event of an accident. In the 2010 edition, the scoring was downgraded to &quot;very poor&quot; (equivalent to one of five stars, or the &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; terminology used in 2008).

=== Ford Aspire ===

The Ford Aspire was sold in North America from 1994 until 1997. It was the replacement for the Ford Festiva. It was the first car in its class to have dual airbags standard and anti-lock brakes optional. It came in two and four door body styles, both hatchbacks. The 2-door was available in base and SE trim while the 4-door was only available in base trim. The SE model offered a sporting package that consisted of fog lights, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, blue face instrument cluster with tachometer, and upgraded interior trim. The Aspire had very few options for the base model: cassette player, automatic transmission, rear defrost and wiper, alloy wheels, and a comfort and convenience package that had several minor interior upgrades. Due to slow sales the SE model was dropped after 1995 along with all of its optional equipment. The base model also lost its optional alloy wheels and rear wiper. The performance with the automatic was slower than the manual, with 0–60 mph times of 16.2 seconds. Power steering was only available with the 5-door automatic. The Aspire was given a facelift in 1997 with redesigned front and rear bumpers, a new radio, and new seat facings. The Aspire was discontinued after 1997, due to slow sales.

=== Kia Avella ===
The version of the Festiva sold in Korea, from March 1994, was badged &quot;Kia Avella&quot;. &quot;Avella&quot; was a made-up portmanteau word, combining &quot;aveo&quot; (Latin for &quot;desire&quot;) and &quot;ella&quot; (Spanish for &quot;she&quot;). Available in sedan (Avella Delta), three-door and five-door hatchback body styles. Sales of the Kia Avella totalled 115,576 between 1994 and 1995 but dropped to only 27,850 in 1998. The Avella was primarily intended for export markets carrying Ford badging, as South Korean customers tended to prefer sedans over hatchbacks. It was sold in a very few export markets with Kia badging, such as Malta and Russia. The Kia Avella was discontinued in 1999 although production for some export markets continued until 2000; it and the Pride (first generation Festiva) were collectively replaced by the Kia Rio in 1999.

All Avellas came standard with 13 inch wheels, a four-speaker stereo, heated rear glass, anti-lock brakes (ABS), driver&#x27;s side airbag, and door impact beams. Optional equipment included air conditioning, power locks, power mirrors, power windows, folding rear seats, dimming interior mirror, a tachometer, and aluminum wheels. The Avella was the first South Korean car in its class to offer dual airbags and ABS-brakes. The Delta version received a slightly reworked front end from its hatchback siblings.

While the standard Avellas received the 1.3 liter Mazda B3 engine, higher spec versions were available both with an SOHC and a more powerful DOHC version of the 1.5 liter B5 engine. The DOHC version was only available in the four-door Avella Delta. Five-speed manuals as well as three- or four-speed automatic transmissions were available.


== Third generation (1996) ==

Sales of the second generation Festiva ended in 1996 for the Japanese market, being replaced by generation three—a badge engineered Mazda Demio (DW). Known as the &quot;Ford Festiva Mini Wagon&quot;, the Japanese-only model range consisted of a single five-door hatchback body style available with either a 1.3- or 1.5-liter engine. Transmission options were a three-speed or four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual. Production continued until Mazda ceased manufacture of the equivalent Demio in 2002.

<doc id="393467" wikidata="Q2304770" url="?curid=393467" title="Southland Conference">
<text>The Southland Conference (SLC) is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the South Central United States (specifically Texas and Louisiana). It participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I for all sports; for football, it participates in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The Southland sponsors 18 sports, 10 for women and eight for men, and is governed by a presidential Board of Directors and an Advisory Council of athletic and academic administrators. Chris Grant became the Southland&#x27;s seventh commissioner on April 5, 2022. From 1996 to 2002, for football only, the Southland Conference was known as the Southland Football League. 
The conference&#x27;s offices are located in the Dallas suburb of Frisco, Texas. According to a press release from April 11, 2022, the conference was to undergo a rebrand in 2022 that included a new name and logo. The rebranding was unveiled in March 2023, with a new logo but no change to the conference name.

==History==

===Chronological timeline===
Founded in 1963, its members were Abilene Christian College (now Abilene Christian University; departed in 1973 for NCAA Division II, but moved to Division I and rejoined the Southland in 2013), Arkansas State College (now Arkansas State University; departed in 1987, now a member of the Sun Belt Conference), Arlington State College (now the University of Texas at Arlington, departed in 2012 and now in the Western Athletic Conference), Lamar State College of Technology (now Lamar University; departed in 1987, rejoined in 1999, left again in 2021, returned in 2022), and Trinity University (departed in 1972, now participating in NCAA Division III).

Since its founding, the Southland Conference has been the home for 18 college and university all-sports programs (see membership timeline below). In addition, the conference has also been home to some schools for one sport only. In the case of football, Troy University fielded a team from 1996 to 2000 and Jacksonville State University did so from 1997 to 2002. This has also been the case for some Olympic sports like men&#x27;s tennis, in which the University of Texas–Pan American (UTPA; since merged into the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, or UTRGV) and the University of New Orleans (UNO) fielded teams as affiliate members before 2013, when UTPA joined the WAC and UNO became a full Southland member.

The Southland underwent major turmoil in 2021, losing five members. On January 14, the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) announced that four Southland members - Abilene Christian, Lamar, Sam Houston, and Stephen F. Austin - would join that conference in July 2022. Within a week, the Southland expelled those four schools, leading the WAC to move their entry up to July 2021. A fifth member, Central Arkansas, announced on January 29 that it would join the Atlantic Sun Conference effective that July. At the time, the ASUN was a non-football conference, but soon entered into a football partnership with the WAC that gave Central Arkansas and two other incoming ASUN members a football home until an ASUN football league was established.

The Southland began the process of rebuilding its core membership in September 2021, announcing that East Texas A&amp;M University, then named Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, would start a transition from NCAA Division II and join the conference in July 2022. The SLC also announced a football scheduling alliance with the Ohio Valley Conference, another FCS league that had experienced major membership losses during the early-2020s realignment cycle, for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. However, shortly after Texas A&amp;M-Commerce was announced as a future member, the SLC was set to experience further attrition when the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) announced that it would leave for the WAC after the 2021-22 school year. Ultimately, however, this did not come to pass, as UIW announced it would be staying in the SLC only 7 months after announcing its departure. McNeese was also courted by the WAC, and also flirted with a move to Conference USA, but eventually stayed in the SLC. According to the &quot;American Press&quot;, the daily newspaper of McNeese&#x27;s home of Lake Charles, Louisiana, McNeese became &quot;the de facto lead school in the league&quot;. It was set to host the SLC&#x27;s football media day through at least the 2026 season, as well as the conference tournaments in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, and softball through 2026.

More recently, Lamar announced it would return to the SLC effective in 2023-24. In addition, on April 11, 2022 the conference announced in a press release that it had partnered with Troika Media Group to institute a rebrand to be implemented before the end of the calendar year. The release stated that the rebrand would include, among other things, a new name for the conference. On July 11, 2022, Lamar and the Southland Conference announced Lamar&#x27;s accelerated return to the SLC effective immediately. The following day saw the SLC lose two of its women&#x27;s golf associates when the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) and Northeast Conference (NEC) announced a partnership for baseball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf that saw all MEAC schools that sponsored those sports become NEC associates. Accordingly, Delaware State and Maryland Eastern Shore, which had joined SLC women&#x27;s golf just a year earlier, moved that sport to the NEC.

On March 25, 2024, the Southland expanded again with the announcement that UTRGV would join the conference effective July 1, 2024, joining Lamar from the WAC. Two months later, multiple media reports indicated that Stephen F. Austin would return to the SLC in July 2024; this move was officially announced on May 29.

==Member schools==

===Current full members===

;Notes
===Associate members===
The Southland added four associate members in golf effective with the 2021-22 school year. One school joined in men&#x27;s golf only, two in women&#x27;s golf only, and one in both. A fifth school joined at the same time for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and two more schools joined in July 2022, one for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf and tennis and the other for beach volleyball. However, as noted previously, two of these schools left a year later when their full-time home of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference entered into a women&#x27;s golf partnership with the Northeast Conference. The Southland Conference announced UIC joining the conference as an affiliate in men&#x27;s tennis for the 2022–23 season on July 14. San Jose State was added as a multi-year beach volleyball affiliate beginning with the 2023 season (2022–23 school year). UIC would only spend one season in SLC men&#x27;s tennis, moving that sport to the Mid-American Conference in July 2023.

==Media==

===Southland Conference Television Network===
The Conference began its own syndicated broadcast entity in 2008, the Southland Conference Television Network. It aired in over 25 markets in the league&#x27;s four-state region, plus on national networks such as Fox College Sports, ESPN GamePlan, and ESPN3. In 2008-09, the network featured 35 broadcasts, and over 30 in each of the next four seasons.

For 2013 and 2014, the syndicated network was restricted to only regular season football games. The remainder of the schedule was available on ESPN3 or regional sports networks, including regular season and tournament basketball as well as championships in soccer, volleyball, softball and baseball. ESPN3 also carried an exclusive package of football games beyond the syndicated network&#x27;s schedule.

SLCTV dissolved on July 1, 2015. Beginning with the 2015–16 school year, the Southland Conference entered into an agreement with the American Sports Network to syndicate and televise selected games, while also continuing its association with ESPN3. A separate deal allowed Louisiana-based Cox Sports Television to air select games.

After ASN folded following the 2016–17 academic year, the Southland announced a television agreement with Eleven Sports. During 2017-18, conference-controlled games aired on ESPN3, Eleven Sports, Fox Sports Southwest and Cox Sports Television. For 2018-19, ESPN productions began to be split between ESPN3 and ESPN+ platforms. On October 8, 2020, the Southland Conference announced a multi-year extension through the 2024–25 academic year as well as an expansion of its media rights agreement with ESPN.

<doc id="393470" wikidata="Q2228698" url="?curid=393470" title="Archibald Lampman">
<text>Archibald Lampman (17 November 1861 – 10 February 1899) was a Canadian poet. &quot;He has been described as &#x27;the Canadian Keats;&#x27; and he is perhaps the most outstanding exponent of the Canadian school of nature poets.&quot; &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; says that he is &quot;generally considered the finest of Canada&#x27;s late 19th-century poets in English.&quot;

Lampman is classed as one of Canada&#x27;s Confederation Poets, a group which also includes Charles G.D. Roberts, Bliss Carman, and Duncan Campbell Scott.

==Life==

Archibald Lampman was born at Morpeth, Ontario, a village near Chatham, the son of Archibald Lampman, an Anglican clergyman. &quot;The Morpeth that Lampman knew was a small town set in the rolling farm country of what is now western Ontario, not far from the shores of Lake Erie. The little red church just east of the town, on the Talbot Road, was his father&#x27;s charge.&quot;

In 1867 the family moved to Gore&#x27;s Landing on Rice Lake, where young Archie Lampman attended at the Barron&#x27;s School. In 1868 he contracted rheumatic fever, which left him lame for some years and with a permanently weakened heart.

Lampman attended Cobourg Collegiate, followed by Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, and then Trinity College in Toronto, Ontario (now part of the University of Toronto), graduating in 1882, with only second-class standing. While at university, he published early poems in &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot;, the literary journal of Victoria College. In 1883, after a frustrating attempt to teach high school in Orangeville, Ontario, he took an appointment as a low-paid clerk in the Post Office Department in Ottawa, a position he held for the rest of his life.

Lampman &quot;was slight of form and of middle height. He was quiet and undemonstrative in manner, but had a fascinating personality. Sincerity and high ideals characterized his life and work.&quot;

On Sep. 3, 1887, Lampman married 20-year-old Maude Emma Playter. &quot;They had a daughter, Natalie Charlotte, born in 1892. Arnold Gesner, born May 1894, was the first boy, but he died in August. A third child, Archibald Otto, was born in 1898.&quot;

In Ottawa, Lampman befriended poet William Wilfred Campbell. He also became a close friend of Indian Affairs bureaucrat Duncan Campbell Scott; Scott introduced him to camping, and Lampman introduced Scott to writing poetry. One of their early camping trips inspired Lampman&#x27;s classic &quot;Morning on the Lièvre&quot; which, in 1961, became the text for, and subject of, an award-winning National Film Board of Canada film of the same name. 

Lampman, Campbell, and Scott together wrote a literary column, &quot;At the Mermaid Inn,&quot; for the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; from February 1892 until July 1893. (The name was a reference to the Elizabethan-era Mermaid Tavern.) As Lampman wrote to a friend:

&quot;In the last years of his short life there is evidence of a spiritual malaise which was compounded by the death of an infant son [Arnold, commemorated in the poem &quot;White Pansies&quot;] and his own deteriorating health.&quot;

Lampman died in Ottawa at the age of 37, due to his weakened heart. He is buried, fittingly, at Beechwood Cemetery, in Ottawa, a site he wrote about in the poem &quot;In Beechwood Cemetery&quot; (which is inscribed at the cemetery&#x27;s entranceway). His grave is marked by a natural stone on which is carved only one word: Lampman. A plaque on the site carries a few lines from his poem &quot;In November&quot;:

==Writing==

In May 1881, when Lampman was at Trinity College, someone lent him a copy of Charles G. D. Roberts&#x27;s recently published first book, &quot;Orion and Other Poems&quot;. The effect on the 19-year-old student was immediate and profound:

Lampman sent Roberts a fan letter, which &quot;initiated a correspondence between the two young men, but they probably did not meet until after Roberts moved to Toronto in late September 1883 to become the editor of Goldwin Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Week&quot;.&quot;

Inspired, Lampman also began writing poetry, and soon after began publishing it: first &quot;in the pages of his college magazine, &quot;Rouge et Noir&quot;;&quot; then &quot;graduating to the more presitigious pages of &quot;The Week&quot;&quot; – (his sonnet &quot;A Monition,&quot; later retitled &quot;The Coming of Winter,&quot; appeared in its first issue) – and finally, by the late 1880s &quot;winning an audience in the major magazines of the day, such as &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;.&quot;

Lampman published mainly nature poetry in the current late-Romantic style. &quot;The prime literary antecedents of Lampman lie in the work of the English poets Keats, Wordsworth, and Arnold,&quot; says the &quot;Gale Encyclopedia of Biography&quot;, &quot;but he also brought new and distinctively Canadian elements to the tradition. Lampman, like others of his school, relied on the Canadian landscape to provide him with much of the imagery, stimulus, and philosophy which characterize his work... Acutely observant in his method, Lampman created out of the minutiae of nature careful compositions of color, sound, and subtle movement. Evocatively rich, his poems are frequently sustained by a mood of revery and withdrawal, while their themes are those of beauty, wisdom, and reassurance, which the poet discovered in his contemplation of the changing seasons and the harmony of the countryside.&quot;

&quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; calls his poems &quot;for the most part close-packed melancholy meditations on natural objects, emphasizing the calm of country life in contrast to the restlessness of city living. Limited in range, they are nonetheless remarkable for descriptive precision and emotional restraint. Although characterized by a skilful control of rhythm and sound, they tend to display a sameness of thought.&quot;

&quot;Lampman wrote more than 300 poems in this last period of his life, although scarcely half of these were published prior to his death. For single poems or groups of poems he found outlets in the literary magazines of the day: in Canada, chiefly the &quot;Week&quot;; in the United States, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, the &quot;Independent&quot;, the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1888, with the help of a legacy left to his wife, he published &quot;Among the millet and other poems&quot;,&quot; his first book, at his own expense. The book is notable for the poems &quot;Morning on the Lièvre,&quot; &quot;Heat,&quot; the sonnet &quot;In November,&quot; and the long sonnet sequence &quot;The Frogs&quot;

&quot;By this time he had achieved a literary reputation, and his work appeared regularly in Canadian periodicals and prestigious American magazines... In 1895 Lampman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and his second collection of poems, &quot;Lyrics of Earth&quot;, was brought out by a Boston publisher.&quot;

The book was not a success. &quot;The sales of &quot;Lyrics of Earth&quot; were disappointing and the only critical notices were four brief though favourable reviews. In size, the volume is slighter than &quot;Among the Millet&quot; — twenty-nine poems in contrast to forty-eight — and in quality fails to surpass the earlier work.&quot; (&quot;Lyrics&quot; does, though, contain some of Lampman&#x27;s most beautiful poems, such as &quot;After Rain&quot; and &quot;The Sun Cup.&quot;)

&quot;A third volume, &quot;Alcyone and other poems&quot;, in press at the time of his death&quot; in 1899, showed Lampman starting to move in new directions, with the nature verses interspersed with philosophical poetry like &quot;Voices of Earth&quot; and &quot;The Clearer Self&quot; and poems of social criticism like &quot;The City&quot; and what may be his best-known poem, the dystopian vision of &quot;The City of the End of Things.&quot; &quot;As a corollary to his preoccupation with nature,&quot; notes the &quot;Gale Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Lampman [had] developed a critical stance toward an emerging urban civilization and a social order against which he pitted his own idealism. He was an outspoken socialist, a feminist, and a social critic.&quot; Canadian critic Malcolm Ross wrote that &quot;in poems like &#x27;The City at the End of Things&#x27; and &#x27;Epitaph on a Rich Man&#x27; Lampman seems to have a social and political insight absent in his fellows.&quot;

However, Lampman died before &quot;Alcyone&quot; appeared, and it &quot;was held back by Scott (12 specimen copies were printed posthumously in Ottawa in 1899) in favour of a comprehensive memorial volume planned for 1900.&quot; The latter was a planned collected poems &quot;which he was editing in the hope that its sale would provide Maud with some much-needed cash. Besides &quot;Alcyone&quot;, it included &quot;Among the Millet&quot; and &quot;Lyrics of Earth&quot; in their entirety, plus seventy-four sonnets Lampman had tried to publish separately, twenty-three miscellaneous poems and ballads, and two long narrative poems (&quot;David and Abigail&quot; and &quot;The Story of an Affinity&quot;).&quot; Among the previously unpublished sonnets were some of Lampman&#x27;s finest work, including &quot;Winter Uplands&quot;, &quot;The Railway Station,&quot; and &quot;A Sunset at Les Eboulements.&quot;

&quot;Published by Morang &amp; Company of Toronto in 1900,&quot; &quot;The Poems of Archibald Lampman&quot; &quot;was a substantial tome — 473 pages — and ran through several editions. Scott&#x27;s &#x27;Memoir,&#x27; which prefaces the volume, would prove to be an invaluable source of information about the poet&#x27;s life and personality.&quot;

Scott published one further volume of Lampman&#x27;s poetry, &quot;At the Long Sault and Other Poems&quot;, in 1943 – &quot;and on this occasion, as on other occasions previously, he did not hesitate to make what he felt were improvements on the manuscript versions of the poems.&quot; The book is remarkable mainly for its title poem, &quot;At the Long Sault: May 1660,&quot; a dramatic retelling of the Battle of Long Sault, which belongs with the great Canadian historical poems. It was co-edited by E.K. Brown, who the same year published his own volume &quot;On Canadian Poetry&quot;: a book that was a major boost to Lampman&#x27;s reputation. Brown considered Lampman and Scott the top Confederation Poets, well ahead of Roberts and Carman, and his view came to predominate over the next few decades.

Lampman never considered himself more than a minor poet, as he once confessed in a letter to a friend: &quot;I am not a great poet and I never was. Greatness in poetry must proceed from greatness of character — from force, fearlessness, brightness. I have none of those qualities. I am, if anything, the very opposite, I am weak, I am a coward, I am a hypochondriac. I am a minor poet of a superior order, and that is all.&quot; However, others&#x27; opinion of his work has been higher than his own.

Malcolm Ross, for instance, considered him to be the best of all the Confederation Poets:

==Recognition==
Lampman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1895.

He was designated a Person of National Historic Significance in 1920.

A literary prize, the Archibald Lampman Award, is awarded annually by Ottawa-area poetry magazine &quot;Arc&quot; in Lampman&#x27;s honour.

Since 1999, the annual &quot;Archibald Lampman Poetry Reading&quot; has brought leading Canadian poets to Trinity College, Toronto, under the sponsorship of the John W. Graham Library and the Friends of the Library, Trinity College.

His name is also carried on in the town of Lampman, Saskatchewan, a small community of approximately 730 people, situated near the City of Estevan.

Canada Post issued a postage stamp in his honour on July 7, 1989. The stamp depicts Lampman&#x27;s portrait on a backdrop of nature.

Canadian singer/songwriter Loreena McKennitt adapted Lampman&#x27;s poem &quot;Snow&quot; as a song, writing original music while keeping as the lyrics the poem verbatim. This adaptation appears on McKennitt&#x27;s album &quot;To Drive the Cold Winter Away&quot; (1987) and, with a different arrangement, on her 1995 EP, &quot;A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season&quot;, which was replaced in 2008 by the album &quot;A Midwinter Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Toronto choir the Upper Canada Choristers commissioned a setting of three of Lampman&#x27;s poems (&quot;The Bird and the Hour,&quot; &quot;Snow&quot; and &quot;Voices of Earth&quot;) from Canadian composer Stephen Chatman.

<doc id="393473" wikidata="Q654824" url="?curid=393473" title="Denominazione di origine controllata">
<text>The following four classifications of wine constitute the Italian system of labelling and legally protecting Italian wine:
* Denominazione di origine (DO, rarely used; ; &#x27;designation of origin&#x27;);
* Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT; ; &#x27;indication of geographical typicality&#x27;);
* Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC; ; &#x27;controlled designation of origin&#x27;); and
* Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG; ; &#x27;controlled and guaranteed designation of origin&#x27;).

The system was introduced in 1963 shortly after the Treaty of Rome established Italy as a founding member of the European Economic Community, and was modelled on the extant French &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) laws. It was overhauled in 1992 to match new European Union law on protected designation of origin, introducing the more general &quot;denominazione di origine protetta&quot; (DOP) designation for foods and agricultural products, including wines. Further EU reforms to harmonise agricultural policy in 2008 meant that designations used in member states, and thus Italian designations, were registered with the EU by the end of 2011, with subsequent new denominations or elevations approved by the EU.

==&quot;Indicazione geografica tipica&quot; (IGT)==
&quot;Indicazione geografica tipica&quot; was created in 1992 to recognize the unusually high quality of the class of wines known as Super Tuscans, and to be broadly equivalent to the French &quot;vin de pays&quot; designation, official in Italy&#x27;s Aosta Valley, where French is an official language. IGT wines are labelled with the locality of their creation, but do not meet the requirements of the stricter DOC or DOCG designations, which are generally intended to protect traditional wine formulations such as Chianti or Barolo. Since 2008 both IGT and &quot;vin de pays&quot; are equivalent to the EU protected geographical indication (PGI) designation, and many producers have switched to using the Italian translation, &quot;Indicazione geografica protetta&quot; (IGP). This classification is seen to be a higher quality wine than &quot;vino da tavola&quot; (&#x27;table wine&#x27;).

==&quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC)==
The &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; classification was created to be roughly equivalent to the French &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC). It requires that a wine satisfy a defined quality standard and be produced within the specified region. Unlike IGT, the DOC definitions will usually specify additional more stringent rules regarding permitted grape varieties, harvest yields, minimum ageing including use of barrels, minimum alcohol content, and other factors. Wines labelled DOC or DOCG must be sold in bottles holding no more than . Historically the DOC status has been used to classify other food products such as cheeses, olive oil and vinegar, but the &quot;denominazione di origine protetta&quot; (DOP) is now used instead.

Since the 2008 EU reforms, both the DOC and DOCG wine classifications are protected in the EU as protected designation of origin (PDO), which in Italy generally is indicated in Italian: &quot;denominazione di origine protetta&quot; (DOP). They may however still be referred to as DOC/DOCG, or in Bolzano, where German is an official language, &quot;kontrollierte Ursprungsbezeichnung&quot;, as well as in the Aosta Valley, where French is an official language, &quot;dénomination d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot;.

==&quot;Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG)==

&quot;Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; is intended to be a superior classification to DOC, and is the highest classification in Italy. All DOCG wines from each producer are analysed and tasted by a government-licensed judgement panel before being bottled. Once approved, the wines are &quot;guaranteed&quot; with a numbered governmental seal across the cap or cork, to prevent later manipulation. Where the DOCG classification represents a refinement of an existing DOC wine, the rules for the DOCG wine usually require more stringent quality controls. These controls are usually some combination of a lower proportion of blending grapes, lower yields, higher minimum alcohol, longer ageing requirements, and so on.

The need for a DOCG identification arose when the DOC designation was, in the view of many Italian food industries, given too liberally to different products. A new, more restrictive identification was then created as similar as possible to the previous one so that buyers could still recognize it, but qualitatively different. The three original DOCGs were Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, and Barolo, all approved by a presidential decree in July 1980, followed by Barbaresco three months later.

For wines produced in Bolzano, where German is an official language, DOCG may be written as &quot;Kontrollierte und garantierte Ursprungsbezeichnung&quot;.

For wines produced in the Aosta Valley, where French is an official language, DOCG may be written as &quot;Dénomination d&#x27;origine contrôlée et garantie&quot;.

In 2010–2011 many new DOCG classifications were created or elevated from DOC, in the rush to register them before the EU reform deadline. This has had the effect of potentially diluting the importance of the DOCG classification.

==Other label rules==
Italian legislation additionally regulates the use of qualifying terms for wines. &quot;Classico&quot; (&#x27;classic&#x27;) is reserved for wines produced in the region where a particular type of wine has been produced &quot;traditionally&quot;. For Chianti Classico, this traditional region is defined by a 1932 decree. &quot;Riserva&quot; (&#x27;reserve&#x27;) may be used only for wines that have been aged at least two years longer than normal for a particular type of wine.

<doc id="393477" wikidata="Q6518233" url="?curid=393477" title="Court of Final Appeal Building">
<text>The Court of Final Appeal Building, also known as the Old Supreme Court Building, is the home of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. It housed the former Supreme Court from 1912 to 1983 and the Legislative Council from 1985 to 2011. It is located at 8 Jackson Road, in Central, along the eastern side of Statue Square, directly west of Chater Garden. As the Old Supreme Court, its exterior is one of the declared monuments of Hong Kong.
==History==
The building was designed by Sir Aston Webb and Ingress Bell, the British architects responsible for the eastern façade of Buckingham Palace and the Cromwell Road frontage of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Construction of the building started in 1900 and it was opened on 15 January 1912 by the Governor Sir Frederick Lugard. The two-storey granite building is neo-classical in style supported by Ionic columns. It is surmounted by a 2.7 m high blindfolded statue of Justice, represented by Themis, the Greek goddess of justice and law. This statue was inspired by the one erected at London&#x27;s Old Bailey.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (December 1941 to August 1945), the building was used as the headquarters of the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; (Military Police).

In 1978, this building was severely affected by the construction of MTR, requiring restoration work. As a consequence, for part of the early 1980s, the Supreme Court was moved to the Former French Mission Building, which was then used by the Victoria District Court.

In 1985, the building took up service as home to the Legislative Council, when it was known as &#x27;the Legislative Council Building&#x27;, while the Supreme Court moved to the Supreme Court Building in Admiralty - renamed the High Court Building in 1997.

In 2011, the Legislative Council moved into the new Legislative Council Complex within the Central Government Complex at Tamar site.

On 7 September 2015, the building reverted to its former judicial function. It now houses the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. The opening ceremony was held on 25 September 2015 by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal Geoffrey Ma Tao-li.

==Architectural features==
The building was erected on reclaimed land. Its foundation was formed by driving hundreds of Chinese fir tree trunks into the mixture of reclamation materials and silt on the site. As a consequence, the building is in effect &quot;floating&quot; on a timber raft. Such a foundation system requires the groundwater level to be maintant level, and a groundwater replenishment system is installed to replace groundwater as required.

The plan of the building follows a rectangular pattern and is symmetrical. The building occupies an area of around (about ) and is surrounded by columns. Its height, fronze Tudor Crown, is about .
A pediment surmounts the central section of the building facing Statue Square. The pediment is topped by a Statue of Justice and under it is the inscription &quot;Erected AD MDCCCCX&quot; (Erected AD 1910). The pediment incorporates a semi-circular window and the carving of the British royal coat of arms is above it. The shield shows the various royal emblems of the various parts of the United Kingdom: the three lions of England in the first and fourth quarters, the lion of Scotland in the second and the harp of Ireland in the third. The shield is supported by the English lion and Scottish unicorn and is surmounted by the royal crown. The motto of the sovereign, &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot; (God and my right), is displayed underneath it. The figures of Mercy and Truth are located on both sides of the British royal arms.

<text>John Runciman (1744 – 1768 or 1769) was a Scottish painter known for Biblical and literary scenes. His works include &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot; and &quot;King Lear in the Storm&quot;, both in the National Gallery of Scotland.

==Life==
Born in Edinburgh, Runciman was the younger brother of the better-known painter Alexander Runciman. His earliest surviving work is the 1764 etching, &quot;Taking-down of the Netherebow Port, Edinburgh&quot;, which depicts the demolition of one of Edinburgh&#x27;s old city gates. In Edinburgh he produced a number of small oil paintings on religious themes, including the &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot; in the National Gallery of Scotland, which shows the influence of Rembrandt. In 1767 he produced one of his finest works, &quot;King Lear in the Storm&quot;, inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s play, which shows a tranquil king facing down a savage storm at sea. Also in 1767 he moved to London and, after a few months, to Rome, where he produced a painted &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, the etching &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son&quot;, and some drawings.

Runciman took ill with tuberculosis in 1768, and destroyed many of his works, partly due to harsh comments by his fellow painter James Nevay. He died in Naples in 1768 or 1769.

<doc id="393485" wikidata="Q628687" url="?curid=393485" title="Croagh Patrick">
<text>Croagh Patrick (), nicknamed &#x27;the Reek&#x27;, is a mountain with a height of and an important site of pilgrimage in County Mayo, Ireland. The mountain has a pyramid-shaped peak and overlooks Clew Bay, rising above the village of Murrisk, several kilometres from Westport. 

It has long been seen as a holy mountain. It was the focus of a prehistoric ritual landscape, and later became associated with Saint Patrick, who is said to have spent forty days fasting on the summit. There has been a church on the summit since the 5th century; the current church dates to the early 20th century. Croagh Patrick is climbed by thousands of pilgrims every year on Reek Sunday, the last Sunday in July, a custom which goes back to at least the Middle Ages.

Croagh Patrick is the fourth-highest mountain in the province of Connacht on the P600 listing after Mweelrea, Nephin and Barrclashcame. It is part of a longer east–west ridge; the lower westernmost peak is named Ben Goram.

==Name==
&#x27;Croagh Patrick&#x27; comes from the Irish &quot;Cruach Phádraig&quot; meaning &quot;(Saint) Patrick&#x27;s stack&quot;. It is known locally as &quot;the Reek&quot;, a Hiberno-English word for a &quot;rick&quot; or &quot;stack&quot;. Previously it was known as &quot;Cruachán Aigle&quot; or &quot;Cruach Aigle&quot;, being mentioned by that name in medieval sources such as &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot;, &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot;, &quot;The Metrical Dindshenchas&quot;, and the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; entry for the year 1113. &quot;Cruachán&quot; is simply a diminutive of &quot;cruach&quot; meaning &quot;stack&quot; or &quot;peak&quot;. Aigle was an old name for the area. The &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; (lore of places) says that Aigle was a prince of Connacht who was slain by his uncle Cromderg in revenge for his slaying of a woman under Cromderg&#x27;s care. It is also suggested that &quot;Aigle&quot; is an alternative form of &quot;aicil&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;.

The Marquess of Sligo, whose seat was nearby Westport House, bears the titles Baron Mount Eagle and Earl of Altamont (&quot;high mount&quot;), both deriving from Croagh Patrick.

==Historical significance==
Perhaps because of its prominence, its pyramidal quartzite peak, and the legends associated with it, Croagh Patrick has long been seen as a holy mountain.

Archaeologist Christiaan Corlett writes that the large number of prehistoric monuments surrounding and oriented towards Croagh Patrick &quot;suggests that the mountain has been a local spiritual inspiration since at least the Neolithic, and during the Bronze Age became the focus of an extensive ritual landscape&quot;.

A short distance east of the mountain lies the Boheh Stone, an outcrop covered with ancient rock art. There are more than 260 carvings, making it one of the most detailed pieces of ancient rock art in Ireland, and one of only two in the province of Connacht. In 1987 it was rediscovered that, from the Boheh stone, the setting sun appears to roll down the slope of Croagh Patrick in late April and late August. It is believed the stone was chosen because of this natural phenomenon. A stone row at Killadangan is aligned with a niche in the mountain where the sun sets on the winter solstice.

Archaeological surveying found remains of an enclosure encircling the mountaintop and dozens of circular huts abutting it, which showed evidence of Bronze Age date.

Tírechán, a native of Connacht, wrote in the 7th century that Saint Patrick spent forty days on the mountain, like Moses on Mount Sinai. The 9th century &quot;Bethu Phátraic&quot; says that Patrick was harassed by a flock of black demonic birds while on the peak, and he banished them into the hollow of Lugnademon (&quot;hollow of the demons&quot;) by ringing his bell. Patrick ended his fast when God gave him the right to judge all the Irish at the Last Judgement, and agreed to spare the land from the final desolation. A later legend tells how Patrick was tormented by a demonic female serpent named Corra or Caorthannach. Patrick is said to have banished the serpent into Lough Na Corra below the mountain, or into a hollow from which the lake burst forth.

==Pilgrimage==
Archaeologists found that there had been a stone chapel or oratory on the summit since the 5th century. There is reference to a &quot;Teampall Phádraig&quot; (Patrick&#x27;s Temple) from AD 824, when the Archbishops of Armagh and Tuam disagreed as to who had jurisdiction on the site. A small modern chapel was built on the summit and dedicated on 20 July 1905.

On the last Sunday in July, thousands of pilgrims climb Croagh Patrick in honour of Saint Patrick, and masses are held at the summit chapel. Some pilgrims climb the mountain barefoot, as an act of penance. Traditionally, pilgrims would perform &#x27;rounding rituals&#x27;, in which they pray while walking sunwise around features on the mountain. Among these are a group of three ancient cairns known as Reilig Mhuire (Mary&#x27;s graveyard), which are likely Bronze Age burial cairns.

Folklorist Máire MacNeill conjectured that the pilgrimage pre-dates Christianity and was originally a ritual associated with the festival of Lughnasadh.

Today, most pilgrims climb Croagh Patrick from the direction of Murrisk Abbey to the north. Originally, most pilgrims climbed the mountain from the east, following the Togher Patrick (&quot;Tochár Phádraig&quot;) pilgrim path from Ballintubber Abbey. This route is dotted with prehistoric monuments, including the Boheh stone. Until 1970, it was traditional for pilgrims to climb the mountain after sunset. It is possible that this came from a pre-historic tradition of climbing the mountain after viewing the &#x27;rolling sun&#x27; phenomenon. The &quot;Tochár Phádraig&quot; may have originally been the main route from Cruachan (seat of the Kings of Connacht) to Cruachan Aigle, the original name of Croagh Patrick. The &quot;Tochar Phadraig&quot; was revived and reopened as a cross-country pilgrimage tourist trail by Pilgrim Paths of Ireland; the 30-kilometre route takes about ten hours.

Local people and organisations point out that the large number of climbers – as many as 40,000 per year – have damaged the mountain by causing erosion which makes the climb more dangerous.

Local stakeholders have made efforts to combat the erosion caused by foot traffic through the creation of a stone path up the mountain, composed of stone from Croagh Patrick and assembled in a dry stone manner. 

Leave No Trace Ireland will deliver the Ambassador Training Programme to the selected Ambassadors, working with Mayo County Council to ensure that visitors to Crough Patrick appreciate the importance of preserving the mountain’s distinct natural, cultural and religious heritage through sustainable use. This training programme will also provide guidance on the most effective means for visitors to engage with the mountain, whether local or visiting on how to engage in responsible stewardship of Croagh Patrick. Dogs are not permitted on Croagh Patrick due to animal livestock been present and the threat dog leads pose to other visitors. 

==Gold discovery==
A seam of gold was discovered in the core of the mountain in the 1980s. Due to local resistance by the Mayo Environmental Group, headed by Paddy Hopkins, Mayo County Council decided not to allow mining on Croagh Patrick. The name of the Owenwee River (&quot;Abhainn Bhuí&quot;, yellow river) on the south of the mountain may indicate an ancient awareness of gold deposits in the area and gold panning in the river.

<text>Ezra Taft Benson (August 4, 1899 – May 30, 1994) was an American farmer, government official, and religious leader who served as the 15th United States Secretary of Agriculture during both presidential terms of Dwight D. Eisenhower and as the 13th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1985 until his death in 1994.

==Early life==

Born on a farm in Whitney, Idaho, Benson was the oldest of eleven children. He was the great-grandson of Ezra T. Benson, who was appointed by Brigham Young to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1846. When he was 12 years old, his father was called as a missionary to the midwestern United States, leaving his expectant mother alone with seven children. Benson took much of the responsibility for running the family farm and in the words of his sister, &quot;He took the place of father for nearly two years.&quot; Benson began his academic career at the Oneida Stake Academy in Preston, Idaho and graduated in 1918. He then attended Utah State Agricultural College (USAC, modern Utah State University), where he first met his future wife, Flora Smith Amussen. Benson alternated quarters at USAC and worked on the family farm.

Benson served an LDS Church mission in Britain from 1921 to 1923. It was while serving as a missionary, particularly an experience in Sheffield, that caused Benson to realize how central the Book of Mormon was to the message of the church and in converting people to it. Due to local antagonism and threats of violence, LDS Church leaders sent apostle David O. McKay to personally oversee the mission. McKay was impressed with Benson and appointed him as president of the Newcastle Conference.

After his mission, Benson studied at Brigham Young University and finished his bachelor&#x27;s degree there in 1926. That year he married Flora Smith Amussen, shortly after her return from a mission in Hawaii. They had six children together. Benson received a master of science degree in agricultural economics in 1927 from Iowa State University. Several years later, he did preliminary work on a doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley, but never completed it.

Just after receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Benson returned to Whitney to run the family farm. He later became the county agriculture extension agent for Oneida County, Idaho. He later was promoted to the supervisor of all county agents and moved to Boise in 1930. Benson encouraged crop rotation, improved grains, fertilizers, pest controls, and establishment of farmer&#x27;s cooperatives to market farm commodities.

While in Boise, Benson also worked in the central state extension office connected with the University of Idaho Extension Service. He also founded a farmers cooperative. Benson was superintendent of the Boise Stake Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association and later a counselor in the stake presidency. Benson was a critic of national agricultural policies implemented in the 1930s under Franklin D. Roosevelt. In particular, he objected to farm subsidies, and efforts by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to raise prices by paying farmers to destroy crops and kill livestock.

In 1939, he became president of the Boise Idaho Stake. Later that year, he moved to Washington, D.C., to become Executive Secretary of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, overseeing around five thousand farm cooperatives which represented two million farmers throughout the country.

Benson became the first president of a new church stake in Washington, D.C.

==Apostle==

In 1943, Benson went to Salt Lake City to ask church leaders for advice on whether to accept a new job. They unexpectedly told him that he would join the church leadership. On October 7, 1943, both Benson and Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) became members of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, filling two vacancies created by the deaths of apostles that summer. Because Kimball was ordained first, he was given seniority over Benson in the Quorum. Upon Kimball&#x27;s death in 1985, Benson became the church&#x27;s next president.

In 1946, the First Presidency sent Benson to Europe to oversee the church&#x27;s relief efforts after World War II. He spent eleven months there, traveling 61,000 miles and supervising two thousand tons of relief supplies, including to Germany and Poland. Recalling this experience, he wrote to his wife, &quot;I&#x27;m so grateful you and the children can be spared the views of the terrible ravages of war. I fear I&#x27;ll never be able to erase them from my memory.&quot; Apostle Gordon B. Hinckley noted of Benson&#x27;s experience in Europe, &quot;I am confident that it was out of what he saw of the bitter fruit of dictatorship that he developed his strong feelings, almost hatred, for communism and socialism.&quot;

On April 25, 1950, Benson was married vicariously to his never married and recently deceased cousin, Eva Amanda Benson, with his wife standing in as proxy.

On September 16, 1980, he dedicated the newly renamed Ezra Taft Benson Building at Ricks College.

Benson&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2015 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

==Political career==
In 1948, Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey approached Benson before the election that year about becoming the United States Secretary of Agriculture. Although Benson had supported his distant cousin Robert A. Taft over Dwight D. Eisenhower for the 1952 Republican nomination and did not know Eisenhower, after his election Eisenhower nevertheless appointed Benson as Secretary of Agriculture. Benson accepted with the permission and encouragement of church president David O. McKay; Benson therefore served simultaneously in the United States Cabinet and in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He became the first clergy member to be a cabinet secretary since Edward Everett in 1852, which created some controversy as crossing a boundary between church and state. The American Council of Churches opposed Benson for being a member of what they felt was a &quot;pagan religion...hostile to the Biblical evangelical Christian faith.&quot;

At the time of assuming office, the Department of Agriculture had 78,000 employees and an annual budget of $2.1 billion.

Benson opposed the system of government price supports and aid to farmers which he was entrusted by Eisenhower to administer, arguing that it amounted to unacceptable socialism. Furthermore, farming in the United States was increasingly becoming large scale agribusiness at the expense of the small farmer, and Benson was opposed to outsized portions of these government subsidies being apportioned to these large companies. He was once pelted with eggs by a group of South Dakota farmers over his efforts to reduce price controls. Another time, 21 congressmen from the Midwest stormed his office requesting he not lift price controls on hogs, which he refused to do, and later noted that the prices rose on their own. Nonetheless, he served in his cabinet position for all eight years of Eisenhower&#x27;s presidency. He was selected as the administrator-designate of the Emergency Food Agency, part of a secret group that became known as the Eisenhower Ten. The group was created by Eisenhower in 1958 to serve in the event of a national emergency.

As Benson&#x27;s term came to an end in 1961, farm commodity prices had risen 10% from the previous year, and Benson&#x27;s popularity increased.

In 1968, the John Birch Society (JBS) made an effort to nominate Benson as a presidential candidate, with segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond as vice president, for which Benson sought and obtained approval from LDS Church president David O. McKay. Several months later, Benson flew to Alabama to meet with segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace, who asked Benson to become his vice presidential running mate for the presidency. This time McKay refused Benson&#x27;s request, even after Wallace himself wrote to McKay.

Benson&#x27;s interest in politics could be seen in the subjects he chose for his biannual addresses at general conference. Three-quarters of Benson&#x27;s 20 sermons at general conference during the 1960s were on a political theme. In addition, Benson gave hundreds of other talks discussing Communism and how to combat it.

Like Robert A. Taft, Benson supported a non-interventionist foreign policy.

In August 1989, Benson received the Presidential Citizens Medal from U.S. President George H. W. Bush.

Benson was a vocal proponent of limited government, individual liberty, and free-market economics. As Secretary of Agriculture, he implemented policies aimed at reducing government intervention in agriculture, including efforts to phase out price supports and promote self-reliance among farmers. A fierce critic of communism and socialism, Benson warned against the erosion of constitutional freedoms and centralized power, drawing heavily on his belief in the principles of the U.S. Constitution. He integrated these ideals into his religious teachings, frequently emphasizing personal responsibility, moral agency, and the dangers of government overreach.

==Anti-communism efforts==
Benson was an outspoken opponent of communism and socialism, and a strong supporter, but not an official member, of the JBS, which he praised as &quot;the most effective non-church organization in our fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism.&quot; Benson requested permission of church president McKay to join the JBS and sit on its board, but the request was denied. Benson was a close friend with the JBS founder, Robert W. Welch Jr., exchanging dozens of letters, and many hours in person discussing politics. When Nikita Khrushchev came in September 1959 to the US, Benson opposed his visit. From the 1950s to the 1980s, his public support of anti-communism often put him at odds with other leaders of the LDS Church. In 1960, Benson made a proposition to Brigham Young University president Ernest L. Wilkinson that his son, Reed Benson, be used as a spy to &quot;find out who the orthodox teachers were and report to his father.&quot; Wilkinson declined the offer, stating &quot;neither Brother Lee nor I want espionage of that character.&quot; Later in the 1960s and 1970s, members and advocates of the Birch Society did conduct espionage at BYU.

In October 1961 general conference, Benson said, &quot;No true Latter-day Saint and no true American can be a socialist or a communist or support programs leading in that direction.&quot; This, and similar statements by Benson in the December &quot;Church News&quot; led Hugh B. Brown, a politically liberal member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency, to begin publicly and privately pushing back against Benson. In the April 1962 general conference, Brown said, &quot;The degree of a man&#x27;s aversion to communism may not always be measured by the noise he makes in going about and calling everyone a communist who disagrees with his personal political bias. ... There is no excuse for members of this Church, especially men who hold the priesthood, to be opposing one another over communism.&quot;

In October 1962, Benson formally endorsed the JBS, as his son, Reed, accepted a leadership role in the society. Reed Benson had been using LDS Church meetinghouses for JBS meetings, a move that angered both Brown and first counselor Henry D. Moyle, who believed it violated the LDS Church&#x27;s policy of political neutrality. Brown wrote in a letter shortly after the endorsement that he was &quot;disgusted&quot; and if Ezra Taft Benson continued his JBS activities that &quot;some disciplinary action should be taken.&quot; In January 1963, the First Presidency issued a statement, &quot;We deplore the presumption of some politicians, especially officers, coordinators and members of the John Birch Society, who undertake to align the Church or its leadership with their political views.&quot; Three days later, Benson spoke at a JBS-endorsed political rally, reported by several newspapers as purposefully ignoring the First Presidency statement, and embarrassing to the LDS Church. In February 1963, the JBS asked its members to &quot;write to President McKay,&quot; with the suggested verbiage to praise &quot;the great service Ezra Taft Benson and his son, Reed (our Utah Coordinator), are rendering to this battle, with the hope that they will be encouraged to continue.&quot; That same month, Benson gave a copy of his book, &quot;The Red Carpet: A Forthright Evaluation of the Rising Tide of Socialism – the Royal Road to Communism,&quot; to newly called apostle N. Eldon Tanner, who was a Democrat, and had been a Canadian politician in the Alberta Social Credit Party.

In 1963, the First Presidency sent Benson to Europe to preside over the missionary work there. Some, including the &quot;New York Times&quot;, interpreted this move as an &quot;exile&quot; after Benson&#x27;s virtual endorsement of the JBS in general conference. McKay publicly denied that the assignment was an exile or a rebuke, but other church leaders, including Joseph Fielding Smith, indicated that a purpose in sending Benson to Europe was to break his ties with the JBS.

Benson published a 1966 pamphlet entitled &quot;Civil Rights, Tool of Communist Deception&quot;. In a similar vein, during a 1972 general conference, Benson recommended that all church members read Gary Allen&#x27;s New World Order tract &quot;None Dare Call It a Conspiracy&quot;. U.S. Representative Ralph R. Harding, during a speech in Congress, accused Benson of being &quot;a spokesperson for the radical right&quot; and using his apostleship to give the impression that the church &quot;approve[d] of&quot; the JBS. Eisenhower endorsed Harding&#x27;s criticism of Benson.

===Civil rights movement===
Benson viewed the civil rights movement as having been infiltrated with communists, who were using the movement to steer the United States towards communist policies. In his October 1967 conference address, Benson summed up his oft-repeated views, &quot;Now there is nothing wrong with civil rights; it is what&#x27;s being done in the name of civil rights that is alarming. There is no doubt the so-called civil rights movement as it exists today is used as a Communist program for revolution in America just as agrarian reform was used by the Communists to take over China and Cuba.&quot;

In 1967, Benson asked McKay for permission to speak on &quot;how the Communists are using the Negros to ... foment trouble in the United States&quot;. While McKay allowed Benson to speak on this subject, other church apostles were opposed to Benson&#x27;s positions. (McKay did occasionally take action to limit Benson&#x27;s use of the church to promote the JBS, such as when he deleted a couple of paragraphs from Benson&#x27;s 1965 conference address after a complaint from Brown.) When Joseph Fielding Smith became church president in 1970, Benson was no longer given permission to promote his political opinions.

Also in 1967, Benson gave a talk discussing his views on the civil rights movement at the anti-Communist/segregationist leadership school of Billy James Hargis, who published it in his &quot;Christian Crusade&quot; magazine. Benson approved this talk to be used as the foreword to the book &quot;The Black Hammer: A Study of Black Power, Red Influence and White Alternatives&quot;, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has classified as &quot;racist&quot;. This book features a decapitated and bleeding African-American head, being used at the end of a hammer in the Communist hammer and sickle, illustrating the book&#x27;s theme that the civil rights movement was being used as a tool by communists. Historian D. Michael Quinn speculates that the endorsement of this book by Benson may have been an attempt to curry favor with segregationist George Wallace, who several months later asked Benson to be his vice presidential running mate for his 1968 campaign.

==Church presidency==
Benson succeeded Kimball as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1973, and as church president in 1985. Benson retained Gordon B. Hinckley, who had been Kimball&#x27;s second counselor, as his first counselor and chose Thomas S. Monson as his second counselor. Despite speculation, Benson did not discuss politics during his tenure as president, and instead focused on spiritual messages. During his early years as church president, Benson brought a renewed emphasis to the distribution and reading of the Book of Mormon, reaffirming this LDS scripture&#x27;s importance as &quot;the keystone of [the LDS] religion.&quot; After his challenge to the membership to &quot;flood the earth with the Book of Mormon&quot;, the church sold a record six million copies that year to its membership for distribution. He is also remembered for a general conference sermon condemning pride, which relied heavily upon C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. In the priesthood session of the church&#x27;s April 1988 General Conference, Benson specifically addressed the single adult men of the church, encouraging them to examine their direction in life and align themselves with the priorities of Christian discipleship, including marriage and family responsibilities.

===Scouting===
Benson was a lifelong supporter of Scouting. He started in 1918 as assistant Scoutmaster. On May 23, 1949, he was elected a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America. He received the three highest national awards in the Boy Scouts of Americathe Silver Beaver, the Silver Antelope, and the Silver Buffaloas well as world Scouting&#x27;s international award, the Bronze Wolf.

==Health problems and death==
Benson suffered poor health in the last years of his life from the effects of blood clots in the brain, dementia, strokes, and heart attacks, and was rarely seen publicly in his final years. He was ultimately rendered unable to speak due to the strokes he suffered. One of Benson&#x27;s last appearances during which he spoke was at his 90th birthday celebration in 1989. Benson made his final public appearance at the funeral of his wife Flora in 1992. He was hospitalized in 1993 with pneumonia.

Benson died on May 30, 1994, of congestive heart failure in his Salt Lake City apartment, at age 94. Funeral services were held June 4, 1994, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle and were conducted by Hinckley. Benson was buried near his birthplace in Whitney, Idaho, at the Whitney City Cemetery. Following Benson&#x27;s funeral, Howard W. Hunter succeeded him as church president.

<doc id="393488" wikidata="Q1427551" url="?curid=393488" title="Pentangle (band)">
<text>Pentangle are a British folk rock band, formed in London in 1967. The original band was active in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and a later version has been active since the early 1980s. The original line-up, which was unchanged throughout the band&#x27;s first incarnation (1967–1973), was Jacqui McShee (vocals); John Renbourn (vocals and guitar); Bert Jansch (vocals and guitar); Danny Thompson (double bass); and Terry Cox (drums).

The name &quot;Pentangle&quot; was chosen to represent the five members of the band. It was also the device on shield in the Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, which held a fascination for Renbourn.

In 2007, the original members of the band were reunited to receive a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and to record a short concert that was broadcast on BBC radio. The following June, all five original members began a twelve-date UK tour.

==History==

===Formation===
The original group formed in 1967. Renbourn and Jansch, who shared a house in London in St John&#x27;s Wood, were already musicians on the British folk scene, with several solo albums each and a duet LP, &quot;Bert and John&quot;. 

Jacqui McShee had begun as an unpaid floor singer in several London folk clubs. By 1965 she was running a folk club at the Red Lion in Sutton, Surrey, and established a friendship with Jansch and Renbourn when they played there. She sang on Renbourn&#x27;s &quot;Another Monday&quot; album and performed with him as a duo, debuting at Les Cousins club in August 1966.

Thompson and Cox were jazz musicians and had played together in Alexis Korner&#x27;s band. By 1966, they were both part of Duffy Power&#x27;s Nucleus, a band which also included John McLaughlin on electric guitar. Thompson was known to Renbourn through appearances at Les Cousins and from having worked with him on a project for television.

In 1967, the Scottish entrepreneur Bruce Dunnet, who had recently organised a tour for Jansch, set up a Sunday night club for Jansch and Renbourn at the now defunct Horseshoe Hotel in Tottenham Court Road. London. McShee began joining them as a vocalist, and by March of that year, Thompson and Cox were being billed as part of the band. Renbourn claims to have been the catalyst that brought the band together, although he credits Jansch with the idea of getting the band to play in a regular place, &quot;to knock it into shape&quot;.

While Pentangle was nominally a folk group, the individual members had wide musical tastes and influences. McShee had grounding in traditional music, Cox and Thompson a love of jazz, Renbourn a growing interest in early music, and Jansch a taste for blues and contemporary performers such as Bob Dylan.

===Commercial success===

Pentangle&#x27;s first public concert was a sell-out performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 27 May 1967. Later that year they undertook a short tour of Denmark, in which they were disastrously billed as a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band, and a short UK tour organised by Nathan Joseph of Transatlantic Records. By this stage, their association with Bruce Dunnett had ended, and early in 1968 they acquired a new manager, Jo Lustig. Under his influence, they graduated from performing in clubs to appearing in concert halls, and from then on, as Colin Harper put it, &quot;the ramshackle, happy-go-lucky progress of the Pentangle was going to be a streamlined machine of purpose and efficiency&quot;.

Pentangle signed with Transatlantic Records and their self-named debut LP was released in May 1968. This all-acoustic album was produced by Shel Talmy, who claimed to have used an innovative approach to recording acoustic guitars in order to achieve a bright, bell-like sound. On 29 June of that year, the band performed at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, and recordings from that concert formed part of their second album, &quot;Sweet Child&quot; (released in November 1968), a double LP comprising live and studio recordings.

&quot;Basket of Light&quot;, which followed in mid-1969, was their greatest commercial success, thanks to a surprise hit single, &quot;Light Flight&quot;, which became popular when it was used as theme music for a television series, &quot;Take Three Girls&quot; (the BBC&#x27;s first drama series to be broadcast in colour, for which the band also provided incidental music). The album reached number five in the charts. By 1970, Pentangle were at the peak of their popularity. They recorded a soundtrack for the film &quot;Tam Lin&quot;, made at least 12 television appearances, and undertook tours of the UK, including the Isle of Wight Festival, and America, including a concert at the Carnegie Hall. Their fourth album, &quot;Cruel Sister&quot;, released in October 1970, was an album of traditional songs that included a nearly 19-minute-long version of &quot;Jack Orion&quot;, a song that Jansch and Renbourn had recorded previously as a duo. &quot;Cruel Sister&quot; was a commercial disaster and failed to rise higher than number 51 in the charts.

===Later years of original band===
The band returned to a mix of traditional and original material on the album &quot;Reflection&quot;, recorded in March 1971. It was received without enthusiasm by the music press. By this time the strains of touring and of working together as a band were apparent. Bill Leader, who produced the album, said it seemed that each day a different member of the group decided they were leaving. Pentangle withdrew from Transatlantic in a bitter dispute regarding royalties, Transatlantic having apparently believed that they were within their contractual rights to withhold payments. Joseph pointed out that his company had covered all the costs entailed in making the albums. Jo Lustig, their manager, who had agreed to the Transatlantic contract, made it clear that their contract with him included a clause that they could not sue him &quot;for anything under any circumstances.&quot; In order to make some money out of their work, Pentangle established their own music publishing company, Swiggeroux Music, in 1971.

The final album of the original lineup was &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Seal&quot;, released by Warner Brothers/Reprise in 1972. Its release was accompanied by a UK tour in which Pentangle were supported by Wizz Jones and Clive Palmer&#x27;s band COB. The last few dates of the tour had to be cancelled when Thompson became ill. On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1973, Jansch left the band. &quot;Pentangle Split&quot; was the front-page headline of the first issue of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; of the year.

===Subsequent incarnations===
A reunion of the band was planned in the early 1980s, by which time, Jansch and Renbourn had re-established their solo careers, McShee had a young family, Thompson was mainly doing session work, and Cox was running a restaurant in Minorca. The re-formed Pentangle appeared at the 1982 Cambridge Folk Festival, but without a drummer, as Cox had broken his leg in a road accident. They completed a tour of Italy, Australia and some venues in Germany, with Cox initially performing in a wheelchair.

Renbourn left the band to study classical music at Dartington College of Arts. There followed a series of replacement personnel: Mike Piggott replaced Renbourn in 1982, Nigel Portman Smith replaced Thompson in 1986 and Gerry Conway replaced Cox in 1987, leaving McShee and Jansch the only members remaining from the original line-up. In 1989, Rod Clements of Lindisfarne briefly replaced Piggott, to be replaced by Peter Kirtley the following year. The line-up of Jansch, McShee, Portman Smith, Kirtley and Conway survived almost as long as the original Pentangle and recorded three albums: &quot;Think of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;One More Road&quot; and &quot;Live 1994&quot;. They completed a final tour in March–April 1995, after which Jansch left to pursue solo work, including his residency at the 12 Bar Club in London&#x27;s Denmark Street.

===Jacqui McShee&#x27;s Pentangle===
In 1995 McShee formed a trio, with Conway on percussion and Spencer Cozens on keyboards. Their first album, &quot;About Thyme&quot;, featured Ralph McTell, Albert Lee, Mike Mainieri and John Martyn as guests. &quot;About Thyme&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own label, GJS (Gerry Jacqui Spencer), and reached the top of fRoots magazine&#x27;s British folk chart. Saxophonist Jerry Underwood and bassist/guitarist Alan Thomson were added, and the band, with the agreement of the original members, was renamed Jacqui McShee&#x27;s Pentangle. The first album of the new five-piece band, &quot;Passe Avant,&quot; was released on the Park Records label in 1998. A concert recorded in April 2000 at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, was released by Park Records under the title &quot;At the Little Theatre&quot;.

Saxophonist Jerry Underwood died in 2002 and was replaced in 2004 by flautist/saxophonist Gary Foote. In 2005, the band released an album, &quot;Feoffees&#x27; Lands&quot; (a feoffee being a medieval term for a trustee), on the GJS label. The 2011 &quot;Live In Concert album,&quot; released on GJS Records, featured some of the band&#x27;s best performances in the years between 1997 and 2011. The new 2002 line-up of Jacqui McShee&#x27;s Pentangle continued to perform regularly in the UK.

===Continued interest in the original band===
The new incarnations and personnel changes took the band in various musical directions, but interest in the original Pentangle line-up continued and at least nineteen compilation albums were released between 1972 and 2016, such as &quot;The Time Has Come 1967 – 1973,&quot; a 4-CD collection of rarities, outtakes and live performances issued in 2007, with liner notes written by Colin Harper and Pete Paphides.

In 2004, the &quot;1968–1972 Lost Broadcasts&quot; album was released. Jo Lustig&#x27;s earlier influence had secured numerous radio appearances for the band, including at least eleven broadcasts by the BBC in 1968, and the album was a 2-CD compilation of tracks from these sessions, including a recording of &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, which was used by the BBC as a theme song for some of the Pentangle broadcasts but had never appeared before on record.

The original Pentangle line-up reformed in 2008 and appeared on the BBC TV music programme &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; on 29 April 2008, performing &quot;Let No Man Steal Your Thyme&quot;; and on 2 May 2008, performing &quot;Light Flight&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;. They undertook a UK tour that year which included a performance at the Royal Festival Hall, where they had recorded their &quot;Sweet Child&quot; album forty years earlier, and headlined at the Green Man Festival in Wales in August. A live double-CD album &quot;Finale - An Evening with Pentangle,&quot; containing 21 songs recorded during the 2008 tour, was released by Topic Records in October 2016.

In 2011, the original Pentangle played several concerts, including the Royal Festival Hall, Glastonbury and Cambridge. There were delays in performing together again because Jansch had throat cancer, but they were recording new material. Bert Jansch died of cancer on 5 October 2011, aged 67. John Renbourn was found dead at his home on 26 March 2015 after a suspected heart attack.

Film director Ben Wheatley included Pentangle&#x27;s song &quot;Let No Man Steal Your Thyme&quot; in the 2020 Netflix film, &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

==Style==
Pentangle are often characterised as a folk-rock band, although Danny Thompson preferred to describe the group as a &quot;folk-jazz band.&quot; John Renbourn rejected the &quot;folk-rock&quot; description. He said, &quot;One of the worst things you can do to a folk song is inflict a rock beat on it. . . Most of the old songs that I have heard have their own internal rhythm. When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer.&quot; This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: &quot;Market Song&quot; from &quot;Sweet Child&quot; moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and &quot;Light Flight&quot; from &quot;Basket of Light&quot; includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.

Writing in &quot;The Times,&quot; Henry Raynor struggled to put the band&#x27;s music into a category. &quot;It is not a pop group, not a folk group and not a jazz group. What it attempts is music which is a synthesis of all these and other styles, as well as interesting experiments in each of them individually.&quot; Even Pentangle&#x27;s earliest work is characterised by this synthesis of styles, and songs such as &quot;Bruton Town&quot; and &quot;Let No Man Steal Your Thyme&quot; from 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Pentangle&quot; include elements of folk, jazz, blues and early music. Pete Townshend described their sound as &quot;fresh and innovative&quot;. By the time they released their fourth album, &quot;Cruel Sister&quot;, in 1970, Pentangle had reverted to traditional folk music and had begun to use electric guitars. Folk music in Britain had moved towards a rock sound and the use of electrified instruments, and &quot;Cruel Sister&quot; invited comparison with such works as Fairport Convention&#x27;s &quot;Liege and Lief&quot; and Steeleye Span&#x27;s &quot;Hark! The Village Wait,&quot; which caused Pentangle to be referred to as one of the progenitors of British folk rock.

In their final two albums Pentangle returned to their folk-jazz roots, but by then the genre&#x27;s musical tastes had moved to British folk rock. Colin Harper commented that Pentangle&#x27;s &quot;increasingly fragile music was on borrowed time, and everyone knew it.&quot;

==Awards==
In January 2007, the five original members of Pentangle were presented with a Lifetime Achievement award by Sir David Attenborough at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Producer John Leonard said Pentangle had been one of the most influential groups of the late 20th century, and it would be wrong not to acknowledge the contribution they had made to music. The group played together at the event for the first time in over 20 years. Their performance was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on Wednesday 7 February 2007.

<text>The City and the Pillar is the third published novel by American writer Gore Vidal, written in 1946 and published on January 10, 1948. The story is about a young man who is coming of age and discovers his own homosexuality.

&quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; is significant because it is recognized as the first post-World War II novel whose gay protagonist is portrayed in a sympathetic manner and is not killed off at the end of the story for defying social norms. It is also recognized as one of the &quot;definitive war-influenced gay novels&quot;, being one of the few books of its period dealing directly with male homosexuality. In addition, it was among the few gay novels reprinted in inexpensive paperback form as early as the 1950s.

In 1965, Vidal released an updated version of the novel titled &quot;The City and the Pillar Revised.&quot; Most modern printings contain the updated text; however, they retain the original title &quot;The City and the Pillar.&quot;

== Plot summary ==

The plot centers on Jim Willard, a handsome youth in Virginia in the late 1930s, who is also a very good tennis player. When his best friend Bob Ford, one year his senior, is about to leave high school, the two take a camping trip into the woods. Both are elated to be in each other&#x27;s company and, after some moaning from Bob about how difficult it is to get the local girls to have sex with him, the two have sex, even though Bob thinks this is not a &quot;normal&quot; thing for two men to do.

Jim, who does not find girls so appealing, hopes Bob can stay and is crushed when Bob is insistent on joining the United States Merchant Marine. The next seven years of Jim&#x27;s life will be an odyssey, at the end of which he hopes to be happily reunited with Bob.

Jim decides he wants to go to sea too and becomes a cabin boy on a cruise ship after going to New York City to look for work. Another seaman on his ship, Collins, goes out with him in Seattle, but is more interested in a double date with two girls than in sex with Jim. The date is a disaster for Jim, who must realize that he is unable to drink enough to overcome being repelled by the female body. When he finally storms out, Collins calls him a queer, which causes him to think about this possibility.

He quits his job, fearing another confrontation with Collins, and becomes a tennis instructor at a hotel in Los Angeles. One of the bellboys, Leaper, whose advances he has spurned previously, introduces him to the circle around the mid-thirties Hollywood actor Ronald Shaw, who immediately takes interest in Jim. Eventually, Jim moves in with Ronald, even though he is not really in love with him.

Their affair is ended when Jim meets the writer Paul Sullivan, who is in his late twenties, at a party. Jim is drawn to Paul because he seems so different from the other, more stereotypical homosexuals he meets at Hollywood parties, even having married once (although that marriage was later annulled).

When Ronald learns of their relationship, Jim is quite happy to move with Paul to New Orleans. Again, he is not in love with Paul but with his boyhood pal, but he considers Paul adequate for the time being. Paul however, needing some pain in his relationships for artistic inspiration, introduces Jim to Maria Verlaine, who seems to specialize in seducing homosexuals, hoping his relationship will end in a suitably tragic way. Together, the three go to Yucatán, where Maria has made an inheritance. Jim does feel vaguely attracted to Maria, but he is unable to perform sexually. All the same, for Paul even an imagined affair of his boyfriend with a woman is as painful as he had hoped and warrants a breakup.

In the meantime, World War II has started in Europe and Paul and Jim are determined to go to New York to enlist in the Army. This of course also means their separation. Jim gets transferred to a Colorado Air Force base, where his sergeant is clearly sexually interested in him. But Jim has set his sights on a young corporal. Unfortunately, the corporal does not seem to like him in &quot;that&quot; way, even though the sergeant later seems to succeed with the corporal.

Due to the cold Colorado weather, Jim contracts rheumatoid arthritis and is eventually discharged from service. He goes back to New York, where he meets Maria and Ronald again. Ronald has been forced to marry a lesbian by studio executives to uphold his public image and tries unsuccessfully to become a stage actor. He also introduces Jim to his local friends like an effeminate millionaire. Jim begins frequenting gay bars to find sexual relief. Later, he meets Paul at a party and the two start an open relationship, not because of passion, but out of loneliness.

When Jim finally goes home for Christmas, he learns that his father is dead and (more alarming to him) that Bob has married. Hoping their affair can resume despite this, Jim is anxious to see him again.

The resolution of their relationship comes again in New York, where they end up on the bed in Bob&#x27;s hotel room. But when Jim finally thinks he has attained what he wants and moves closer, grabbing his &quot;sex&quot;, Bob panics, is outraged to be thought of as gay, and even punches Jim in the face. The two struggle and Jim wins because he is stronger. In the original version, Jim is infuriated enough to murder Bob while in the revision he rapes Bob and then leaves the room.

==Major themes==
The major theme of the novel is how prejudice creates the object of its own hatred, and in the process damages not only the oppressed, but also society at large. The protagonist is a potentially well adjusted individual who is forced, by society&#x27;s neurotic attitude to sex in general and to sex between men in particular, into a pattern of behaviors that precludes happiness or fulfillment, and eventually leads to a destructive denouement. The origin of society&#x27;s perverse attitude to sex is subtly traced to religion (both by the epigraph opening the novel, which is the end of the biblical passage describing the destruction of Sodom, and by remarks scattered in the narrative by different characters, who voice Vidal&#x27;s idea that humans are naturally bisexual, and this natural inclination is perverted by cultural superstructures).

Another theme is the portrayal of the homosexual man as masculine. Vidal set out to break the mould of novels that up until &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; depicted homosexuals as transvestites, lonely bookish boys, or feminine. Vidal purposefully makes his protagonist a strong athlete to challenge superstitions, stereotypes, and prejudices about sex in the United States. To further this theme Vidal wrote the novel in plain, objective prose in order to convey and document reality.

Two additional themes identified by Dennis Bolin are the foolishness and destructiveness of wishing for something that can never be and to waste one&#x27;s life dwelling on the past, the second of which is reinforced by the novel&#x27;s epigraph from the Book of Genesis 19:26 &quot;But his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt.&quot;

==Reception and critical analysis==
&quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; sparked a public scandal, including notoriety and criticism, not only since it was released at a time when homosexuality was commonly considered immoral, but also because it was the first book by an accepted American author to portray overt homosexuality as a natural behavior. The controversial reception began before the novel hit bookshelves. Prior to its even being published, an editor at EP Dutton said to Vidal, &quot;You will never be forgiven for this book. Twenty years from now you will still be attacked for it.&quot; Looking back in retrospect from 2009, it is considered by Ian Young to be &quot;perhaps the most notorious of the gay novels of the 1940s and 1950s.&quot;

Vidal himself said &quot;shock was the most pleasant emotion aroused in the press.&quot; Upon its release &quot;The New York Times&quot; would not advertise the novel. Vidal was blacklisted after releasing &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; to the extent that no major newspaper or magazine would review any of his novels for six years. This forced Vidal to write several subsequent books under pseudonyms. Subsequently, he reestablished a popular reputation and resumed using his true name.

At the time, Christopher Isherwood privately responded to the novel enthusiastically, whereas Thomas Mann, a Nobel Prize Laureate, privately responded with short politeness but called the novel a “noble work.” Stephen Spender expressed the notion that the novel was plainly autobiographical and a sexual confession on Vidal&#x27;s part; this has been denied by Vidal. However, all three authors were gay themselves.

Modern scholars note the importance of the novel to the visibility of gay literature. Michael Bronski points out that &quot;gay-male-themed books received greater critical attention than lesbian ones&quot; and that &quot;writers such as Gore Vidal were accepted as important American writers, even when they received attacks from homophobic critics.&quot; Bronski also suggests that the mantle of &quot;literary quality&quot; conferred some level of protection from censorship upon the works. Ian Young notes that social disruptions of World War II changed public morals and enumerates &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; among a spate of war novels that use the military as backdrop for overt homosexual behavior. The book has, however, faced criticism from some contemporary gay theorists, who consider the novel&#x27;s emphasis on masculinity and its explicit put-downs of effeminate and gender-deviant gay men to be heteronormative.

The book sold well, enjoying several paperback reprint editions; the 1950 Signet edition features a cover painting by the notable artist James Avati. &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; is considered by Anthony Slide to be one of only four familiar gay novels of the first half of the twentieth century in English. The other three novels are Djuna Barnes&#x27; &quot;Nightwood&quot;, Carson McCullers&#x27; &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, and Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;. &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; was ranked number 17 on a list of the best 100 gay and lesbian novels compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999.

==&quot;The City and the Pillar Revised&quot;==
In 1965, E.P. Dutton published Vidal&#x27;s updated version of &quot;The City and the Pillar,&quot; titled &quot;The City and the Pillar Revised.&quot;

In this version, Vidal removed melodramatic narrative, passages of introspection, and politically offensive language and strove to clarify the intended theme of the work. The original edition was divided into two sections: &quot;The City&quot; and &quot;The Pillar&quot;; in the revised edition the narrative is continuous. Vidal also significantly changed the storyline in the coda so that Jim rapes Bob instead of murdering him. It is commonly believed that the publishers of &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; (in its original form) coerced Gore to give the original a cautionary ending, but Gore specifically denied this.

==Derivative works==

Vidal said in a 2006 NPR interview that parts of the dynamic of &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; were softened for the public and applied to the script for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; which Vidal and others were called in to re-work.

== Featured in media ==
In the 2022 homoerotic film &quot;Dino at the Beach&quot; which takes place in the 1960s, the main character is reading a 1950s paperback printing of the novel. The placement of the book contributes largely to the themes of discovering one&#x27;s own homosexuality in the film.

<text>William David Friedkin (; August 29, 1935 – August 7, 2023) was an American film, television and opera director, producer, and screenwriter who was closely identified with the &quot;New Hollywood&quot; movement of the 1970s. Beginning his career in documentaries in the early 1960s, he is best known for his crime thriller film &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and the horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), which earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Director.

Friedkin&#x27;s other films in the 1970s and 1980s include the drama &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; (1970), considered a milestone of queer cinema; the originally deprecated, now lauded thriller &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977); the crime comedy drama &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978); the controversial thriller &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980); and the neo-noir thriller &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; (1985). Although Friedkin&#x27;s works suffered an overall commercial and critical decline in the late 1980s, his last three feature films, all based on plays, were positively received by critics: the psychological horror film &quot;Bug&quot; (2006), the crime film &quot;Killer Joe&quot; (2011), and the legal drama film &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot; (2023), released two months after his death. He also worked extensively as an opera director from 1998 until his death, and directed various television films and series episodes for television.

==Early life and education ==
Friedkin was born in Chicago, Illinois, on August 29, 1935, the son of Rachael (née Green) and Louis Friedkin. His father was a semi-professional softball player, merchant seaman, and men&#x27;s clothing salesman. His mother, whom Friedkin called &quot;a saint,&quot; was a nurse. His parents were Jewish emigrants from Ukraine, in the Russian empire. His grandparents, parents, and other relatives fled Russia during a particularly violent anti-Jewish pogrom in 1903. Friedkin&#x27;s father was somewhat uninterested in making money, and the family was generally lower middle class while he was growing up. According to film historian Peter Biskind, &quot;Friedkin viewed his father with a mixture of affection and contempt for not making more of himself.&quot;

After attending public schools in Chicago, Friedkin enrolled at Senn High School, where he played basketball well enough to consider turning professional. He was not a serious student and barely received grades good enough to graduate, which he did at the age of 16. He said this was because of social promotion and not because he was bright.

Friedkin began going to movies as a teenager, and cited &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as one of his key influences. Several sources claim that Friedkin saw this motion picture as a teenager, but Friedkin himself said that he did not see the film until 1960, when he was 25 years old. Only then, Friedkin said, did he become a true cineaste. Among the movies that he also saw as a teenager and young adult were &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;, &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; (which many consider he remade as &quot;Sorcerer&quot;), and &quot;Psycho&quot; (which he viewed repeatedly, like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;). Televised documentaries such as 1960&#x27;s &quot;Harvest of Shame&quot; were also important to his developing sense of cinema.

Friedkin began working in the mail room at WGN-TV immediately after high school. Within two years (at the age of 18), he started his directorial career doing live television shows and documentaries. His efforts included &quot;The People vs. Paul Crump&quot; (1962), which won an award at the San Francisco International Film Festival and contributed to the commutation of Crump&#x27;s death sentence. Its success helped Friedkin get a job with producer David L. Wolper. He also made the football-themed documentary &quot;Mayhem on a Sunday Afternoon&quot; (1965).

==Career==
=== 1965–1979 ===
As mentioned in his voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;, Friedkin directed one of the last episodes of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; in 1965, called &quot;Off Season&quot;. Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.

In 1965, Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, &quot;Good Times&quot; starring Sonny and Cher. He has referred to the film as &quot;unwatchable&quot;. Several other films followed: &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play; the musical comedy &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot;, starring Jason Robards and Britt Ekland; and the adaptation of Mart Crowley&#x27;s play &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;.
His next film, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, was released to wide critical acclaim in 1971. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin&#x27;s next film was 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, based on William Peter Blatty&#x27;s best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won for Best Screenplay and Best Sound. Following these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood. In 1973, the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount Pictures, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Bogdanovich, the Henry James adaptation, &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;, Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount.

Friedkin&#x27;s later movies did not achieve the same success. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977), a $22 million American remake of the French classic &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;, co-produced by both Universal and Paramount, starring Roy Scheider, was overshadowed by the blockbuster box-office success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which had been released exactly one week prior. Friedkin considered it his finest film, and was personally devastated by its financial and critical failure (as mentioned by Friedkin himself in the 1999 documentary series &quot;The Directors&quot;). &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was shortly followed by the crime-comedy &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978), based on the real-life Great Brink&#x27;s Robbery in Boston, Massachusetts, which was also unsuccessful at the box-office.

=== 1980–1999 ===
In 1980, Friedkin directed an adaptation of the Gerald Walker crime thriller &quot;Cruising&quot;, starring Al Pacino, which was protested during production and remains the subject of heated debate. It was critically assailed but performed moderately at the box office.

Friedkin had a heart attack on March 6, 1981, due to a genetic defect in his circumflex left coronary artery, and nearly died. He spent months in rehabilitation. His next picture was 1983&#x27;s &quot;Deal of the Century&quot;, a satire about arms dealing starring Chevy Chase, Gregory Hines, and Sigourney Weaver.

In 1985, Friedkin directed the music video for Barbra Streisand&#x27;s rendition of the &quot;West Side Story&quot; song &quot;Somewhere&quot;, which she recorded for her twenty-fourth studio LP, &quot;The Broadway Album&quot;. He later appears as Streisand&#x27;s interviewer (uncredited) on the television special, &quot;Putting It Together: The Making of the Broadway Album&quot;.

The action/crime movie &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin&#x27;s own &quot;The French Connection&quot; (particularly for its car chase sequence), while his courtroom drama/thriller &quot;Rampage&quot; (1987) received a fairly positive review from Roger Ebert. He next directed the cult classic horror film &quot;The Guardian&quot; (1990) and the thriller &quot;Jade&quot; (1995), starring Linda Fiorentino. Though the latter received an unfavorable response from critics and audiences, he said it was one of the favorite films he directed.

=== 2000–2023 ===

In 2000, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was re-released in theaters with extra footage and grossed $40 million in the U.S. alone. Friedkin directed the 2006 film &quot;Bug&quot; due to a positive experience watching the stage version in 2004. He was surprised to find that he was, metaphorically, on the same page as the playwright and felt that he could relate well to the story. The film won the FIPRESCI prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Later, Friedkin directed an episode of the TV series &quot;&quot; titled &quot;Cockroaches&quot;, which re-teamed him with &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; star William Petersen. He directed again for &quot;CSI&quot;″s 200th episode, &quot;Mascara&quot;.

In 2011, Friedkin directed &quot;Killer Joe&quot;, a black comedy written by Tracy Letts based on Letts&#x27; play, and starring Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Gina Gershon, and Thomas Haden Church. &quot;Killer Joe&quot; premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. It opened in U.S. theaters in July 2012, to some favorable reviews from critics but did poorly at the box office, possibly because of its restrictive NC-17 rating. In April 2013, Friedkin published a memoir, &quot;The Friedkin Connection&quot;. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in September. In 2017, Friedkin directed the documentary &quot;The Devil and Father Amorth&quot; about the ninth exorcism of a woman in the Italian village of Alatri. In August 2022, it was announced officially that Friedkin would be returning to film directing to helm an adaptation of the two-act play &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot; with Kiefer Sutherland starring as Lt. Commander Queeg. The film was completed before Friedkin&#x27;s death, and debuted in September 2023 in the out-of-competition category at the Venice Film Festival.

==Influences==
Friedkin cited Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, François Truffaut, and Akira Kurosawa as influences. Friedkin named Woody Allen as &quot;the greatest living filmmaker&quot;.

In regard to influences of specific films on his films, Friedkin noted that &quot;The French Connection&quot;[&#x27;s] documentary-like realism was the direct result of the influence of having seen &quot;Z&quot;, a French film by Costa-Gavras:

==Personal life==

Friedkin was married four times:
* Jeanne Moreau, married February 8, 1977, and divorced in 1979.
* Lesley-Anne Down, married in 1982 and divorced in 1985.
* Kelly Lange, married on June 7, 1987, and divorced in 1990.
* Sherry Lansing, married on July 6, 1991.

While filming &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot; in 1970, Friedkin began a relationship with Kitty Hawks, daughter of director Howard Hawks. It lasted two years, during which the couple announced their engagement, but the relationship ended about 1972. Friedkin began a four-year relationship with Australian dancer and choreographer Jennifer Nairn-Smith in 1972. Although they announced an engagement twice, they never married. They had a son, Cedric, on November 27, 1976. Friedkin and his second wife, Lesley-Anne Down, also had a son, Jack, born in 1982. Friedkin was raised Jewish, but called himself an agnostic later in life, although he said that he strongly believed in the teachings of Jesus Christ.

==Death==
Friedkin died from heart failure and pneumonia at his home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on August 7, 2023.

An LA Opera production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; was announced by Friedkin, but a spokesperson revealed it had been delayed indefinitely. Friedkin had also been set to direct the premiere of an opera titled &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; to debut in 2011, but he later departed from it when creative differences arose between him and the librettist. In 2013, it was reported that he would helm a stage production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (which he had already directed as a feature film in 1968), for Geffen Playhouse. A cast including Katie Amess, Frances Barber, Steven Berkoff, Tim Roth and Nick Ullett was assembled, but the production was soon postponed for an unknown reason, and never revived.

<text>Alan Eaton Davidson CMG (30 March 1924 – 2 December 2003) was a British diplomat and writer best known for his writing and editing on food and gastronomy.

After leaving Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1948, Davidson joined the British diplomatic service, rising through the ranks to conclude his career as ambassador to Laos, from 1973 to 1975. He retired early and devoted himself to full-time writing about food, encouraged by Elizabeth David and others. He published more than a dozen books between his retirement and 2002, but his &quot;magnum opus&quot; was &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, a work of more than a million words, which took twenty years to complete and was published to international acclaim in 1999.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Davidson was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, the son of William John Davidson (1899–1959), inspector of taxes, and his wife, Constance, &quot;née&quot; Eaton (1889–1974). He was brought up in Leeds in the north-east of England, where he attended Leeds Grammar School. His higher education was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an ordinary seaman and saw wartime and post-war service in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Pacific, ending the war as a commissioned officer. In 1946 he returned to England to complete his interrupted education at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he took a double first in classical moderations and Greats in 1948.

===Foreign Office===
From Oxford, Davidson joined the Foreign Office and between 1948 and 1973 he served in diplomatic posts in Washington, The Hague, Cairo and Tunis, headed two Foreign Office departments in London, and served as head of chancery in the British delegation to NATO in Brussels. In 1951 he married Jane Macatee. There were three daughters of the marriage.

Davidson concluded his Foreign Office career as British ambassador to Laos, 1973–1975. A colleague later said of this posting:

Davidson took early retirement from the diplomatic service at the age of 51 in 1975.

===Food writer===
While the Davidsons were living in Tunis, Jane asked her husband to look for a cookery book on fish because she did not recognise any of the local varieties and was unsure how they should be cooked. Not being able to find one he wrote one himself: &quot;Seafish of Tunisia and the Central Mediterranean&quot; &quot;a handbook giving the names of 144 species in 5 languages, with a list of molluscs, crustaceans, and other marine creatures, and notes on cooking&quot;. It was a 126-page tract produced on a stencil duplicator and published in 1963. The British cooking guru Elizabeth David gave it a good review in &quot;The Spectator&quot; and introduced Davidson to Jill Norman, her editor at Penguin Books; in 1972 Penguin published his &quot;Mediterranean Seafood&quot;, described by his biographer Paul Levy as &quot;a revolutionary combination of scientific taxonomy along with the vernacular names of the fish, visual illustrations of them, and recipes for cooking them&quot;. Within four years the book had become &quot;a classic&quot;, according to &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;a masterly combination of reference book and cook book with a beautifully illustrated and annotated catalogue of fish, plus a collection of remarkable recipes&quot;. Further books on the same lines followed, much of the information in them supplied by Davidson&#x27;s diplomatic contacts: &quot;Fish and Fish Dishes of Laos&quot; (1975), &quot;Seafood of South-East Asia&quot; (1976), and &quot;North Atlantic Seafood&quot; (1979), all of which went through several editions.

In 1978 Davidson contracted with Oxford University Press to write what Levy calls his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;: &quot;the house became a research centre, with the two basement rooms stacked floor-to-ceiling with cookery books and reference works in all of the several languages he, Jane, or their daughters could read&quot;. The same year the Davidsons edited and translated a 320-page selection from &quot;Le grand dictionnaire de cuisine&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, published as &quot;Dumas on Food&quot;.

In 1979 Davidson and his wife set up a publishing company, Prospect Books, to reprint rare cookery books. They also started a magazine, &quot;Petits Propos Culinaires&quot; &quot;the first serious periodical dealing with food history&quot; (Levy). In the same year Davidson was Alistair Horne Research Fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford. He convened a symposium on food history, in partnership with Theodore Zeldin, which grew into an annual event known since 1981 as the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery.

The Oxford Companion took Davidson twenty years to complete. It ran to a million words on 892 pages. There were contributions from more than fifty writers, but most of the book was written by Davidson. Elizabeth David, like the Davidsons, lived in Chelsea, and she made her extensive library available to him. Through her he met her favoured specialist booksellers in London and New York who helped him add to his knowledge. When the Companion was published in 1999 &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;The publishing event of the year, if not the decade&quot;, and &quot;The New Statesman&quot; said, &quot;… the best food reference work ever to appear in the English language … read it and be dazzled.&quot;

Davidson died on 2 December 2003 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, of heart failure, aged 79; he was survived by his wife and their three daughters.

==Recognition==
Davidson accepted the award of the CMG on his retirement, but later regretted it, deleted mention of it from his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry and refused further offers of official government recognition. In 2003 he received the Erasmus Prize from Queen Beatrix in Amsterdam in recognition of his establishing the Oxford symposium on food and cookery and writing the Oxford Companion.

In March 2010 BBC Four broadcast a television documentary called &quot;The Man Who Ate Everything&quot;, a portrait of Alan Davidson by Andrew Graham-Dixon.

<text>The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle, also known as The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, is a 1980 British mockumentary film directed by Julien Temple and produced by Don Boyd and Jeremy Thomas. It centres on the British punk rock band Sex Pistols and, most prominently, their manager Malcolm McLaren.

==Plot==
Guitarist Steve Jones plays a shady Private detective who through a series of set piece acts uncovers the truth about the band. Drummer Paul Cook and bass guitarist Sid Vicious play smaller roles, and the band&#x27;s manager, Malcolm McLaren, is featured as &quot;The Embezzler&quot;, the man who manipulates the Sex Pistols. Fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs, performer Edward Tudor-Pole, sex film star Mary Millington, and actresses Irene Handl and Liz Fraser also make appearances. Singer and frontman Johnny Rotten refused to have anything to do with the film, stating that it was &quot;a pile of rubbish&quot; and &quot;Malcolm&#x27;s vision of what he believed; not true in any form&quot;.

The movie tells a stylised fictional account of the formation, rise and subsequent break-up of the band, from the point of view of their then manager, McLaren. In the film McLaren claims to have created the Sex Pistols (in truth, they were already formed, and Jones and Cook asked him to be their manager), and manipulated them to the top of the music business, using them as puppets to both further his own agenda (in his own words: &quot;Cash from chaos&quot;), and to claim the financial rewards from the various record labels the band were signed to during their brief existence as EMI, A&amp;M, Virgin, and Warner Bros. Records.

==Background==
The title of the movie was inspired by an article written by Skiffle musician Lonnie Donegan in the 1950s titled &quot;Rock and Roll – It&#x27;s a Swindle&quot;. A copy of the article resides in the Jamie Reid archive at the V&amp;A.

The footage was filmed in early to mid-1978, between the departure of singer John Lydon from the band and their subsequent split. The movie was finally released nearly two years later. Lydon (who was listed in the credits as &quot;The Collaborator&quot;) and original bass guitarist Glen Matlock only appear in archive footage — Lydon refused to have anything to do with the production.

The film was shown at the wake of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis after his 1980 suicide.

The 2000 documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, also directed by Julien Temple, re-tells the story of the Sex Pistols from the perspective of the band, thus serving as a response to and rebuttal of McLaren&#x27;s insistence that he was the driving creative force of the band.

==Home media releases==
&quot;The Swindle Continues in Your Own Home&quot; was the tagline on the original 18 certificate UK VHS release from Virgin Video in 1982. Warner/Reprise Video released the film on US home video in 1992. In 2005, the film was released on DVD by Shout Factory.

<text>Ringwood is a market town in south-west Hampshire, England, on the River Avon close to the New Forest, northeast of Bournemouth and southwest of Southampton. It was founded by the Anglo-Saxons, and has held a weekly market since the Middle Ages.

==History==
Ringwood is recorded in a charter of 961, in which King Edgar gave 22 hides of land in &quot;Rimecuda&quot; to Abingdon Abbey. The name is also recorded in the 10th century as &quot;Runcwuda&quot; and &quot;Rimucwuda&quot;. The second element &quot;wuda&quot; means a &#x27;wood&#x27;; &quot;rimuc&quot; may be derived from &quot;rima&quot; meaning &#x27;border&#x27; or &#x27;rim&#x27;, hence &quot;border wood&quot;. The name may refer to Ringwood&#x27;s position on the fringe of Ringwood Forest, or on the border of Hampshire. William Camden in 1607 gave a much more fanciful derivation, claiming that the original name was Regne-wood, the &quot;Regni&quot; being an ancient people of Britain.

In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, Ringwood (&quot;Rincvede&quot;) had been appropriated by the Crown and all but six hides taken into the New Forest. Prior to 1066 Ringwood had been held by Earl Tostig. During the 12th and early 13th centuries Ringwood, like other manors of which John and Henry III had the immediate overlordship, frequently changed hands. Thus it was held by Roland de Dinan, a Breton lord, in 1167; Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester before 1204; Theodoric the Teuton, a servant of King John, after 1204; William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, in 1217, and intermittently by the third and fourth Earls up to 1237; Simon de Steyland, the King&#x27;s clerk, around 1237; John son of Geoffrey, described as &quot;of the lands of the Bretons&quot;, from 1240; Nicholas of Ely, Bishop of Winchester, from about 1272; and then by three successive queens: Queen Eleanor, Queen Margaret, and Queen Isabella, from 1280 until 1331.

In January 1331, Ringwood and other manors which Isabella had previously surrendered were granted to William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, whose descendants with some intermission held it for more than two centuries, until the death of Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury in 1541. It was held by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset until his execution in 1552, and then briefly by John Gates who was executed in 1553. Queen Mary granted the lands to Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, but by the middle of the 17th century the manor had passed to the Arundells of Wardour, and in 1728 was in the hands of Henry Arundell, 6th Baron Arundell of Wardour. His grandson, the eighth Baron, sold it in 1794 to John Morant of Brockenhurst, and the Morant family held the manor throughout the 19th century.

In 1108, it was recorded that the tenants of the &quot;manor of Ringwood and Harbridge&quot; had common rights in the New Forest, among the knights and esquires, for their farm beasts and plough beasts between &quot;Teg att Brokelisford&quot; and &quot;Ostaven&quot; and in the vill of Beaulieu for all their livestock except goats and geese: for this they paid the King an annual agistment. A valuation of the manor made at the end of the 13th century records the tenants services included mowing the lord&#x27;s meadow, haymaking on eight acres in &quot;Muchelmershe,&quot; carting the hay and making a rick; they were to repair the mills and the houses within the court.

A mill in Ringwood is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; and later there were two. In March 1226 Henry III granted a weekly market in Ringwood on Wednesdays to Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke and Gervaise his wife to hold until the King should come of age. In 1337 the Earl of Salisbury, as lord of Ringwood Manor, was granted a yearly fair on the feast-day of Saint Andrew (30 November). There was also another fair held on the feast of Saint Peter (29 June) in the 16th century.

After the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth was arrested near Horton, Dorset. Monmouth is believed to have hidden in a ditch under an ash tree disguised as a shepherd, but was betrayed by a local woman who, according to legend, later killed herself in remorse. Monmouth was then taken to the house now named Monmouth House in West Street (between the Market Place and the Fish Inn). It was there that he wrote a letter to James II begging forgiveness. This was not granted, and he was brought to trial in the Tower of London by the infamous &quot;Hanging Judge Jefferies&quot;.

Also after the Battle of Sedgemoor, an elderly local lady, Alice Lisle, gave refuge to two wanted men who were escaping the battle. When her home, Moyles Court, (now a private school — Moyles Court School) was raided, the men were found and Alice was arrested. She was sentenced by the same Judge Jefferies to be burned at the stake; she received a late reprieve, and the sentence was reduced to beheading. She is buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ellingham, one mile from her Moyles Court home. Her tomb can be found to the right of the church entrance; it is easily spotted as the lid has been left unfinished with rough edges. There is now a pub called the Alice Lisle near Moyles Court.

The Town Hall was erected by John Morant in 1868 to designs by the distinguished architect, future president of the Royal Institute of British Architects and future winner of the Royal Gold Medal; Thomas Henry Wyatt. The town was famous in the 19th century for its &quot;Ringwood&quot; woollen gloves, and there was also a large linen collar and cuff factory here.

The site of Royal Air Force Station Ibsley, in use during World War II, is located on the outskirts of the Ringwood hamlet of Poulner. This site has later been used for motor-racing as Ibsley Circuit and today is a quarry lake area.

<doc id="393509" wikidata="Q1388579" url="?curid=393509" title="FIGlet">
<text>FIGlet is a computer program that generates text banners, in a variety of typefaces, composed of letters made up of conglomerations of smaller ASCII characters (see ASCII art). The name derives from &quot;Frank, Ian and Glenn&#x27;s letters&quot;.

Being free software, FIGlet is commonly included as part of many Unix-like operating systems (Linux, BSD, etc.) distributions, but it has been ported to other platforms as well. The official FIGlet FTP site includes precompiled ports for the Acorn, Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, BeOS, Mac, MS-DOS, NeXTSTEP, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, as well as a reimplementation in Perl (Text::FIGlet). There are third-party reimplementations of FIGlet in Java (including one embedded in the JavE ASCII art editor), JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Go.

==Behavior==
FIGlet can read from standard input or accept a message as part of the command line. It prints to standard output. Some common arguments (options) are:
* codice_1 to select a font file. (font files are available here)
* codice_2 to change the directory for fonts.
* codice_3 centers the output.
* codice_4 left-aligns the output.
* codice_5 right-aligns the output.
* codice_6 sets the output width to the terminal width.
* codice_7 specifies a custom output width.
* codice_8 enables kerning, printing each letter of the message individually, instead of merged into the adjacent letters.

==Sample usage==
An example of output generated by FIGlet is shown below.

[user@hostname ~]$ figlet 7MO

__ ___ _ _ _ _ 
\ \ / (_) | _(_)_ __ ___ __| (_) __ _ 
 \ \ /\ / /| | |/ / | &#x27;_ \ / _ \/ _` | |/ _` |
 \ V V / | | &lt;| | |_) | __/ (_| | | (_| |
 \_/\_/ |_|_|\_\_| .__/ \___|\__,_|_|\__,_|
 |_| 
The following command:
[user@hostname ~]$ figlet -ct -f roman Wikipedia
generates this output:

The codice_9 options centers the text and makes it take up the full width of the terminal. The codice_10 option specifies the &#x27;roman&#x27; font file.

==Font examples==
===Invita===
===Banner (same as banner utility)===
===Larry3d===
==FIGlet-based ASCII typefaces==
Eric Olson&#x27;s 2002 FIG typeface family is a series of OpenType fonts similar to the output of FIGlet.

TOIlet seeks to extend FIGlet to use colour text. FIGlet supports TOIlet fonts as of version 2.2.4.

<text>Stoke Mandeville Hospital is a large National Health Service (NHS) hospital located on the parish borders of Aylesbury and Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, England. It is managed by Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. 

It was established in 1830 as a cholera hospital intentionally on the parish border between the neighbouring village of Stoke Mandeville and the town of Aylesbury to serve the residents of both settlements.

The hospital&#x27;s National Spinal Injuries Centre is one of the largest specialist spinal units in the world, and the pioneering rehabilitation work carried out there by Sir Ludwig Guttmann, specifically the therapeutic use of competitive sport, led to the development of the Stoke Mandeville Games in 1948, the International Stoke Mandeville Games (now the World Abilitysport Games) in 1952, which in 1960 in Rome in turn became the Paralympic Games. 

==History==
===Foundation and growth===
In the early 1830s the village of Stoke Mandeville was badly affected by cholera epidemics that swept across England. A cholera hospital was established on the parish border between Stoke Mandeville and Aylesbury.

In September 1943 the government asked German-expatriate spinal injuries specialist Ludwig Guttmann to establish the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The centre opened on 1 February 1944, and Guttmann was appointed its director (a position he held until 1946). As director of the UK&#x27;s first specialist unit for treating spinal injuries, he believed that sport was a major method of therapy for injured military personnel helping them build up physical strength and self-respect. Guttmann became a naturalised citizen of the United Kingdom in 1945. Guttmann organised the first Stoke Mandeville Games for disabled personnel on 28 July 1948, the same day as the start of the London 1948 Summer Olympics.

The games were held again at the same location in 1952, and Dutch World War II veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its kind. These Stoke Mandeville Games have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games. The Paralympics were subsequently officialised as a quadrennial event tied to the Olympic Games, and the first Paralympic Games, no longer open solely to war veterans, were held in Rome in 1960.

===Recent history===
After the hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948, it sought to establish the Stoke Mandeville Stadium which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1969.

The hospital was visited by Diana, Princess of Wales who opened the new International Spinal Injuries Centre when it was refurbished in August 1983.

A redevelopment scheme over much of the site was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2004. The construction work was carried out by Alfred McAlpine at a cost of £47 million and completed in 2006. Sodexo was contracted to carry out the facilities management services on the site. A new maternity unit was opened in 2009.

Mandeville, one of the official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, was named in honour of the hospital&#x27;s contribution to Paralympic sports.

==Historic sexual abuse at the hospital==
The joint Metropolitan Police Service and National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children report of the investigations into sexual abuse committed by disc jockey Jimmy Savile found that Savile, who was a valued fundraiser for the institution (including raising money for the Spinal Injuries Unit), committed offences there between 1965 and 1988. Twenty-two offences there between those dates have been formally recorded as crimes by the police. A former child patient at the hospital has said that nurses warned her to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when Savile was due to visit.

Michael Salmon, consultant paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville hospital, was convicted and jailed for three years in 1990 for indecent assaults on teenaged girl patients, two thirteen-year-olds and one sixteen-year-old girl. In the aftermath of the Savile scandal, Salmon was also arrested as part of Operation Yewtree on 17 December 2013. He was subsequently convicted of nine indecent assaults and two rapes, with victims&#x27; ages ranging from eleven to eighteen and having occurred between 1973 and 1988 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Despite working at the hospital at the same time as Savile, there is no known link between the two. Salmon was also convicted of 14 charges in December 2016 and received an additional sentence of four years in prison.

Independent investigator Androulla Johnstone published a report on Savile&#x27;s activities at the hospital on 26 February 2015. The report found that he had sexually abused more than 50 people there, including staff, patients and visitors; one was an eight-year-old child. Savile had full access to all parts of the hospital. The report stated that it was widely known at the hospital that Savile was a &quot;sex pest&quot;, and that 10 complaints had been made at the time, but no action was taken. The report also found that three doctors, including Salmon, had been convicted of sex crimes against their patients in the preceding four decades.

==Criticism==

On 27 February 2013, Buckinghamshire disability charity BuDS announced that it was compiling a dossier of evidence about risks to patient safety at Stoke Mandeville hospital to send to the Care Quality Commission. The charity claimed that it had received &quot;alarming reports from various sources ... expressing serious concerns about patient safety at the hospital&quot;.

Bucks Healthcare NHS Trust responded by saying &quot;it was &#x27;somewhat irresponsible of BuDS to potentially worry patients by hinting at patient safety issues at the hospital&quot;. The charity, however, defended its action and said &quot;BuDS wanted to give staff, patients and visitors at Stoke Mandeville hospital a wholly anonymous way to report any concerns they might have&quot;.

On 20 April 2013 the CQC published a report after an unannounced inspection at the hospital. It found that the hospital did not meet the standards for staffing levels and for providing support to staff. Enforcement action was taken regarding supporting staff and a warning notice was served.

==Facilities==
The facilities at the hospital include:
===Transport links===
The hospital is served by the London to Aylesbury Line and the Princes Risborough to Aylesbury Line from Aylesbury railway station. There are bus services connecting the hospital with Aylesbury and High Wycombe run by Arriva and also with Leighton Buzzard.

==Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio==

Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio (SMHR) is a non-profit hospital radio station which was founded on 4 December 1978. It is located within the hospital complex and provides a 24-hour radio service to the patients and staff streaming its service online, on 101.8MHz (FM) and through the use of their mobile device app, &quot;SMHR&quot; which was released in 2015.

The first broadcast was on 4 December 1978 at 7:30pm. The first sentence was: &#x27;Good evening and welcome to Stoke Mandeville Hospital&#x27;s very own radio station&#x27;.&quot;

In 1997, it was one of two hospital radio stations in the UK (the other being Radio Tyneside) to be awarded a temporary AM broadcasting licence from the Radio Authority (became Ofcom in 2003) as part of a pioneering trial as per the then recent passed Broadcasting Act. The success of the experiment led to the station, along with Tyneside Radio and many others, gaining a permanent broadcasting licence.

In 2018, former mayor of Aylesbury and long-standing patron and co-founder of the station, Freda Roberts MBE JP stood down as patron, being replaced by Radio 2 presenter Ken Bruce. Ken said &quot;Hospital Radio continues to thrive and I am delighted to take on the role of patron.&quot;

The station is a volunteer-run not-for-profit charity and has live request shows every weekday from 8pm till 10pm.

On 24 May 2019, SMHR was granted an FM broadcasting licence at 87.7 MHz by the industry regulator Ofcom. The move was linked to Local Radio day, in which the station celebrated with a six hour live broadcast from the Royal Voluntary Services Café in the Hospital.

==Notable patients==

British entertainer and actor Nicholas Parsons, best known for hosting &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; died there on 28 January 2020.

<doc id="393518" wikidata="Q1652985" url="?curid=393518" title="Peak Tram">
<text>The Peak Tram is a funicular railway in Hong Kong, which carries both tourists and residents to the upper levels of Hong Kong Island. Running from Garden Road Admiralty to Victoria Peak via the Mid-Levels, it provides the most direct route and offers good views over the harbour and skyscrapers of Hong Kong. Operated since 1888, it was the first funicular railway in Asia.

The Peak Tram is owned and operated by Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels (HSH), the owner of Hong Kong&#x27;s Peninsula Hotel along with other properties. The line, along with HSH&#x27;s Peak Tower leisure complex at the line&#x27;s summit, is promoted using the brand The Peak. After a lengthy renovation and upgrade project, the Peak Tram reopened on 27 August 2022.
==Route==

The Peak Tram&#x27;s route from Central district to Victoria Peak covers a distance of about and an elevation of just under . The line has two pronounced curves, one to the left immediately after leaving the lower terminus, and the other to the right in the upper half of the ascent. The gradient also varies considerably throughout the ascent. 

The lower terminus station, Central, is located on Garden Road near St. John&#x27;s Cathedral. The original station was incorporated into St. John&#x27;s Building, an office tower, with the tram terminus at the ground level. The station comprises a single track, with platforms on both sides. One platform is used for boarding, the other for exiting the tram.

The upper terminus, The Peak, is located below the Peak Tower shopping and leisure complex at Victoria Gap, some below the summit of Victoria Peak. The station has the same arrangement of boarding and alighting platforms as the lower terminus. The haulage and control equipment for the funicular is located in a basement below the station.

The Peak Tram is a funicular tramway - one where the upward and downward trams act as counterweights for each other so two trams are required for its operation.

As it is a single track tramway, a passing loop is needed for the two trams to pass each other - this is located just uphill from the May Road station (and can also be seen from the May Road overbridge). The approximately 400m long section which includes the passing loop changes from two rails to four rails for a short length just before the tramline&#x27;s upper curve, then there is a length of three rails before it reverts back to two rails.

There are four intermediate stops, each of which is a request stop consisting of a single stepped platform and a shelter:

*Kennedy Road. Located on Kennedy Road, named after Arthur Edward Kennedy, a former Governor of Hong Kong.
*MacDonnell Road. Located on MacDonnell Road, named after Richard Graves MacDonnell, a former Governor of Hong Kong; the depot storing two historic cars is next to the stop.
*May Road. Located on May Road, named after Francis Henry May, a former Governor of Hong Kong.
*Barker Road. Located on Barker Road, named after George Digby Barker, a former military commander and acting administrator of Hong Kong.

==History==

In 1881, Alexander Findlay Smith first put the project of a Peak Railway into shape and presented a petition for a concession to the governor of Hong Kong. The necessary legislation was passed two years later.

Findlay Smith did not approach the project rashly. Travelling extensively in Europe and America, he made himself conversant with nearly every existing method of railway employed for mountain ascent — San Francisco, Scarborough, Rigi, Monterey, Lucerne, the Rhine, Mount Vesuvius — and returned to Hong Kong thoroughly convinced of the feasibility of his idea. The actual construction was begun in September 1885 and in May 1888 the line was officially opened.

Smith&#x27;s business partner, N. J. Ede, owned and lived in the house next to the Upper Terminus, originally named Dunheved, which they converted into the original Peak Hotel.

It took three years to build the Peak Tram. Most of the heavy equipment and rails needed for the construction were hauled uphill by the workers with no mechanical support. As a revolutionary new form of transport for Asia at the time, the tramway was considered a marvel of engineering upon its completion. A wooden structure was built for the terminal. According to photographs, the Garden Road terminus was originally an unadorned building, a large clock face was added to the edifice probably between the 1910s and 1920s.
The Peak Tram was opened for public service on 28 May 1888 by the then governor Sir George William des Voeux. As built, the line used a static steam engine to power the haulage cable. It was at first used only for residents of Victoria Peak. Despite that, it carried 800 passengers on its first day of operation, and about 150,000 in its first year, transported in the line&#x27;s original wooden-bodied cars. The tram&#x27;s existence accelerated the residential development of Victoria Peak and the Mid-Levels.

From its opening in 1888 until 1926, the Peak Tram divided into three classes:
*First Class: British colonial officials and residents of Victoria Peak
*Second Class: British military and Hong Kong Police Force personnel
*Third Class: Other people and animals
The initial upward trip fares were HKD 30 cents (First Class), 20 cents (Second Class) and 10 cents (Third Class) while the downward trip was half these prices. The fares had risen 50 per cent by 1926 - they are now HKD108 return and HKD76 single after a significant rise in December 2024.

From 1908 to 1949, the first two seats in the front of the tram were reserved for the governor of Hong Kong, to which was attached a bronze plaque reading: &quot;This seat is reserved for His Excellency the Governor&quot;. The seats were not available to ordinary passengers until two minutes before departure.

In the course of its history, the tram has been a victim of two natural disasters, caused by floods from heavy rainfall, which washed away steep sections of the track between Bowen Road and Kennedy Road. The first was in 1899, and the second occurred on 12 June 1966.

In 1926, the steam engine was replaced by an electric motor. On 11 December 1941, during the Battle of Hong Kong, the engine room was damaged in an attack. Services were not resumed until 25 December 1945, after the end of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong.

In 1956, the Peak Tram was equipped with a new generation of lightweight metal-bodied cars, each of which seated 62 passengers. Unusually for a funicular line, three such cars were provided, only two of which were in use at any one time. The third spare car was kept in a car shed near the Kennedy Road station.

The system was comprehensively rebuilt in 1989 by the Swiss company, Von Roll, with a new track, a computerized control system, and two new two-car trams with a capacity of 120 passengers per tram. By the time of the handover in 1997, the system carried some 2 million passengers annually. Today, more than 4 million people ride the Peak Tram annually, or an average of over 11,000 every day.

Of prior rolling stock, only two 1956 fourth generation all-aluminium cars and one 1989 fifth generation car survive. Two cars, one from both previous generations, can be seen on a disused spur track that led to the former tram depot near the Kennedy Road station. An additional fourth generation car is displayed near the upper terminal, now serving as a Tourism Board Information Center. None of the cars from the first three generations exist, but a replica of the first car is displayed in the Peak Tram Historical Gallery.

===The Peak Tram Upgrade Project===
In view of the continuous increase in the number of tourists visiting Hong Kong, passenger usage of the tram was increasing by more than one digit percentage every year, especially on Sundays and public holidays. It was taking at least two hours to board; passenger demand far exceeded capacity. By 2012, average daily passenger usage reached 12,000, of which around 90% were tourists. At that period, Peak Tramways Company Limited hired a consultant to study how to improve the Peak Tram terminal and facilities to increase the available space, also considering re-laying tracks and to renovate the cable car cabins to increase the passenger capacity.

At the end of 2015, Peak Tramways Company Limited&#x27;s right to operate the Peak Tram expired. In the same year, it stated that it planned to spend about HK$684 million to launch a development plan to upgrade the Peak Tram system and improve existing facilities. It was implemented in phases and to be completed in 4 to 5 years. The development plan included:
*Purchasing new trams to increase the passenger capacity of the Peak Tram from 120 to 210 passengers per trip, which will greatly reduce the waiting time for passengers by approximately 75–91%
*Extend the Garden Road tram station and build the platform about uphill, after arriving at the &quot;Red Brick House&quot; in the WWF Central Visitor Center, providing a covered, temperature-controlled and comfortable waiting area for queuing, as well as providing a moderate amount of entertainment (such as historical exhibits on the Peak Tram) for approximately 1,300 waiting passengers
*Refurbishment of the upper platform of the Peak Tram Station, including widening the boarding platform; increasing the number of gates and ticket counters, and setting up a larger waiting area in front of the ticket office
*More effective crowd monitoring to ensure the safety of tourists, employees and pedestrians
*Further enhancement of the image of the Peak Tram and maintaining the status of the tram as an important tourism and leisure facility

The project was expected to be completed in 2021, during which the construction was divided into two phases. The first phase, which lasted from April 23, 2019, saw the Peak Tram being suspended for 2 to 3 months. The maintenance plan included the extension of the Peak Terminus and Garden Road Terminus, which was completed on July 22 of the same year. After the completion of the first phase of the project, the Peak Tram service was resumed for about 12 to 15 months. During this period, due to the expansion and renovation of the Garden Road Terminus, passengers used the temporary platform and queue outside the station.

The Second phase began on June 28, 2021, with the closure of the line. New tram carriages were installed, with longer bodies, and passenger capacity increased from 120 to 210. At the same time, power and towing systems, rail, control and signal systems and cables were replaced, and the renovation of the Peak Terminus and the Garden Road Terminus were complete, with the expansion of the former to cater for the new and larger tram carriage.

The project improved the waiting environment, replaced tracks, improved foundations, cable car bridges and other structures. The government stated that the entire development plan invested more than 700 million Hong Kong dollars. Final project costs were $799m HKD (£87m). After a closure of 14 months, the tram was reopened on 27 August 2022, though tourist numbers in Hong Kong are a fraction of their pre-COVID levels. 

The upgrade&#x27;s opening ceremony was held on 2 December 2022. It commenced with the lighting-up of the Eye of Infinity, a 10-metre-tall sculpture at the Central Terminus by Australian artist Lindy Lee, a commission that was part of the overall project.

===Heritage buildings===

====Barker Road Tram Station====
Built in 1919, Barker Road Station is the oldest surviving Peak Tram station. The station building is a striking open structure featuring semi-circular arches topping its columns, and has classical and Art Deco influences. The arches on the street side have ornamental ironwork with a radiating pattern (the current ironwork being installed in 2008). There is a cantilevered canopy on the Barker Road side which is believed to have originally been a coolie shelter for sedan chair and rickshaw bearers. The building, annex and walkway extension have changed little with the passage of time. It is a Grade I historic building.

====The Peak Depot====
The Peak Depot (山頂倉庫) is a rendered brick two-storey rectangular building close to The Peak Terminus with a place in Hong Kong&#x27;s transportation and water supply history. It was built c.1903.as a &#x27;chair coolie house&#x27; - a shelter and quarters for sedan chair &#x27;coolies&#x27; whose customers were going to and from the terminus. From around 1910 it was used as a waterworks office, workshop and depot, having accommodation for waterworks workers upstairs up to WW2, but is now vacant. It&#x27;s siting and views make it a potential adaptive reuse site. It is a Grade II historic building.

====No. 1 Lugard Road====
The building at No. 1 Lugard Road, located next to the Peak Tower and The Peak Lookout, was built about 1927 by The Peak Tramways Co. Ltd. as a workshop, with an additional floor added in 1953 to provide a flat for the General Manager of Company. The building is still owned and used by the Peak Tramways Company. It has been a Grade III historic building since 2010.

<doc id="393519" wikidata="Q466758" url="?curid=393519" title="Voltage divider">
<text>In electronics, a voltage divider (also known as a potential divider) is a passive linear circuit that produces an output voltage (&quot;V&quot;out) that is a fraction of its input voltage (&quot;V&quot;in). Voltage division is the result of distributing the input voltage among the components of the divider. A simple example of a voltage divider is two resistors connected in series, with the input voltage applied across the resistor pair and the output voltage emerging from the connection between them.

Resistor voltage dividers are commonly used to create reference voltages, or to reduce the magnitude of a voltage so it can be measured, and may also be used as signal attenuators at low frequencies. For direct current and relatively low frequencies, a voltage divider may be sufficiently accurate if made only of resistors; where frequency response over a wide range is required (such as in an oscilloscope probe), a voltage divider may have capacitive elements added to compensate load capacitance. In electric power transmission, a capacitive voltage divider is used for measurement of high voltage.

== General case ==

A voltage divider referenced to ground is created by connecting two electrical impedances in series, as shown in Figure 1. The input voltage is applied across the series impedances &quot;Z&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2 and the output is the voltage across &quot;Z&quot;2.
&quot;Z&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2 may be composed of any combination of elements such as resistors, inductors and capacitors.

If the current in the output wire is zero then the relationship between the input voltage, &quot;V&quot;in, and the output voltage, &quot;V&quot;out, is:
:formula_1

Proof (using Ohm&#x27;s law): 
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5

The transfer function (also known as the divider&#x27;s voltage ratio) of this circuit is:
:formula_6

In general this transfer function is a complex, rational function of frequency.

==Examples==
===Resistive divider===

A resistive divider is the case where both impedances, &quot;Z&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2, are purely resistive (Figure 2).

Substituting &quot;Z&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2 = R2 into the previous expression gives:
:formula_7

If &quot;R&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot;2 then
:formula_8

If &quot;V&quot;out = 6 V and &quot;V&quot;in = 9 V (both commonly used voltages), then:
:formula_9
and by solving using algebra, &quot;R&quot;2 must be twice the value of &quot;R&quot;1.

To solve for &quot;R&quot;1:
:formula_10

To solve for &quot;R&quot;2:
:formula_11

Any ratio &quot;V&quot;out / &quot;V&quot;in greater than 1 is not possible. That is, using resistors alone it is not possible to either invert the voltage or increase &quot;V&quot;out above &quot;V&quot;in.

=== Low-pass RC filter ===

Consider a divider consisting of a resistor and capacitor as shown in Figure 3.

Comparing with the general case, we see &quot;Z&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;2 is the impedance of the capacitor, given by

:formula_12

where &quot;X&quot;C is the reactance of the capacitor, &quot;C&quot; is the capacitance of the capacitor, &quot;j&quot; is the imaginary unit, and &quot;ω&quot; (omega) is the radian frequency of the input voltage.

This divider will then have the voltage ratio:
:formula_13

The product &quot;τ&quot; (tau) = &quot;RC&quot; is called the &quot;time constant&quot; of the circuit.

The ratio then depends on frequency, in this case decreasing as frequency increases. This circuit is, in fact, a basic (first-order) low-pass filter. The ratio contains an imaginary number, and actually contains both the amplitude and phase shift information of the filter. To extract just the amplitude ratio, calculate the magnitude of the ratio, that is:

:formula_14

===Inductive divider===
Inductive dividers split AC input according to inductance:

formula_15

(with components in the same positions as Figure 2.)

The above equation is for non-interacting inductors; mutual inductance (as in an autotransformer) will alter the results.

Inductive dividers split AC input according to the reactance of the elements as for the resistive divider above.

===Capacitive divider===
Capacitive dividers do not pass DC input.

For an AC input a simple capacitive equation is:

formula_16

(with components in the same positions as Figure 2.)

Any leakage current in the capactive elements requires use of the generalized expression with two impedances. By selection of parallel &quot;R&quot; and &quot;C&quot; elements in the proper proportions, the same division ratio can be maintained over a useful range of frequencies. This is the principle applied in compensated oscilloscope probes to increase measurement bandwidth.

==Loading effect==
The output voltage of a voltage divider will vary according to the electric current it is supplying to its external electrical load. The effective source impedance coming from a divider of &quot;Z&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2, as above, will be &quot;Z&quot;1 in parallel with &quot;Z&quot;2 (sometimes written &quot;Z&quot;1 // &quot;Z&quot;2), that is: (&quot;Z&quot;1 &quot;Z&quot;2) / (&quot;Z&quot;1 + &quot;Z&quot;2) = &quot;HZ&quot;1.

To obtain a sufficiently stable output voltage, the output current must either be stable (and so be made part of the calculation of the potential divider values) or limited to an appropriately small percentage of the divider&#x27;s input current. Load sensitivity can be decreased by reducing the impedance of both halves of the divider, though this increases the divider&#x27;s quiescent input current and results in higher power consumption (and wasted heat) in the divider. Voltage regulators are often used in lieu of passive voltage dividers when it is necessary to accommodate high or fluctuating load currents.

== Applications ==
Voltage dividers are used for adjusting the level of a signal, for bias of active devices in amplifiers, and for measurement of voltages. A Wheatstone bridge and a multimeter both include voltage dividers. A potentiometer is used as a variable voltage divider in the volume control of many radios.

===Sensor measurement===
Voltage dividers can be used to allow a microcontroller to measure the resistance of a sensor. The sensor is wired in series with a known resistance to form a voltage divider and a known voltage is applied across the divider. The microcontroller&#x27;s analog-to-digital converter is connected to the center tap of the divider so that it can measure the tap voltage and, by using the measured voltage and the known resistance and voltage, compute the sensor resistance. This technique is commonly used to measure the resistance of temperature sensors such as thermistors and RTDs.

Another example that is commonly used involves a potentiometer (variable resistor) as one of the resistive elements. When the shaft of the potentiometer is rotated the resistance it produces either increases or decreases, the change in resistance corresponds to the angular change of the shaft. If coupled with a stable voltage reference, the output voltage can be fed into an analog-to-digital converter and a display can show the angle. Such circuits are commonly used in reading control knobs.

===High voltage measurement===

A voltage divider can be used to scale down a very high voltage so that it can be measured by a volt meter. The high voltage is applied across the divider, and the divider output—which outputs a lower voltage that is within the meter&#x27;s input range—is measured by the meter. High voltage resistor divider probes designed specifically for this purpose can be used to measure voltages up to 100 kV. Special high-voltage resistors are used in such probes as they must be able to tolerate high input voltages and, to produce accurate results, must have matched temperature coefficients and very low voltage coefficients. Capacitive divider probes are typically used for voltages above 100 kV, as the heat caused by power losses in resistor divider probes at such high voltages could be excessive.

===Logic level shifting===
A voltage divider can be used as a crude logic level shifter to interface two circuits that use different operating voltages. For example, some logic circuits operate at 5 V whereas others operate at 3.3 V. Directly interfacing a 5 V logic output to a 3.3 V input may cause permanent damage to the 3.3 V circuit. In this case, a voltage divider with an output ratio of 3.3/5 might be used to reduce the 5 V signal to 3.3 V, to allow the circuits to interoperate without damaging the 3.3 V circuit. For this to be feasible, the 5 V source impedance and 3.3 V input impedance must be negligible, or they must be constant and the divider resistor values must account for their impedances. If the input impedance is capacitive, a purely resistive divider will limit the data rate. This can be roughly overcome by adding a capacitor in series with the top resistor, to make both legs of the divider capacitive as well as resistive.

<doc id="393520" wikidata="Q1816620" url="?curid=393520" title="Rugeley">
<text>Rugeley ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Cannock Chase District, in Staffordshire, England. It lies on the north-eastern edge of Cannock Chase next to the River Trent; it is situated north of Lichfield, south-east of Stafford, north-east of Hednesford and south-west of Uttoxeter. At the 2021 Census, the population was 26,156. 

Rugeley is twinned with Western Springs, Illinois and, in July 1962, both towns made telephone history on national television when the chairman of Rugeley Urban District Council made the first telephone call via the new Telstar satellite to the mayor of Western Springs. It was also featured in an article about workers&#x27; rights and town transformation in the 21st century.

==History==
The town, historically known as Rudgeley or Ridgeley, is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. This name is thought to be derived from &#x27;Ridge lee&#x27;, or &#x27;the hill over the field&#x27;. In the mediaeval period, it thrived on iron workings and was also a site of glass manufacturing. During the Industrial Revolution the economy of Rugeley benefited from the construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal and then from it becoming a junction on the railway network.

Rugeley was considered royal land and Cannock Chase was considered a royal forest. In 1189, Rugeley was sold to the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry by King Richard I the Lionheart. Rugeley was still relatively small at this point.

By 1259, Rugeley had grown significantly enough to be granted the right to hold a weekly market. To this day there is a weekly outdoor market held in the town.

In 1532, the manor of Rugeley was inherited by the Chetwynd family who held it until 1764. In 1768, the manor passed to Thomas Anson, later Viscount Anson.

In 1709 Rugeley was hit with two disasters. One was a fire that ravaged the town (the town had been hit by a fire sixty years prior to this too, making this the second such disaster) and the other was when the Rising Brook which runs through the town broke its banks and flooded the town.

Rugeley was an agricultural community for hundreds of years and held regular sheep, cattle and horse fairs. This reached its peak in the mid 19th century and lasting until the 1930s. The Rugeley annual horse fair was known internationally and attracted trade from far and away. To this day there is a main road in Rugeley town centre called Horsefair honouring this, as well as another street honouring the sheep fair.

St. Augustine&#x27;s Church in Rugeley has memorials to the Levett family, who live at nearby Milford Hall and who established the Rugeley Home and Cottage Hospital on Church Street in 1866.

From 1894 to 1974 the town was administered by Rugeley Urban District Council which was based at Rugeley Town Hall; the town hall was largely demolished in 1978 and all that remains of the building now is the clock tower.

Between 1793 and 1967 Rugeley Grammar School provided selective secondary education for the town and also for Hednesford. Historical characters who were educated at RGS include the banker and railway promoter Edward Charles Blount and the Australian pioneer and politician Charles Bonney.

Although smaller pits had existed beforehand, the town became a centre of industrial scale deep-shaft coal mining from the 1950s, to access similar coal seams to those under Cannock Chase. The Lea Hall Colliery that opened in July 1960 was the first modern coal mine opened by the National Coal Board, which managed the United Kingdom&#x27;s nationalized coal industry. Nearby the Central Electricity Generating Board built the two Rugeley power stations. With the construction of Rugeley A and B power stations Rugeley became a major centre for electricity generation. These developments led to the town growing very quickly in the 1960s. The Rugeley A power station was designed to take its fuel directly from Lea Hall by conveyor belt (although the coal was of poor quality not suitable for Rugeley B). This was the first such arrangement in Britain. Rugeley power station was shut in 2016 and demolished in stages in 2021. Rugeley was once home to an Amazon Fulfilment centre, which was built at the Tower Business Park. The centre permanently closed in March 3, 2024.

==Transport==

===Railway===
For many years in the 1970s and 1980s, Rugeley was served by British Rail with four services each way to and from Stafford and Rugby/Coventry. After the closure of Rugeley A power station and Lea Hall Colliery, with the consequential reduction in rail freight, it became possible to open up the Rugeley to Walsall line for passenger traffic. Rugeley now has two railway stations: and .

Rugeley Trent Valley lies on the West Coast Main Line; it has a regular hourly service to London via Lichfield, Nuneaton, Rugby and Milton Keynes, and to Crewe via Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent. Rugeley Trent Valley also has a half-hourly service via Rugeley Town railway station and the Chase Line suburban route connecting to and .

===Buses===
Regular bus services 826 and 828 link Rugeley to the town of Stafford (going north-west) and city of Lichfield (going south). Service 63 links Rugeley to Hednesford (going south-west) and Uttoxeter (going North). These Chaserider operated routes also link nearby rural villages of Colwich and Great Haywood. They also link the towns neighbourhoods including Springfields, Brereton and Pear Tree. Since cut backs in 2018, no buses operate on Sunday or bank holidays.

===Canal===
The town continues to benefit from the Trent and Mersey Canal on its eastern side which, since the popularity of canals as a leisure activity, brings additional tourism into the town. The canal runs from Preston Brook to Shardlow, through Cheshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire.

===Roads===
The major roads into Rugeley are the A460 from Wolverhampton and the A51, via Tamworth, Lichfield to Stone before going through Nantwich and ending at Chester. A new eastern bypass was opened in 2007, to facilitate the development of new employment areas on the former colliery site and to reduce congestion in the town centre.

== Media ==

=== Television ===
BBC Midlands Today and ITV News Central cover Rugeley from studios in Birmingham. These are mainly received from the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station; however, some parts of the town are shielded from Sutton Coldfield and rely on the Rugeley relay, located at The Hart School.

Some parts of Rugeley can also receive good signals from the Waltham transmitting station near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, which carries BBC East Midlands and the East Midlands variant of ITV Central.

=== Radio ===
Rugeley lies within the coverage areas of the West Midlands regional stations, like Heart and Greatest Hits Radio, Capital Mid-Counties and Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire in Stoke-on-Trent. BBC Local Radio is covered by BBC Radio WM from Birmingham on 95.6 FM, though reception is not good and, in some parts, BBC Radio Stoke on 94.6 FM is better received.

The town is covered by Cannock Chase Radio, a community radio station.

=== Newspapers ===
For many years up to 1980, Rugeley had its own newspaper: the &quot;Rugeley Times&quot;, published from Bow Street. The newspaper was sold to the &quot;Staffordshire Newsletter&quot;. Today, the town is covered by the &quot;Express and Star&quot;. A team of students from The Hart School began writing a local newspaper called &quot;The Hart of Rugeley&quot;; this is now published three times a year.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census, Rugeley was 96.5% White British. Much of the ageing population and their families are linked to the ex-mining communities, with an increasing proportion of the younger population being new to the area and associated with the services sector. As former mining towns, Rugeley including the Brereton area suffer from a moderate level of social deprivation, with parts of the town consisting of council or ex-council house stock (such as the Springfield Estate and parts of Brereton) or former National Coal Board housing, such as the Pear Tree Estate. However, on the fringes of Rugeley there is more affluence, and some of the older Georgian streets including the conservation area of Crossley Stone or waterfront properties along the Trent and Mersey Canal. A number of new houses were built in the housing boom of the early 2000s, providing a mixture of affordable and higher-end properties.

==Religion==
===Church of England===

The parish church of Rugeley is St Augustine&#x27;s Church, dedicated to St Augustine of Canterbury. The present church, a Grade II* listed building, was built in 1822–23 to replace the medieval parish church. What remains of the former church, primarily the tower and chancel, is a Grade II listed building and is known as the &#x27;Old Chancel&#x27;. A school next to it is called Chancel School. Other churches within the Rugeley area include The Church of the Good Shepherd, Rugeley Community Church, Victory Church, The Church of the Holy Spirit and St Michael&#x27;s Church.

===Roman Catholic===

St Joseph and St Etheldreda is a Roman Catholic church in Rugeley, dedicated to Saint Joseph and Saint Etheldreda. It is in the Gothic revival style of the 19th Century and was designed by Charles Hansom and built between 1849 and 1851 out of local stone. There is a Catholic primary school in the town dedicated, as the church is, to Saint Joseph. The Parish is part of the Archdiocese of Birmingham.

===Methodist===

The Methodist church of Rugeley is named after St Paul and located close to the town centre on Lichfield Street. It is a Methodist/ United Reformed Church. Along with the main town centre Methodist church there is also one in the Brereton area of the town.

==Sport==
Rugeley is home to two cricket clubs (Rugeley C.C. and Trent Valley C.C.), several football clubs, Rugeley Rugby Club and Staffordshire Quantums Rugby League.

Rugeley Snooker Club (previously known as Rugeley Billiards Club) was established in 1850. Since 1964, after it had to relocate from Bow Street, it has owned and has been based at Heron Court Hall, a large gothic style mansion built in 1851 (by Joseph Whitgreave, who was also a chief founder of the St Joseph and St Etheldreda church, built opposite the mansion).. The club has 4 well maintained snooker tables, including an accessible table situated on the ground floor, a members bar and a small function room that can be hired out for local community based purposes.

Rugeley Rifle Club, catering to .22 and air gun target shooting, moved to its current location near the Town Station in 1971 and is noted for member Victoria Bradbury, bronze medallist at the 2018 ISSF World Shooting Championships.

The Lea Hall Social Club, which underwent extensive renovation between 2005 and 2011, serves Rugeley residents with a variety of facilities including cricket and football pitches, a crown bowling green. There used to be tennis courts, but they are now gone and replaced with housing.

Etching Hill Tennis Club has offered casual and competitive hard court play to members since 1952.

Hawkesyard Golf (formerly known as the St. Thomas Priory Golf Course) is to the east of the town on the Hawkesyard Estate.

==Events==
The town council also puts on a fireworks display during the last weekend of the school summer holidays, known as &quot;Back to School with a Bang&quot;. A Christmas lights switch-on during December includes a market and late-night opening of shops, with the local traders association joining in the organising of street entertainment.

A Pagan conference happens on the May bank holiday every year. Staffordshire Pagan Conference started in 2015 and was held at Lea Hall Social Club. The conference is attended by over 250 people from all over the country. Over £1,000 has been donated to Staffordshire Wildlife Trust with the profit from the event. As of 2018 the conference relocated to The Rose Theatre and become Witchfest Midlands.

In 2016 and 2017, the British Quidditch Cup was held at Rugeley Leisure Centre. The third British Quidditch Cup took place on 19 and 20 March 2016, with 32 teams competing, and the winners were Oxford&#x27;s team, the Radcliffe Chimeras. The fourth British Quidditch Cup took place on 11 and 12 March 2017, with 32 teams competing, and the winners were Velociraptors QC.

In February 2020 a new &quot;Fringe Festival&quot; was announced with a variety of events intended to be held in the town over the May Bank Holiday. The Festival was cancelled in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cannock Chase is a venue for the Forest Live series of music events, with concerts held at Birches Valley Forest Centre, Rugeley. As with other Forest Live events it hosts different live acts from big name bands each year. Past acts have included Paul Weller, UB40, Kaiser Chiefs and Paloma Faith.

==Future==
Rugeley suffered an increase in unemployment when Lea Hall Colliery closed in 1990. Following many years of demolition and regeneration, a number of large industrial units have been built on the Towers Business Park, a brownfield site situated on the former ground of the colliery. In August 2011, Amazon.co.uk opened a 700,000 sq ft fulfillment centre on the Towers Park, creating between 700 and 900 full-time jobs as well as generating a large pool of seasonal work around Christmas. In June 2023 the closure of the Towers Park Amazon fulfillment centre was announced, following the opening of a new centre in Sutton Coldfield.

Rugeley&#x27;s future looks set to benefit from the recent closure and demolition of the power station. The Brownfields site will be developed. This development has been earmarked to include 2,300 new homes as well as housing for the elderly. There will be a new All through school; the first in Staffordshire, which will accommodate 1,400 pupils. There will be over 12 acres used for employment as well as a riverside country park and a new water sports leisure facility at the Borrow Pit Lake. There will also be added commercial development to the area. This new development will be a massive boost to the area and the whole new development will be low carbon.
