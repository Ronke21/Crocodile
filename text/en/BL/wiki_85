<text>John Taylor Doolittle (born October 30, 1950), is an attorney and an American politician. Elected to Congress in 1990, he served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 2009, representing (numbered as during his first term). In the 109th Congress, he held a leadership role as the Deputy Whip for the Republican party in the House. He was succeeded in the House of Representatives by Tom McClintock. Before being elected to Congress, he had served in the California State Senate from 1984 to 1991.

In the approach to the 2008 election, Doolittle lost support from previous allies and had difficulty in fundraising. He announced that he would not run again. He had been criticized by opponents for improprieties, including using his wife&#x27;s one-person firm for his political fundraising, as she based her compensation on a percentage of all funds raised, including from his PAC. She made nearly $180,000 in such commissions from 2001 to 2006. His office did not stop using her firm for fundraising until January 2007.

He was under investigation from 2006 to 2010 related to alleged financial improprieties. These included his and his wife&#x27;s business relations with Jack Abramoff, a prominent Washington, D.C. lobbyist who was found to have defrauded numerous clients, including Indian tribes. During this period, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) listed Doolittle as among the 20 most corrupt congressmen in reports from 2006 to 2009. The US Attorney closed its investigation of Doolittle in 2010 without bringing any charges against him.

== Early life and education ==
Doolittle was born in Glendale, California. He grew up in Cupertino, California, attending local public schools. He graduated from Cupertino High School in 1968. He graduated with honors with a B.A. in history from the University of California, Santa Cruz. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from McGeorge School of Law, University of the Pacific, in Sacramento, in 1978.

Before going to law school, Doolittle spent two years as a missionary in Argentina for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to which he and his family belonged. Doolittle is married to the former Julia (Julie) Harlow. They have a son and daughter.

== Career prior to the U.S. House ==
Doolittle entered politics early. Soon after passing the bar, in 1979 Doolittle started work as an aide to California state senator H. L. Richardson, the conservative founder of Gun Owners of America and the Law and Order Campaign Committee. 
The next year Doolittle decided to run for the state senate, with encouragement from Richardson and other Republicans. Riding on the coattails of Governor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s victory in the presidential race, in 1980 the 29-year-old Doolittle narrowly defeated incumbent Democrat Albert S. Rodda, dean of the state Senate and chair of the Senate Finance Committee. Doolittle won his seat in the California State Senate.

In 1981, the Democratic-dominated state legislature issued a redistricting plan following the 1980 census and congressional reapportionment. It tried to squeeze out Republican lawmakers. The newly drawn district put Doolittle into a predominately Democratic district, where he lost to then-Assemblyman Leroy Greene in 1982 for the state senate. But by a quirk of redistricting rules, Doolittle was able to keep his original seat until 1984. He won another term in the state senate by beating Ray E. Johnson, a Republican turned Independent from Chico. An administrative law judge later found Doolittle guilty of violating campaign finance laws because his campaign had contributed to his Democratic opponent in order to pull votes away from Johnson.

Doolittle easily won re-election in 1988. From 1987 to 1990, he was chairman of the state Senate Republican Caucus.

===Initial election and re-elections===
In 1990, Republican Norman D. Shumway, also a Mormon, retired from Congress. In the November general election, Doolittle defeated Patty Malberg, a Democrat from Lincoln, getting 51% of the vote, in what was then California&#x27;s 14th congressional district. The district covered much of the northeastern corner of the state, from the northern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon border.

Doolittle&#x27;s district was renumbered as California&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 1992, following redistricting. He was reelected with 50 percent of the vote, again defeating Malberg. In 1994 he received 60% of the vote and did not face another close race until 2006.

===Political positions and actions===
In his first years in Congress, Doolittle was a member of the group known as the Gang of Seven, which had a role in exposing the House banking scandal.

Doolittle is a staunch conservative. According to the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, &quot;Doolittle is a generally loyal supporter of the Bush administration—though like many House Republicans he opposes Bush&#x27;s support for an immigration guest worker program.&quot; He is in favor of partial privatization of Social Security, saying he would like to see people &quot;gain ownership over their own funds&quot;. He opposes gun control and abortion rights.

After the Republican Study Committee had its funding removed in 1995, Doolittle helped revive it as the &quot;Conservative Action Team.&quot; He alternated the chairmanship with Dan Burton of Indiana, Sam Johnson of Texas, and Ernest Istook of Oklahoma until 1999.

In November 1997, Doolittle was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Doolitte voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Doolittle voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).

In January 2006, an opinion piece published in &quot;The Union&quot; newspaper, of Grass Valley, California, quoted Doolittle as saying that &quot;A liberal front is underway to find God and all things pertaining to him unconstitutional.&quot;

In February 2006, Doolittle was praised by the El Dorado Irrigation District for his assistance in obtaining federal funds for hydroelectric power projects.

===Auburn Dam Project===

Doolittle is known for support of the Auburn Dam project, despite environmental concerns. People who opposed construction of the dam were particularly concerned about the uncertainties of the potential effects of such a dam on seismic activity in the area. A mid-1990s preliminary United States Geological Survey report cited concerns about the potential for earthquakes to be caused by that project.

Doolittle&#x27;s stated reason for supporting the Auburn Dam was for flood control of Sacramento. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he portrayed the flooding in New Orleans as an example of why the project was needed. Critics replied that the Gulf Coast, with its hurricane season and the torrential rainfalls associated with it, is not a valid comparison to a region of the country that historically often has droughts. They said that Folsom and Nimbus dams sufficed to control floods in an intense rainy season. Opponents of the project believe that the proposed Auburn Dam will also accelerate urban sprawl east of Sacramento and downriver from the proposed dam. Placer County already has one of the highest growth rates in the country, putting strains on local services and infrastructure, and affecting the environment. Opponents also cited other issues, such as destruction of the canyon environment and loss of habitat for wildlife.

In 1975, the construction of the dam was stopped due to environmental concerns, money issues, and the seismic instability of the proposed dam site. The construction was canceled and the project is abandoned. Much of the preliminary work on the dam can still be seen today. In 2005, Doolittle secured funding for studies to move the project forward.

===21st century re-election campaigns===

====2002====
In 2002, Doolittle defeated Republican challenger Dr. Bill Kirby of Auburn, California, 78%–22%. In the general election, Doolittle defeated Mark Norberg, 65%-35%, while raising $1,024,986 compared to Norberg&#x27;s $8,202.

====2004====
In 2004, Doolittle took in more than $1 million in contributions and received 65% of the vote. His Democratic opponent David Winters raised $2,300; he won 35 percent of the vote.

====2006====
In the Republican primary on June 6, 2006, Doolittle was challenged for his party&#x27;s nomination by Mike Holmes, the mayor of Auburn. Doolittle raised more than $1.1 million in campaign contributions, more than 14 times the fund of Holmes. Doolittle won the primary with 67% of the vote.

In the general election, Doolittle&#x27;s Democratic opponent was retired Air Force Lt. Colonel Charles Brown. Doolittle agreed to a single debate, on October 11, 2006. Doolittle defeated Brown, getting 49% of the vote to Brown&#x27;s 46%. Brown defeated Doolittle in Nevada County, but narrowly lost Placer County, the most populated county in the district, and lost the rest of the district.

In January 2007, Doolittle announced ten steps he said he would take to re-establish the confidence of the district in his holding office. He announced the planned changes in an op-ed piece he distributed to newspapers in his district, to attempt to gain free publicity about it.

==Legislative record==

===State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)===

In 2007, Congress took up the reauthorization of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicare but not enough to afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.

John Doolittle voted against the first House bill, which passed along party lines. It would have added $47 billion over five years to the $25 billion cost of the program and added about 5 million people to the program, including children, some legal immigrants, pregnant women, and adults aged 18 and 19. The bill was to be financed mainly by an increase in cigarette taxes.

House Democrats, with 45 Republicans, later compromised and passed a bill that expanded the plan by $35 billion and would have insured about 3.5 million more children from families generally making between 250% and 300% of the federal poverty line (about $51,000 to $62,000 for a family of four). Most non-pregnant, childless adults were excluded, as were most legal immigrants and all illegal immigrants. Doolittle voted against the bill.

After President Bush vetoed the bill, Democratic leaders attempted to override the veto with the same bill but failed. Doolittle voted against the bill.

House Democrats attempted to override the veto with a new bill, which acceded to Republican demands for increased checks for citizenship, the quick phasing-out of adult coverage, a hard limit of 300% of the federal poverty level, and funding for families to cover their children through private insurance instead. Angry that the congressional vote was scheduled to proceed despite massive wildfires in California, Republicans blocked the veto override. Doolittle voted with fellow Republicans against the bill.

==Campaign finances==
Between 2005 and 2006, John Doolittle raised a total of $2,354,786 for his political campaign. 65.1% of his finances came from private donors, 34.5% from PACs, and 0.3% from other various sources. 54.3% of the PAC contributions came from business organizations while the other 45.7% came from labor and ideological groups. At the end of his 2005–2006 political campaign, 98.4% of his finances were completely disclosed. According to the FEC (Federal Election Commission), John Doolittle raised a total of $278,142 in that year.

==Controversies==
Doolittle was investigated by the US Attorney for issues related to his campaign financing and reporting, beginning in 2006. He and his wife both had business and political relations with Jack Abramoff, a prominent lobbyist in Washington, DC. Abramoff was investigated by a Congressional committee and found to have defrauded numerous clients, especially Indian tribes which he represented on gaming issues. Doolittle&#x27;s wife had a consulting firm that Abramoff used for some activities. He required his Indian tribe clients to contribute some $50,000 to Doolittle&#x27;s political campaigns and personally contributed another $14,000.

On September 20, 2006, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a non-profit group headed by former Democratic Congressional staffer Melanie Sloan, released its second annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress. It was entitled &quot;Beyond DeLay: The 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and Five to Watch)&quot;. Doolittle was one of the 20 discussed in the report. The organization said, &quot;His ethics issues stem from his wife&#x27;s relationship to his campaign and political action committees, as well as campaign contributions and personal financial benefits he accepted from those who sought his legislative assistance.&quot; He was also listed as among the most corrupt Congressmen in CREW&#x27;s subsequent 2007 and 2008 reports.

On June 11, 2010, the U.S. Attorney announced that, after a 4-year investigation, they had closed its case against Congressman Doolittle and would not pursue charges. Doolittle, who had consistently denied wrongdoing, expressed regret that so many lives and careers had been affected by the investigation. He was forced from office by it. He said he was relieved that the investigation was ended.

===Abramoff connections===

John Doolittle has been entangled in the scandal involving Jack Abramoff. On September 27, 2007, he indicated that he planned to fight a Justice Department subpoena for 11 years of records as part of that department&#x27;s investigation into his conduct.

Doolittle has denied any wrongdoing. In connection with the matter, he hired David Barger, a criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor from Ken Starr&#x27;s office, and Wiley Rein LLP, a law firm that specializes in campaign finance and government ethics. Doolittle has estimated that he received about $50,000 in contributions for his campaigns from clients of Abramoff, mostly Indian tribes. His congressional campaigns from 1999 to 2004 received $14,000 in personal donations from Abramoff over the period 1999–2004 to Doolittle&#x27;s congressional campaigns. After Doolittle&#x27;s Chief of Staff Kevin A. Ring left to work for Abramoff, Ring helped arrange for Abramoff to hire a consulting firm owned by Doolittle&#x27;s wife. Doolittle used Abramoff&#x27;s luxury sports box for a political fundraiser and failed to report this as part of his campaign finances. Doolittle was investigated by a federal probe into his relationship with Abramoff. On April 13, 2007, Doolittle&#x27;s former aide, Kevin Ring, resigned from his lobby firm. On the same day, the FBI raided Doolittle&#x27;s Virginia home. On September 4, 2007, the House announced that Doolittle&#x27;s Chief of Staff Ron Rogers and Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Blankenburg were subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.

===Small towns pressured to hire lobbyists===
Dan Landon, a Republican and the executive director of the Nevada County Transportation Commission, said that he was told recently by Doolittle&#x27;s staff that &quot;it also doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a lobbyist&quot;. Sharon Atteberry, city administrator for the city of Oroville, said she had also been urged to hire a lobbyist by Doolittle&#x27;s staff. &quot;They encouraged us that a lobbyist is very important to any city or county government&quot; she said.

===Activities of Julie Doolittle===
During the 2001–2005 period, Julie Doolittle had at least three different occupations: she worked for Jack Abramoff doing event planning (see above); she worked as a bookkeeper for a lobbying firm; and she worked on commission as a fundraiser for her husband. Payments to Julie Doolittle during the period were done via a company called Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions. It was founded in March 2001, just after Congressman Doolittle gained a seat on the Appropriations Committee. It is based at the couple&#x27;s home in Oakton, Virginia; Julie is the only employee. The company (that is, Julie) has continued to do fundraising, but no event planning or other work, since the Abramoff scandal first became public in early 2005.

====Work for lobbying firm====
From 2002 until mid-2005, the Alexander Strategy Group, a Washington, D.C. lobbying firm with close ties to Congressman Tom DeLay, paid Sierra Dominion for bookkeeping work for a nonprofit group called the Korea-U.S. Exchange Council (KORUSEC). The latter was created by Ed Buckham, a partner in the firm, and was located at the ASG headquarters. KORUSEC is also connected to Kevin Ring, one of Doolittle&#x27;s former assistants. ASG closed due to the financial scandals caused by Jack Abramoff and his associates. Julie Doolittle&#x27;s records regarding her work there were subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice.

====Fundraising commissions from Doolittle campaign revenues====
Sierra Dominion charged Doolittle&#x27;s campaign and his Superior California Political Action Committee a 15 percent commission on any contribution that Julie Doolittle helped bring in. Federal and state campaign records show that, since late 2001, she had received nearly $180,000 in commissions from for such fundraising. This meant that Doolittle and his family had personally made money off his political fundraising. Doolittle aides said even though the PAC had made payments to other fundraisers, Julie Doolittle was entitled to 15 percent of all money the PAC brought in because those donations were raised at events she helped organize.

In December 2005, Richard Robinson, Doolittle&#x27;s Chief of Staff, defended the commission structure. &quot;Sierra Dominion&#x27;s compensation is based entirely on performance in that it receives a percentage in what it is directly involved in raising. This arrangement is not only consistent with that of other fund raisers but is designed to avoid the appearance that Sierra Dominion is compensated for anything other than its tireless and effective work. Any suggestion otherwise is completely without merit.&quot;

But in 2006, the 27,000-member Association of Fundraising Professionals published a letter it had sent to Doolittle, stating emphatically that his wife&#x27;s activities and form of compensation violated the Association&#x27;s ethics code. Their code &quot;explicitly prohibits percentage-based compensation&quot;.

In January 2007, Doolittle announced that he would no longer employ his wife as his campaign fundraiser. Instead, he said, he would hire an outside fundraiser. But in July 2007, his campaign reported expenses of $50,000 for fundraising by Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions during the April–June 2007 period. The company was also still owed $76,000 in commissions from the 2006 race.

===2005 trip to Asia===
KORUSEC, which employed Doolittle&#x27;s wife (see above) and the U.S.-Malaysia Exchange Association, another non-profit firm operated by ASG, paid the total $29,400 cost of what was described as a &quot;fact finding mission&quot; in 2005 for Congressman Doolittle and his 12-year-old daughter to South Korea and Malaysia. This trip included a stop at the Berjaya Beach &amp; Spa Resort on the Malaysian island of Langkawi.

KORUSEC and the U.S.-Malaysia Exchange Association, which were operated by the Washington lobbying firm, Alexander Strategy Group, were, as of November 2006, being investigated by the FBI as possible conduits for illegal influence in U.S. affairs; foreign corporations such as KORUSEC and foreign governments, such as USMEA, are prohibited from seeking such influence. A spokeswoman for Doolittle said that he believed that his trip was proper and that it had nothing to do with the earmarks he had approved in the federal budget.

===Connections to Brent Wilkes===
PerfectWave is a company owned by Brent R. Wilkes; Doolittle has had significant involvement with both the company and its owner. Disgraced Congressman Duke Cunningham admitted receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and favors from Wilkes for his efforts to help another of Wilkes&#x27; companies, ADCS Inc.

In 2002, Wilkes hired the Alexander Strategy Group (ASG) for lobbying for his company. In November 2003, Wilkes hosted a fund-raising dinner for Congressman Doolittle. Between 2002 and 2005, Doolittle received at least $118,000 in campaign contributions from Wilkes, PerfectWave associates and their wives, and ASG lobbyists Edwin A. Buckham and Tony C. Rudy (two former aides of Tom DeLay) and their wives.

Doolittle, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in January 2006 that he had helped steer defense funds totaling $37 million to PerfectWave ($1 million in 2002, $18 million in 2003, and then $18 million in 2004.) Doolittle said that his support was based &quot;on the project&#x27;s merits and the written support of the military.&quot;

But the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; reported that &quot;The money was not requested by the Navy but was instead inserted by the Appropriations Committee as part of the closed-door congressional earmarking process.&quot; They further reported that &quot;[T]he only evidence Doolittle&#x27;s office could provide to show military support for the project was a letter of praise from Robert Lusardi, a program manager for light armored vehicles at the Marine Corps dated Feb. 25—two and a half years after PerfectWave got its first earmark. By the time Lusardi wrote his letter, the company had received at least $37 million in earmarks.&quot;

In February 2006, Doolittle said that he was glad he supported PerfectWave, saying &quot;it has unique technology ... that ensures the safety of our armed forces in the war on terror.&quot;

===Investigation of Charles Hurwitz===
On January 8, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;Reps. John T. Doolittle and Richard W. Pombo joined forces with former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas to oppose an investigation by federal banking regulators into the affairs of Houston millionaire Charles Hurwitz, documents recently obtained by &quot;The Times&quot; show.&quot; &quot;When the FDIC persisted [in seeking investigation], Doolittle and Pombo—both considered proteges of DeLay—used their power as members of the House Resources Committee to subpoena the agency&#x27;s confidential records on the case, including details of the evidence FDIC investigators had compiled on Hurwitz.&quot; The FDIC investigation was ultimately dropped.

The Times reported that &quot;Although Washington politicians frequently try to help important constituents and contributors, it is unusual for members of Congress to take direct steps to stymie an ongoing investigation by an agency such as the FDIC.&quot; The article concluded, &quot;in the Hurwitz case, Doolittle and Pombo were in a position to pressure the FDIC and did so.&quot;

On April 19, 2007, Doolittle resigned from the Committee on Appropriations in response to a raid by the FBI at his Northern Virginia home. The raid stemmed from possible involvement by his wife in the investigation of Jack Abramoff for defrauding clients as a lobbyist and inappropriate influence.

== 2008 re-election campaign ==
Democrat Charlie Brown, a retired Lt. Colonel who had narrowly lost to Doolittle in 2006 by 3 percent of the vote, announced in February 2007 that he would run again in 2008. In the first and second quarters of 2007, Brown raised more campaign funds than Doolittle; as of June 30, he had a net cash balance of $251,000; Doolittle had a negative balance of $32,000. Analysts believed that the continuing corruption investigation caused the decline in support for Doolittle.

In August 2007, former Placer County Republican Party chairman Ken Campbell, a longtime financial backer of Doolittle, said he was withdrawing his support. Campbell cited a recent Club for Growth report on votes in 2007 on spending bills, where Doolittle scored 2 percent, compared to the Republican average of 43 percent.

In July 2007, Eric Egland, a 37-year-old Air Force reservist and security consultant, announced that he would seek the Republican nomination for the seat held by Doolittle. In August 2007, Auburn City Councilman Mike Holmes announced that he also was entering the 2008 race. Holmes ran unsuccessfully against Doolittle in the primary for the Republican nomination in 2006, getting 33 percent of the primary vote to 67 percent for Doolittle.

On August 30, 2007, State Assemblyman Ted Gaines announced the establishment of an exploratory committee to begin raising money to run for Congress against Doolittle, stating &quot;I think voters have lost faith in his leadership ability ... when you lose the moral ability to lead, you kind of have to re-evaluate.&quot;

Doolittle said, &quot;After spending the last month talking to local voters, I have seen strong support for my candidacy and a strong desire to focus on solving problems instead of plotting for political advantage ... I will gladly place before the voters my record of over 30 years of service to the Republican Party to Ted Gaines&#x27; less than one year.&quot;

After much speculation, on January 10, 2008, John Doolittle announced he would finish his current term, but would not run for re-election.

After Doolittle&#x27;s retirement announcement, Councilman Holmes quit the race and instead endorsed former Republican Congressman Doug Ose, who announced on February 1, 2008, that he is running for Doolittle&#x27;s seat. Ose faced opposition from former California State Senator Rico Oller (R-San Andreas), who announced his candidacy on January 10, 2008. When California State Senator Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) announced that he too was running for Doolittle&#x27;s seat on March 4, 2008, Oller dropped out of the race, and decided to give his endorsement to McClintock. Although he didn&#x27;t live in the district, McClintock beat Charlie Brown in the general election by only 1,800 votes.

<text>Philodromidae, also known as philodromid crab spiders and running crab spiders, is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Tord Tamerlan Teodor Thorell in 1870 (then known as subfamily Philodrominae within Thomisidae). It contains over 500 species in thirty genera.

The most common genus is &quot;Philodromus&quot; which is widespread, similar to &quot;Ebo&quot;. Other common genera include the elongate grass-dwelling &quot;Tibellus&quot; and the widespread &quot;Thanatus&quot;, which includes the house crab spider that commonly captures flies on and in buildings.

== Description ==
Philodromids have a crab-like shape due to the first two pairs of legs being oriented sideways (laterigrade). This is superficially similar to the &quot;true&quot; crab spiders (Thomisidae), such as &quot;Misumena vatia,&quot; but these families are not as closely related as previously thought. Unlike crab spiders, the legs are generally similar in size, though the second leg pair may be significantly longer than the first pair. This is most evident in &quot;Ebo&quot;, where the second pair of legs are twice as long as the first pair in some species. Philodromids have scopula only at the tips of the tarsi (unlike sparassids) and the eyes are in two curved rows with the posterior row wider than the anterior row. In terms of colouration, they are usually cream to light brown and have faint longitudinal stripes.

== Ecology ==
Philodromidae are active predators and often occur on the stems and leaves of plants. Some occur only on deciduous trees and others only on conifers. A small number of species live in deserts. Instead of building webs to catch prey, they hunt by ambush.

<text>A bobblehead, also known by nicknames such as nodder, wobbler, or wacky wobbler, is a type of small collectible figurine. Its head is often oversized compared to its body. Instead of a solid connection, its head is connected to the body by a spring or hook in such a way that a light tap will cause the head to move around, or &quot;bobble,&quot; hence the name.

==History==

During the seventeenth century, figurines of Buddha and other religious figures called &quot;temple nodders&quot; were produced in Asia. The earliest known Western reference to a bobblehead is thought to be in Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s 1842 short story &quot;The Overcoat,&quot; in which the main character&#x27;s neck was described as being &quot;like the necks of plaster cats that wag their heads.&quot; During the nineteenth century, bisque porcelain bobbleheads were made in limited quantities for the US market. Many of the bobbleheads in the US were produced in Germany, with an increase in imports during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1950s, bobbleheads had a substantial surge in popularity, with items made of either plastic or bisque porcelain.

By 1960, Major League Baseball (MLB) produced a series of papier-mâché Bobblehead dolls, one for each team, all with the same cherubic face, and a few select players over time. The World Series held that year brought the first player-specific baseball bobbleheads, for Roberto Clemente, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Willie Mays, still all with the same face. Over the next decade, bobbleheads were also made of ceramic. Within a few years, they would be produced for other sports as well as cartoon characters. One of the most famous bobbleheads of all time also hails from this era: the Beatles bobblehead set, which is a valuable collectible today.

The subsequent increase in popularity was in the late 1990s. Although older bobbleheads such as the baseball teams and the Beatles were sought after by collectors during this period, new bobblehead dolls were uncommon. Prompting their resurgence were cheaper manufacturing processes, and the primary bobblehead material switched, this time from ceramic to plastic. Making bobbleheads in the limited numbers necessary to become viable collectibles was now possible. On August 2, 1997, the Birmingham Barons gave away the Barons Bobblehead Doll Bobbleheads at a game. The first MLB team to offer a bobblehead giveaway was the San Francisco Giants, which distributed 35,000 Willie Mays head nodders at their May 9, 1999 game.

The variety of bobbleheads has grown to include even relatively obscure popular culture figures and notable people. The new millennium brought a new type of bobblehead toy. This mini-bobblehead was two or three inches tall and used for gifts in some packaged foods. Post Cereals packaged 22 million mini-bobble heads of MLB players with its cereal before opening day in 2002.

On November 18, 2014, it was announced that the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum would open in 2016 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum held a preview exhibit at RedLine Milwaukee from January 7, 2016, to April 30, 2016, which showcased the largest public display of bobbleheads in history. The 2000s also saw the rise of a competitive market for personalized, on-demand bobbleheads, typically 6–7 inches tall, from several online vendors. In 2015, the Pope Francis bobblehead became so popular that a nationwide shortage was reported.

January 7, 2015, was the inaugural National Bobblehead Day in the US. In 2016, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; mark for the world&#x27;s largest bobblehead was set at 15 feet, 4 inches tall. Named &quot;Goldie,&quot; St. Bernard, the mascot of Applied Underwriters, was created for Applied Underwriters, designed by Nate Wells, and constructed by Dino Rentos and BobbleHeads.com.

===Thanjavur dolls of India===
Thanjavur dolls are a type of Indian bobblehead doll known as &quot;Thanjavur Thalayatti Bommai&quot; in the Tamil language, meaning &quot;Tanjore Head-Shaking Doll.&quot; They are a native art form in the Thanjavur region of Tamil Nadu. These dolls are usually 6&quot; to 12&quot; tall (15 to 30 cm). They are made of clay or wood and painted over in bright colors, and they are often dressed up in fancy clothes. They form part of an elaborate display of dolls known as &quot;Golu (kolu),&quot; exhibited in Indian houses during the &quot;Dasara (Navaratri)&quot; festival in September-October. These dolls are examples of how to start separating the movements of three distinct parts of the body, namely the head, torso, and hip and skirt parts.

A different version of these, &#x27;Thalayatti Bommai,&#x27; is the king and queen versions. The purpose is to show that the semi-circular bottoms, filled with sands, do not topple with a structure that is sharply raised, a mode that is used in building the Thanjavur Peruvudaiyar Kovil. The recent excavations near the temple&#x27;s walls show bases filled with sands of different colors, indicating that the temple&#x27;s architecture has much more planning than the simple stacking of heavy stones.

==In popular culture==
* Sports teams sometimes give away bobblehead dolls at their games; for example, the Los Angeles Kings gave away bobbleheads commemorating Luc Robitaille&#x27;s induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame.
* In the 1986 &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Mets&quot; music video, there is a scene where Joe Piscopo, standing outside the New York Mets&#x27; dugout at Shea Stadium, taps four Mets bobblehead dolls, then goes into the dugout and taps the heads of four actual Mets players (Howard Johnson, Bob Ojeda, Rick Aguilera, and Kevin Mitchell), who &quot;bobble&quot; their heads in a similar fashion. Piscopo then attempts to tap a fifth player (Lee Mazzilli) but is rebuffed and subsequently tackled by all of the players.
* In 2001, Audi broadcast commercials in Europe featuring an Elvis impersonator and a prototypical Wackel-Elvis (&quot;Wobble Elvis&quot; or &quot;Wobbly Elvis&quot;) dashboard figure with a wobbling left arm and hip.

<doc id="408627" wikidata="Q1246446" url="?curid=408627" title="Carmen Saeculare">
<text>The Carmen saeculare (&quot;Song of the ages&quot;) is a Latin hymn written by Horace and commissioned by Augustus. It was sung by a choir of girls and boys at the secular games in 17 BC. It is written in Sapphic meter and follows the themes of the poets of the day, in particular Vergil.

The poem is a prayer dedicated to Diana and Apollo, and secondarily to Jupiter and Juno. It asks for their protection of Rome and its laws, as well as their favor in granting descendants to the Roman people. For Horace, prosperity and wealth returned to the city after Augustus took power and established peace. Making references to Aeneas and Romulus, he celebrates the reign of Augustus, which brought in a new era and ensured the future of Rome.

This poem marked Horace&#x27;s return to lyrical poetry and raised him to the level of national poet.

== History ==

=== The secular games of 17 BC ===
After his return from the east in 19 BC, Augustus established laws regarding the family and adultery. He then held celebration of the secular games in 17 BC. These celebrations were to be held every , or the maximum human lifespan, which Romans considered to be one hundred or one hundred and ten years. But the term was interpreted more generally to denote an era and were not held at a regular period. It is difficult to find evidence for a continuing tradition. The games were celebrated with a song in 294 BC during the First Punic war and later in the 140s. Soon before the Augustan secular games, a tradition was discovered supposedly discovered in ancient texts, dating back to 456 BC, with a period of 110 years (which would make the correct date 16 BC). However, it is not certain that these texts were authentic or partly composed to provide a reason for holding a celebration in that year.

We know about the games of 17 BC from descriptions by Phlegon and Zosimus, the latter passing on the sibylline oracle which supposedly instituted the ritual. This information is supplemented by an epigraphic document, the , a record of the ceremonies. Originally, the celebrations, dedicated to Dis Pater and Proserpine, were held over three nights; in Augustus&#x27; time, the quindecemviri added daytime ceremonies. Sacrifices were shared between Augustus and Agrippa. On the first night, from May 31 to June 1, 17 B.C., sacrifices were made to the Fates on the banks of the Tiber. The following day saw a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, likely at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. On the second night, gifts were offered to Ilithyia, and during the day, a sacrifice was made to Juno on the Capitol. Finally, on the third night, a sow is sacrificed to Mother Earth; during the day, offerings are made to Apollo and Diana on the Palatine. After the last offering, Horace&#x27;s poem was performed.

The poem was commissioned by Augustus for the secular games. Horace&#x27;s initial relationship with Augustus was facilitated by Gaius Maecenas, to whom he was introduced by Vergil and Varius. Maecenas at first figured highly in Horace&#x27;s poetry, but his significance diminished in Horace&#x27;s later writings. This is likely due to Horace becoming closer to Augustus, with whom he was quite close. While Augustus commissioned the poem and influenced its subject matter, Horace maintained a degree of artistic independence.

=== Performance and publication ===
The is unique in the knowledge the circumstances surrounding its performance. According to Alessandro Barchiesi, it is &quot;the only surviving poem in Latin of which we know time and place of a choral performance, and independent evidence confirms that this definitely happened&quot;. The proceedings were recorded with the following inscription:
&lt;poem&gt;Sacrificio perfecto puer. [X]XVII quibus denuntiatum erat patrimi et matrimi et puellae totidem
carmen cecinerunt; eo[de]m modo in Capitolio.
Carmen composuit Q. Hor[at]ius Flaccus&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;With the sacrifice completed, 27 boys and the same number of girls known to have their mothers and fathers sung a song, and again on the Capitoline. The song was written by Q. Horatius Flaccus.&lt;/poem&gt;


The poem was recited by a mixed choir, i.e. composed of both boys and girls, which was very rare in the Greek choral tradition, and the Sibylline oracle suggested that for certain parts of the poem, the singing would be done by only the boys or girls. The suggested allotments vary, but one proposed by Peter L. Schmidt is the following:

* Full chorus: stanzas 1, 2 and 19;
* Boys: stanza 3; verses 33-34 in stanza 9; stanzas 10-14, and 16-17;
* Girls: stanzas 4-8; verses 35-36 in stanza 9; and stanzas 15 and 18.

The poem was performed at the Temple of Apollo Palatinus. It may also have been performed at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, either in procession or a second time. The poem&#x27;s performance was separate from the religious celebrations and ceremonies of the secular games, and was sung once they had been completed. It was also published as a separate work from Horace&#x27;s Odes, instead of in their fourth book, which followed the performance by several years.

=== Structure ===
The poem is made up of 19 stanzas in sapphic meter, or 76 verses. This meter is the simplest used by Horace in his lyric poems, making it easier for the chorus and audience to understand and remember.

Jacques Perret proposed the following structure for the poem&#x27;s stanzas:

* the first 3 stanzas to Apollo and Diana
* the next 5 for the nocturnal divinities (Lucina or Ilithyia, the Parcae and Tellus)
* the next stanza to Apollo and Diana
* the next six to the capitoline divinities
* the next three to Apollo and Diana
* the final stanza to &quot;Jupiter deique cuncti&quot; (Jupiter and all the gods)

Eduard Fraenkel, following Johannes Vahlen and Theodor Mommsen divides the poem into two halves, separated by line 37. The first half concerns the &quot;physical conditions of Rome&#x27;s welfare&quot;, and its moral and political aspects are addressed in the second half.

Finally, Michael Putnam describes the first and ninth stanzas as &quot;fram[ing] the ode&#x27;s initial half&quot;, with their mentions of Apollo and Diana beginning and ending it.

=== Influences ===
The &quot;Carmen saeculare&quot; follows the tradition of the Greek paean, an essentially religious genre of poetry, of which the &quot;Carmen&quot; is the first known imitation in Latin. The paean mainly invokes Apollo and, to a lesser extent, Artemis, with a number of other deities also present. There are several recurrent themes: prophecy, divine justice, rituals and sacrifices. With a complex meter, it was sung at religious festivals, mainly by young men. The genre reached its highest level with poets such as Pindar in the 5th century B.C., whose sixth &quot;Paean&quot; has much in common with the &quot;Carmen saeculare.&quot;

Horace also took inspiration from Latin poetry. The &quot;Carmen saeculare&quot; shares themes with and has a style similar to the poems of Catullus, Vergil and Tibullus. Catullus and Tibullus both wrote poems dedicated to or invoking Apollo, and Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; is directly alluded to.

==Interpretations==
=== As a religious hymn ===
The Latin word , related to the word (literally &quot;I sing&quot;), denoted a poem, song or incantation: all these aspects of the word are found in the &quot;Carmen&quot;. 

==== Deities of light ====
Apollo and Diana occupy a prime place in the poem: named at the beginning and the end, but also throughout the poem, they frame it and form its structure. The aspect of light in these two deities is present in the names which Horace chose for them (Apollo is called &quot;Phoebus&quot;, i.e. &quot;bright&quot;, Diana&#x27;s name is related to the heavens); and is reinforced by the use of various expressions throughout the poem. Horace also replaces the traditional Hades and Proserpina, who represent darkness, and mentions night only once.

=== As a political poem ===
The &quot;Carmen&quot; places emphasis on Augustus&#x27; power and his connection to the gods. It also celebrates many of the new laws which Augustus put into place. However, Augustus himself is not directly mentioned in the poem, only indirectly once as the descendant of Anchises and Venus.

== Legacy ==
Horace, after the mixed success encountered by the first three books of his &quot;Odes&quot;, published in 23 B.C., decided not to write lyric poetry again. Thus it is likely, without being commissioned to write the &quot;Carmen saeculare&quot;, Horace would not have composed the fourth book of his &quot;Odes&quot;, several years later, and would have followed through with his decision to cease to write lyric poetry altogether.

=== Later mentions ===
Like other poems of Horace, manuscripts from different eras show that the &quot;Carmen saeculare&quot; continued to be read well after it was written. It is known through medieval manuscripts and was occasionally cited by grammarians of late antiquity. It was also imitated by Conrad Celtes who composed a poem of the same name.

The poem has twice been set to music:

* In the Middle ages is found a neume for the &quot;Carmen saeculare.&quot;
* A version first performed at the Freemasons&#x27; Hall in London, written by François-André Danican Philidor.

Voltaire wrote that &quot;Horace&#x27;s secular poem is one of the most beautiful pieces of antiquity&quot;.

<doc id="408629" wikidata="Q3006978" url="?curid=408629" title="Cuisine of Quebec">
<text>The cuisine of Québec (also called &quot;French Canadian cuisine&quot; or &quot;cuisine québécoise&quot;) is a national cuisine in the Canadian province of Québec. It is also cooked by Franco-Ontarians.

Québec&#x27;s cuisine descended from 17th-century French cuisine and began to develop in New France from the labour-intensive nature of colonial life, the seasonality of ingredients and the need to conserve resources. It has been influenced by the province&#x27;s history of fur trading and hunting, as well as Québec&#x27;s winters, soil fertility, teachings from First Nations, British cuisine, American cuisine, historical trade relations and some immigrant cuisines.

Québec is home to many unique dishes and is most famous for its poutine, &quot;tourtières&quot;, &quot;pâté chinois&quot;, pea soup, &quot;fèves au lard&quot;, &quot;cretons&quot; and desserts such as &quot;grands-pères&quot;, &quot;pouding chômeur&quot; and St. Catherine&#x27;s taffy. Québec&#x27;s unique dishes are the traditional fare of the holidays, as well as the &quot;temps des sucres&quot;, a time in March where families go to sugar shacks.

Québec is known for being the biggest producer of maple syrup on the planet, as 72% of the maple syrup sold in the world (and 90% sold in Canada) originates from Québec. The province is also recognized for having created over 700 different kinds of cheese, some of which have won international contests.

Food critic Jacob Richler wrote that Québec&#x27;s cuisine is better defined than that of the rest of Canada, due to its language barrier with the dominant culture of the United States and having had more time to develop. Conversely, Québec&#x27;s cuisine and Acadian cuisine have much in common due to proximity and a shared language and history.

== History ==
The cuisine of Québec evolved from that of 17th-century Northern France. It also retains some heritage from Poitevin cuisine: many Québecois make &quot;pâté marmite&quot;; &quot;soupe aux gourganes&quot;, which is based on &quot;gourgane&quot; beans, a strain of fava bean; and soups based on other legumes. Charentaise chowders (&quot;chaudrées charentaises&quot;) have evolved into the &quot;quiaudes&quot; of Gaspesia and the &quot;tourtes salées&quot; of Poitiers into &quot;tourtières&quot;.

Other foods that originate from France are &quot;pot-au-feu&quot;; blood sausage (&quot;boudin&quot;); head cheese (&quot;tête fromagée&quot;); &quot;plorine&quot; sausages; ham hock stew (&quot;ragoût de pattes de cochon&quot;); rabbit stew (&quot;civet de lapin&quot;); French toast (&quot;pain perdu&quot; or &quot;pain doré&quot;); and pastries like crêpes, beignets, &quot;croquignole&quot; biscuits, and tarts. As in France, pork is the most popular meat.

From the moment they arrived in the early 17th century, French colonists always preferred their native cuisine. However, they learned some culinary techniques from the Algonquins, Atikamekw and Iroquois. The most important ones were &quot;l’acériculture&quot; (the process of harvesting maple sap and creating maple syrup), ice fishing, and &quot;boucanage&quot; (in which fish or other meat is smoked for preservation and flavour).

Food preservation was always important in pioneer times, due to long winters and to the frequent voyages of &quot;coureurs des bois&quot;. Butter, herbs, and lard were used for seasoning and salting. Pork and fish were &quot;boucanés&quot;(smoked), while other meats and vegetables were preserved in vinegar. These techniques are still practiced today, though not for survival. As game was so plentiful, pioneers and their descendants always hunted and fished for sustenance.

By the 1670s, a substantial agrarian population had emerged in the region of Québec City, and French habits dominated. Meals almost always featured soup, bread, meat, and wine. Since the climate made it difficult to grow European grapes (namely, &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;), wines were always imported from France.

The Conquest of New France in 1760 brought some culinary changes to Québec. One of the immediate effects was the elimination of wine, as it could no longer be imported from France. Another major change was the importation of the potato, which, in only a few decades, became a staple ingredient in Québec, dethroning bread in popularity. Sugar consumption also increased. Finally, the British imported many recipes like mashed potatoes, crumble, and meat pies.

Because tensions with the young United States alleviated, the period following the Aroostook War in 1839 saw increased interaction between Québec and New England. Some recipes inspired by the cultural exchange included &quot;fèves au lard&quot;, &quot;ketchup maison&quot;, and date squares. The socio-economic standing of French Canadians also fell to deplorable levels; the intense poverty pushed them to simplify their meals. Recipes for bouillon were now almost nothing more than warm water. Alcoholic beverages were rarely consumed, and butter was either used sparingly or absent. Some famine foods like &quot;ploye&quot; emerged during this period.

By the early 1900s, conditions had improved somewhat, though French Canadians were still poor. Most families would often eat a mix of potatoes and pork on their plate, which is still a staple combination today. During this period, the passenger pigeon, called &quot;tourte&quot; in French, also became extinct. Because this bird&#x27;s meat had been used to fill the pie-like dishes known as &quot;tourtières&quot;, the &quot;tourtière&quot; recipe had to change. Farm-raised meats like beef and pork were usually chosen as the substitutes.

The Great Depression of the 1930s saw the creation of new recipes like &quot;pâté chinois&quot; (&quot;Chinese pie&quot;) and &quot;pouding chômeur&quot; (&quot;unemployed man&#x27;s pudding&quot;) that were delicious and cost-conscious. Immigration after this period diversified; immigrants no longer came only from the British Isles but also from other parts of Europe. Jewish specialties like bagels and Eastern Europe-style smoked meat became popular, resulting in the creation of Montréal-style smoked meat and Montréal-style bagels.

The 1950s saw many changes in the eating habits of the Québécois for a variety of reasons: the popularity of fast-food grew enormously, raw milk was banned, and many fruits and vegetables became available year-round thanks to refrigerators and larger supply chains. As a result, the homemade &quot;pain de ménage&quot; was replaced with store-bought sandwich bread; many old cheese recipes were abandoned and new ones created; and spaghetti, pizza, turkey, bacon, sausages, industrial cheeses, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, coleslaw and lobster rolls all become popular.

In the late 1950s, these changes brought about the creation of poutine—arguably the most famous Québécois dish—as well as other dishes, like &quot;hot chicken&quot; and &quot;guédilles&quot;.

The Quiet Revolution of the 1960s to 1970s greatly improved the socio-economic standing of French Canadians. This allowed them to have a more diverse diet. It also set the stage for high-quality products to be created in Québec and for the emergence of Québécois restaurants, for example Lafleur, Valentine, La Belle Province or St-Hubert.

From the 1980s to today, a desire for higher quality foods, more spending power, and an influence by immigrants from Europe —particularly Italy, Greece, France and Portugal— has led to the rise of the creation and production of high-quality cheeses and alcoholic beverages across Québec, as well as a return to recipes of the &quot;terroir&quot;. Immigration from Greece has popularized gyros and brought about slouvaki pitas. Immigrants from Lebanon have popularized shawarmas which has created &quot;shish taouk&quot;. Finally, NAFTA and the new culture of Quebecers vacationing south has resulted in the adoption of Western-style sushi and Tex-Mex dishes like nachos, fajitas, salsa, chili and burritos.

== Ingredients ==
=== Game, seafood, and fish ===
Historical poverty led many families in Québec to hunt for food until the mid 20th century. &quot;Tourtières&quot; were stuffed with the meat of the &quot;tourte&quot;, or passenger pigeon, which used to be common and easy prey. But, by the early 20th century, the passenger pigeon became extinct due to overhunting, deforestation, and the Allee effect. Families had to replace the meat with whatever they had. As a result, most modern &quot;tourtières&quot; are filled with beef or pork.

Today, the consumption of game remains a tradition, although game is not sold in grocery stores. When available, Québécois eat meat from moose, deer, hares, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, waterfowl and more rather than that of livestock. Game is also sometimes given as a gift.
As for seafood, lobster and crab are caught in Gaspesia, la Côte-Nord, and the Magdalen Islands to be sold to the rest of Québec. Shrimp is often marketed as &quot;crevette de Matane&quot; after the shrimp-processing factory in the town of Matane. However, the shrimp themselves are caught in several villages on the Saint Lawrence River estuary. Mussels, oysters, scallops, and whelks (&quot;bourgots&quot;) are also caught.

Salmon and trout are the most popular fish in Québec. The brook trout is nearly ubiquitous, salmon is farmed and can be caught in 118 different rivers, and Arctic char is present across nearly 100 lakes. Other fished species include lake trout, yellow perch, walleye, muskellunge, Northern pike, micropterus, rainbow smelt, Greenland halibut, mackerel, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, Atlantic cod (Eastern Québec), Atlantic herring (Eastern Québec), American eel (between Trois-Rivières and Cap-Chat), &quot;ouananiche&quot; (a kind of freshwater salmon; Lac Saint-Jean), frostfish (Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade), deepwater redfish (Saguenay fjords), capelin (coastal villages), and brown bullhead (Îles de Sorel).

Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade holds a world-renowned festival every December to February called &quot;La pêche des petits poisons des chenaux,&quot; where ice fishers catch tomcods. Historically, starving French colonists learned ice fishing techniques from the Atikamekw—a privilege, as the technique was kept a secret from neighbouring First Nations.

=== Livestock ===
Pork is the meat used most often in Québécois recipes. Beef is also commonly used but has been losing popularity in recent years. In summer, beef commonly features in barbecues.

Québécois pigs are mostly hybrids of the Duroc, Yorkshire, and American Landrace breeds. The cattle are also hybrids of many breeds; the Aberdeen Angus, Charolais, and Limousin are the most common. Despite the large cattle population, Québec imports most of its beef from the Canadian West, using its own cattle mostly for dairy. Milk production is dominated by the Holstein, but Jersey or Brown Swiss cows are also milked.

Poultry is commonly consumed. Chicken is the most popular by far, but turkey and duck are also consumed. Chicken eggs are very popular and mostly used at breakfast and to make pastries. Turkey is traditionally served at Christmas and Thanksgiving with croutons and sage. The Estrie region has produced duck since the early 20th century. Québec is also the only producer of &quot;foie gras&quot; in Canada, as well as its largest producer in North America.

Horse is eaten marginally- by less than 1% of Quebecois. Its consumption is considered taboo, though it is not illegal.

Other meats include lamb, veal, rabbit, bison, elk and frog legs (from American bullfrogs and leopard frogs).

=== Spices, sweeteners and cereals ===
Spices common in traditional recipes are linked to local production and historical commerce: salt, savory, cloves, cinnamon, parsley, thyme, sage, nutmeg, &quot;quatres épices&quot;, chives, garlic, oregano and bay leaf. Thanks to globalisation, a wider selection of international spices are available today, like turmeric, curry powder, allspice, cumin, cayenne pepper, etc. In recent years, chefs have attempted to create excitement for the flavours of the boreal forest; among them are green alder pepper, sweetfern, caraway seed, sweetgale, and juniper berry.

The types of sugar used are white sugar, brown sugar and maple sugar. Maple syrup is used to sweeten breakfasts, meats, and pastries. Honey is almost exclusively used for desserts, but it is also used as toast spread. Molasses and raisins are common ingredients in traditional recipes because of historical commerce with the Antilles and Brazil.

Traditional and most common cereals are wheat, rice, oat and buckwheat. Buckwheat became popular because it could grow well on the Canadian Shield. Nowadays, a few other cereals have managed to gain a small presence: quinoa, wild rice, chia seeds, and barley.

=== Fruits and vegetables ===
The most commonly used vegetables in traditional Québécois cuisine were those that can easily be preserved to last throughout the winter, either kept in a cool storage area like a root cellar or brined in jars. These vegetables are potato, onion, carrot, beet, pumpkin, squash (butternut, spaghetti, accorn, etc.), zucchini, beans, cabbage, turnip, and corn. In modern times, Québécois also cook with store-bought tomato, bell pepper, cucumber, lettuce, asparagus, cauliflower, broccoli, avocado, microgreens, radish, shallot, spinach, parsnip, eggplant, artichoke, kale, leek, rutabaga, sweet potato, celery, lentil, peanut, soybean, chickpea and others. Rhubarb is typically grown in backyard gardens. Fiddleheads are gathered from the wild in the spring.

Frequently eaten berries are the blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, grape, cherry and cranberry. The goldenberry is uncommonly imported from South America. Cloudberries only grow in the wilds of the boreal forest, but are still gathered seasonally in northern communities. Finally, as these plants were banned on the continent in the early 20th century and were, with time, forgotten, all types of gooseberries or currants are virtually unknown to Quebecers.

Other important locally-grown fruits are the apple, pear, plum, cantaloupe and watermelon. The most eaten imported fruits are: banana, orange, lemon, lime, kiwi, coconut, mango, clementine and pineapple. Other imported -but less popular- fruits include: pomegranate, grapefruit, starfruit, papaya, dragonfruit, passionfruit, fig and others.

Mushrooms have long been absent from Québec&#x27;s traditional cuisine. However, they are present now, and almost always of the cremini variety. In recent years, morchella, chanterelle, shiitake and enokis mushrooms have also gained a small presence.

==Fast food==
The idea of fast food was quietly introduced to Quebec from the United States during the early 20th century. At first, it was sold from food trucks or carts pulled by horses who would park next to factories to sell quick cheap meals to factory workers. They were called &quot;casse-croutes&quot; or &quot;cantines&quot; and run by local entrepreneurs. They would usually only sell a few items, like fries and hot-dogs. In 1940, there were around 200 of these mobile distributors around Montreal factories. Cantines as actual restaurants began to appear in the 1930s. These had wider menus serving fast food staples like hamburgers, hot-dogs, fries and club sandwiches, alongside some traditional meals like pea soup, pouding chômeur, etc.

Following the Second World War, the popularity of fast food grew enormously, aided by the rise of the automobile. The post-war years also saw the popularization of pizzerias serving American pizzas, chicken rotisseries, and breakfast restaurants serving English breakfasts.

Quebecois tastes popularized certain techniques or foods that are not found or are uncommon in the rest of North America. For example, steamed hot dogs (&quot;steamies&quot;) are popular here, and it&#x27;s the norm to ask customers for their cooking preference. Steamies are usually topped with coleslaw, sweet yellow mustard, onion and/or sweet relish, but topping options can be more expansive. Another example is that the typical American industrial gravy is not used, instead brown gravy is favored, which is made from dehydrated chicken and beef along with spices, animal fat and vinegar. A lightly spiced chicken stock is also used and called &quot;sauce barbecue&quot;. These were made to cover French fries (known as frite-sauce) and dishes such as hot chicken (chicken between two slices of bread covered with peas) or hot hamburger (an untopped hamburger covered with sauce and peas). Brown gravy also came to be used in Quebec&#x27;s most emblematic fast-food dish poutine when it was invented.

Casse-croutes are still very common today (in 2016, there were over 1400), but they now also compete with large chains from the US and native chains from Quebec like Valentine, La Belle Province, Ashton, Saint-Hubert, etc. Nowadays, foods usually served in Quebec fast-food establishments include: poutine and its variants, steamies, Michigan hot dog, &quot;pain à la viande&quot; (onions and ground meat on a hot-dog bun), &quot;frites-sauce&quot;, hot chicken, hot hamburger, hamburgers, pogos, onion rings, fries, coleslaw, spaghetti, caesar salad, pizza and its variants, the combination meals of pizza-ghetti and pizza-caesar, sandwiches, submarine sandwiches, club sandwiches, Montreal smoked meat sandwiches and platters, shawarmas and a Quebec variant called &quot;shish taouk&quot;, gyros and the Quebec exclusive &quot;souvlaki pita&quot;, roasted chicken, chicken fingers, lasagna, mac n cheese, grilled cheese, fish n chip, &quot;guedilles&quot; (lobster roll), cheese sticks, chicken wings, ice cream, and finally soft drinks.

=== Poutine variants ===
The classic Poutine is composed of fresh French fries and fresh cheese curds topped with hot brown gravy in a shallow bowl. The cheese curds are usually at room temperature to prevent them from melting and losing their elasticity or &quot;squeakiness&quot;. Poutine emerged in the Centre-du-Québec area in the late 1950s. Its precise origins are uncertain as there are several cities and towns claiming to have invented the dish.

For many years, it was perceived negatively by English Canadians and mocked in English Canada. It was even used by some to stigmatize Québec society. But, it later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture and the province of Québec. It has long been associated with Québec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to its popularity in the rest of Canada, in the northern United States, and internationally. Poutine has been called &quot;Canada&#x27;s national dish&quot; though many believe this is cultural appropriation of Québécois and Québec&#x27;s national identity, especially since Canada has mocked Québec for it, in the not-so-distant past. 

Because variants on the classic poutine have become widespread, many now consider poutine to be a dish class of its own. Some of the most commonly seen variants include: chicken poutine (chicken is added), hot dog poutine (hot dog is added), pulled pork poutine (pulled pork is added), smoked meat poutine (Montréal smoked meat is added), galvaude poutine (adds peas and turkey, and is associated with maritime Québec), all-dressed poutine (adds ingredients to imitate an all-dressed pizza), &quot;Italian&quot; poutine (which replaces gravy with bolognese sauce), and lobster poutine (lobster is added and gravy is substituted). Menus who list variants on the classic poutine can vary wildly between restaurants. Establishments who specialise in poutines usually offer many variants and are called &quot;poutineries&quot;.

== Cheeses ==

When Canada was part of the French Empire, colonials used their Canadienne cattle to create a variety of soft, semi-soft and soft-ripened cheeses to eat. Following the Conquest of New France, the British began importing hard cheeses like Cheddar.

In the 1960s, the banning of crude milk made most of the old cheese-making techniques and recipes, which up to that point had been successfully passed on for centuries, disappear and become forgotten. Only a few recipes remain. The Saint-Pierre, produced on l&#x27;île d’Orléans, has the honour of being the oldest North American cheese. It is a soft-ripened cheese sold under the forms of la Faisselle, le Paillasson or le Raffiné. The Cailles cheese, a cheese made from fermented milk and typically used in salads, also used to be quite widespread. It now only exists in the Charlevoix and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean regions. Nowadays, there are attempts to diversify the ways in which Cailles is consumed.

There are some cheeses that were created by priests. Towards the end of the 19th century, a group of trappist monks were expelled from France and moved to Oka. One of them, who originated from Notre-Dame-du-Port-du-Salut, created a paste which was eventually used to mold the first Oka cheese. Benedictines were responsible for creating l’Ermite, a blue cheese, in 1943 at Saint-Benoît-du-Lac.

Today, Québec creates over 700 different kinds of cheeses and is the biggest cheese producer in Canada. Québecers enjoy many natively produced and imported hard cheeses, including hard cheeses flavored with beer or wine. Most soft cheeses are produced locally and many are artisanal.

== Maple syrup ==
Québec produces 72% of the maple syrup sold on Earth and 90% of the maple syrup sold in Canada. Maple syrup is made from heated maple sap. The syrup is often used at breakfast to cover &quot;crêpes&quot; and &quot;pain doré&quot;, and as a component of &quot;fèves au lard&quot;. It can also be used to caramelize meats like ham, to stabilize the acidity of certain sauces, and to complement desserts. It is the main ingredient showcased in sugar shacks.

Many maple syrup-derived products exist. &quot;Tire&quot;, French for sugar on snow, is heated maple syrup that is cast onto a flat bed of snow and then rolled up onto a Popsicle stick. &quot;Tire&quot; is very popular at sugar shacks and during springtime. Maple butter is a spread commonly used at breakfast on toast. Maple sugar can serve as a replacement to brown and white sugar.

== Meat ==

=== Smoked meat ===

In Québec, a technique called&quot; boucanage&quot; is sometimes used to smoke meat.

Colonials learned this technique from First Peoples. After they discovered that it was useful for preserving food, they decided to start smoking their meat in the &quot;boucanage&quot; fashion, following their usual brining and/or spicing. First Peoples, on the other hand, continued to only &quot;boucaner&quot; and never started brining or spicing. Today, Québecers still eat food that has been &quot;boucané&quot; for its taste.

Establishments called &quot;boucanières&quot; or &quot;boucaneries&quot; are specialized in the process. Modern &quot;boucanières&quot; can also use tree essences to infuse a certain taste in the meat, with maple wood being the most popular choice. A technique called &quot;boucaner à froid&quot; has also been developed; it involves drying fish and then suspending them over a fire. &quot;Boucaner à froid&quot; has always been popular in the Gaspesia, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Côte-Nord regions since fish were and are still commonly caught there.
In the 1930s, Jewish immigrants came to Montréal and introduced their own Eastern European meat-smoking technique to Québec. This technique is often used today to make Montréal smoked meat, which is then often cut up in narrow slices to be added to dishes as an ingredient. Montréal smoked meat is also often spiced with Montréal steak spice and used to make Montréal smoked meat sandwiches.

Smoked salmon has become more popular in recent decades due to influence from the United States and Europe. Smoked pork&#x27;s popularity has decreased and it is now almost exclusively consumed during Easter.

=== Charcuterie ===
In Quebec, &quot;charcuterie&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;cochonailles&quot;. It includes:
* &quot;Creton&quot; is composed of ground pork, lard, milk and cereal that is cooked together to obtain a creamy paste. &quot;Cretons&quot; are often eaten as a snack or for breakfast on roasted bread pieces called &quot;rôties&quot;. If another kind of meat is used to create &quot;cretons&quot;, like poultry or veal, it is called &quot;cretonnade&quot; instead.
* &quot;Tête fromagée&quot; is less popular but used in the same way as &quot;cretons&quot;.
* The &quot;boudin&quot; of Québec is made of lard, milk, onions and pork blood. It is served in a pan along with a sweet side or a sauce. Since 2018, the Goûte-Boudin de Boucherville association hands out a yearly prize for the best &quot;boudin&quot;.
* &quot;Plorines&quot; are composed of lard and flavoured meat enveloped in pork caul fat. Sometimes &quot;plorine&quot; recipes can also include eggs, beef and/or bread.
* &quot;Oreilles de Christ&quot; are lard pieces that are fried until crispy. They are eaten as an &quot;amuse-gueule&quot; and sometimes with maple syrup.

== Pastries ==
Here are some pastries popular in Quebec:
* &quot;Crêpes&quot; and pancakes are popular breakfast items. They are often served with maple syrup and/or fruits.
* Doughnuts. The doughnut holes are eaten as well with powdered sugar or icing on top.
* Pies. The most popular kinds are sugar-based, like &quot;tarte au sucre&quot;, or fruit-based, like blueberry, apple, strawberry, or raspberry. 
*Cakes. Popular kinds include carrot cake and chocolate cake.
* &quot;Sucre à la crème&quot; is a fudge-like sweet.
* &quot;Pets-de-sœur&quot; and cinnamon rolls are both popular and spiral-shapped.
* &quot;Chocolatines&quot; consist of small &quot;croissants&quot; with chocolate inside.
* &quot;Pouding chomeur&quot; is a white cake soaked in maple syrup or brown sugar.
* &quot;Grands-pères&quot;, a spherical cake that is eaten plain, with maple syrup, or filled with fruits.
* Éclairs, an oblong pastry stuffed with cream and topped with chocolate.
* Macarons are a sandwich-shaped meringue-based sweet.
*Mille-feuilles are a layered puff pastry.
*&quot;Croquignoles&quot; are braided, twisted or rectangular fried dough pastries. They may be found in rural regions.

== Regional foods ==
Some regions of Québec are known for specific foods or products. Montréal is known for having created Montréal-style smoked meat, Montréal-style bagels, Montréal hot dogs (also called &quot;steamies&quot;), and Montréal melons. The Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region is the birthplace of the tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean, soupe aux gourganes and Saguenay Dry.

Maritime Quebec, known for its fish and seafood, is a region where cipaille is consumed during the holidays. &quot;Pot-en-pot des îles de la Madeleine&quot; is a dish of the Magdellan Islands.

Some municipalities are associated with high-quality meat, such as duck from lake Brome or Charlevoix lamb.

== Strains and breeds ==

=== Strains ===
Over the centuries, new strains of fruits and vegetables were created in Québec. Then, in the 1900s, people moved away from a farming lifestyle. As a result, most of these have been lost. Here are some that have been preserved or rediscovered:
* The Montréal melon
* The Oka melon
* White Canadian corn
* The &quot;crotte-d’ours&quot; potato of Louis-Marie
* The Thibodeau bean of Saint-Jules
* The &quot;pomme Fameuse&quot;
* The Mémé tomato of Beauce
* The potato onion

=== Breeds ===
Though few in number now, these breeds are still used today:
* Canadienne cattle 
* Chantecler chicken

<text>Lynn Carol Woolsey (née Robinson; born November 3, 1937) is an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from California from 1993 to 2013. She was a member of the Democratic Party and represented California&#x27;s 6th congressional district.

During her time in Congress, Woolsey was a strong advocate for social and economic justice, and she was a vocal opponent of the Iraq War. She worked to promote universal healthcare, improve access to education, and expand workers&#x27; rights. She also authored and co-sponsored several pieces of legislation, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides job protection for workers who need time off to care for themselves or their families.

Woolsey was also a strong advocate for environmental protection and played a key role in efforts to protect the Northern California coastline. She was a co-founder of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and served as its co-chair for several years.

Prior to her time in Congress, Woolsey served on the Petaluma, California City Council, and as Mayor of Petaluma. She also worked as a high school teacher and was involved in various community organizations.

After leaving Congress, Woolsey remained active in politics and advocacy, and she continued to be involved in efforts to promote progressive causes and improve the lives of working people.

==Early life, education and career==
Woolsey was born Lynn Carol Robinson in Seattle, Washington. Woolsey graduated from Lincoln High School in 1955. She was educated at the University of Washington, where she became a member of Alpha Phi sorority, but left school early to marry Terry J. Critchett in 1958. She moved to Marin County in Northern California and enrolled at the University of San Francisco. Her husband left the family, leaving Woolsey to raise her three children alone, and they divorced in 1968. She received public assistance to make ends meet while working and finishing her education. She married David C. Woolsey in 1971, and raised another child, but that marriage also ended in divorce. She later became a human resources manager and business owner, a teacher at the College of Marin and the Dominican University of California, and a member of the Petaluma, California, City Council before running for Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Political campaigns===

In 1992, five-term Congresswoman Barbara Boxer gave up her seat to make a successful run for the Senate. Woolsey entered a nine-way Democratic primary. Seven of her opponents lived in Marin County and split that county&#x27;s vote, allowing Woolsey to win the nomination with 26 percent of the vote. In the general election, she faced Republican Assemblyman Bill Filante, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor and did not actively campaign. Woolsey won with 65 percent of the vote.

Woolsey was reelected eight times with no substantial opposition.

===Tenure===

Woolsey was ranked as the most liberal member of Congress in 2012 by That&#x27;s My Congress.

==== Welfare reform ====

She quickly made her presence known, drawing upon her experience in vocal opposition to the major welfare reform initiative negotiated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and President Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s. She later led efforts to restore programmatic funding for services such as child care, nutrition, and paid parental leave. She also passed legislation increasing the power of the IRS to enforce payment of delinquent child support.

====Iraq====

Woolsey was an outspoken opponent of the War in Iraq. On October 10, 2002, she was among 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. She took an active role in opposing continued U.S. presence, leading 15 members of Congress in writing a letter to President George W. Bush dated January 12, 2005, calling for the withdrawal of U.S. from Iraq. She also among the first Members of Congress to call for a troop withdrawal, when she introduced H.Con. Res. 35 on January 26, 2005. Woolsey gave war protester Cindy Sheehan a guest pass to attend Bush&#x27;s 2006 State of the Union speech. Sheehan&#x27;s attendance at the speech became noted when she was arrested for wearing a T-shirt with a political message. In the lead up to the 2008 elections, Woolsey, encouraged leaders of anti-war groups to field primary challenges to any Democrat who refused to support a vote ending the war in Iraq. In response, 15 members of the Blue Dog Coalition, a conservative-centrist group within the Democratic Party caucus in the House Representatives in safe seats, refused to contribute party dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Woolsey later stated that she was misunderstood, but the Blue Dogs continued the boycott.

==== Indian gaming ====

Woolsey introduced the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act on August 6, 1998. It was signed by President Clinton as Title XIV of the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act in December 2000.

Woolsey testified in support of H.R. 946, citing her approval for the clause restricting gaming on land that is &quot;taken into trust for the tribes.&quot;

Woolsey&#x27;s original bill (H.R. 4434, later H.R. 946) would not have permitted the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria to have an Indian casino. Senator Barbara Boxer removed that prohibition when she included Woolsey&#x27;s bill in the Omnibus Act.

In response, Woolsey introduced H.R. 2656 (which never left the House Resources Committee) and appeared frequently at local town-hall meetings, saying that the Miwok Indians double-crossed her by seeking to legalize gambling on their reservation.

==== Scouting for All Act ====

In September 2000, Woolsey sponsored H.R. 4892, the Scouting for All Act, to revoke the charter held by the Boy Scouts of America.

==== Recognition of Ramadan ====

On December 11, 2007, Woolsey, along with 8 other Democrats, voted ‘nay’ on a resolution to recognize the importance of &quot;Christmas and the Christian faith&quot; but did vote to &quot;recognize the commencement of Ramadan&quot;,’ a Muslim religious observance in October.

==== Health care ====

Woolsey introduced a bill to revive the public option on July 22, 2010. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the legislation would save $68 billion between 2014 and 2020.

She was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which prevents private health insurance plans from covering abortion if the plan is subsidized by tax breaks in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Education and the Workforce
**Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
**Subcommittee on Workforce Protections (Ranking Member)
*Committee on Science, Space and Technology
**Subcommittee on Energy and Environment

===Caucuses===
*Congressional Progressive Caucus (Co-chair)

== Controversies ==
===Stewart Pearson letter ===
On December 2, 2003, Woolsey wrote a letter on behalf of Stewart Pearson, the son of one of her senior aides, who had pleaded guilty to rape. In a letter written on her official congressional stationery, she asked the judge to consider mitigating circumstances and show leniency. The judge in the case was not swayed by the letter, and sentenced Pearson to eight years in prison, the maximum allowed under the plea bargain. Woolsey has apologized for writing the letter, saying she did not know all the facts; the victim did not accept her apology.

===Objection to 2004 presidential election results===
Woolsey was one of thirty-one House Democrats who voted to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election. President George W. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Darfur protest arrest===
Woolsey was arrested April 27, 2009, outside the embassy of Sudan in Washington, D.C., during a protest against genocide in Darfur. Woolsey and four other U.S. lawmakers were protesting the blocking of aid to victims. They were arrested on a charge of trespassing after they crossed a police line.

Other Democratic House members arrested were Jim McGovern, Donna Edwards, Keith Ellison and John Lewis.

==Legacy==
Woolsey&#x27;s congressional papers are preserved in Special Collections and University Archives at the Sonoma State University Library.

<doc id="408632" wikidata="Q7608444" url="?curid=408632" title="Stephanie De Sykes">
<text>Stephanie De Sykes (born Stephanie Ryton, 1948) is an English singer and actress.

==Early life==
She attended Brays Grove School in Harlow, Essex; she returned to the school for a final reunion in June 2008 as guest of honour.

==Career==
===Solo singer===
De Sykes began her career as a session singer, often releasing tracks under other names. Her first release in 1972 was &quot;Bright Shines The Light&quot; on the Polydor label, credited as &#x27;Verity&#x27;. She had her first hit in 1974 with the Roger Holman/Simon May penned &quot;Born with a Smile on My Face&quot; which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number 19 in Australia. The song featured in the ATV British TV serial &quot;Crossroads&quot;, De Sykes played a character called Holly Brown in 1974. She also recorded the theme tune to the television programme &quot;The Golden Shot&quot; with the group Rain that same year. The theme song, &quot;Golden Day&quot;, was written for them by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue. 

Around this time, the television company ATV Midlands started each day&#x27;s broadcasting with a short film accompanied by another song performed by Rain with De Sykes singing vocals, &quot;Odyssey&quot; (often incorrectly referred to as &quot;Life is a Beautiful Book&quot;). After being cast as a pop singer in the ATV soap &quot;Crossroads&quot;, De Sykes returned to the UK Top 20 as a solo artist with the song &quot;We&#x27;ll Find Our Day&quot;, a song she performed in the series which was featured at Meg Mortimer&#x27;s wedding in the UK TV soap opera in 1975. De Sykes appeared in the show as singer &#x27;Holly Brown&#x27;. She also had a starring role in the comedy &quot;Side by Side&quot;.
In 1977, she sang &quot;Cool Wind from the North&quot;, in Episode 1 of the Marc Bolan TV show, &quot;Marc&quot;.

===Groups and backing singer===
De Sykes was one of The Birds of Paris, a combination of backing singers used throughout the 1970s to add vocals to a number of disco groups and artists. The other members of the Birds of Paris included Madeline Bell, Joanne Stone, Kay Garner, Sunny Leslie, Sue Glover, Vicki Brown and Katie Kissoon.

She was once a background vocalist of Love &amp; Kisses, a concept group by producer Alec R Costandinos. She also sang with the group &quot;Sphinx&quot; and with Voyage.

===De Sykes / Slater===
De Sykes and Stuart Slater wrote two UK Eurovision Song Contest entries, Co-Co&#x27;s &quot;The Bad Old Days&quot; and Prima Donna&#x27;s &quot;Love Enough for Two&quot; in 1978 and 1980 respectively. De Sykes and Slater had one other song in the UK final, &quot;All Around The World&quot; in 1983, which was performed by Slater, ostensibly as a soloist, but with five musicians, including De Sykes on keyboards and vocals. The song placed fifth of the eight submissions.

===Later career===
Her 1979 self-penned single release &quot;Oh, What A Night For Romance&quot; was featured on the BBC1 show &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, when it was panned by the panel of Dusty Springfield, Tony Blackburn, Jonathan King and Britt Ekland who unanimously correctly predicted it would be a &#x27;miss&#x27;. De Sykes featured in a TV commercial for McVities biscuits in the 1983 Christmas period and soon after provided background vocals for Meat Loaf&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;, which included the Jim Steinman penned single, &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;.

As a human rights activist, her 2015 song &quot;Bomb Babies&quot; was chosen as the opening track for the pro-peace anti-war album &quot;Not In Our Name&quot;, a collaboration of singers and musicians, songwriters and poets.

==Personal life==
De Sykes lived with Stuart Slater (born Stuart Leslie James Slater, 14 July 1945, Liverpool), lead singer of The Mojos, with whom she had two sons: musician Toby Slater; and Barnaby Slater, a comedian, writer and producer.

She was then in a relationship with the comedian and broadcaster Angus Deayton, and was credited with some of the female vocals on the 1985 second album of his parody band, The Hee Bee Gee Bees. Their relationship broke up in the early 1990s, after he began an affair with scriptwriter Lise Mayer in 1991.

<doc id="408640" wikidata="Q966352" url="?curid=408640" title="George Miller (California politician)">
<text>George Miller III (born May 17, 1945) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from California from 1975 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the state&#x27;s 7th congressional district until redistricting in 2013 and 11th congressional district until his retirement. Miller served as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee from 1991 to 1995 and Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee from 2007 until 2011.

==Education and early career==
He was born in Richmond, California, the son of George Miller Jr., a leader of the liberal wing of the California Democratic Party at the time. He graduated from Diablo Valley Community College and San Francisco State University.

After his father died on New Year&#x27;s Day 1969, Miller ran in a March 1969 special election to succeed him in California&#x27;s 7th State Senate district, but Republican John A. Nejedly defeated him 57% to 42%.

He then attended the University of California, Davis School of Law (King Hall), where he received his Juris Doctor. Miller served as legislative assistant to California State Senate Majority Leader George Moscone before entering the United States House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

In 1974, incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Jerome Waldie gave up his seat to make an unsuccessful run for Governor of California. Miller decided to run for the open seat, which had been renumbered from the 14th congressional district to the 7th congressional district in a mid-decade redistricting. He won the primary with a plurality of 38%. In the general election, he defeated Republican Gary Fernandez 56% to 44%, the lowest winning percentage of his career. He went on to win reelection 18 times and never won with less than 60% of the vote.

On April 10, 1975, Miller walked out of the House chamber during President Ford&#x27;s State of the Union Address when he requested military aid for South Vietnam.

;2012 

After redistricting, Miller&#x27;s district was redrawn and renumbered the 11th. He ran against, and defeated, Republican Virginia Fuller in the general election.

In a 2012 campaign ad, Miller said that the main challenge the U.S. faces is the need “to correct the disparities that exist in our country.”

===Tenure===
According to a 2013 article in the &quot;National Journal&quot;, Miller was one of seven members of the 113th Congress House of Representatives who tied for most liberal.

In 2011–12, Miller sponsored 10 bills (placing him at #40 out of 440 House members), none of which were made into law (ranks 18 of 440). He co-sponsored 199 bills (placing him at #138 out of 440), 4 of which were made into law (ranks 17 of 440).

During Miller&#x27;s 1974 campaign, he routinely disclosed his donors and expenses, taking advantage of the Watergate scandal that was still in the minds of voters. This helped get him a seat in the House at the age of 29, becoming one of the Watergate Babies. At the time of his retirement, he was one of the last surviving members of the large Democratic freshman class of 1974, and had spent over half of his life in Congress. Miller has been described as someone who has &quot;proven himself both a liberal lion ...and savvy about working both sides of the aisle.”

With his father being the former chairman of the state Senate Finance Committee and mentor Phillip Burton being an integral part of liberal politics in the 1970s, Miller has been described as the “heir to a tradition of Bay Area working-class politics.” Miller had one of the most liberal voting records in the House, and brings &quot;a zest for political combat.&quot; A review of Miller&#x27;s career states that, although he has been unsuccessful in his pursuit of top party positions, he has &quot;learned a legislator’s virtues of patience, timing, and creativity.&quot;

; Environmental issues
In the House, Miller was a member of the Natural Resources Committee; he was that Committee&#x27;s chairman from 1991 to 1994. Miller supported efforts to preserve public lands such as the 1994 California Desert Protection Act, which among other things created Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park. In addition, Miller was the chief sponsor of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992, which mandated that the federal government&#x27;s Bureau of Reclamation manage the Central Valley Project in order to better protect the fish and wildlife populations of California&#x27;s Bay-Delta region. Miller lost his chairmanship when Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. He stayed as the committee&#x27;s Ranking Member until 2000, and remained on the committee as a member until 2015. Miller was also a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

; Labor issues
From 2001 to 2006, Miller was the ranking Democrat on the Education and the Workforce Committee. With that committee&#x27;s chairman and their Senate counterparts, Miller helped draft the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and 2002. Miller has focused on pension issues, reinstating Davis-Bacon Act wage protections for Gulf Coast workers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Miller has worked on education issues such as protesting student aid cuts, increasing No Child Left Behind Act funding, and investigating the Bush administration&#x27;s hiring of Armstrong Williams to promote that law. Miller has also been a vocal advocate of labor and immigration reform in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In 2007, as chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, Miller sponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which was enacted into law as an amendment to another bill. In 2001, Miller said, &quot;The secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose.&quot; He was an &quot;outspoken critic of the apparel industry record on worker safety in foreign factories, most recently in Bangladesh.&quot;

;Education

Miller&#x27;s biggest defeat was when he lost 424-1 in congress for his amendment to House Resolution 6 of 1994. His refusal to make provision for homeschooling caused the national home school community to lobby the whole congress against Miller&#x27;s amendment to the Improving America&#x27;s Schools Act of 1994. Miller sponsored the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, a bill that would require school districts receiving federal funds to give all employees criminal background checks. The bill passed the House of Representatives on October 22, 2013.

;Port Chicago disaster
Miller has petitioned to clear the names of the sailors of the World War II Port Chicago disaster in which more than 200 black men were court-martialed and 50 convicted of mutiny for refusing to continue to load ammunition onto warships after a tremendous explosion killed hundreds. For the most part, Miller&#x27;s efforts failed. By 1999, only three of the sailors convicted of mutiny were still alive. That year, at Miller&#x27;s behest, President Bill Clinton pardoned Freddie Meeks, one of the 50 convicted mutineers. In addition, Miller wrote the legislation to designate the site of the event as a National Memorial.

;Native American gaming
Miller was a supporter of Native American gaming. In 2000, as ranking member of the House Resource Committee, Miller inserted an amendment to the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act that took an existing cardroom into federal trust for the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians. The amendment made the land acquisition retroactive to 1987, stating that &quot;[s]uch land shall be deemed to have been held in trust and part of the reservation of the Rancheria prior to October 17, 1988.&quot; This allowed the Lyttons to open a casino at the cardroom under the terms of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. Some members of Congress and the gambling industry called the amendment &quot;underhanded,&quot; while other politicians have judged the process to be nothing out of the ordinary. When Donald Trump protested the issuance of gaming licenses to Native Americans, saying the recipients didn&#x27;t look like Indians to him, Miller responded:

&quot;Thank God that&#x27;s not the test of whether or not people have rights in this country or not – whether or not they pass your &#x27;look&#x27; test.&quot;

In 2024, Ana Cabrera of MSNBC remarked, &quot;Congressman George Miller of California, who had confronted Trump in 1993...said that was the most irresponsible testimony he had heard in his 40 years in Congress.&quot;

;2008 presidential election
Miller, a superdelegate in the Democratic Party&#x27;s 2008 presidential primary, pledged his support to Barack Obama despite the fact that his district voted for Hillary Clinton. Miller cited Obama&#x27;s grassroots fundraising campaign, first-place win in the Iowa caucus and strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, leadership style and opposition to the Iraq War as reasons for his endorsement. The endorsement was first reported in the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; on January 9, 2008.

;Relationship with Nancy Pelosi
Miller has been considered Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s most trusted confidant, with conservative columnist Robert Novak describing him as &quot;her consigliere, always at her side.&quot; Pelosi receives advice from Miller as well as protection from potential adversaries in the Democratic Caucus. Miller describes her as the leader he has been waiting for 30 years and supported her when the Democrats lost the majority in 2010, saying that the Obama administration did not defend her or her accomplishments. Pelosi also named Miller chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, where he had an influential role in preparing the &quot;New Direction&quot; for the 2006 election.

Their friendship has spanned &quot;over 30 years and many plane trips to Washington from their neighboring California districts,&quot; with some colleagues saying that they have become so close that they finish each other&#x27;s sentences. The New York Times reported that &quot;In the concerns of some Democrats — and the I-told-you-so’s of some Republicans — Mr. Miller represents Mrs. Pelosi’s true liberal soul.”

;SunPower controversy
It was reported that Miller and his son, George Miller IV, a lobbyist, were involved in the controversy surrounding the U.S. Department of Energy awarding a $1.2 billion loan to the struggling SunPower Corporation. The loan was awarded hours before the DOE program was set to expire. It was reported that by April 2012, the company&#x27;s stock had fallen nearly 50% since the loan had been awarded. SunPower paid Miller&#x27;s son and his lobbying firm US$138,000 to represent them. Miller asserted that he and his son never discuss legislation; his son, however, does boast openly of political connections in Washington.

;Accepting free travel
In January 2012, Miller was cited as one of the members of Congress who had accepted the most free travel the previous year.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Education and Labor (ranking member)
**As ranking member of the full committee, Miller may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees of which he is not already a voting member.
**Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
**Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions
*United States House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families (Chair)

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Progressive Caucus
*Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus
*International Conservation Caucus
*House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee (Co-Chair for Policy)

==Personal life==
Miller owned a townhouse in Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. for decades, renting rooms to fellow members of the U.S. House, even after some moved to the Senate. His longest-standing tenants were Nancy Pelosi and Senators Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin. Miller purchased the residence in 1977 and sold it when he retired from the House at the end of 2014. Prior tenants included former Representatives Marty Russo, Leon Panetta and Sam Gejdenson.

<doc id="408652" wikidata="Q289317" url="?curid=408652" title="Barbara Lee">
<text>Barbara Jean Lee (; born July 16, 1946) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from California from 1998 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, Lee represented (numbered as the 9th district from 1998 to 2013 and as the 13th district from 2013 to 2023), which is based in Oakland and covers most of the northern part of Alameda County. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, it is one of the nation&#x27;s most Democratic districts, with a rating of D+40.

Born and raised in Texas, Lee was educated at Mills College and the University of California, Berkeley. She started her career by working on the presidential campaign of Shirley Chisholm, and she later was involved with the Black Panther Party. After working as chief of staff for U.S. Representative Ron Dellums, Lee served in the California State Assembly from 1990 to 1996 and in the California State Senate from 1996 to 1998.

Lee was elected to the House of Representatives in a 1998 special election to succeed Dellums. A noted progressive, she chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus from 2005 to 2009 and the Congressional Black Caucus from 2009 to 2011. In addition, she is the vice chair and a founding member of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, a co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, and a co-chair of the House Democratic Steering Committee. She has played a major role in the antiwar movement, notably in her vocal criticism of the Iraq War and for being the only member of Congress to vote against the authorization of use of force following the September 11 attacks.

In 2024, Lee chose not to pursue re-election in the House and instead ran for Senate to succeed Dianne Feinstein. Lee lost in the jungle primary to Republican Steve Garvey and fellow House Democrat Adam Schiff, who won the seat in the general election. In January 2025, Lee announced her campaign for mayor of Oakland following the recall of Sheng Thao.

==Early life and education==
Lee was born Barbara Jean Tutt on July 16, 1946, in El Paso, Texas. She is the oldest of three daughters of Mildred Adaire (née Parish; 1924–2015) and Garvin Alexander Tutt (1924–2007), a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army. When she was born in a segregated hospital, her mother was left in the hallway, as the hospital refused to assist her. Lee is African American; according to a DNA analysis, she descends primarily from the people of Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone. She was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools, where she was taught by the Sisters of Loretto. She was the only African-American Girl Scout in El Paso, and she recalls having faced racial discrimination throughout her childhood.

Lee&#x27;s parents divorced in 1955. Five years later, she moved to California with her mother and two sisters. She attended San Fernando High School in the Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles, where she worked with the NAACP to become the school&#x27;s first African-American cheerleader, and she graduated in 1964. When she was 15, Lee had a back-alley abortion in Ciudad Juárez. She married Carl Lee, a member of the United States Air Force, and moved with him to England after high school; they had two children, and then divorced when Lee was 20. After the birth of her first child in 1966, Lee returned to California’s San Fernando Valley. Lee describes the marriage as abusive, and she became homeless following the divorce.

She later moved to the Bay Area and attended Mills College, where she served as president of the college&#x27;s Black Student Union, and she graduated in 1973 with a bachelor of arts in psychology. She later attended the University of California, Berkeley, from where she graduated in 1975 with a master of social work. Throughout college, Lee was a single mother of two on public assistance and food stamps, and she often took her children to class because she was unable to afford child care.

==Early political career==
Lee worked for the Glendale Welfare Council and later as a statistical clerk for the California Department of Labor Statistics. As president of the Mills College Black Student Union, Lee invited Representative Shirley Chisholm to speak on campus. She was inspired to register to vote by Chisholm&#x27;s visit, and she went on to work on Chisholm&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign, serving as one of her delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Lee later said Chisholm was a mentor who inspired her to run for office. Also while a student, Lee volunteered at the Oakland chapter of the Black Panther Party&#x27;s Community Learning Center and worked on Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale&#x27;s 1973 campaign for mayor of Oakland. Lee was surveilled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation due to her involvement with the Black Panthers.

As a graduate student, Lee founded the Community Health Alliance for Neighborhood Growth and Education (CHANGE), a community-based mental health clinic. She was later offered an internship in the office of Representative Ron Dellums, who represented an Oakland-based district. Following the internship, she took a full-time job in Dellums&#x27;s office and eventually became his chief of staff. Lee was one of the only African Americans and women to hold a senior staff position on Capitol Hill. After leaving Dellums&#x27;s office in 1987, she returned to the Bay Area and founded a facilities-management company.

== California State Legislature ==
Lee was elected to the California State Assembly in 1990 to succeed Elihu Harris, who retired to successfully run for mayor of Oakland. She served three terms in the Assembly, and she was elected to the California State Senate in 1996. She resigned her seat in the State Senate after winning a special election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998.

Lee was the first African-American woman to represent Northern California in the California State Legislature. During her time in the Legislature, she authored 67 bills that were signed into law by then-Governor Pete Wilson, a Republican; among those bills were the California Schools Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the California Violence Against Women Act. Lee also worked to defeat California&#x27;s three-strikes law and was an early champion of LGBTQ+ rights.

Lee was a member of the California Commission on the Status of Women and founded the California Commission on the Status of African American Males.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
After Dellums resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998, Lee successfully ran in the special election to succeed him, winning 66% of the vote. She was elected to a full term later that year, winning 83% of the vote. She has since been re-elected to the House of Representatives 12 more times.

In lieu of running for a 14th term, Lee campaigned to succeed Dianne Feinstein in the United States Senate in 2024.

=== Tenure ===
Lee originally represented California&#x27;s 9th congressional district, from which she served until 2013. She later represented the 13th district from 2013 to 2023, and she has represented the 12th district since 2023. Her district is located in Alameda County and includes the cities of Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, Alameda, Albany, Piedmont, San Leandro, and most of San Lorenzo. The Cook Partisan Voting Index gives her district a rating of D+40, making it one of the most Democratic districts in the nation.

Lee&#x27;s voting record as a member of Congress was ranked by the &quot;National Journal&quot; in 2007, based on roll-call votes on economic, social and foreign policy issues in 2006. Lee scored an overall 84.3%, meaning that she voted with a more liberal stance than 84.3% of the House. &quot;National Journal&quot; scored Lee as voting 82% liberal on economic issues, 92% liberal on social issues, and 65% liberal on foreign policy. The 92% rating on social issues came from Lee being grouped with 35 other House legislators who all tied for the highest, most liberal ranking. Lee received a 97% progressive rating from &quot;The Progressive Punch&quot; and a 4% conservative rating from the American Conservative Union. In 2016, GovTrack&#x27;s 2015 Report Card on members in Congress ranked Lee the 3rd most progressive member of the House.
Lee endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. In February 2019, she endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.

As of January 3, 2023, Lee had voted in line with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 99.1% of the time.

====AUMF opposition====
Lee gained national attention in 2001 as the only member of Congress to vote against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF), stating that she voted no not because she opposed military action but because she believed the AUMF, as written, granted the president overly broad powers to wage war at a time when the facts regarding the situation were not yet clear. She &quot;warned her colleagues to be &#x27;careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target. Lee has said:It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events—anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation&#x27;s long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration. I could not support such a grant of war-making authority to the president; I believe it would put more innocent lives at risk. The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action.Her vote made national news and a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some calling her &quot;communist&quot; and a &quot;traitor&quot;. Many of the responses included death threats against her or her family to the point that the Capitol Police provided round-the-clock plainclothes bodyguards. Lee was also criticized by politicians and in editorial pages of conservative-leaning newspapers, such as John Fund&#x27;s column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal.&quot; In 2002, she received the Seán MacBride Peace Prize from the International Peace Bureau for her vote.

In her speech, she quoted Nathan D. Baxter, dean of the Washington National Cathedral: &quot;As we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore.&quot;

On June 29, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved Lee&#x27;s amendment to repeal the 2001 AUMF that was the foundation of the United States&#x27; post-September 11 military actions. The amendment, if passed, would have required that the AUMF be scrapped within 240 days. In June 2021, Lee sponsored a bipartisan bill in the House to repeal the AUMF, which passed 268–161. The bill was never put to a vote in the Senate.

====Foreign policy====
Although Lee is considered a progressive Democrat, she has occasionally split with members of her party throughout her career, especially on foreign policy. Prior to voting against the Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2001, she joined four other representatives in voting against the resolution to authorize Operation Desert Fox in Iraq in 1998, and later voted against US participation in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999.

In an August 2017 interview, Lee said of President Donald Trump&#x27;s comments on North Korea, &quot;His saber-rattling is putting the world at risk. The United States should be the grown-up in the room&quot;, and that his rhetoric reminded her of news about the Cuban Missile Crisis during her mid-teens, adding, &quot;the words of war weren&#x27;t as profound and dangerous and scary [then] as they are now.&quot;

In September 2018, Lee was one of 11 House Democrats to sign a statement announcing their intent &quot;to introduce a new, privileged resolution in September invoking the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from engaging in the Saudi-led coalition&#x27;s conflict with the Houthis should additional escalations continue and progress fail to be made towards a peace agreement.&quot;

In April 2019, after the House passed the resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, Lee was one of nine lawmakers to sign a letter to Trump requesting a meeting with him and urging him to sign &quot;Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973 to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalition&#x27;s armed conflict against Yemen&#x27;s Houthi forces, initiated in 2015 by the Obama administration.&quot; They asserted the &quot;Saudi-led coalition&#x27;s imposition of an air-land-and-sea blockade as part of its war against Yemen&#x27;s Houthis has continued to prevent the unimpeded distribution of these vital commodities, contributing to the suffering and death of vast numbers of civilians throughout the country&quot; and that Trump&#x27;s approval of the resolution would send a &quot;powerful signal to the Saudi-led coalition to bring the four-year-old war to a close&quot;.

In July 2019, Lee voted against a House resolution condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. The resolution passed 398–17.

In October 2020, Lee co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemning Azerbaijan&#x27;s offensive operations against the Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.

In April 2021, Lee supported President Joe Biden&#x27;s plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

In 2023, Lee was among 56 Democrats to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21 which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

Lee has supported US aid to Ukraine during its invasion by Russia and has voted in favor of all bills for aid to Ukraine, with a rationale to &quot;preserve democracy&quot; and &quot;make sure that the United States is on the right side of history and provides the resources, the economic resources, the humanitarian resources, so that Ukrainian people can live in peace and in security.&quot; On July 6, 2023, President Joe Biden authorized the provision of cluster munitions to Ukraine in support of a Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian forces in Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine. Lee opposed the Biden administration&#x27;s decision to supply cluster munitions to Ukraine.

====Gun control====
Lee is a strong advocate for legislation restricting the availability of guns. She participated in the 2016 sit-in against gun violence in the House of Representatives. Democratic members of Congress adopted the slogan &quot;No Bill, No Break&quot; in an attempt to push the introduction of legislation increasing restrictions on guns. In a statement on the sit-in, Lee said:

==== Environment ====
Lee introduced the Women and Climate Change Act in February 2018. The bill aims to create a Federal Interagency Working Group on Women and Climate Change. Lee said of the bill, &quot;Climate change is already impacting communities around the world with a disproportionate effect on the world&#x27;s poorest residents. Women make up the majority of the world&#x27;s poor and are especially vulnerable to abrupt changes in the environment. As leaders in their families, women are called upon to find food and clean water, secure safe housing, and care for loved ones. As climate change worsens, provoking historic droughts, rising sea levels and violent storms, women and girls will bear the brunt of this global crisis&quot;.

====Education====
Lee is the author of the Shirley A. Chisholm United States−Caribbean Educational Exchange Act, which would enhance U.S. foreign relations with CARICOM nations. This act directs the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a comprehensive program that extends and expands existing primary and secondary school initiatives in the Caribbean to provide teacher training methods and increased community involvement in school activities. The bill is named for Shirley Chisholm, who helped inspire Lee to become involved in politics when Chisholm ran for the Democratic nomination for president; Lee was the Chisholm campaign&#x27;s Northern California chair.

==== Black Panthers ====
In 1968, Lee began volunteering at the Black Panther Party&#x27;s Community Learning Center in Oakland. She also worked on Bobby Seale&#x27;s 1973 campaign for mayor of Oakland.

Lee disagreed with the National Park Service removing funding for a Black Panther Legacy Project in 2017. She released a statement saying, &quot;It is outrageous that the National Park Service has stripped resources from the Black Panther Party Research, Interpretation &amp; Memory Project. The Black Panther Party was an integral part of the civil rights movement and the public has a right to know their history. I call upon the National Park Service and the Department of [the] Interior to provide a full explanation as to why these critical federal resources have been taken away&quot;.

==== Cannabis ====
Lee has supported a number of efforts to reform cannabis laws in Congress. In 2018, she introduced the Marijuana Justice Act to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, penalize states that enforce cannabis laws disproportionately (regarding race or income status), and enact other social justice-related reforms. Additional legislation Lee has introduced includes the States&#x27; Medical Marijuana Property Rights Protection Act, the Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe Harbor Act, the Restraining Excessive Federal Enforcement &amp; Regulations of Cannabis (REFER) Act, and the Realizing Equitable &amp; Sustainable Participation in Emerging Cannabis Trades (RESPECT) Resolution. Lee was an original cosponsor of the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act when it was first introduced in 2011. In January 2019, she was named a co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus.

====Presidential election objections====

In 2001, Lee and other House members objected to counting Florida&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined their objection, it was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who lost the election to George W. Bush.

In 2005, Lee was one of 31 House Democrats who voted not to accept Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. Bush won Ohio by 118,457 votes.

After the 2016 presidential election, Lee objected to Michigan&#x27;s and West Virginia&#x27;s electoral votes. Because no senator joined her objections, they were dismissed. Donald Trump won Michigan by slightly over 10,000 votes and West Virginia by over 300,000 votes.

====Defense budget====
Lee called for a 10% cut to the military budget of the United States. She backed an amendment to reduce the size of the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, but a majority of Democrats and Republicans rejected it.

====Housing====
Lee has made affordable housing a top priority, particularly in the East Bay. She has supported and backed legislation meant to expand home ownership opportunities, improve public housing quality, and assist the homeless.

====Health care====
Lee was strongly critical of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, which places restrictions on health insurance plans providing coverage for abortions in the context of the Affordable Health Care for America Act. She supports Medicare for All.

====Abortion====
Lee is pro-choice. During a September 30, 2021, hearing of the House Oversight Committee, she recounted having to travel to Mexico for a back-alley abortion in the 1960s: &quot;I&#x27;m sharing my story even though I truly believe it is personal and really nobody&#x27;s business— and certainly not the business of politicians. But I&#x27;m compelled to speak out because of the real risks of the clock being turned back to those days before &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.&quot; Lee opposed the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe&quot;, which she called an &quot;attack on reproductive freedom&quot; and blamed on a &quot;decades-long coordinated strategic assault on women&#x27;s rights by right-wing extremists&quot;.

====Economy====
Lee was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

On March 15, 2013, Lee announced the official relaunch of the Congressional Social Work Caucus to the 113th Congress as its new chair.

Lee co-chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus with Lynn Woolsey from 2005 to 2009. She also chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2009 to 2011.

On November 28, 2018, Lee lost an attempt to become chair of the House Democratic Caucus to Hakeem Jeffries.

On November 30, 2018, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced that she had recommended Lee to become one of three co-chairs of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee alongside Rosa DeLauro and Eric Swalwell. The change was approved on December 11, 2018.

===United Nations assignments===
Lee was the United States representative to the 68th, 70th, and 72nd sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.

==2024 U.S. Senate campaign==

In January 2023, it was reported that Lee planned to run in the 2024 election for the United States Senate seat held by Dianne Feinstein, after she revealed her intentions to members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The report came a day after Representative Katie Porter announced her own candidacy. A third Democrat, Adam Schiff, had also announced his candidacy. Lee formally launched her Senate campaign in Oakland on February 21, 2023. On September 29, 2023, Feinstein died while serving in office. Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler to serve out the remainder of the term. On March 5, 2024, Lee failed to advance to the November general election after finishing fourth in the jungle primary. With at least 99% of votes counted, Lee trailed Schiff and Garvey by close to 1.6 million votes, and Porter by about 400,000 votes, with Lee failing to lead in any county. As Lee did not seek re-election to her House of Representatives seat, the defeat also ensured the end of her career in Congress by January 2025.

==2025 Oakland mayoral campaign==
Following the 2024 Oakland mayoral recall election, Lee announced that she would run for mayor of Oakland in the 2025 Oakland mayoral special election on January 8, 2025.

==Personal life==

Lee married Carl Lee after graduating high school in 1964. She described the marriage as abusive, and she divorced her husband when she was 20. The marriage produced two children, Tony and Craig, whom she raised as a single mother. Both of Lee&#x27;s sons now work in the insurance industry: Tony Lee is the CEO of Dickerson Employee Benefits, an African-American owned insurance brokerage and consulting firm, and Craig Lee is a senior executive at State Farm.

Lee married Rev. Dr. Clyde Oden Jr., a retired pastor from Oxnard, on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 2019. They live together in Oakland.

In 2002, the Peace Abbey in Boston gave Lee the Courage of Conscience Award for her vote against the call to war after the September 11 attacks. In her speech, she said, &quot;let us not become the evil that we deplore.&quot;

In 2003, Lee was recognized as a Woman of Peace at the Global Exchange Human Rights Awards in San Francisco with Bianca Jagger, Arundhati Roy and Kathy Kelly. In 2010, Lee took the food stamp challenge and also appeared in the documentary film &quot;Food Stamped&quot;.

In 2014, Lee, Hill Harper, and Meagan Good contributed to Enitan Bereola II&#x27;s bestselling book &quot;Gentlewoman: Etiquette for a Lady, from a Gentleman.&quot;

In 2015, Lee won the 43rd Thomas Merton Award.

Lee is an honorary member of Sigma Gamma Rho

<text>The river Neris () or Vilija (, ) rises in northern Belarus. It flows westward, passing through Vilnius (Lithuania&#x27;s capital) and in the south-centre of that country it flows into the Nemunas (Neman) from the right bank, at Kaunas, as its main tributary. Its length is .

After passing through Belarus for , the Neris flows through Lithuania for a further .

The Neris connects successive Lithuanian capitals – Kernavė and Vilnius. Along its banks are the burial places of the pagan Lithuanians. At from Vilnius there is are old Karmazinai Hillfort and .

==Dual naming==

The reasons for the dual naming of the river as Neris by the Lithuanians and Viliya (formerly &quot;Velja&quot;, meaning &quot;big, great&quot; in Slavic) by the Slavs are complex. Even in Vilnius, there are toponyms including both names, e. g. &quot;Neris&quot; remains in the riverside names of &quot;Paneriai&quot; and &quot;Paneriškės&quot; while &quot;Velja&quot; is a part of the name &quot;Valakampiai&quot;, which means &quot;an angle of Velja&quot; in Lithuanian. In Kaunas, a part of the city by the Neris river, that was formerly a separate town, is also named Vilijampolė (Vilija + polis, that means &quot;polis by Vilija&quot;).

Although it has been suggested that &quot;Neris&quot; is the primeval name of the river, while the name &quot;Viliya&quot; is of secondary extraction, the dual naming most probably emerged from the confluence of the rivers Neris (now known as Narač River, leaving Lake Narač) and Velja, in the historical Slavic/Baltic borderland, each ethnos choosing their own name for the river starting at the confluence. It is moreover evidenced by the fact that the name &quot;Neris&quot; was never used to name the river Velja up to this confluence. Therefore, it has been proposed that the Narač River had in fact been considered the upper reaches of Neris by the Balts in ancient times.

Some linguists, however, point to the fact, that Viliya in it upper part is not &quot;big&quot; or &quot;great&quot; at all and the name cognates with Lithuanian words velnias and vėlė. What is more, all the territory of upper Neris before the 12th c. was inhabited by the Balts, the archaeological .

===Etymology of &quot;Neris&quot;===
The name &quot;Neris&quot; is of Baltic origin, a cognate of the Lithuanian &quot;nerti&quot; generally meaning &quot;to dive, swim downstream&quot; as well as &quot;to net, crochet&quot;. It is likely that the name had a more general meaning of &quot;flow&quot; or particularly &quot;swift and swirling flow&quot; in early times.

Etymologically, the name is one of a class of hydronyms, widespread in the modern and prehistoric Baltic ranges; e.g., Lithuanian Narotis, Narasa (rivers), Narutis (lake), Old Prussian Narus, Nara near Moscow. These are related to Lithuanian &quot;narus&quot;, &quot;deep&quot;, and &quot;nerti&quot;, &quot;to dive&quot;.

More remote connections are obscure, although the root is believed to be Indo-European. There are a number of possibilities:

*Pokorny&#x27;s 2nd &quot;*ner-&quot;, &quot;under&quot; (&quot;Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch&quot;, pp765–766);
*Derksen&#x27;s *, o-grade * (&quot;Slavic Inherited Lexicon&quot;);
*A relation to the Greek god Nereus, which may be from *&quot;snau-&quot;, &quot;to give milk to&quot;, in the sense of &quot;flow&quot; (Partridge, &quot;Origins&quot; (1983)).
* Another relationship of &quot;Neris&quot; with the Sanskrit word &quot;Neer&quot;/&quot;Naar&quot; which means water.

<text>Ellen O&#x27;Kane Tauscher (November 15, 1951 – April 29, 2019) was an American businesswoman, diplomat, and Democratic Party politician who was the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 10th congressional district from 1997 to 2009. From 2009 to 2012, she served as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. She then served as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the State Department.

While in Congress, Tauscher was a leading centrist Democrat, and the chair of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House of Representatives. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005.

==Early life and career==
Ellen Tauscher was born in Newark, New Jersey, the daughter of John E. O&#x27;Kane, a shop steward for the United Food and Commercial Workers union at a ShopRite store in Union City, and his wife Sally, a secretary for Marsh &amp; McLennan in New York City. She graduated in 1974 from Seton Hall University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in early childhood education.

She then worked as an investment banker with Bache &amp; Co. and, at age 25, was the youngest and one of the first women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange. She also served as an officer of the American Stock Exchange from 1979 to 1983, after which she worked for Bear Stearns and a subsidiary of Drexel Burnham Lambert.

In 1989, Tauscher moved to California and later founded the ChildCare Registry, the first national research service to help parents verify the background of childcare workers. She also published &quot;The ChildCare Sourcebook&quot; and headed the Tauscher Foundation, which provided funds for elementary schools to buy computers and Internet access.

==Political career==
Before running for the United States House of Representatives, Tauscher was active in Democratic circles as a fundraiser and also chaired Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s successful 1992 and 1994 Senate campaigns.

In 1996, Tauscher was recruited to run against two-term Republican incumbent Bill Baker in California&#x27;s 10th congressional district, which included several wealthy suburbs in the East Bay. During the campaign, Tauscher emphasized balancing the federal budget, her support for business, the environment, and the military. She also charged that Baker was too conservative for the district, particularly given his opposition to abortion and gun control. She narrowly defeated Baker, claiming victory by a margin of 1.45% of the vote. The race was ranked as the fourth most expensive of that year&#x27;s 435 House races.

Tauscher was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 against vigorous Republican opposition. While the 10th district was once considered &quot;solid Republican territory,&quot; most Bay Area Republicans tend to be more moderate than their counterparts in the rest of California and since the 1990s have been increasingly willing to support Democrats at the national level.

In 2000, during the statewide redistricting process, some of the more Republican-leaning parts of Tauscher&#x27;s district were removed and replaced with more Democratic territory near Berkeley and in Solano County. She was subsequently re-elected to four more terms, facing no substantive opposition and receiving more than 65 percent of the vote after 2002.

In the House of Representatives, Tauscher served on the Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. She chaired the Strategic Forces subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which oversees the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons stockpile, missile defense program, and the national labs. Tauscher was the only member of Congress who had two national labs in her district, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories. At the time she left Congress, Tauscher also was the senior member from California serving on the Highways and Transit subcommittee and the Aviation subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure committee. From her position on the Transportation Committee, Tauscher brought $33 million to her district for transportation and infrastructure projects.

On March 18, 2009, President Obama nominated Tauscher to the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 25, 2009, by unanimous consent. Notwithstanding her appointment, confirmation and acceptance, she served as Speaker Pro Tempore on June 26, 2009, when the House narrowly passed (219–212) a cap-and-trade global warming bill. Tauscher resigned her seat on June 26, 2009, after voting was finished on the American Clean Energy &amp; Security Act. Her resignation necessitated a special election. Tauscher served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security until her appointment on February 6, 2012, as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense. Tauscher retired from the State Department on August 31, 2012.

As Under Secretary of State, Tauscher successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation in March 2010. The first major agreement signed with Russia in nearly 20 years, the treaty was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev on April 8, 2010, and ratified by the U.S. Senate on December 22, 2010. Tauscher represented the United States at the U.N. NPT review conference that is held every five years to review the status of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The 2010 conference was the first in 10 years to result in an consensus agreement. Tauscher was also the lead official in the State Department working on the bilateral agreements with Poland, Romania, and Turkey for the European Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, negotiating timely agreements that allowed the President&#x27;s deployment timeline to be met.

In 2008, Tauscher was a strong supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton&#x27;s candidacy for president. She traveled around the country as a surrogate for Clinton&#x27;s campaign in the primary. In 2013, she was one of the first prominent elected officials to join the Ready for Hillary effort which became one of the largest independent grassroots efforts on behalf of an undeclared Presidential candidate in history.

==Political views==
A leading centrist Democrat, Tauscher was the chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate Democrats in the House. She also served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Leadership Council from 2001 to 2005.

Tauscher received an 11% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, and a 95% rating for her 2008 voting record from Americans for Democratic Action.

While in Congress, she supported universal health care and, in particular, covering uninsured children through the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). She also supported scaling back the estate tax, tightening bankruptcy rules, and expanding free trade.

===Abortion===
Tauscher was strongly pro-choice. She received a 100% positive rating from NARAL. She voted against bans on late-term and partial-birth abortions.

She also supported federal funding of stem cell research, voting in favor of both Stem Cell Research Enhancement Acts.

===Gun rights===
Tauscher was in favor of more extensive gun control. She expressed her support for the Second Amendment, but has also said that &quot;we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with history of violence.&quot; She called for &quot;common sense gun safety legislation that strikes a balance between Second Amendment protections and protections for the public.&quot;

While in Congress, she supported arming commercial pilots, requiring background checks of legal gun owners, and banning Saturday night specials. She received an F rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.

===Iraq war===
In October 2002, Tauscher voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution, approving the use of military force in Iraq. However, she later became a critic of the Iraq War, while continuing to vote for funding for the War (see HR 1585). In December 2005, Tauscher led a group of twenty-two other House Democrats in sending a letter to President George W. Bush urging him to withdraw U.S. troops, expressing the hope that the &quot;Iraqi government takes increased responsibility&quot; for its political and security needs. She later voted to redeploy troops out of Iraq within 90 days and even to impeach President Bush over the war.

===LGBT issues===
Tauscher was an early proponent of same-sex marriage, publicly stating in 2004 in response to President George W. Bush&#x27;s call for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, &quot;It is clear to me that this is the civil rights issue of the 21st century, and it is unambiguous in my mind that the government cannot discriminate by gender the rights conferred by the state in marriage.&quot; In 2006, she voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally defined marriage as being between a man and woman.

On March 3, 2009, Tauscher introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009 to the House of Representatives, which would have repealed Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell. The bill eventually passed in a slightly different form in 2010 after Tauscher had left the House, repealing Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell.

She was opposed to banning gays from the Boy Scouts. She had a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy group in the United States.

==Career after politics==
After leaving the State Department, Tauscher assumed a number of publicly held corporate and non-profit board positions, including serving on the boards of Edison International/Southern California Edison (EIX) in Rosemead, California, and eHealth (EHTH) in Mountain View, California. She served on the Board of Advisors of SpaceX and the Board of Directors of BAE Systems, Invacare Corporation, and SeaWorld Entertainment. She was a member of the Board of Governors of The Commonwealth Club of California. She served as vice chair of the Atlantic Council&#x27;s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security and was a member of the University of California Board of Regents.

She also served as chairman of the Board of Governors for Los Alamos National Security and Lawrence Livermore National Security, a member of the board of directors of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and was chairman of the board of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Foundation.

In August 2013, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety elected Tauscher as independent chairperson. The Alliance is a coalition of some of the largest clothing retailers and brands in North America, including Wal-Mart, Target, the Gap, Costco, and VF Brands. The Alliance is working with the government of Bangladesh, factory owners, and international organizations to improve worker safety for Bangladeshi garment workers.

Tauscher was also a strategic advisor to the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson on matters of defense, transportation, energy, and health care.

Tauscher was a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Personal life and death==
Tauscher lived in Pleasanton and later Alamo, California, during her Congressional career. Prior to their divorce in 1999, she was married to William Tauscher, former chairman and CEO of Vanstar Corporation, current director of Safeway, Inc., and founder of the Tauscher Group, which invests and assists in the management of enterprises in home products, transportation, security and real estate. She had a daughter, Katherine (born 1991).

On the same day as her taking the office of Under Secretary, she married widower James Cieslak, a retired pilot for Delta Air Lines. They divorced in 2011.

In July 2010, Tauscher was diagnosed with Stage 3 esophageal cancer, one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States and one of the deadliest, with a survival rate of 18%. After a grueling regimen of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery to remove her esophagus, Tauscher was declared cancer-free in December 2010. Following that time, she was active as a board member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and as chair of the NCCN Foundation, as well as speaking around the country, advocating for more information, more funding and earlier screening for the disease.

Tauscher died of pneumonia on April 29, 2019, at the age of 67 at the Stanford University Medical Center, in Stanford, California.

<doc id="408658" wikidata="Q288610" url="?curid=408658" title="Richard Pombo">
<text>Richard William Pombo, GOIH (born January 8, 1961) is an American lobbyist for mining and water-management companies and former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, having represented California&#x27;s 11th congressional district from 1993 to 2007. Pombo lost a reelection bid to Democratic challenger Jerry McNerney on November 7, 2006.

On January 4, 2010, Pombo announced his candidacy for Congress in California&#x27;s 19th congressional district to succeed retiring fellow Republican George Radanovich, although he did not live in the district. Pombo came in third in that four-way GOP race, with 20.8 percent of the votes.

==Early life and career==
Pombo was born in Tracy, California, 18 miles south of Stockton. He attended Cal Poly, Pomona, for three years before dropping out to work for his family&#x27;s cattle and dairy business. He is a descendant of Portuguese immigrants. Pombo is married to the former Annette Cole and has three children. Even after being elected to Congress, he returned to his 500-acre (2 km2) ranch near Tracy every week. Pombo is a Roman Catholic.

From 1990 to 1992, Pombo served on the Tracy City Council.

==House of Representatives==
===1992 election===

In 1992, Pombo won the Republican primary by defeating several candidates in a race for an open seat in a district newly created by redistricting. California had added seven seats in the House after the 1990 census. Pombo&#x27;s strongest opponent in the Republican primary was moderate Republican Sandra Smoley, a Sacramento County Supervisor.

In November, although the district had a Democratic majority and was carried by Bill Clinton, Pombo nonetheless defeated Democrat Patti Garamendi (wife of current California Congressman John Garamendi).

===1994–2000 elections===
Pombo was reelected from this district in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000.

===2002–2004 elections===
For his first five terms, Pombo represented a district covering almost all of San Joaquin County and a large slice of Sacramento County. However, Pombo&#x27;s district was significantly altered as a result of the 2000 round of redistricting. He lost his share of Sacramento County to the 3rd district, and lost most of Stockton to the 18th District. The district was pushed westward into the San Francisco Bay Area when it picked up some of the more Republican-leaning portions of Alameda and Contra Costa counties, which had previously been part of the East Bay–based 10th district. Pombo was reelected in 2002 and 2004 after the redistricting.

=== Political positions ===
In Congress, Pombo had a conservative track record. In 1994, during the Republican Revolution, he was one of the signatories of the Contract with America. He was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee. He was given the nickname &quot;The Marlboro Man&quot; by President George W. Bush.

====Private property rights====

Pombo co-wrote a book in 1996 with Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily about private property issues, entitled &quot;This Land is Our Land: How to End the War on Private Property&quot;. The San Joaquin County Citizen&#x27;s Land Alliance, founded in July 1997, has been described as a group, co-founded by Pombo, that included farmers and other landowners advocating for private property rights and opposing government encroachment on these rights. As of March 2018 it was being led by Gary Barton as CEO Michael Petz as CFO, with Nanette Martin serving as corporation secretary, and as of that date it was listed as terminated (its registration having expired).

Pombo&#x27;s association with the defense of private property rights was spurred by the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s abandonment of the Altamont Pass route through Tracy. Pombo owned land adjacent to the abandoned railroad line, and argued that the abandoned easement should legally revert to the adjacent property owners (such as himself) rather than to the local park district. He further argued that as the easement was granted based on a promise that the land would be used for railroad purposes only, that the easements ended entirely when they were abandoned.

Pombo&#x27;s case resulted in Congress passing the Rails to Trails Act. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial, Pombo was called &quot;an outspoken product of the extreme property rights movement.&quot; In 2005, he proposed legislation that would allow mining companies to buy lands on which they have staked claims, even if there is no evidence of valuable minerals on that land; according to the editorial, &quot;This has nothing to do with mining, and everything to do with stealing land that is owned by the American people.&quot;

==== Iraq ====
Pombo supported the Iraq War. In August 2006, anti-Iraq War activists criticized him, citing an estimate that taxpayers in the 11th congressional district paid $974 million for the war by that time.

====Warrantless wiretapping====
In a 2006 debate, Pombo said that &quot;intelligence agents should obtain surveillance warrants before monitoring phone calls&quot;, but &quot;less than five months later, he voted to allow warrantless wiretapping.&quot; He told the &quot;Tracy Press&quot; that his vote was consistent with his statement, and that although the bill allows a delay in obtaining a warrant, it requires that Congressional Intelligence Committees and the FISA Court be notified, this maintaining separation of powers among the branches of government. An advocate for the Center for Democracy and Technology said the bill went further than Pombo acknowledged insofar as it allowed for the warrantless collection of large amounts of data as long as no specific individual was being targeted (and that the bill in fact defined &quot;electronic surveillance&quot; as excluding such activity). Pombo&#x27;s opponent in 2006, Jerry McNerney, who went on to defeat Pombo, opposed the bill.

===Committee and caucuses===
====Committee assignments====
From 2003 to 2007, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, and was the Chairman of the House Resources Committee, which has oversight and sets policy on matters involving natural resources, Indian Country and Indian gaming. Pombo was also a co-chair of the &quot;House Energy Action Team&quot; (HEAT), whose stated goal was to find alternative energy solutions.

====Caucuses====
Pombo was an early member of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, a Republican caucus that promotes the interest of Hispanic and Portuguese Americans. He was also a member and former Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, which is made up of Western State members of Congress concerned about Endangered Species Act reform, water rights, private property rights, and other issues affecting the western states. He was also, as of 2007, co-chair of the Portuguese Caucus, a coalition of Members of Congress who promote positive Portuguese-American relations, and a group he is said to have founded. In that role, he hosted prominent visitors from Portugal to the United States, and the Portuguese government bestowed Pombo with the Grand Order of Infante D. Henrique, Portugal&#x27;s highest civilian honor, in recognition of his efforts to improve Portuguese-American relations.

==Environmental record==

Pombo proposed legislation to sell roughly a quarter of the land managed by the National Park Service. In November 2005, Pombo and Jim Gibbons (R-NV) co-authored an amendment to the Federal Budget Reconciliation Bill easing restrictions of sale of federal lands to mining companies. This amendment was opposed by environmentalists, anti-growth advocates, and even some Republican Senators concerned about the measure&#x27;s effects on hunting and fishing. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was defeated in the Senate. The legislation was later described by his chief of staff as a &quot;bureaucratic exercise&quot; designed to evaluate the costs of not drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

Pombo supported oil drilling in the ANWR, despite concerns about the ecosystem and opposition from moderate Republicans.

In September 2005, Pombo helped write a revision of the 1973 Endangered Species Act. The proposed revision &quot;was widely denounced by environmentalists as a disturbing retreat from habitat protection and a paperwork nightmare for agencies seeking to revive the 1,268 threatened and endangered plants and animals in the country, 186 of which are in California.&quot; The bill did not pass.

By March 2006, &quot;Environmental Science &amp; Technology&quot; reported that Pombo was coordinating efforts with Pac/West Communications to weaken the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Pac/West created the Save Our Species Alliance, an anti-environmental front group that campaigned for Pombo&#x27;s bill to change the ESA.

The League of Conservation Voters, a nonpartisan PAC, assigned Pombo a lifetime average rating of 7 on a scale of 0 to 100. In 2005, he scored a 6. Subsequently, the organization named Pombo as one of the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; in 2006. LCV released an ad on October 31, 2006, citing Pombo&#x27;s acceptance of $120,000 from oil companies and his ties to indicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him one of the worst congressmen and called him &quot;Enemy of the Earth&quot;. The Sierra Club called him an &quot;eco-thug&quot;.

As the chairman of the House Resources Committee, Pombo blocked legislation that would have created the Wild Sky Wilderness area in Washington state, despite broad support for the bill.

His political revival was characterized as giving environmentalists &quot;fits&quot; by the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; in addition to describing his perception by that community as similar to that of Exxon-Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood or the hunter that shot Bambi&#x27;s mother.

The League of Conservation Voters added him to their Dirty Dozen list in 2010, even though this list is typically reserved for sitting members of Congress; and Warner Chabor, the organization&#x27;s CEO, stated, &quot;Having Pombo represent a district that includes Yosemite National Park is like electing Godzilla as mayor of Tokyo&quot;.

==Controversies and criticisms==
In 2006, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchgroup founded in 2005 by liberal and Democratic Party activists released a report naming Pombo as one of the 13 most corrupt members of Congress. Pombo issued a statement where he denied the allegations and described the group as &quot;a liberal-activist organization masquerading as a government watchdog group.&quot;

===Corruption allegations===
Pombo and his political action committee &quot;RICH PAC&quot; was among a dozen leaders in the House of Representatives reportedly under investigation as part of the corruption and influence-peddling scandal centered around disgraced Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and his policy issues, including Indian gaming. Pombo had accepted more money from Abramoff than had any other member of Congress ($500,000). Fundraisers organized by Indian gaming interests and tied to the 2005 MLB All-Star Game are among those activities under scrutiny.

On January 8, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; alleged that Pombo helped one of Abramoff&#x27;s clients, the Mashpee Indians in Massachusetts, gain federal recognition as a tribe. In return, Pombo received campaign contributions from both the tribe and Abramoff.

In the 2006 cycle, Abramoff was one of the top donors to Pombo&#x27;s political action committee. Several of Pombo&#x27;s top five donors are political influence brokers from Detroit, who hosted several $5,000-per-person fundraisers for Pombo in their owners box at Comerica Park during the 2005 MLB All-Star Game. News reports indicated contributions from the two-day fundraising event would go to RICH Political Action Committee. However, Federal Election Commission reports filed by RICH PAC show only one such contribution. Apparently contributions were diverted to some other entity making it difficult to track who attended and contributed.

The Ilitch family, owners of the MLB Detroit Tigers and Detroit&#x27;s MotorCity Casino, are also financial backers of various Indian tribes, including the Shinnecock Indian Nation, which is seeking to build a gaming casino on its reservation near Southampton, New York. Various issues and tribal disputes involving the Shinnecock were before the House Resources Committee chaired by Pombo just days after the fundraiser.

On October 11, 2006, it was reported that Pombo &quot;says he never worked with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff in his fourteen years in Congress, but billing records suggest at least two interactions between the two in 1996&quot;.

=== Freeways that could enhance owned real estate ===
Various members of the Pombo family individually own more than undeveloped near two proposed freeways. If even one of the proposed freeways is eventually built, the value of the property owned by Pombo&#x27;s relatives and located near the proposed freeway will be worth far more than its currently assessed value.

Pombo led an effort to build a multilane freeway (State Route 130) through the mostly uninhabited Diablo Range to facilitate Bay Area-bound commuting from the greater Tracy area.

=== Windfarm regulations ===
Pombo&#x27;s home town of Tracy is close to a large wind farm on Altamont Pass. In 2004, Pombo&#x27;s office sent a letter to then-Secretary of the Department of the Interior Gale Norton, urging the suspension of environmental guidelines opposed by the wind power industry. Pombo&#x27;s parents have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties from wind-powered turbines on their ranch. Pombo owns an interest in his parents&#x27; ranch.

=== Payments to family ===
Between 2000 and 2004, Pombo used his campaign and PAC funds to pay his brother Randall $272,000, and his wife (between 2003 and 2004) $85,000. In that 2003–04 campaign cycle, Pombo paid more to his family members—$217,000—than his opponent, Jerry McNerney, spent on his entire campaign. The two were paid for duties listed as bookkeeping, fundraising, consulting and other unspecified services.

After publicity about the payments to his family, Randall was taken off Pombo&#x27;s payroll (total payments between January 2005 and mid-2006 were less than $7,000). Pombo&#x27;s wife continued to be paid at the rate of $3,000 per month.

=== Mailings during 2004 campaign ===
In October 2004, Pombo used the franking privileges afforded members of Congress to mail approximately 175,000 copies of a two-page leaflet that openly praised the House Resources Committee and the Bush administration for overturning Clinton Administration limits on snowmobiling in national parks. The leaflets were sent to snowmobile owners in the swing states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Pombo authorized the expenditure of $68,081 from House Resources Committee funds for the mailing of the leaflets as &quot;official business.&quot; House members are required to seek prior approval and obtain advisory opinions before sending out franked mail; no such approval was obtained prior to the October mailing.

===2003 RV trip charged to the federal government===
In August 2003, Pombo and his family rented an RV and &quot;spent two weeks on vacation, stopping along the way to enjoy ... our national parks&quot;. The trip included stops in the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Joshua Tree, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park and Mount Rushmore, Badlands National Park, and other parks. The $4,935 cost of the rental was charged to the federal government, but was determined to be a more cost effective alternative to flying, renting a car, and staying in a hotel.

When asked in February 2006 about the trip—rules forbid government-funded travel for personal vacations, but allow lawmakers to bring family members on official trips—Pombo said that he had looked into flying into the parks by commercial air or charters, but found the costs to be excessive. After choosing to travel instead by RV, he invited his family along with him.

At Yellowstone, Pombo had a lengthy meeting with the park superintendent, which a spokesman charactizered as official. Pombo&#x27;s visit to the Badlands National Park is in dispute: the secretary to the superintendent said he did not show; a spokesman for Pombo said that Pombo was certain he was there and met with a group of Native American tribal leaders nearby. Reports concerning Pombo&#x27;s visit to Joshua Tree are also contradictory. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was told that Pombo had shown up for his meeting but &quot;they were not there&quot;. The &quot;Tracy Press&quot; was told that Pombo met with the park&#x27;s acting superintendent.

Officials from Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks did not return calls seeking comment.

===Investigation of Charles Hurwitz===
One January 8, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Pombo and Representative John Doolittle had joined with then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas to oppose an investigation by federal banking regulators into the affairs of Houston millionaire Charles Hurwitz. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that &quot;When the FDIC persisted, Doolittle and Pombo—both considered protegés of DeLay—used their power as members of the House Resources Committee to subpoena the agency&#x27;s confidential records on the case, including details of the evidence FDIC investigators had compiled on Hurwitz.&quot; The investigation was ultimately dropped.

According to the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Although Washington politicians frequently try to help important constituents and contributors, it is unusual for members of Congress to take direct steps to stymie an ongoing investigation by an agency such as the FDIC.&quot; The article concluded, &quot;in the Hurwitz case, Doolittle and Pombo were in a position to pressure the FDIC and did so.&quot;

===Corruption at the Interior Department===
On September 23, 2006, the Central Valley &quot;Record&quot; reported that East Bay Representative George Miller and six other House Democrats had requested that Pombo hold &quot;immediate&quot; congressional hearings concerning oil lease payments to the Interior Department. The article noted that &quot;Miller and his allies—including Pombo&#x27;s challenger, wind power consultant Jerry McNerney—want oil companies such as Chevron to renegotiate contracts they inked with Clinton administration officials that failed to include language requiring the firms to pay taxes when oil prices pass $36 a barrel.&quot; Pombo &quot;had a provision written into the House&#x27;s offshore drilling legislation, which passed earlier this year, that would instead levy a fee on those firms that refuse to renegotiate their contracts.&quot;

===Probed oil firm linked to Pombo===
An Alaskan oil services company under federal investigation in connection with allegations of influence peddling has contributed nearly $18,000 to Pombo. The investigation sparked a Washington state candidate for the Senate to return his contributions from Anchorage-based VECO Corporation the day after the FBI raided offices of several Alaskan state legislators.

==2006 re-election campaign==
Amid these growing scandals, Pombo faced serious primary opposition for the first time since his initial race in 1992. His leading opponent was former congressman Pete McCloskey, a leading moderate Republican. Earlier, McCloskey had led an effort to find a viable primary challenger to Pombo. Pombo defeated McCloskey in the primary with 61 percent of the vote. McCloskey had been endorsed by &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, and the League of Conservation Voters. Seven weeks later, McCloskey endorsed Pombo&#x27;s Democratic opponent, Jerry McNerney, who had won the Democratic primary over Steve Filson and Steve Thomas. McNerney received just over half of the Democratic vote and faced Pombo in the 2006 general election in November. McNerney had been Pombo&#x27;s opponent in 2004.

On October 3, 2006, a Democratic-commissioned poll was released with McNerney leading Pombo 48 percent to 46 percent. There were two polls commissioned by the NRCC, but results weren&#x27;t released. Based on these events, in early October, &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; changed their rating of this race from &quot;Republican Favored&quot; to &quot;Leans Republican&quot;. This was a significant development; Pombo had soundly defeated McNerney in 2004, taking 61 percent of the vote.

On November 7, 2006, Pombo was defeated by McNerney. McNerney got 53.1 percent of the vote to Pombo&#x27;s 46.9 percent. Apart from prevailing national Democratic trends and the corruption allegations dogging him, Pombo was also the number one national target of environmental groups. Washington, D.C.–based Defenders of Wildlife spent more than $1 million on the race and commissioned the first poll in 2005 that showed Pombo to be vulnerable in his re-election bid. The Sierra Club sent over 300 volunteers and organizers to work for McNerney in the final weeks of the campaign. The group, allied with the League of Conservation Voters, also aired issue ads attacking Pombo. Pombo and Heather Wilson were the two Representatives targeted by the Humane Society, which spent over $100,000 in Pombo&#x27;s district, including organizers. Since Pombo left office, no other Republican has represented a significant part of the Bay Area in Congress.

In a letter dated November 29, 2006, from PAC/West Communications, Pombo states, &quot;I have accepted a position as Senior Partner at Pac/West, a full service political public relations firm with offices from California to Washington, D.C.&quot;

==2010 Congressional campaign==
On January 4, 2010, Pombo announced his candidacy for Congress in California&#x27;s 19th congressional district after Congressman George Radanovich, a fellow Republican, announced he wouldn&#x27;t run for reelection. The 19th neighbors Pombo&#x27;s former 11th district and leans more Republican than the 11th. Pombo said he &quot;didn&#x27;t think [he] would ever run again, but when George Radanovich announced he wasn&#x27;t running, my phone rang off the hook&quot;. Pombo faced Radanovich-backed state Senator Jeff Denham and former Fresno mayor Jim Patterson in the primary, which Jeff Denham won.

Pombo followed up his candidacy for Congress announcement by signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform on January 5, 2010. This marks the second time that Pombo signed the Pledge. He previously signed it as Representative of California&#x27;s 11th congressional district. According to ATR, Pombo has a lifetime rating of 91% from their annual Congressional Scorecards.

Primary opponent Jeff Denham stated that Pombo was a liability to the Republican Party who has &quot;given them a lot of material over the years&quot;, a reference to his various scandals and notoriety among environmentalists.

<text>Thomas Peter Lantos (born Tamás Péter Lantos; February 1, 1928 – February 11, 2008) was a Hungarian-born American politician who served as a U.S. representative from California from 1981 until his death in 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the state&#x27;s 11th congressional district until 1993. After redistricting, he served from the 12th congressional district, which included both the northern two-thirds of San Mateo County and a portion of the southwestern part of San Francisco.

Lantos, who served as Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in his last term, announced in early January 2008 that he would not run for re-election because of cancer of the esophagus. He died before finishing his term. A Hungarian Jew, Lantos was the only Holocaust survivor to have served in the United States Congress; he survived the genocide with help from Raoul Wallenberg. In speaking before the House of Representatives after his death, Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated that Lantos &quot;devoted his public life to shining a bright light on the dark corners of oppression. He used his powerful voice to stir the consciousness of world leaders and the public alike.&quot;

In 2008, after his death, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, which he founded in 1983, was renamed the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Its mission is partly &quot;to promote, defend, and advocate internationally recognized human rights&quot;. In the final weeks of his life, Lantos asked that a non-profit be established to carry on the work he felt so passionately about. The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights &amp; Justice was founded later that year to carry out that wish. In 2011, the Tom Lantos Institute was set up in Budapest to promote tolerance and support minority issues in Central Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as around the world.

==Early life==
Lantos was born Tamás Péter Lantos () into a Jewish family in Budapest, the son of Anna, a high school English teacher, and Pál Lantos, a banker. His family was heavily involved in education, and included an uncle who was a professor at the University of Budapest and a grandmother who was a high school principal.

=== World War II ===
His life in Hungary would change after the annexing of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, with the Austrian border just from Budapest. Lantos remembered this period and a newspaper headline he read when he was ten years old, &quot;Hitler Marches into Austria&quot;. Even at a young age, he understood the significance of this invasion, recalling in a 1999 interview with University of Washington Magazine, &quot;I sensed that this historic moment would have a tremendous impact on the lives of Hungarian Jews, my family, and myself&quot;.

Six years later, in March 1944, the German military invaded Hungary and occupied Budapest, its capital. As he was Jewish, Lantos, then 16, was arrested and sent to a forced labor camp outside of Budapest. He escaped, but was soon caught by the Germans and beaten severely, then returned to the labor camp. He again escaped, this time making his way back to Budapest, away. There, he hid with an aunt in a safe house set up by Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat.

Lantos joined Wallenberg&#x27;s network; his fair hair and blue eyes, which to the Nazis were physical signs of &quot;Aryanism&quot;, enabled him to serve as a courier and deliver food and medicine to Jews living in other safe houses. In January 1945, less than a year later, Soviet military forces fought door-to-door battles and liberated Hungary from German occupation. However, Lantos, then 17, returned home only to discover that his mother and other family members had all been murdered by the Germans, along with 440,000 other Hungarian Jews, during the preceding 10 months of their occupation. Wallenberg, for his part, was later credited with saving the lives of thousands of other Hungarian Jews.

Lantos described some of his experiences in the Academy Award-winning documentary film &quot;The Last Days&quot; (1998), produced by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Shoah Foundation. In his floor speeches as a congressman, he sometimes referred to himself as one of the few living members of Congress who had fought against fascism. In 1981, Lantos sponsored a bill making Wallenberg an Honorary Citizen of the United States, and became a member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. In January 2006, he traveled to Hungary and attended a ceremony commemorating the 61st anniversary of the liberation of the Budapest Ghetto. The event was held at the Great Synagogue in Budapest.

===Education===
In 1946, Lantos enrolled at the University of Budapest. As a result of his fluent English, he wrote an essay about Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he was awarded a scholarship by the Hillel Foundation to study in the United States. He then emigrated to the U.S., and studied economics at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he earned a B.A. in 1949 and an M.A. in 1950. He continued his post-graduate education at the University of California, Berkeley, and received a Ph.D. in economics in 1953.

===Early career===
After graduation from Berkeley, Lantos became a professor of economics at San Francisco State University. In subsequent years, he worked as a business consultant and television commentator on subjects of foreign policy. He eventually became a senior advisor to various U.S. Senators, and in 1980, he was elected to the U.S. Congress, where he remained until his death in February 2008. Recalling his early life, he announced his retirement by stating to Congress, &quot;I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country.&quot;

==Personal and family life==
Despite becoming fluent in English, Lantos never lost his Hungarian accent. During his childhood, he met his future wife, Annette Tillemann (or Tilleman; born June 27, 1931), then using the name Agnes Ethel Seymour. Her family had managed to escape to Switzerland, using Swedish passports issued by Raoul Wallenberg. After Hungary was liberated, she and her family returned to Budapest, where she and Lantos met again. After emigrating to the United States, they married on July 13, 1950. They remained married until his death in 2008. Agnes Ethel Lantos became a naturalized United States citizen on May 17, 1954, under that name. Annette&#x27;s father Sebastian was the brother of Jolie Gabor, with Jolie&#x27;s daughters Magda, Zsa Zsa, and Eva Gabor being first cousins to Annette Lantos.

Lantos and his wife had two daughters, Annette Marie and Katrina, and 18 grandchildren, including Levi Tillemann, an author and energy expert; Tomicah S. Tillemann, a former Democratic political speechwriter; and Charity Tillemann-Dick, an opera singer and activist. The Lantoses&#x27; daughter Annette was married to Timber Dick, an independent businessman in Colorado, until his accidental death in 2008.

Lantos&#x27;s younger daughter, Katrina Lantos Swett, is married to ambassador and former U.S. Representative from New Hampshire Richard Swett, and was herself a candidate for Congress in New Hampshire. She now serves as President of the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice, and she is also the Co-chair of the International Religious Freedom Summit. 

Lantos considered himself a secular Jew.

==Political career and positions==

Lantos made his first run for office in 1980, challenging Republican Congressman Bill Royer, who had won a 1979 special election after Democrat Leo Ryan was killed in the Jonestown massacre. Lantos defeated Royer by 5,700 votes. He never again faced such a close contest, and was re-elected 13 times. Lantos earned a reputation as a champion for various human rights causes, such as having Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang testify at a congressional hearing after the company turned over the email records of two Chinese dissidents to the Chinese government, allowing them to be traced and one sentenced to jail.

Lantos was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and repeatedly called for reforms to the nation&#x27;s health-care system, reduction of the national budget deficit and the national debt, repeal of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. He opposed Social Security privatization efforts. He supported same-sex marriage rights and marijuana for medical use, was a strong proponent of gun control and adamantly pro-choice.

Lantos was an advocate on behalf of the environment, receiving consistently high ratings from the League of Conservation Voters and other environmental organizations for his legislative record. His long-standing efforts to protect open space brought thousands of acres under the protection of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, including Mori Point, Sweeney Ridge, and Rancho Corral de Tierra, which will keep its s and delicate habitats free from development permanently. 

While Lantos was an early supporter of the Iraq War, from 2006 onward, he acknowledged public criticism about the conduct of the war and called for a diplomatic approach toward ceasing hostilities.

==Foreign affairs issues==

Lantos served as the chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Through its more than 20 years of work, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus—of which Lantos was co-chair with Representative Frank Wolf—covered a wide range of human rights issues. They included speaking for Christians in Saudi Arabia and Sudan to practice their faith, helping Tibetans to retain their culture and religion in Tibet, and advocating for other minorities worldwide.

Among his other efforts was a demand that Japan apologize for sex slavery during World War II. He declared Turkey&#x27;s mass killings of Armenians during World War I to be genocide. In more recent times, he supported democracy in Burma and pressed for sanctions on Iran for supporting terrorism. In 2004, he sponsored a bill to stop the spread of antisemitism.

On other aspects of American foreign policy, Lantos spoke out against waste, fraud and abuse in the multi-billion dollar U.S. reconstruction program in Iraq, and warned that the U.S. could lose Afghanistan to the Taliban if the Bush administration failed to take decisive action to halt the current decline in political stability there. Lantos was against U.S. military aid to Egypt as the Egyptian military had failed to stop the flow of money and weapons across the Egyptian border to Hamas in Gaza, and Egypt had not contributed troops to the peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

===1991 Gulf War===

Lantos was a strong supporter of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. During the run-up to the war in 1990, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, of which Lantos was co-chairman, hosted a 15 year old Kuwaiti girl, then identified only as &quot;Nurse Nayirah&quot;, who told of horrific abuses by Iraqi soldiers following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, including the killing of Kuwaiti babies by taking them out of their incubators and leaving them to die on the floor of the hospital. These alleged atrocities figured prominently in the rhetoric at the time about Iraqi abuses in Kuwait. Her witness account was later challenged by independent human rights monitors.

&quot;Nurse Nayirah&quot; later turned out to be the daughter of Saud Nasser Al-Saud Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait&#x27;s ruling Al-Sabah family who served as Kuwait&#x27;s ambassador to the United States at the time. Asked about having allowed the girl to give testimony without identifying herself, and without her story having been corroborated, Lantos replied, &quot;The notion that any of the witnesses brought to the caucus through the Kuwaiti Embassy would not be credible did not cross my mind... I have no basis for assuming that her story is not true, but the point goes beyond that. If one hypothesizes that the woman&#x27;s story is fictitious from A to Z, that in no way diminishes the avalanche of human rights violations.&quot;

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation sent investigators to Kuwait who went through the hospital and counted the incubators and they found that &quot;except for one or two that may have been misplaced&quot; all of the incubators were still in the hospital. The investigators concluded that there were no deaths resulting from stolen equipment. And the doctor who provided Amnesty International with the number of babies killed dropped from 312 to 72 and then 30, 19 of which died before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. After the war, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s plainly wrong for a member of congress to collaborate with a public relations firm to produce knowingly deceptive testimony on an important issue. Yet Representative Tom Lantos has been caught doing exactly that. His behavior warrants a searching inquiry by the House Ethics Committee.&quot;

===War in Iraq===
On October 4, 2002, Lantos led a narrow majority of Democrats on the House International Relations Committee to a successful vote in support of the Resolution for the Use of Force, seeking the approval of the United Nations and under the condition that President George W. Bush would allow UN weapons inspectors to finish their work and that Bush would need to return to Congress for an actual declaration of war before invading Iraq. The resolution later passed the House and the Senate with a total of 373 of 435 members of Congress supporting it. &quot;The train is now on its way&quot;, said Lantos after the resolution successfully passed both houses of Congress. In later hearings on the war, Lantos continued his enthusiastic support.

Starting in early 2006, Lantos distanced himself from the Bush Administration&#x27;s Iraq policy, making critical statements at hearings, on the House floor and in published media interviews about the conduct of the war. During hearings of the House International Relations Committee, where he was then the ranking member, Lantos repeatedly praised the investigative work of the office of the Special Inspector of Iraq Reconstruction General Stuart Bowen, which uncovered evidence of waste, fraud and abuse in the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Lantos was an immediate and consistent critic of the troop surge advocated by President Bush. On the night in January 2007 that Bush announced his plan, Lantos responded, &quot;I oppose the so-called surge that constitutes the centerpiece of the President&#x27;s plan. Our efforts in Iraq are a mess, and throwing in more troops will not improve it.&quot;

During a joint House hearing on September 10, 2007, featuring General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, Lantos said:

At the same hearing, Lantos drew comparisons between some of the current U.S. activities in Iraq to U.S. support two decades earlier of Islamic militants in Afghanistan:

==Human rights advocate==
===Tibet===
As co-founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1983 and as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Lantos would &quot;stir the consciousness of world leaders and the public alike&quot;, according to Representative Nancy Pelosi. She added: &quot;Wherever there was injustice or oppression, he used his expertise and moral authority to put the United States on the side of justice and human rights&quot;. In 2007, in his effort to help the people of China and Tibet, he presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal.

===Darfur===
On April 28, 2006, Lantos and four other Democratic U.S. Representatives, along with six other activists, took part in a civil disobedience action in front of the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C. They were protesting the role of the Sudanese government in carrying out genocide in the Darfur conflict and were arrested for disorderly conduct.

===Hungarian minorities===
Lantos was an activist for the rights of Hungarian minorities; as a member of the US House of Representatives. In a 2007 letter he asked Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia to distance themselves from the Beneš decrees, a reasonable process in the Hedvig Malina case, and to treat members of the Hungarian minority as equal.

The American Hungarian Federation recognized Congressman Lantos for his &quot;Leadership in Support of Democracy, Human Rights and Minority Rights in Central and Eastern Europe&quot;, awarding him the organization&#x27;s highest award, the &quot;Col. Commandant Michael Kovats Medal of Freedom&quot;, at the October 19, 2005, Congressional Reception commemorating the 49th Anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

===Lebanon===
On August 27, 2006, at the Israeli Foreign Ministry building in Israel, Lantos said he would block a foreign aid package promised by President George W. Bush to Lebanon unless and until Beirut agreed to the deployment of international troops on the border with Syria and Lebanon takes control of its borders with Syria to prevent arms smuggling to Hezbollah guerrillas.

===Morocco and Western Sahara===
Lantos supported Morocco&#x27;s demand to gain sovereignty over Western Sahara, and criticized the Polisario Front, which demands independence for the disputed region. In 2007, he backed Morocco&#x27;s proposal to make the region autonomous under Moroccan rule, saying: &quot;I urge the leadership of the Polisario to realize that they will never again get such a good deal for the population they purport to represent.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

On January 2, 2008, after having been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, Lantos announced he would not run for a 15th term in the House, but planned to complete his final term. In his statement, he said:

Lantos died from complications of esophageal cancer at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on February 11, 2008, ten days after his 80th birthday, and eleven months before the end of his term. Numerous politicians memorialized him; House Minority Whip Roy Blunt called him &quot;a man of uncommon integrity and sincere moral conviction — and a public servant who never wavered in his pursuit of a better, freer and more religiously tolerant world&quot;, and President George W. Bush called Lantos &quot;a man of character and a champion of human rights&quot; and &quot;a living reminder that we must never turn a blind eye to the suffering of the innocent at the hands of evil men&quot;. A memorial service was held for Lantos on February 14, 2008, at Statuary Hall in the Capitol. Speakers included Senator Joe Biden, Bono of U2, Rep. Steny Hoyer, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Rep. Christopher Shays and Elie Wiesel. He was buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

A special election was held to fill his seat on April 8, 2008, and was won by former State Senator Jackie Speier, whom Lantos had endorsed.

On June 19, 2008, Bush posthumously awarded Lantos the Medal of Freedom. In a ceremony at the White House, Bush stated &quot;We miss his vigorous defense of human rights and his powerful witness for the cause of human freedom. For a lifetime of leadership, for his commitment to liberty, and for his devoted service to his adopted nation, I am proud to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, posthumously, to Tom Lantos, and proud that his loving wife Annette will receive the award on behalf of his family.&quot;

In 2008, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, which he founded in 1983, was renamed The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Its mission is partly &quot;to promote, defend and advocate internationally recognized human rights.&quot; The first Lantos Human Rights Prize was presented to the 14th Dalai Lama in 2009. In 2011, the institute was set up in Budapest to promote tolerance and support minority issues in central and eastern Europe and in the world.

In the final weeks of his life, Lantos asked that a non-profit be established to carry on the work he felt so passionately about. The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights &amp; Justice was founded later that year to carry out that wish. Lantos&#x27;s daughter, Katrina Lantos Swett, serves as the Foundation&#x27;s president and CEO.

On September 10, 2011, the Peninsula Humane Society &amp; SPCA officially opened the Tom and Annette Lantos Center for Compassion, located at 1450 Rollins Road in Burlingame, California. The facility was funded with a naming gift in the Lantos&#x27;s honor by Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, and his wife, Melanie.

* Tom Lantos Tunnels south of San Francisco have been named after the late Congressman, as has a street in Netanya, Israel.
* BBYO, Inc. (formerly B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization) chapter honored Tom Lantos&#x27;s legacy by naming the chapter in his honor. Lantos AZA #2539 now thrives in the Rockville, Maryland, area.

Budapest named a promenade in the city in honor of Lantos in 2016.

Lantos received the Grand Cross, Hungary&#x27;s highest civilian honor.

==Controversies==
During a 1996 congressional inquiry into the Filegate scandal, Lantos told witness Craig Livingstone that &quot;with an infinitely more distinguished public record than yours, Admiral Boorda committed suicide when he may have committed a minor mistake&quot;. Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, had taken his own life after his right to wear Combat V decorations had been questioned. Lantos was criticized by some (including fellow Congressman Joe Scarborough) for this comment.

On May 3, 2000, Lantos was involved in an automobile accident while driving on Capitol Hill. He drove over a young boy&#x27;s foot and then failed to stop his vehicle and was later fined over the incident for inattentive driving.

In 2002, Lantos, who was on the House Committee on International Affairs, took Colette Avital, a Labor Party member of the Israeli Knesset, by the hand and, according to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, tried to reassure her with these words: &quot;My dear Colette, don&#x27;t worry. You won&#x27;t have any problem with Saddam. We&#x27;ll be rid of the bastard soon enough. And in his place we&#x27;ll install a pro-Western dictator, who will be good for us and for you.&quot; He later denied saying this, but Avital confirmed it, according to Ben Terrall, an adviser to Maad H. Abu-Ghazalah, a Libertarian Party candidate who ran against Lantos that year.

In June 2007, Lantos called former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder a &quot;political prostitute&quot; at the dedication ceremony of the Victims of Communism Memorial, which caused a political backlash from the German government. Lantos was referring to Schröder&#x27;s ties to energy business in Russia, and remarked that this appellation would offend prostitutes.

In October 2007, Dutch parliamentarians said Lantos insulted them while discussing the War on Terror by stating that the Netherlands had to help the United States because it liberated them in World War II, while adding that &quot;Europe was not as outraged by Auschwitz as by Guantanamo Bay.&quot;

On January 6, 2008, FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds included Lantos&#x27;s photograph among others featured in the &quot;State Secrets Privilege Gallery&quot; posted on her website, composing images of figures considered to be relevant to her case. On August 8, 2009, she gave sworn testimony about Lantos and others during a witness deposition before the Ohio Elections Commission in the &quot;Schmidt v. Krikorian&quot; case, in which she alleged that he had engaged in &quot;[N]ot only ... bribe[ry], but also ... disclosing highest level protected U.S. intelligence and weapons technology information both to Israel and to Turkey. ... other very serious criminal conduct.&quot;

<doc id="408663" wikidata="Q1602312" url="?curid=408663" title="Mark Green (Wisconsin politician)">
<text>Mark Andrew Green (born June 1, 1960) is an American politician and diplomat. He is currently president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Before joining the Wilson Center on March 15, 2021, he served as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, and prior to that, as the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. He served in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1993 to 1999, was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007, representing , ran unsuccessfully for governor of Wisconsin in 2006, and held the post of United States Ambassador to Tanzania from August 2007 until January 2009. Green served as president of the International Republican Institute from 2014 to 2017 and sits on the board of directors of the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

The United States Senate confirmed Green as administrator of the USAID on August 3, 2017. He was sworn in the following August 7. On March 16, 2020, Green submitted a resignation letter to President Trump. He left the office on April 10, 2020.

==Early life and education==
Green was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Jeremy and Elizabeth Green. His father is from South Africa, and Green spent time there as a child. His family moved often, and as a child he lived in Jersey City, New Jersey; Cincinnati, Ohio; England; South Africa; and Australia. He attended Abbot Pennings High School in De Pere, Wisconsin.

Green received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire in 1983 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1987. In law school, he served as a managing editor of the &quot;Wisconsin Law Review&quot; and won the Justice Robert Jackson Award from the Washington, D.C., Foreign Law Society for &quot;Best Published Student Writing on a Foreign Law Subject&quot;.

== Career ==
After graduating from law school, he joined the law firm Godfrey &amp; Kahn S.C. at their Green Bay, Wisconsin office.

=== Wisconsin State Assembly ===
In 1992, Green was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly, where he served District 4 for six years and rose to the position of chairman of the Republican Caucus. He chaired the Judiciary Committee, served on the Board of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA), and helped reform state housing policy. Green&#x27;s legislative work won him awards from the Wisconsin and American Farm Bureau Federations, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Rifle Association of America, the Wisconsin Builders Association, the Wisconsin Medical Society, Citizens Against Government Waste, Watchdogs of the Treasury, and the Seniors Coalition.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
Green first ran for Congress in 1998, defeating first-term Representative Jay W. Johnson, with 54% of the vote. Green won each of his next three elections with 70% or more of the vote. He represented Wisconsin&#x27;s 8th congressional district from the 106th Congress until the 109th Congress.

Green was a member of the House International Relations Committee in the 107th to 109th sessions of Congress. He helped draft the Millennium Challenge Act, the Global Access to HIV/AIDS Prevention, Awareness and Treatment Act of 2001, and the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act. He co-founded the Victory in Iraq Caucus.

Green worked to raise awareness about human rights violations by the communist Pathet Lao government in Laos against the ethnic minority Hmong people and others suffering under authoritarian governments, and about religious freedom issues in Laos and Southeast Asia. Many Hmong Americans had resettled in Wisconsin as political refugees following the Vietnam War.

In January 1999, Green was appointed an Assistant Majority Whip by then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, and then re-appointed by House Majority Whip Roy Blunt.

While a U.S. Representative, Green was a member of the House Judiciary Committee, vice chair of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee, and co-founded the bipartisan Faith-Based Caucus. He co-led the floor debate on the &quot;Faith-Based Initiative&quot;, a plan to reenlist faith-based communities in the national fight against poverty and social crises. As part of that effort, he co-founded the bipartisan Faith-Based Caucus. Green helped expand the Violence Against Women Act, and wrote the &quot;Two Strikes and You&#x27;re Out Child Protection Act&quot;, which would have established a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for twice-convicted child sex offenders. He also cosponsored the Debbie Smith Act, which was meant to assist law enforcement in modernizing DNA databases, and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. He supported the death penalty and the No Child Left Behind Act.

=== 2006 Wisconsin gubernatorial campaign ===

Green unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Wisconsin against incumbent Governor Jim Doyle, a Democrat. Green had no opponent in the Republican Party primary. Then-Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker dropped out of the GOP primary on March 24, 2006, citing a lack of campaign funds (he would later win the governorship in 2010). After the primary, Green was joined on the ticket by State Rep. Jean Hundertmark of Clintonville, who had defeated Nick Voegeli in the primary for lieutenant governor. Green received 979,427 votes to Doyle&#x27;s 1,139,115 votes.

=== U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania ===

On June 8, 2007, President George W. Bush announced Green&#x27;s nomination as United States Ambassador to Tanzania. Senator Russ Feingold, chairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, held hearings on Green&#x27;s nomination as ambassador on June 19.

Senator Chris Dodd, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put a hold on Green&#x27;s nomination to replace Michael Retzer as ambassador, citing Retzer&#x27;s action of revoking the country clearance of Peace Corps Country Director Christine Djondo as interference in the independence of the Peace Corps. On June 28, when the State Department provided a letter of apology to Djondo, Dodd released his hold. On August 3, 2007, the Senate confirmed Green by unanimous consent. He resigned as ambassador to Tanzania upon Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration as president.

==== Tenure ====
During Green&#x27;s tenure, President George W. Bush visited Tanzania in February 2008, the first official visit by a sitting U.S. president; Tanzania hosted Sullivan Summit VIII, the first Sullivan Summit in East Africa; President Kikwete visited the White House in August 2008; and the largest Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact in history was signed.

During his tenure, Green helped craft the Millennium Challenge Act, which expanded America&#x27;s commitment to invest in developing nations that are pursuing political and economic reforms. He worked to enact the Global Access to HIV/AIDS Prevention, Awareness and Treatment Act of 2001 and the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act. He worked on legislation covering policy areas like international terrorism and human trafficking. In 2005, Green worked with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute and the State Department as an election observer in Kenya. He also traveled to West Africa with the Academy for Educational Development, Oxfam and Save the Children to work on programs related to women&#x27;s health and education.

== Nongovernmental Organization (NGO) work ==
Green was a director of the policy center of Malaria No More, a global effort to eliminate malaria.

He served as a senior director of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) from 2011 until his appointment in 2017. USGLC is a foreign policy foundation that describes itself as &quot;a broad-based influential network of over 500 businesses and NGOs; national security and foreign policy experts; and business, faith-based, academic, military, and community leaders in all 50 states who support strategic investments to elevate development and diplomacy alongside defense in order to build a better, safer world&quot;.

He served as president and CEO of Initiative for Global Development, a nonprofit organization aimed at reducing world poverty, from 2013 to 2014.

From 2014 to 2017, Green served as president of the International Republican Institute (IRI), an NGO chaired by Arizona Sen. John McCain.

==Administrator of USAID==

===Nomination===
In May 2017, Green was nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the United States Agency for International Development. His nomination was backed by aid organizations and politicians, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing that Green &quot;is well regarded and known for his bipartisan approach to foreign assistance&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Mark and Susan (née Keske) Green wed on August 5, 1985, and have three children. Green and his wife served as volunteer teachers in Kenya with WorldTeach in 1987 and 1988, and while in Kenya, visited rural areas of neighboring countries.

<text>At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, 37 events were contested in athletics. There were a total number of 1005 participating athletes from 80 countries.

The men&#x27;s 50 kilometres walk competition was dropped from the Olympic athletics programme, despite its constant presence at the games since 1932. The IAAF chose to host its own world championship event instead, a month and a half after the Olympics. This foreshadowed the creation of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in the following years.

<text>The Canadian Brass is a Canadian brass quintet formed in 1970 in Toronto, Ontario, by Charles Daellenbach (tuba) and Gene Watts (trombone), with horn player Graeme Page and trumpeters Stuart Laughton and Bill Phillips completing the quintet. , Daellenbach is the sole original member in the group, with the other members being trumpeters Joe Burgstaller and Mikio Sasaki, hornist Jeff Nelsen, and trombonist Keith Dyrda.

The group is known for the use of humor in their live performances and an irreverent attitude that includes their signature attire of formal black suits with white running shoes. They have performed internationally and have recorded more than 170 CDs and DVDs. They have commissioned, performed, and recorded hundreds of transcriptions and original works for brass quintet. Canadian Brass has a library of more than 600 compositions and arrangements written specifically for them.

The quintet was named the &quot;one of the most popular brass ensembles in the world&quot; in 2015 by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. They have appeared on all the major North American TV networks, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;CBS Sunday Morning,&quot; and Hunan TV in China.

== History ==
The Canadian Brass originally included &quot;Ensemble&quot; in its name, but in 1971, the Hamilton Philharmonic&#x27;s then-music director Betty Webster suggested that the quintet should be officially named the Canadian Brass.

Canadian Brass made its American debut at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in 1975. A significant international visit was made in 1977 when they were sent to mainland China as a cultural exchange between Canada and China. The ensemble was chosen and sent on this cultural mission by then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. They are now remembered in China as the first Western musicians allowed into China after the Cultural Revolution had suppressed Western art and music.

In 1979, the Canadian Brass became the first chamber ensemble to solo the main stage at Carnegie Hall. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, their sold-out performance &quot;clearly establishes the Canadian Brass as a main-stage attraction.&quot; In addition to their heavy international touring schedule for nearly 50 years, and their extensive recording catalog, they have been on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in each decade of their existence, recording for RCA Records, BMG, Columbia Records, SONY, Philips Decca, Steinway Label and Opening Day Entertainment occupying virtually all the spots open to brass players. As of 2018, the Canadian Brass recordings have been released by Toronto-based Opening Day Entertainment Group (ODEG), headed by the Daellenbachs.

The first recordings the Brass created were for the CBC Radio transcription service, CBC Records, including their very first major concert in Toronto the summer of 1971. Record producer Eleanor Sniderman discovered the group and put the group on its first commercial LPs in 1973 and 1974, which then attracted major artist management in New York City. In 1977, the same year the Brass represented North America in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a live radio broadcast on WQXR was heard by multi-Grammy award-winning producer Jay Saks, who was impressed, and brought the group to the prestigious RCA Red Seal label. The ensemble was then scouted by CBS records, soon to be Sony, where they recorded with the Berlin Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony brass players, establishing a repertoire that is now standard for expanded brass ensembles.

When the group&#x27;s former manager, Costa Pilavachi, assumed the post of &quot;Head of A&amp;R&quot; at Philips Records in the Netherlands, he lured the Brass to his new label, establishing a new European presence for the group. In 1992, the Brass returned to RCA, releasing fourteen albums in eight years, including Bach&#x27;s Goldberg Variations, for which the group won a German Echo award.

Stuart Laughton founded Opening Day in 1993, as a recording company specializing in Canadian performers and compositions (five JUNO nominations and a win resulted). By 2003 Laughton was seeking a partner for the heavy work load, and in talks with Chuck Daellenbach agreed to share, then relinquish control. Daellenbach extended the scope of the company, creating Opening Day Entertainment Group and entering into partnership with producer Trey Mills later that year. Mills signed over to Mary Beth Daellenbach in December, 2007. Opening Day Entertainment Group remains an independent recording label now directed by Mary Beth Daellenbach. As of 2014 ODEG has released over 70 CDs for artists in a variety of genres.

<text>Nagaland () is a state in the north-eastern region of India. It is bordered by the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh to the north, Assam to the west, Manipur to the south, and the Naga Self-Administered Zone of the Sagaing Region of Myanmar (Burma) to the east. Its capital city is Kohima and its largest city is the twin Chümoukedima–Dimapur. The state has an area of with a population of 1,980,602 as per the 2011 Census of India, making it one of the least populated states in India.

Nagaland consists of 16 administrative districts, inhabited by 17 major tribes along with other sub-tribes. Each tribe is distinct in character from the other in terms of customs, language and dress. It is a land of folklore passed down the generations through word of mouth. The earliest recorded history of the Nagas of the present-day Nagaland dates back to the 13th century.

In the 19th century, the British India forces began expanding their influence in Northeast India, including the Naga Hills. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the question of the Naga Hills&#x27; political status emerged. Nagaland was a district in the State of Assam until 1957, known to others as &quot;The Naga Hills&quot;. The Naga National Council, led by Zapu Phizo, demanded an independent Naga state and launched an armed insurgency. The Indian Government, however, maintained that Nagaland was an integral part of the Indian Union. The conflict between the Naga National Council and the Indian Government resulted in a protracted insurgency. The State of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963, as the 16th state of the Indian Union, and a democratically elected government took office in 1964.

Nagaland is home to a rich variety of natural, cultural, and environmental resources. It is a mountainous state and lies between the parallels of 95° and 94° eastern longitude and 25.2° and 27.0° latitude north. The high-profile Dzüko Valley is at Viswema, in the southern region of the state. The state has significant resources of natural minerals, petroleum, and hydropower, with the primary sector which is mostly agriculture still accounting for 24.6% of its economy. Other significant activities include forestry, tourism, insurance, real estate, horticulture, and miscellaneous cottage industries.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &#x27;Naga&#x27; is unclear. The present day Naga people have historically been referred to by many names, like &quot;Noga&quot; or &quot;Naka&quot; by the inhabitants of the Ahom kingdom in what is now considered as Assam which means &quot;naked&quot;, &quot;Hao&quot; by Meitei people of Imphal Valley and &quot;Nakas&quot; or &#x27;Naga&#x27; by Burmese of what is now considered as Myanmar meaning &quot;people with earrings&quot;, while others suggest it means pierced noses.

Before the arrival of European colonialism in South Asia, there had been many wars, persecution and raids from Burma on the Nagas, Meiteis and others in India&#x27;s northeast. The invaders came for &quot;head hunting&quot; and to seek wealth and captives from these tribes and ethnic groups. When the British inquired with Burmese guides about the people living in the northern Himalayas, they were told &#x27;Naka&#x27;. This was recorded as &#x27;Naga&#x27; and has been in use thereafter.

== History ==

The ancient history of the Nagas is unclear. Ethnic groups migrated at different times, each settling in the northeastern part of present India and establishing their respective sovereign mountain terrains and village states. There are no records of whether they came from the northern Mongolian region, southeast Asia, or southwest China, except that their origins are from the east of India, and historical records show the present-day Naga people settled before the arrival of the Ahoms in 1228 CE.

===Kingdom of Ava===
In Yan-aung-myin Pagoda inscription found in Pinya of Myanmar mentions that the Kingdom of Ava under Minkhaung I (1400–1421) in the early 1400s extended till the territories of the Nagas.
=== British administration ===
With the arrival of the British East India Company in the early 19th century, followed by the British Raj, Britain expanded its domain over the whole of South Asia, including the Naga Hills. The first Europeans to enter the hills were Captain Francis Jenkins and Lieutenant Robert Pemberton in 1832. The early contact with the Naga ethnic groups was characterised by suspicion and conflict. The colonial interests in Assam, such as managers of tea estates and other trading posts led defensive action against raids from the ethnic groups who were known for their bravery and &quot;head hunting&quot; practices. To put an end to these raids, the British troops recorded 10 military expeditions between 1839 and 1850. In February 1851, at the bloody Battle of Kikrüma, people died on both the British side and the Kikrüma (Naga) side; in the days after the battle, inter-ethnic warfare followed that led to more bloodshed. After that war, the British adopted a policy of caution and non-interference with Naga ethnic groups.
Despite this, colonists continued to move into Naga peoples&#x27; territory. Between 1851 and 1865, Naga ethnic groups continued to raid the British in Assam. The British India Government took over the holdings of the East Indian Company following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The failings and atrocities of the East Indian Company led the British Crown to review its governance structure throughout South Asia including its northeastern region. In 1866, the British India administration established a post at Samaguting with the explicit goal of ending intertribal warfare and tribal raids on property and personnel.

In 1869, Captain Butler was appointed to lead and consolidate the British presence in the Nagaland Hills. In 1878, the headquarters were transferred to Kohima — creating a city that remains an important center of administration, commerce, and culture for Nagaland.

On 4 October 1879, British political agent G. H. Damant went to Khonoma with troops, where he was shot dead with 35 of his team. Kohima was subsequently attacked and the stockade looted. This violence led to a determined effort by the British Raj to return and respond. The subsequent defeat of Khonoma marked the end of serious and persistent ultimatums in the Naga Hills.

Between 1880 and 1922, the British administration consolidated their position over a large area of the Naga Hills and integrated it into its Assam operations. The British administration enforced the rupee as the currency for economic activity and a system of structured ethnic government that was very different from historic social governance practices.

In parallel, since the mid-19th century, Christian missionaries from the United States and Europe, stationed in India, reached into Nagaland and neighbouring states, converting Nagaland&#x27;s Naga ethnic groups from animism to Christianity.

=== World War II ===


In 1944, during World War II, the Japanese Army, with the help of the Indian National Army led by Netaji Subhashchandra Bose, invaded through Burma and attempted to take India through Kohima. The population was evacuated. British India soldiers defended the area of Kohima and having lost many of their original force were relieved by British in June 1944.
Together the British and Indian troops successfully repelled the Japanese troops.
The battle was fought from 4 April to 22 June 1944 from the town of Kohima, coordinated with action at Imphal, Manipur. The Indian National Army lost half their numbers, many through starvation, and were forced to withdraw through Burma.

There is the World War II Cemetery, and the War Museum, in honour of those who died during World War II during the fighting between the British Empire and Japanese troops. Nearly 4,000 British Empire troops died, along with 3,000 Japanese. Many of those who died were Naga people, particularly the Angami Nagas. Near the memorial is the Kohima Cathedral, on Aradura Hill, built with funds from the families and friends of deceased Japanese soldiers. Prayers are held in Kohima for peace and in memory of the fallen of both sides of the battle.
=== Naga national awakening ===

In 1929, a memorandum was submitted to the Simon Statutory Commission, requesting that the Nagas be exempt from reforms and new taxes proposed in British India, should be left alone to determine their own future.

The Naga Memorandum submitted by the Naga Club (which later became the Naga National Council) to the Simon Commission explicitly stated, &#x27;to leave us alone to determine ourselves as in ancient times.&#x27;

=== Post-independence history ===
After the independence of India in 1947, the area remained a part of the province of Assam. Nationalist activities arose among a section of the Nagas. Phizo-led Naga National Council demanded a political union of their ancestral and native groups. The movement led to a series of violent incidents, that damaged government and civil infrastructure, attacked government officials and civilians. The central government sent the Indian Army in 1955, to restore order. In 1957, an agreement was reached between Naga leaders and the Indian government, creating a single separate region of the Naga Hills. The Tuensang frontier was united with this single political region, Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA), and it became an autonomous area under Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India. It was to be &quot;administered by the Governor as the agent of the President but will be distinct from the North East Frontier Administration&quot;.

This was not satisfactory to the Nagas, however, and agitation with violence increased across the state – including attacks on army and government institutions, banks, as well as non-payment of taxes. In July 1960, following discussion between Prime Minister Nehru and the leaders of the Naga People Convention (NPC), a 16-point agreement was arrived at whereby the Government of India recognised the formation of Nagaland as a full-fledged state within the Union of India.

=== Nagaland statehood and late 20th century ===
Accordingly, the territory was placed under the Nagaland Transitional Provisions Regulation, 1961 which provided for an Interim body consisting of 45 members to be elected by tribes according to the customs, traditions and usage of the respective tribes. Subsequently, Nagaland attained statehood with the enactment of the state of Nagaland Act in 1962 by the Parliament. The interim body was dissolved on 30 November 1963 and the state of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963 and Kohima was declared as the state capital. After elections in January 1964, the first democratically elected Nagaland Legislative Assembly was constituted on 11 February 1964.

The rebel activity continued in many Naga inhabited areas both in India and Burma. Ceasefires were announced and negotiations continued, but this did little to stop the violence. In March 1975, a direct presidential rule was imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on the state. In November 1975, some leaders of the largest rebel groups agreed to lay down their arms and accept the Indian constitution, a small group did not agree and continued their insurgent activity. The Nagaland Baptist Church Council played an important role by initiating peace efforts in the 1960s.

=== 21st century ===
In 2004, two powerful bombs were set off on the same day and struck the Dimapur Railway Station and the Hong Kong Market, resulting in 30 deaths and wounding over 100 others in the deadliest terrorist attack in Nagaland to date.

Over the 5-year period of 2009 to 2013, between 0 and 11 civilians died per year in Nagaland from rebellion related activity (or less than 1 death per 100,000 people), and between 3 and 55 militants died per year in inter-factional killings (or between 0 and 3 deaths per 100,000 people).

In early 2017, Nagaland went into a state of civil unrest and protests in response to the announcement to implement 33% women&#x27;s reservation in the Civic Elections.

On 4 December 2021, a unit of the 21st Para Special Forces of the Indian Army killed six civilian labourers near Oting Village in the Mon District of Nagaland. Eight more civilians and a soldier were killed in subsequent violence. The incident was widely condemned, with many calling out to repeal and revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.

The most recent Nagaland Legislative Assembly election took place on 27 February 2023 to elect the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the 60 Assembly Constituencies in the state. A voter turnout of 87% was observed in the election. The election created history by electing two women candidates for the first time in Nagaland — Hekani Jakhalu Kense and Salhoutuonuo Kruse. Both candidates were from the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). Salhoutuonuo Kruse later became the first woman minister of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly.

== Geography ==


Twenty per cent of the total land area of the state is covered with wooded forest, a haven for flora and fauna. The evergreen tropical and subtropical forests are found in strategic pockets in the state.

=== Climate ===
Nagaland has a largely monsoon climate with high humidity levels. Annual rainfall averages around , concentrated in the months of May to September. Temperatures range from . In winter, temperatures do not generally drop below , but frost is common at high elevations. Summer is the shortest season in the state, lasting only a few months. The temperature during the summer season remains between . Winter often arrives early, with bitter cold and dry weather striking certain regions of the state. The maximum average temperature recorded in the winter season is . Strong northwest winds blow across the state during the months of February and March.

=== Flora and fauna ===

About one-sixth of Nagaland is covered by tropical and sub-tropical evergreen forests—including palms, bamboo, rattan as well as timber and mahogany forests. While some forest areas have been cleared for jhum cultivation, many scrub forests, rainforests, tall grassland, and reed-grass marshes remain. Ntangki National Park, Pulie Badze Wildlife Sanctuary, Fakim Wildlife Sanctuary and Rangapahar Reserve Forest are some natural reserves in Nagaland. 

Some noteworthy mammals found in Nagaland include the slow loris, Assamese macaque, pig-tailed macaque, stump-tailed macaque, rhesus macaque, capped langur, hoolock gibbon, Himalayan black bear, few sun bear, dhole, occasional Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, clouded leopard, marbled cat, golden cat, Indian elephants, Indian rhinoceros, gaur, red serow, common and leaf muntjac, eastern hog deer, sambar, Chinese pangolin, Malayan porcupine, Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine, and Hoary bamboo rats.

Nagaland has a rich birdlife with more than 490 species. The great Indian hornbill has a place in Naga culture. Blyth&#x27;s tragopan, a vulnerable species of galliform, is the state bird of Nagaland. It is sighted in Mount Japfü and Dzüko Valley of Kohima District, Satoi range in Zünheboto District and Pfütsero in Phek District. The state is also known as the &quot;falcon capital of the world&quot; thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Amur falcons that stop at Doyang Reservoir to feast on flying termites on their way from China and Siberia to Africa each year.

Mithun (a semi-domesticated gaur) is the state animal of Nagaland and has been adopted as the official seal of the Government of Nagaland. It is ritually the most valued species in the state. To conserve and protect this animal in the northeast, the National Research Centre on Mithun (NRCM) was established by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1988.


Nagaland is home to 396 species of orchids, belonging to 92 genera of which 54 having horticultural and medicinal economic importance.

=== Geology ===

Several preliminary studies indicate significant recoverable reserves of petroleum and natural gas. Limestone, marble and other decorative stone reserves are plentiful, and other as yet unexploited minerals include iron, nickel, chromium, and cobalt.

=== Urbanisation ===
The Nagaland population is largely rural with 71.14% living in rural regions in 2011. Census reports up to 1951 listed just one settlement in Nagaland as a town, the capital Kohima. The next two settlements, Dimapur and Mokokchung were listed as towns from 1961. Four more towns appeared in 1981: Tuensang, Wokha, Mon and Zünheboto.

The relatively slow rate of urbanisation in Nagaland was described in the 1980s as being an effect of (a) the largely administrative roles of the towns, except for Dimapur which had a more diversified economy, and (b) a low level of mobility among the tribes of Nagaland, scheduled tribes constituting nearly 90% of the population.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
The population of Nagaland consists of almost 2.2 million people, consisting of 1.04 million males and 0.95 million females. Among its districts, Kohima has the largest population (270,063) followed by Dimapur (170,000). The least populated district is Longleng (50,593). 75% of the population lives in the rural areas. As of 2013, about 10% of rural population is below the poverty line; among the people living in urban areas 4.3% of them are below the poverty line.

The state showed a population drop between the 2001 census and the 2011 census, the only state to show a population drop in the census. This has been attributed, by scholars, to incorrect counting in past censuses; the 2011 census in Nagaland is considered most reliable so far.

The largest urban agglomerations are centred upon Dimapur (122,834) and Kohima (115,283).
Other major towns (and 2011 census populations) are Tuensang (36,774), Mokokchung (35,913), Wokha (35,004), Mon (26,328), Chümoukedima (25,885), Zünheboto (22,633), Kiphire (16,487), Kuda (16,108), Kohima Village (15,734), Phek (14,204), Pfütsero (10,371) and Diphupar &#x27;A&#x27; (10,246).

The life expectancy of Nagaland stands at 75.4 years, 79.9 years for females and 71.5 years for males (2019–21) while the infant mortality rate amounts to 3 per 1,000 births (2019), on par with the most developed countries. Both health indicators are the best among Indian states. The fertility rate of 1.7 children per woman (2019–21) lies below the population replacement level.

=== Ethnic groups ===

The state is home to 15 major native Naga ethnic groups – Angami, Ao, Chakhesang, Chang, Khiamniungan, Konyak, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, Sümi, Tikhir, Yimkhiung, Zeme-Liangmai (Zeliang) and two other ethnic groups namely Kuki and Kachari with decent number of community.

Some other recent minor tribes or subtribes that can found in the state are Garo, Karbi, Chirr, Makury, and Rongmei.

There are also sizeable populations of non-native communities like Bengalis, Marwaris, Nepalis, Punjabis and others living mostly around Dimapur City.

=== Languages ===

Naga people form the majority of the population. According to the 2011 census there are 2 million people living in Nagaland. The Naga people number around 1.8 million in the state, constituting over 90% of the population. These belong mostly to the Sino-Tibetan language family. Shafer came up with his own classification system for languages found in and around Nagaland.

In 1967, the Nagaland Assembly proclaimed Indian English as the official language of Nagaland and it is the medium for education in Nagaland. Other than English, Nagamese, a creole language based on Assamese, is widely spoken.

The major languages spoken as per the 2011 census are Konyak (244,135), Ao (231,084), Lotha (177,488), Angami (151,883), Chokri (91,010), Sangtam (75,841), Bengali (74,753), Zeme (71,954; covering Zeliang, 60,399 and Zemi, 11,165), Yimkhiungrü (74,156), Chang (65,632), Khiamniungan (61,906), Rengma (61,537), Phom (53,674), Nepali (43,481), Kuzhami (34,218), Pochury (21,446), Kuki (18,391), Chakhesang (17,919), Assamese (17,201), Bodo (12,243; covering Bodo 7,372 and Dimasa 4,871), Manipuri (9,511), Sema (8,268), etc.

=== Religion ===
==== Christianity ====
The state&#x27;s population is 1.978 million, out of which 88% are Christians. Nagaland is known as &quot;the only predominantly Baptist State in the World&quot; and &quot;the most Baptist State in the World.&quot;

Christianity arrived in Nagaland in the early 19th century. The American Baptist Naga mission grew out of the Assam mission in 1836. Miles Bronson, Nathan Brown and other Christian missionaries working out of Jaipur to bring Christianity to the Indian subcontinent, saw the opportunity for gaining converts since many parts of India&#x27;s northeast was principally animist and folk religion-driven. Along with other tribal regions of the northeast, the people of Nagaland converted to Christianity.

==== Hinduism ====

Hinduism is the second largest religion in Nagaland. Hindus are concentrated mainly in the erstwhile Dimapur District (as per the 2011 Census of India, comprising the present districts of Dimapur, Niuland, and Chümoukedima) (28.75%) and Kohima District (9.51%). Dimapur Kalibari is a famous temple in Nagaland.

===Other religions===
There are also folk religions practised by some Nagas, specially among the Zeliangrongs (Zemes and Rongmeis) but few among other Naga ethnic groups.

== Government ==
The governor is the constitutional head of state, representative of the President of India. He possesses largely ceremonial responsibilities apart from law and order responsibilities.

=== Elections ===

The Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) is a state level coalition of political parties. It headed the government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) (JDU). It was formed in 2003 after the Nagaland Legislative Assembly election, with the Naga People&#x27;s Front (NPF), and the BJP. The alliance was in power in Nagaland from 2003 to 2018.

The NDPP–BJP–NPF alliance led UDA government has won the majority in 2018 Nagaland Legislative Assembly election and has been in power since then.

== Administrative districts ==


=== Districts ===
The sixteen districts of Nagaland, and their headquarters, 2011 census populations, areas and elevations (of the seat) are:


== Economy ==
The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Nagaland was about in 2011–12. Nagaland&#x27;s GSDP grew at 9.9% compounded annually for a decade, thus more than doubling the per capita income.

Nagaland has a literacy rate of 80.1 per cent. The majority of the population in the state speaks English, which is the official language of the state. The state offers technical and medical education. Nevertheless, agriculture and forestry contribute a majority of Nagaland&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product. The state is rich in mineral resources such as coal, limestone, iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, and marble.
Plantation crops such as premium coffee, cardamom, and tea are grown in hilly areas in small quantities with large growth potential. Most people cultivate rice as it is the main staple diet of the people. About 80% of the cropped area is dedicated to rice. Oilseeds is another, higher income crop gaining ground in Nagaland. The farm productivity for all crops is low, compared to other Indian states, suggesting a significant opportunity for farmer income increase. Currently, the Jhum to Terraced cultivation ratio is 4:3; where Jhum is the local name for cut-and-burn shift farming. Jhum farming is ancient, causes a lot of pollution and soil damage, yet accounts for the majority of the farmed area. The state does not produce enough food and depends on the trade of food from other states of India.

Tourism has a lot of potentials but was largely limited due to insurgency and concern of terrorist violence over the last five decades. More recently, a number of Small Medium Enterprises and private sector companies have actively promoted Nagaland tourism, helping initiate a growing tourism market. Tourism experts contend that the state&#x27;s uniqueness and strategic location in northeast India give Nagaland an advantage in tapping into the tourism sector for economic growth.

The state generates 87.98 MU compared to a demand for 242.88 MU. This deficit requires Nagaland to buy power. The state has significant hydroelectric potential, which if realised could make the state a power surplus state. In terms of power distribution, every village and town, and almost every household has an electricity connection; but, this infrastructure is not effective given the power shortage in the state.

=== Natural resources ===
After a gap of almost 20 years, Nagaland state Chief Minister, T. R. Zeliang launched the resumption of oil exploration in Changpang and Tsori areas, under Wokha District in July 2014. The exploration will be carried out by the Metropolitan Oil &amp; Gas Pvt. Ltd. Zeliang has alleged failures and disputed payments made to the statement made by the previous explorer, the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

== Transportation ==
Nagaland&#x27;s rugged and mountainous landscape presents a major challenge to the infrastructural development of transport. Roads are the backbone of Nagaland&#x27;s transportation network. The state has over 15,000 km of surfaced roads, but these are not satisfactorily maintained given the weather damage. Yet, in terms of population served for each kilometre of surfaced road, Nagaland is the second best state in the region after Arunachal Pradesh.

=== Roadways ===
==== International highways passing through Nagaland ====

=== Airways ===

Dimapur Airport is the sole airport in Nagaland, with scheduled commercial services to Kolkata,
Guwahati, Imphal, and Dibrugarh. It is located from Dimapur, and from Kohima. The airport&#x27;s asphalt runway is 2290 metre long, at an elevation of 487 feet.

== Culture ==

=== Festivals ===
Nagaland is known in India as the &quot;Land of Festivals&quot;. The diversity of people and ethnic groups, each with their own culture and heritage, creates a year-long atmosphere of celebrations. In addition, the state celebrates all Christian festivities. Traditional ethnic-related festivals revolve round agriculture, as a vast majority of the population of Nagaland is directly dependent on agriculture. Some of the significant festivals for each major ethnic groups are:
==== Hornbill Festival ====

The Hornbill Festival was launched by the Government of Nagaland in December 2000 to encourage inter-ethnic interaction and to promote cultural heritage of the state.

It is held at the Kisama Heritage Village which is about 12 km south of Kohima. All the ethnic groups of Nagaland take part in this festival. The aim of the festival is to revive and protect the rich culture of Nagaland and display its history, culture and traditions.
The festival is named after the hornbill bird, which is displayed in folklores in most of the state&#x27;s ethnic groups. The week-long festival unites Nagaland and people enjoy the colourful performances, crafts, sports, food fairs, games, and ceremonies. Traditional arts which include paintings, wood carvings, and sculptures are on display. Festival highlights include traditional Naga Morungs exhibition and sale of arts and crafts, food stalls, herbal medicine stalls, shows and sales, cultural medley – songs and dances, fashion shows, beauty contest, traditional archery, naga wrestling, indigenous games, and musical concerts. Additional attractions include the Konyak fire eating demonstration, pork-fat eating competitions, the Hornbill Literature Festival (including the Hutton Lectures), Hornbill Global Film Fest, Hornbill Ball, Choral Panorama, North East India Drum Ensemble, Naga King Chilli eating competition, Hornbill National Rock Contest, Hornbill International Motor Rally and WW-II Vintage Car Rally.
=== Sports ===
====Kene====

&quot;Kene&quot; or &quot;Naga wrestling&quot; is a folk wrestling style and traditional sport of the Nagas.

====Aki Kiti====

&quot;Aki Kiti&quot; or &quot;Sümi kick fighting&quot; is a traditional combat sport originating from and was practised by the Sümi Nagas. It is characterised by kicking and blocking solely using the soles of the feet. The sporting event served the purpose of righting wrongs, restoring honour, or &quot;settling scores&quot; between tribes and tribesmen without resorting to violence. It was practised during tribal ceremonies.

====Cricket====
====Football====
===Cuisine===
===Historical rituals===
====Feasts of Merit====
In Naga society, individuals were expected to find their place in the social hierarchy, and prestige was the key to maintaining or increasing social status. To achieve these goals a man, whatever his ascendancy, had to be a headhunter or great warrior, have many sexual conquests among women, or complete a series of merit feasts.

The Feasts of Merit reflected the splendor and celebration of Naga life. Only married men could give such Feasts, and his wife took a prominent and honoured place during the ritual which emphasised male-female co-operation and interdependence. His wife brewed the beer which he offered to the guests. The event displayed ceremonies and festivities organised by the sponsor. The Feast given by a wealthier community person would be more extravagant. He would typically invite everyone from the ethnic group. This event bestowed honour to the couple from the community. After the Feast, the tribe would give the couple rights to ornaments equally.

== Education ==

Nagaland&#x27;s schools are run by the state and central government or by a private organisation. Instruction is mainly in English — the official language of Nagaland. Under the 10+2+3 plan, after passing the Higher Secondary Examination (the grade 12 examination), students may enroll in general or professional degree programs.

Nagaland has three autonomous colleges:
* St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Jakhama
* Kohima Science College, Jotsoma
* Patkai Christian College, Chümoukedima

Along with one central university—Nagaland University, one engineering college—National Institute of Technology, one medical college— Nagaland Institute of Medical Science and Research, one College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry in Jalukie and three private Universities—St. Joseph University, Northeast Christian University (NECU) and Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India University (ICFAI University).

== Tourism ==
Tourism experts contend that the state&#x27;s uniqueness and strategic location in northeast India give Nagaland an advantage in tapping into the tourism sector for economic growth. The state has been extremely successful in promoting the great Hornbill Festival, which attracts Indian and foreign tourists alike.
The key thrusts of Nagaland&#x27;s tourism are its rich culture, showcasing of history and wildlife. Tourism infrastructure is rapidly improving. Local initiatives and tourism pioneers are now beginning to promote a socially responsible tourism model involving the participation of the councils, village elders, the church and the youth.

==Notability==
The Naga Mircha is a variety of chilli mainly grown in this state.

These are one of the world&#x27;s hottest chillies and an indigenous treasure of Nagaland, deeply rooted in the region&#x27;s lifestyle since ancient times. For generations, farmers in Nagaland&#x27;s chilli-growing areas have cultivated Naga Mircha Chilli, relying on it as a primary source of income and livelihood. This iconic chilli is an integral part of Nagaland&#x27;s culinary identity, inseparably linked to the local community as a staple ingredient.

===Geographical indication===
It was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) status tag from the Geographical Indications Registry under the Union Government of India on 02/12/2008 (valid until 21/08/2027).

The Secretary, Department of Horticulture &amp; Agriculture, Government of Nagaland, from Kohima, proposed the GI registration of Naga Mircha. After filing the application in August 2007, the chilli was granted the GI tag in 2008 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai, making the name &quot;Naga Mircha&quot; exclusive to the chilies grown in the region. It thus became the first chilli variety from Nagaland and the first type of goods from Nagaland to earn the GI tag.

<doc id="408682" wikidata="Q3042666" url="?curid=408682" title="Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada">
<text>The Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada () was written in French by the patriot rebel Robert Nelson on February 22, 1838, while in exile in the United States, after the first rebellion of 1837.

The 1838 declaration was primarily inspired by the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence and the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but it also included some other political ideas that were popular in the 19th century. The movement for the independence of Lower Canada (today Quebec) ultimately failed, as it did not result in the creation of an independent nation-state. 

==Excerpt==
...&quot;whereas we can no longer suffer the repeated violations of our most dearest rights, and patiently support the advanced outrages and cruelties of the Government of Lower Canada,&quot;

&quot;WE, in the name of the people of Lower Canada, acknowledging the decrees of a Divine Providence, which permits us to put down a Government, which hath abused the object and intention for which it was created, and to make choice of that form of Government which shall re-establish the empire of justice — assure domestic tranquility — provide for common defense — promote general good, and secure to us and our posterity the advantages of civil and religious liberty,&quot;

&quot;SOLEMNLY DECLARE:—&quot;

#&quot;That from this day forward, the PEOPLE OF LOWER CANADA are absolved from all allegiance to Great Britain, and that the political connection between that Power and Lower Canada, is now disbanded.&quot;
#&quot;That a REPUBLICAN form of Government is best suited to Lower Canada, which is this day declared to be a REPUBLIC.&quot;
#&quot;That under the Free Government of Lower Canada, all persons shall enjoy the same rights: the Indians shall no longer be under any civil disqualification, but shall enjoy the same rights as all other citizens in Lower Canada.&quot;

<text>James Dennis Carroll (August 1, 1949 – September 11, 2009) was an American author, poet, and punk musician. Carroll was best known for his 1978 autobiographical work &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, which inspired a 1995 film of the same title that starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Carroll, and his 1980 song &quot;People Who Died&quot; with the Jim Carroll Band.

==Early life and education ==
James Dennis Carroll was born on August 1, 1949 to a working-class family of Irish descent, and grew up in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side. When he was about 11 (in the sixth grade) his family moved north to Inwood in Upper Manhattan.

He was taught by the LaSalle Christian Brothers. In fall 1963, he entered Rice High School in Harlem, but was soon awarded a scholarship to the elite Trinity School. He attended Trinity from 1964 to 1968.

Carroll was a basketball star in high school, but also developed an addiction to heroin. He financed his drug habit by engaging in prostitution in the vicinity of 53rd Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan. Carroll briefly attended Wagner College and Columbia University. He dated Patti Smith.

==Career==

Carroll identified Rainer Maria Rilke, Frank O&#x27;Hara, John Ashbery, James Schuyler, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs as influences on his artistic career.

===Writing===
While still in high school, Carroll published his first collection of poems, &quot;Organic Trains.&quot; Already attracting the attention of the local literati, his work began appearing in the Poetry Project&#x27;s magazine &quot;The World&quot; in 1967. Soon his work was being published in elite literary magazines like &quot;Paris Review&quot; in 1968, and &quot;Poetry&quot; the following year. In 1970, his second collection of poems, &quot;4 Ups and 1 Down&quot; was published, and he started working for Andy Warhol. At first, he was writing film dialogue and inventing character names; later on, Carroll worked as the co-manager of Warhol&#x27;s Theater. Carroll&#x27;s first publication by a mainstream publisher (Grossman Publishers), the poetry collection &quot;Living at the Movies&quot;, was published in 1973.

In 1978, Carroll published &quot;The Basketball Diaries,&quot; an autobiographical book concerning his life as a teenager in New York City&#x27;s hard drug culture. &quot;Diaries&quot; is an edited collection of the diaries he kept during his high school years; it details his sexual experiences, his high school basketball career, and his addiction to heroin.

In 1987, Carroll wrote a second memoir, &quot;Forced Entries: The Downtown Diaries 1971–1973,&quot; continuing his autobiography into his early adulthood in the New York City music and art scene as well as his struggle to kick his drug habit.

After working as a musician, Carroll returned to writing full-time in the mid-1980s and began to appear regularly on the spoken-word circuit. Starting in 1991, Carroll performed readings from his then-in-progress first novel, &quot;The Petting Zoo&quot;.

In 1995, Canadian filmmaker John L&#x27;Ecuyer adapted &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Charm&quot;, a short story from Carroll&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Fear of Dreaming&quot;, into the film &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Charm&quot;.

===Music===
In 1978, after he moved to California to get a fresh start since overcoming his heroin addiction, Carroll formed Amsterdam, a new wave/punk rock group, with encouragement from Patti Smith, with whom he once shared an apartment in New York City, along with Robert Mapplethorpe. The musicians were Steve Linsley (bass), Wayne Woods (drums - he had previously been in hard rock band, Estus), Brian Linsley and Terrell Winn (guitars). He performed a spoken word piece with the Patti Smith Group in San Diego when the support band dropped out at the last moment.

They changed their name to The Jim Carroll Band and were able to secure a recording contract with Atlantic Records with the support of the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards. Their 1980 debut album &quot;Catholic Boy&quot;, was originally intended to be released on Rolling Stones Records. The album featured contributions from Allen Lanier and Bobby Keys. Later albums were &quot;Dry Dreams&quot; (1982) and &quot;I Write Your Name&quot; (1983), both with contributions from Lenny Kaye and Paul Sanchez (guitar).

Carroll also collaborated with musicians Lou Reed, Blue Öyster Cult, Boz Scaggs, Ray Manzarek of The Doors, Pearl Jam, Electric Light Orchestra and Rancid. Carroll raps on the Rancid song &quot;Junkie Man&quot;, off 1995&#x27;s album &quot;...And Out Come The Wolves&quot;. The title off the album is derived from the lyric that Carroll wrote and performed while in the studio.

====&quot;People Who Died&quot;====
The Jim Caroll Band released a single, &quot;People Who Died&quot;, from their debut album, which made it to No. 103 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The song&#x27;s title was based on a poem by Ted Berrigan.

&quot;People Who Died&quot; has continued to be used in other media and covered by other musicians. The first known use of &quot;People Who Died&quot; in film or television was in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; opening the first scene with dialogue while the boys play &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. It was also used in the 1985 film &quot;Tuff Turf&quot; (which also featured a cameo appearance by the band) and in the 1995 film &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (based on Carroll&#x27;s autobiography). It was included in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, and 2021&#x27;s &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;. It was featured in the 2015 episode &quot;eps1.9_zer0-day.avi&quot; in Season 1 of &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; and in the end credits of the 2022 episode &quot;Everything Is Bellmore&quot; of Season 4 of &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;.

The song was covered by John Cale for the 1995 film &quot;Antarctica&quot; and issued on Cale&#x27;s &quot;Antártida&quot; soundtrack. The song also was covered by the super group Hollywood Vampires on their album &quot;Rise&quot; with vocals by Johnny Depp.

The song was also covered by UK rock band The Wildhearts for their 2009 ¡Chutzpah! Jnr EP, and in 2019 on a remastered, extended, re-release of their ¡Chutzpah! album. Against Me! released a version in 2018.

==Personal life==
Carroll became sober in the 1970s. After moving to California, he met Rosemary Klemfuss; the couple married in 1978. The marriage ended in divorce, but the two remained friends.

==Death==
Carroll died of a heart attack at his Manhattan home on September 11, 2009, at the age of 60. At the time of his death, he was in ill health due to pneumonia and hepatitis C. He was working at his desk when he died. His funeral Mass was held at Our Lady of Pompeii Catholic Church on Carmine Street in Greenwich Village.

<text>&quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; or &quot;Chinese Rock&quot; is a song written in 1975 by New York punk rock musician Dee Dee Ramone with contributions from Richard Hell. Inspired by Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Heroin&quot;, the song openly details the day-to-day struggles of a heroin addict, and is based on Dee Dee&#x27;s real-life experiences.

Authorship of the track is heavily disputed. Hell made several claims that it is his, though it is generally accepted as mostly Dee Dee&#x27;s work. The song was first recorded by Hell&#x27;s band the Heartbreakers, and later by Dee Dee&#x27;s band the Ramones. The Ramones&#x27; recorded version and the version they initially performed at live shows changed the words &quot;is Dee Dee home?&quot; to &quot;is Arty home?&quot;, although the earlier version was sometimes used after Dee Dee left the Ramones&#x27; lineup. In live performances, the Heartbreakers, but not the Ramones, also sometimes substituted sexual references for some of the mentions of &quot;Chinese rocks&quot;.

==Origin==
Hell and Dee Dee were in agreement that the song was mainly written by Dee Dee. &quot;The reason I wrote that song was out of spite for Richard Hell, because he told me he was going to write a song better than Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Heroin&quot;, so I went home and wrote &#x27;Chinese Rocks&#x27;,&quot; Dee Dee is quoted in &quot;Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk&quot;. &quot;I wrote it by myself, in Debbie Harry&#x27;s apartment on First Avenue and First Street.&quot;

According to Dee Dee, the song was &quot;about Jerry Nolan of the Heartbreakers calling me up to come over and go cop&quot; heroin, a form of which was known in those days as &#x27;Chinese Rocks&#x27;. &quot;The line &#x27;My girlfriend&#x27;s crying in the shower stall&#x27; was about Connie, and the shower was at Arturo Vega&#x27;s loft&quot;, where Dee Dee, his girlfriend Connie and Joey Ramone all lived at one point.

Dee Dee wanted to record the song with the Ramones, but Johnny Ramone vetoed it, considering it too obviously drug-related. Dee Dee then took it to Richard Hell, also with the Heartbreakers at the time. &quot;Dee Dee called me one day and said, &#x27;I wrote a song that the Ramones won&#x27;t do,&#x27;&quot; Hell recalled. &quot;He said, &#x27;It&#x27;s not finished. How about I come over and show it to you and we can finish it if you like it?&#x27;&quot;

According to Hell, &quot;What happened is really clear, and the songwriting credits can all be checked at BMI. The song is by me and Dee Dee, but Dee Dee did 75 percent of it. I mean, all I did was write two verses out of three. Dee Dee wrote the music, the concept was his. He&#x27;s basically responsible for it. But he brought me the song; he didn&#x27;t even know Johnny and Jerry, but we were friends and he thought the band was great. And when the Ramones didn&#x27;t want to do the song he said, &#x27;Look, I&#x27;ve written one verse of this song with the chorus and it&#x27;s about heroin, how about you write the rest of it and it&#x27;s yours?&#x27;&quot; And that&#x27;s what he did.&quot; Dee Dee similarly recalled, &quot;Richard Hell put that line in, so I gave him some credit.&quot;

==The Heartbreakers==
There are differing recollections as to how the song became part of the Heartbreakers&#x27; repertoire. Richard Hell said, &quot;I brought it to the next rehearsal, exactly as it was done by the Heartbreakers for all those years. I would sing it because it was a song I brought in.&quot; Dee Dee, on the other hand, wrote in his memoir, &quot;When Jerry was over at my place one day, we did some dope and then I played him my song, and he took it with him to a Heartbreakers&#x27; rehearsal.&quot;

In either case, the song became one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs. As Hell said, &quot;After I left the Heartbreakers, they kept playing &#x27;Chinese Rocks&#x27; and then ended up recording it&quot; for the band&#x27;s 1977 debut album, &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot;. &quot;And they put all of their names on it, though nothing had changed about the song—they just added their names to it. Johnny Thunders... had nothing to do with &#x27;Chinese Rocks&#x27; at all.&quot;

All vinyl pressings of &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; credit the songwriters as Thunders, Heartbreakers&#x27; drummer Jerry Nolan as well as Ramone and Hell. It was only after the deaths of Thunders and Nolan that the credit was changed. However, both the 1994 and 2002 CD reissues of &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; now name the three &quot;Ramones&quot; as the writers Joey, Johnny Ramone and Dee Dee—but not Hell.

&quot;The credits are false,&quot; Dee Dee wrote in 1997. &quot;Johnny Thunders ranked on me for fourteen years, trying to make out like he wrote the song. What a low-life maneuver by those guys!&quot; The online databases for both ASCAP and BMI, however, credit the song to just Dee Dee Ramone and Hell. In the Heartbreakers&#x27; live performances of the song, Thunders would often change the lyrics to more explicit ones.

==The Ramones==
On the Ramones&#x27; original recording of the song on their 1980 album &quot;End of the Century&quot;, the song is credited to &quot;D.D.Ramone/R.Hell&quot;. It appears on later editions of &quot;End of the Century&quot; (vinyl repressings and CD releases) credited to the Ramones as a whole, with no mention of Hell.

The Ramones&#x27; version is called &quot;Chinese Rock&quot;, with no &quot;s&quot; on the end. There is another slight lyrical difference between the versions: The Heartbreakers&#x27; lyrics begin, &quot;Somebody called me on the phone/They said hey, is Dee Dee home&quot;, while the Ramones change &quot;Dee Dee&quot; to &quot;Arty&quot;, an apparent reference to Arturo Vega, in whose loft the song is set. Vega was a long-time friend of the band and the designer of the Ramones&#x27; &quot;presidential seal&quot; logo. However, after Dee Dee left the band, Joey Ramone sometimes sang &quot;Dee Dee&quot; instead of &quot;Arty&quot; (as on the Ramones&#x27; 1991 live CD &quot;Loco Live&quot;).

Dee Dee Ramone stated in interviews that he felt proud of the song, it being one of his best-known tracks, but that the song became a &quot;pain in the ass&quot; for him as he repeatedly tried to get clean and was mistakenly regarded by many fans as a &quot;heroin guru&quot; promoting drug usage rather than just documenting it.

<text>Muhai Tang (; born 1949 in Shanghai) is a Chinese conductor. He is the youngest son of celebrated Chinese film director Tang Xiaodan and brother of painter and poet Tang Muli.

Tang initially learned music with his parents, and later studied composition and conducting at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, receiving his diploma in both. He furthered his studies in conducting with Hermann Michael at the Hochschule für Musik in Munich, Germany.

His international career started when Herbert von Karajan invited him to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra during the 1983–1984 season. This invitation was later renewed. He was the chief conductor of the Gulbenkian Orchestra in Lisbon from 1988 until 2001. From 1991 to 1995, he was chief conductor of DePhilharmonie (now known as the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra). He made his US debut with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1988.

In 1991 Tang was chief conductor of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra (QSO), the last chief conductor prior to the orchestra&#x27;s renaming as the Queensland Orchestra. In November 2005, he became the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate.

From 2003 to 2006, Tang served as Chief Conductor of the Finnish National Opera. From 2006 to 2011, Tang was artistic director and principal conductor of the Zürcher Kammerorchester (Zurich Chamber Orchestra), and became principal guest conductor in 2011. From 2010 until 2015, he was chief conductor of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra.

As conductor, he was awarded the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition for Christopher Rouse&#x27;s &quot;Concert de Gaudí&quot;.

<doc id="408687" wikidata="Q3013315" url="?curid=408687" title="Dance (Gary Numan album)">
<text>Dance is the third solo studio album by the English new wave musician Gary Numan, released on 4 September 1981 by Beggars Banquet Records. It was the first studio album Numan released after his &quot;Farewell Concerts&quot; staged at Wembley Arena (although Numan would return to performing live shows in 1982).

&quot;Dance&quot; features the single &quot;She&#x27;s Got Claws&quot;, which reached no. 6 on the singles chart in September 1981 during a six-week chart run. The album itself reached no. 3 on the UK charts and remained on the charts for eight weeks, and was certified with a silver disc in the UK for over 60,000 sales.

==Overview==
&quot;Dance&quot; was Numan&#x27;s most experimental album to date with a minimalistic approach featuring sparse electronic sounds and prolific use of drum machines and percussion. With synth-pop music in the mainstream by 1981, Numan made a conscious effort to explore new musical areas. Influenced by Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Lou Reed and Japan, Numan hired Japan&#x27;s bassist Mick Karn to play on the album. &quot;Dance&quot; is described as Numan&#x27;s first true solo album, having previously been supported by an accompanying backing band on his previous albums.

Lyrically the songs were inspired by the imagery of authors William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard and features Numan&#x27;s own personal experiences, particularly a relationship that had turned bitter.

The song &quot;Stories&quot; was performed live by Numan in his &quot;Teletour&quot; of 1980, prior to its recording for &quot;Dance&quot;; a live version of &quot;Stories&quot; can be found in the 2005 expanded edition of Numan&#x27;s live album &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;80&quot;. The songs &quot;She&#x27;s Got Claws&quot; and &quot;Cry, The Clock Said&quot; were premiered on Numan&#x27;s &quot;Farewell Concerts&quot; at Wembley Arena in April 1981 and live versions are included on the live album &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;81&quot; (1998). The song &quot;Moral&quot; is a radical reworking of the track &quot;Metal&quot; on Numan&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;, including a lyrical stab at the contemporary New Romantic movement and featuring an appearance by violinist Nash the Slash. Parts of the new version were performed in the live version of &quot;Metal&quot; on &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;81&quot;. A previously unreleased extended version of the studio track appeared on the 2018 vinyl double LP reissue of &quot;Dance&quot;. &quot;Night Talk&quot;, co-written by Numan and Paul Gardiner, was originally the B-side of &quot;Stormtrooper in Drag&quot;, a collaboration released under the name Paul Gardiner in July 1981. The title track &quot;Dance&quot; was not included on the album and remained unreleased until it appeared as a bonus track on the 1999 CD release of the album.

==Recording==
Numan started working on the album in late 1980. A fan of Japan&#x27;s album &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot;, he hired Japan&#x27;s bassist Mick Karn to play on the album. Numan encouraged Karn to improvise around a basic musical outline. The first song they collaborated on was &quot;She&#x27;s Got Claws&quot;, Karn&#x27;s saxophone riff on the track was a spontaneous improvisation and Numan kept the first take of it. Japan&#x27;s guitarist Rob Dean also played on the album and the Italian voice on &quot;Boys Like Me&quot; is Japan&#x27;s publicist Connie Filapello. Other collaborators on the album include violinist Nash the Slash, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Chris Payne and Cedric Sharpley from Numan&#x27;s live backing band, and keyboardist Roger Mason.

==Critical reception==
Reaction to the album was mixed, some critics applauding what they saw as a less commercial career move and others viewing the change of pace with cynicism. A positive review appeared in &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine which gave the album a 9 out of 10 rating, describing the music as &quot;timeless&quot;. Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Paul Morley argued that the album elevated Numan above many synthesizer contemporaries: &quot;Dance does prove that when judged against his proper peers he can come out well... It&#x27;s a thoughtful response to the new competition: Numan self-controlled and sophisticated. He can filter and exploit past noises as sensibly, even surprisingly, as anyone&quot;, but Morley felt that the music lacked other things: &quot;Dance is Numan&#x27;s neatest, cleanest and most responsible homage to Brian Eno. The elements of Eno&#x27;s meditative adjustments and slippy neology are used well, but &quot;Another Green World&quot;&#x27;s breathtaking personality, intimacy, grace and irony is missing.&quot; Reviewing the album in &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Daniela Soave expressed the belief that Numan on &quot;Dance&quot; appeared as the &quot;Leonard Cohen of synth music&quot;. Paul Colbert in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; also notes the influence of Eno although ultimately describes &quot;Dance&quot; as, &quot;an album by a victim, and he [Numan] suffers at his own hand&quot;.

Retrospectively, on a vinyl double LP reissue of the album, Ned Ragget wrote in a highly positive 2018 review in &quot;The Quietus&quot; that Numan&#x27;s &quot;Dance&quot; is &quot;one of the most interesting albums he ever released&quot;, calling it a &quot;weirdly thrilling&quot; album where &quot;everything had gotten calmer, quieter, more introspective, but no less electronic or textured&quot; [than his previous albums], especially pointing out the ten minute &quot;Cry, The Clock Said&quot; as a highlight, a song that is &quot;capturing deep blue melancholia with precision and skill, a further processing of heartache. With its steady beats almost like a rhythmic patter of raindrops, a guest appearance by Canadian prog figure Nash The Slash on violin adding delicately mournful touches, keyboards softly sparkling then withdrawing, a lead melody played with calm deliberation, Numan&#x27;s clipped lyric delivered with a wounded yearn, it&#x27;s easily one of his most affecting numbers then and now. His spoken-word break can barely be heard, a self-rumination, and if the joke is to say that the robot is finally human, a better take is to say that there aren&#x27;t many songs like it anywhere that capture the shocked emptiness after a decisive break, like the heart steadily beats but there&#x27;s not much to warm it or comfort it&quot;. Raggett also pointed out that &quot;Numan&#x27;s obsessive love of strong rhythms plays out – the soft bursts and beats of electronic pulses, often touched with gentle echo, are nearly always played first and foremost in the mix, and he hangs the song&#x27;s hooks around them with the same catchiness as he had readily demonstrated over nearly everything he&#x27;d already released. It&#x27;s not art-rock, it&#x27;s art-pop, but transformed, extended.&quot;

A few years after &quot;Dance&quot;&#x27;s release Numan conceded, &quot;if I was supposed to be a pop star doing music for the masses, it probably wasn&#x27;t the right thing to do&quot;, but he praised the standard of playing on it.

==Track listing==

* Previous CD releases of &quot;Dance&quot; (Japan in 1990, and the UK in 1993) included &quot;Love Needs No Disguise&quot;, Numan&#x27;s 1981 single with Dramatis, as a bonus track. The track was subsequently replaced by its B-side, &quot;Face to Face&quot;, for the subsequent edition of &quot;Dance&quot;, although &quot;Love Needs No Disguise&quot; would be included on the 1996 Numan compilation, &quot;The Premier Hits&quot;.

On 19 January 2018, Beggars Arkive released &quot;Dance&quot; as a vinyl double-album, with the following track listing:

<text>Ludwika Paleta (; born Maria Ludwika Paleta Paciorek on November 29, 1978) is a Polish-Mexican actress.

== Early life and career ==

Paleta was born in Kraków, Polish People&#x27;s Republic, in 1978. When her father, the musician Zbigniew Paleta, was offered a job in Mexico, the Paleta family settled permanently. As a child, Ludwika was taken by her sister Dominika Paleta, to an acting audition on a whim. Ludwika impressed the casting directors so much that soon after, she was offered her first television role in &quot;Carrusel&quot; (1989). Paleta became an instant celebrity with her character. Three years later, in 1992, she returned to the small screen in what she calls her favorite television job yet, &quot;El abuelo y yo&quot; opposite Gael García Bernal. Roles in &quot;Huracán, Amigas y Rivales,&quot; and &quot;Mujer de Madera&quot; soon followed. Her most recent work in television was in the Endemol-Telefe produced &quot;Los Exitosos Perez.&quot;

Paleta has obtained great fame and popularity in the Latin American country that has been her home since she was merely a child. In an interview, Ludwika Paleta declared that she loves both Mexico and Poland, but that she does not see herself living outside of Mexico in the near-future.

She is fluent in Spanish, Polish and English. In 1998 Paleta married Mexican actor, Plutarco Haza. Their son, Nicolás, was born November 11, 1999. They divorced in 2008. She remarried near Mérida, Yucatán, México on April 20, 2013, with Emiliano Salinas Occelli, son of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari and former Mexican first lady Cecilia Occelli.

She joined actor Aarón Díaz as spokespeople for Calvin Klein in Mexico. In 2012, she starred as Estefania Bouvier de Castañón in &quot;Abismo de pasion&quot; as part of a special participation.

<text>Basketball events at the 1976 Summer Olympics was the ninth appearance of the sport of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. It took place from July 18 to July 27 at the Centre Étienne Desmarteau and the Montreal Forum in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Women&#x27;s basketball was introduced to the Olympic program for the first time at this Games. The United States won the gold against Yugoslavia in the men&#x27;s tournament, while the Soviet Union won the gold medal against the United States in the women&#x27;s competition.

==Medal summary==
==Qualification==
A single NOC may enter up to one men&#x27;s team with 12 players and up to one women&#x27;s team with 12 players. Automatic qualifications were granted to the host country for both events plus the three medal winners from the previous Olympic Games for the men&#x27;s tournament, and the three first places at the 1975 FIBA World Championship for the women&#x27;s tournament. Additional spots for the men&#x27;s tournament were decided via the continental qualification tournaments held by FIBA and an extra qualifying tournament held in Hamilton, Canada months prior to the contest. The remaining slots for the women&#x27;s competition were also assigned via another tournament held in the same city.

===Men===
===Women===

* Egypt withdrew from the Olympic Games after one match, following the boycott of several African countries against New Zealand. All matches involving Egypt were then forfeited.
* Puerto Rico qualified after winning the silver medal at the 1975 Pan American Games, since the gold medal went to the United States, who had already qualified.
* Replaced China.

==Format==
Men&#x27;s tournament:
* Two groups of six teams are formed, where the top two from each group advance to the semifinals.
* Third and fourth places from each group form an additional bracket to decide 5th–8th places in the final ranking.
* Fifth and sixth places from each group form an additional bracket to decide 9th–12th places in the final ranking.

Women&#x27;s tournament:
* One round-robin group is formed containing all six teams, where the final standings are decided.

Tie-breaking criteria:
# Head to head results
# Goal average (not the goal difference) between the tied teams
# Goal average of the tied teams for all teams in its group

==Men&#x27;s tournament==
===Preliminary round===
The first two places in each of the preliminary round groups advanced to the semifinals, where Group A teams would meet Group B teams. The Soviet Union and the United States, two of the powerhouses at this tournament, finished the preliminary round undefeated. The host nation, Canada, also qualified for the semifinals together with Yugoslavia.

Egypt played only one match, against Czechoslovakia, and then flew home supporting the boycott of several African countries. Their remaining matches were forfeited.

====Group A====

<text> (; often ; from an Anglo-Norman term in common law meaning &quot;to speak the truth&quot;) is a legal term for procedures during a trial that help a judge decide certain issues:
* Prospective jurors are questioned to decide whether they can be fair and impartial.
* Witnesses are questioned to decide their competence to testify.
* Witnesses are questioned to decide the admissibility of evidence.

== Etymology ==

From Old French &#x27; &quot;true&quot; (from Latin &#x27; &quot;true,&quot; from PIE root &quot;*were-o-&quot; &quot;true, trustworthy&quot;) and from Old French &#x27; &quot;to say&quot; (from Latin &#x27; &quot;speak, tell, say,&quot; from PIE root &quot;*deik-&quot; &quot;to show,&quot; also &quot;pronounce solemnly&quot;).

It originally referred to an oath taken by jurors to tell the truth (). It comes from the Anglo-Norman language.

==Historic use==
In earlier centuries, a challenge to a particular juror would be tried by other members of the jury panel, and the challenged juror would take an oath of &quot;voir dire&quot;, meaning to tell the truth. This procedure fell into disuse when the function of trying challenges to jurors was transferred to the judge.

== Commonwealth countries, Ireland and Hong Kong ==

In England and Wales, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Canada, it refers to a &quot;trial within a trial&quot;. It is a hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence, or the competency of a witness or juror. As the subject matter of the &quot;voir dire&quot; often relates to evidence, competence or other matters that may lead to bias on behalf of the jury, the jury may be removed from the court for the &quot;voir dire&quot;.

Under Scots law, jury selection is random, and there are a few well-defined exclusions in criminal trials.

In Canada, the case of &quot;Erven v. The Queen&quot; holds that testimony on a &quot;voir dire&quot; cannot influence the trial itself. This remains true even if the judge ruled against the accused in the &quot;voir dire&quot;. The judge is assumed to ignore what they heard during &quot;voir dire&quot;. The jury is never present during a &quot;voir dire&quot;. However, since the evidence given at a &quot;voir dire&quot; may be redundant to evidence at trial, with the consent of the parties a procedure called a &quot;blended &quot;voir dire&quot;&quot; may be used to save time. In this procedure, evidence given in the &quot;voir dire&quot;, if then found admissible, is transferred into the main trial without having to be repeated.

In Australia, the rule about &quot;voir dire&quot; is in section 189 of the &quot;Evidence Act 1995&quot; (Cth): &quot;On a voir dire parties can call witnesses, cross-examine opponent&#x27;s witnesses and make submissions- as they might in the trial proper.&quot; The term has thus been broadened in Australian jurisdictions to include any hearing during a trial where the jury is removed. The High Court of Australia has noted that the &quot;voir dire&quot; is an appropriate forum for the trial judge to reprimand counsel or for counsel to make submissions as to the running of the court to the trial judge.

== United States ==
In the United States, &quot;voir dire&quot; is the process by which prospective jurors are questioned about their backgrounds and potential biases before being chosen to sit on a jury. &quot;Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case.&quot; It also refers to the process by which expert witnesses are questioned about their backgrounds and qualifications before being allowed to present their opinion testimony in court. As noted above, in the United States (especially in practice under the Federal Rules of Evidence) &quot;voir dire&quot; can also refer to examination of the background of a witness to assess their qualification or fitness to give testimony on a given subject. &quot;Voir dire&quot; is often taught to law students in trial advocacy courses.

Colloquially, among attorneys and their staff, the term is used to describe the process of selecting a jury in some jurisdictions. Jury selection differs based on the court and locality where a trial occurs. The process of jury selection and managing &quot;voir dire&quot; is a key area of study for criminal trial attorneys. The Center for Jury Studies, a project of the National Center for State Courts, has studied &quot;voir dire&quot;, as has The American Bar Association, and summaries of research conducted on voir dire are freely available in the OnlineJury Research Update (OJRU).

<text>Mycteroperca bonaci, the black grouper, black rockfish or marbled rockfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a grouper from the subfamily Epinephelinae which is part of the family Serranidae, which also includes the anthias and sea basses. Other fish are sometimes called the black grouper including the similar gag grouper (&quot;Mycteroperca microlepis&quot;), the misty grouper (&quot;Hyporthodus mystacinus&quot;), and the warsaw grouper (&quot;Hyporthodus nigritus&quot;). This species is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from the northeastern United States to Brazil.

==Description==

&quot;Myctoperca bonaci&quot; has an oblong, laterally compressed body with a standard length which is 3.3 to 3.5 times its depth. It has an evenly rounded preopercle with no incisions or lobes at its angle. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 15-17 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 11-13 soft rays, both fins having rounded margins. The caudal fin is truncate to emarginate, althoughit may be convex if spread widely. This species has an overall t&#x27;s an olive grey colour and is marked with dark blotches and brassy hexagonal spots over the head and flanks. The pectoral fins are sooty brown, fading to orange towards the margin; the soft rayed part of the dorsal fin and the anal fin, as well as the forward edge of the pelvic fin have a dark margin. This fish attains a maximum total length of , although they are more common at around and a maximum published weight of .

==Distribution==

&quot;Mycteroperca bonaci&quot; is found in the western Atlantic where its range extends from Cape Canaveral in Florida and Bermuda south to the Bahamas, into the Gulf of Mexico as far north as Alabama and from southern Texas along the coast of Mexico and Cuba. It occurs throughout the Caribbean Sea, along the coast of South America to Santa Catarina in Brazil. Its range extends to the Brazilian islands of Trindade and Fernando de Noronha. There is a gap in its distribution along the northern coast of South America between Paramaribo in Suriname and Maranhão in Brazil. Occurrences in United States waters north to Massachusetts are juveniles and therefore considered vagrants.

==Habitat and biology==
&quot;Mycteroperca bonaci&quot; occurs over rocky bottoms and coral reefs at depths of , however in the eastern Gulf of Mexico it is normally encountered at depths of more than . It is usually a solitary species, the adults feeding mainly on fishes, such as grunts, snapper and herrings, and the juveniles feed on crustaceans. Black groupers have been recorded forming seasonal feeding aggregations along the outer continental shelf off Brazil, these coincide with spawning aggregations of some fish species the groupers prey on. They are monandric protogynous hermaphrodites and form spawning aggregations which have been reported from in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Females attain sexual maturity at around 5years old and at a length of around and the change of sex to males occurs when they are around 15 years old and at a mean length of .

===Predators and parasites===
The recorded predators of &quot;Mycteroperca bonaci&quot; include sandbar shark (&quot;Carcharhinus plumbeus&quot;) and great hammerhead (&quot;Sphyrna mokarran&quot;) while they may also be prey for great barracuda (&quot;Sphyraena barracuda&quot;) and moray eels. Black groupers are hosts to a variety of common parasites which include endoparasites affecting stomach and intestines and ectoparasites which live on its skin.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Mycteroperca bonaci&quot; was first formally described as &quot;Serranus bonaci&quot; in 1860 by the Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey (1799-1891) with Cuba being given as the type locality.

==Utilisation==
&quot;Mycteroperca bonaci&quot; is quite tasty and an important food fish. It is fished for sale and for sport.

==Conservation==
&quot;Mycteroperca bonaci&quot; is an IUCN Red List near threatened species, vulnerable to increases in exploitation because it is a relatively slow breeder.

<doc id="408703" wikidata="Q853859" url="?curid=408703" title="Intercropping">
<text>Intercropping is a multiple cropping practice that involves the cultivation of two or more crops simultaneously on the same field, a form of polyculture. The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources or ecological processes that would otherwise not be utilized by a single crop.

== Methods ==
The degree of spatial and temporal overlap in the two crops can vary somewhat, but both requirements must be met for a cropping system to be an intercrop. Numerous types of intercropping, all of which vary the temporal and spatial mixture to some degree, have been identified. 

=== Mixed intercropping ===

Mixed intercropping consists of multiple crops freely mixed in the available space. In the 21st century, it remains a common practice in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Georgia, and a few other places. Freely mixed intercropping has been practiced for thousands of years. In medieval England, farmers mixed oat and barley, which they called dredge, or dredge corn, to make livestock feed. French peasants similarly ground wheat and rye together to make &quot;pain de méteil&quot;, or bread of mixed grains. Ease of harvesting and buyer preferences led later farmers to plant single-species fields instead.

=== Row crops ===

A row crop is a crop that can be planted in rows wide enough to allow it to be tilled or otherwise cultivated by agricultural machinery, machinery tailored for the seasonal activities of row crops. Such crops are sown by drilling or transplanting rather than broadcasting. They are often grown in market gardening (truck farming) contexts or in kitchen gardens. Growing row crops first started in Ancient China in the 6th century BC.

=== Temporal ===
Temporal intercropping uses the practice of sowing a fast-growing crop with a slow-growing crop, so that the fast-growing crop is harvested before the slow-growing crop starts to mature.

=== Relay ===

Further temporal separation is found in relay cropping, where the second crop is sown during the growth, often near the onset of reproductive development or fruiting, of the first crop, so that the first crop is harvested to make room for the full development of the second.

Crop rotation is a related practice but is not a form of intercropping, as the different crops are grown in separate growing seasons rather than in a single season.

== Potential benefits ==

=== Resource partitioning ===

Careful planning is required, taking into account the soil, climate, crops, and varieties. It is particularly important not to have crops competing with each other for physical space, nutrients, water, or sunlight. Examples of intercropping strategies are planting a deep-rooted crop with a shallow-rooted crop, or planting a tall crop with a shorter crop that requires partial shade. Inga alley cropping has been proposed as an alternative to the ecological destruction of slash-and-burn farming.

When crops are carefully selected, other agronomic benefits are also achieved.

=== Mutualism ===

Planting two crops in close proximity can especially be beneficial when the two plants interact in a way that increases one or both of the plant&#x27;s fitness (and therefore yield). For example, plants that are prone to tip over in wind or heavy rain (lodging-prone plants), may be given structural support by their companion crop. Climbing plants such as black pepper can also benefit from structural support. Some plants are used to suppress weeds or provide nutrients. Delicate or light-sensitive plants may be given shade or protection, or otherwise wasted space can be utilized. An example is the tropical multi-tier system where coconut occupies the upper tier, banana the middle tier, and pineapple, ginger, or leguminous fodder, medicinal or aromatic plants occupy the lowest tier.

Intercropping of compatible plants can also encourage biodiversity, McDaniel et al. 2014 and Lori et al. 2017 finding a legume intercrop to increase soil diversity, or by providing a habitat for a variety of insects and soil organisms that would not be present in a single-crop environment. These organisms may provide crops valuable nutrients, such as through nitrogen fixation.

=== Pest management ===

There are several ways in which increasing crop diversity may help improve pest management. For example, such practices may limit outbreaks of crop pests by increasing predator biodiversity. Additionally, reducing the homogeneity of the crop can potentially increase the barriers against biological dispersal of pest organisms through the crop.

There are several ways pests, typically herbivorous insects, can be controlled through intercropping:

* Trap cropping, this involves planting a crop nearby that is more attractive for pests compared to the production crop, the pests will target this crop and not the production crop.
* Repellant intercrops, an intercrop that has a repellent effect to certain pests can be used. This system involved the repellant crop masking the smell of the production crop in order to keep pests away from it.
* Push-pull cropping, this is a mixture of trap cropping and repellant intercropping. An attractant crop attracts the pest and a repellant crop is also used to repel the pest away.

==== Limitations ====

Intercropping to reduce pest damage in agriculture, has been deployed with varying success. For example, while many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small-scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, only a small portion of these plants have been shown to reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales. Furthermore, increasing crop diversity through intercropping does not necessarily increase the presence of the predators of crop pests. In a systematic review of the literature, in 2008, in the studies examined, predators of pests tended to increase under crop diversification strategies in only 53 percent of studies, and crop diversification only led to increased yield in only 32% of the studies. A common explanation for reported trap cropping failures, is that attractive trap plants only protect nearby plants if the insects do not move back into the main crop. In a review of 100 trap cropping examples in 2006, only 10 trap crops were classified as successful at a commercial scale, and in all successful cases, trap cropping was supplemented with management practices that specifically limited insect dispersal from the trap crop back into the main crop.

<text>Swift Current is the sixth-largest city in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It is situated along the Trans Canada Highway west of Moose Jaw, and east of Medicine Hat, Alberta. As of 2024, Swift Current has an estimated population of 18,430, a growth of 1.32% from the 2016 census population of 16,604. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Swift Current No. 137.

==History==
Swift Current&#x27;s history began with Swift Current Creek which originates at Cypress Hills and traverses of prairie and empties into the South Saskatchewan River at Lake Diefenbaker. The creek was a camp for First Nations for centuries. The name of the creek comes from the Cree, who called the South Saskatchewan River meaning &quot;it flows swiftly&quot;. Fur traders found the creek on their westward treks in the 1800s, and called it &quot;rivière au Courant&quot; (lit: &quot;river of the current&quot;). Henri Julien, an artist travelling with the North-West Mounted Police expedition in 1874, referred to it as &quot;Du Courant&quot;, and Commissioner George French used &quot;Strong Current Creek&quot; in his diary. While it took another decade before being officially recorded, the area has always been known as &quot;Swift Current&quot;.

The settlement of Swift Current was established in 1883, after the CPR surveyed a railway line as far as Swift Current Creek. In 1882, initial grading and track preparation commenced, with the first settlers arriving in the spring of 1883. During the early part of its settlement, the economy was based almost exclusively on serving the new railway buildings and employees. There was also a significant ranching operation known as the &quot;76&quot; ranches. It included 10 ranches raising sheep and cattle and stretched from Swift Current to Calgary. The ranch located at Swift Current dealt with sheep. At one point there were upwards of 20,000 sheep grazing on the present day Kinetic Grounds. The head shepherd was John Oman, originally from Scotland. He donated land to build Oman School in 1913. Other early industries included gathering bison bones for use in fertilizer manufacturing, the making of bone china and sugar refining. Métis residents also ran a successful Red River ox cart &quot;freighting&quot; business along the Swift Current-Battleford Trail to Battleford until the late 1880s. During the Riel Rebellion of 1885, Swift Current became a major military base and troop mustering area due to its proximity to Battleford but this was only for a short time. On February 4, 1904, the hamlet became a village and then a town on March 15, 1907, when a census indicated a population of 550. Swift Current became incorporated as a city on January 15, 1914, with Frank E. West being the mayor at the time.

During World War II, the United Kingdom was considered an unsuitable site for training pilots. The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan identified the Canadian Prairies, with their clear weather and great distance from enemy territory, as an ideal alternative. In 1941, the No. 39 Service Training Flying School was constructed east of Swift Current, hosting over one thousand servicemen at all times until its closure in March 1944. Today, the facility is maintained as the Swift Current Airport, and was taken over by the city of Swift Current from Transport Canada in 1996. Airport services were then contracted out. There have been recent (2005–2006) plans to expand and revitalize the airport alongside the rural municipalities surrounding Swift Current.

Oil was discovered at Fosterton in 1952, 30 miles northwest of the city. This first well continued to pump oil for over 40 years. Since then, with almost 4,000 wells completed in the area, the Shaunavon Formation has yielded 500 million barrels in total production.

Swift Current is affectionately known as &quot;Speedy Creek&quot;, a synonymous play on words. This phrase occurs in the name of many local businesses and organizations. As the primary service centre for most of Southwestern Saskatchewan, its name is also frequently contracted to &quot;Swift&quot; or &quot;Swifty&quot;.

==Landmarks==

Swift Current is home to Saskatchewan&#x27;s oldest operating theatre: the Lyric Theatre, built in 1912 at a cost of $50,000 is the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of Swift Current&#x27;s historical downtown buildings, with instantly recognizable advertisements painted on the north and south sides of the building dating back to the early 1920s. The building has served many functions over the years: at first it housed glamorous vaudeville performances by traveling companies, was later converted into a movie theatre and, in the mid-1980s, a bar and nightclub. A volunteer non-profit group (Southwest Cultural Development Group) purchased the facility in 2005 and is raising money for its preservation while staging cultural events, such as a mock Chautauqua annually in July, since 2008, open mic nights throughout the year, and administering rentals of the building. The current musician in residence is Al Hudec.

Swift Current&#x27;s tallest commercial building is the EI Wood Building, located downtown.

The longest running business in Swift Current is the Imperial Hotel, also known as &quot;The Big Eye&quot; due to the large eye painted on the side. It was built in 1903 and was used as evidence that Swift Current should be granted village status. The owner, R.H. Corbett of Medicine Hat, needed the designation to obtain a liquor licence.

The Swift Current railway station has been designated a historic railway station in 1991. 
 The Court House is also a designated historical building.

Swift Current is located at the start of the historic Swift Current-Battleford Trail, the remnants of which can still be seen today at the Battleford Trail Ruts Heritage Site.

The Blue line, which started in 2017, runs Monday to Friday, from 8:45 am to 3 pm. No service is offered Sundays or holidays. Swift Transit also runs three high school routes, as well as accommodating students from the downtown area on the Red line.

The stop downtown at 41 Chaplin Street E, serves as the main transfer point between the lines, with the Red line servicing it twice on its route; and a second transfer point at the Swift Current Mall.

Swift Current purchased three new Arboc buses which arrived in 2021, enhancing both regular and Access Transit services.

==Government==

Swift Current has had its own Saskatchewan Legislature district since 1908. The current incarnation of Swift Current (provincial electoral district) is nearly coterminous with Swift Current&#x27;s city limits, excluding only an industrial park on the western side of the Trans-Canada Highway. In the House of Commons, Swift Current is part of Cypress Hills—Grasslands, whose boundaries extend to Caronport and Kindersley. Following the 2021 federal election the riding is represented by Jeremy Patzer, MP and from 2018 provincially by Everett Hindley, MLA.

At both higher levels of government, Swift Current is predominantly conservative. The city was the home constituency of the first Saskatchewan Party premier, Brad Wall, who won more than 80% of the popular vote on two occasions. Federally, its last non-conservative MP was Irvin Studer, a Liberal who represented Swift Current—Maple Creek from 1953 to 1958.

The city&#x27;s current mayor is Al Bridal, who defeated incumbent Denis Perrault in the 2020 Saskatchewan municipal elections. On the same ballot, two of five incumbent councillors held their seats. After 40 centimetres of snow fell on election day, voting in the city was postponed by two days.

<text>The Liberal Party ( or LS) was a Croatian social-liberal political party active between January 1998 and April 2006. During its existence the party ran in two general elections (in 2000 and 2003) and in each election won two seats in the 151-seat Sabor. LS was a member of Liberal International and the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party. Its last leader was Zlatko Benašić.

The party was formed in January 1998 following a party split in November 1997 when a faction led by Vlado Gotovac, then chairman of Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), left the party because of internal power struggles which resulted in former chairman Dražen Budiša taking back control of the party. Gotovac was joined by other prominent liberals such as Osijek mayor Zlatko Kramarić and historian Ivo Banac.

In 2000, the party had two representatives in the Parliament and had one minister in a coalition government with the much larger Social Democratic Party of Croatia. In 2002 another HSLS faction split from the party after party leader Dražen Budiša announced pulling out of the ruling coalition. They called themselves LIBRA, and their members participated in the Cabinet of Ivica Račan II.

LS confirmed their two representatives in the Parliament in the 2003 elections, in an alliance with the social democrats, but became part of the opposition.

After the 2003 election, party leader Ivo Banac announced the merger of LS with the Croatian People&#x27;s Party and LIBRA into one big liberal party, but this initiative was opposed by a faction led by Zlatko Kramarić. Banac was replaced at the party convention.

After the 2005 local elections Zlatko Kramarić started merger negotiations with the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS). That prompted a group of dissidents in Split to form a new party called Dalmatian Liberal Party.

Liberal Party formally ceased to exist with all of its membership and party infrastructure re-joining HSLS in April 2006. In the meantime, LIBRA (Party of Liberal Democrats) merged with Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS) in February 2005.

<doc id="408706" wikidata="Q1138772" url="?curid=408706" title="Rialto Towers">
<text>Rialto (often The Rialto, or Rialto Towers) is a skyscraper located at 525 Collins Street, in the western side of the Melbourne central business district, Victoria, Australia. It was the tallest office building in the Southern Hemisphere when it was constructed.

The Rialto featured Melbourne&#x27;s first skyscraper public observation deck, which operated between 1994 and 31 December 2009. It was also the location of Melbourne&#x27;s first Tower running event.

==Background==
The site of the whole Rialto development ran between Flinders Lane and Collins Street, and was occupied by several buildings including numerous small warehouses on Flinders Lane, with lanes between including and Winfield Square and Robbs Lane. On the corner of Collins and King Street stood Robb&#x27;s Buildings, named for the owner, railway builder John Robb, a grand classical styled 5-storey Victorian office building designed by Thomas Watts and Sons in 1885, and one of the largest in the city at the time. Next to that along Collins Street stood two interwar buildings, then the Rialto Building (1891) designed by William Pitt and the Winfield Building (1890) designed by Charles Debro &amp; Richard Speight, both part of the five building Rialto building group, an historic streetscape along Collins Street running up to the 1880s Olderfleet Building to the east.

Through the late 1960s and early 1970s, National Mutual Life Association of Australasia purchased the various historic buildings on the site, but had to rethink plans when the Rialto and Winfield buildings were listed by the new Historic Buildings Preservation Council in 1974, and the National Trust of Victoria opposed the demolition of other buildings on the site.

Little progress was made until 1980 when the site was acquired by Grollo Australia in a joint venture with St Martin&#x27;s Properties. Grocon successfully argued that Robb&#x27;s Building stood in the way of its major three-tower proposal, which they modified to a two-tower proposal, but still demolished the Robbs building. A hotel was created utilising the whole of the long rear wing of the Rialto Building, the replacement of the rear wing of the Winfield Building, and the creation of an atrium between.

==Construction==
The final development plan involved several separate projects proceeding concurrently: the 242m office tower; a five-level underground car park; the restoration of the historic Rialto and Winfield building to create an international hotel; and a theatrette. Ancillary works included the Collins Street Plaza, restoration of the York Butter Factory and Robbs Annexe, and new shops.

Designed by architects Gerard de Preu and Partners in association with Perrott Lyon Mathieson, the building was built between 1982 and 1986, opening in October 1986. The massive glass curtain wall façade of reinforced blue tinted mirrored glass is its central feature and changes colour during the day, ranging from a trademark dark blue to a brilliant gold during sunset. 

Consultants for the design were Dino Burranti, Richard Falkinger (restoration of Rialto and Winfield buildings), Meldrum Burrows and Partners (York Butter Factory) and Davenport Campbell and Partners (hotel interior). Lincolne Scott Australia provided the mechanical, electrical, and fire services as well as the elevators. The hydraulic engineers were C. R. Knight and Associates. 

Project planning was undertaken by Project Planning and Management Pty Ltd and the quantity surveying/cost consultants were Rider Hunt and Partners. The structural engineers for the project were W. K. Meinhardt and Partners (for Tower) and Bonnaci Winward (for Hotel). 

It is high, with 55 floors and 3 basement floors. It comprises two conjoined towers, the shorter North Tower being high with 43 floors. In total, there are of office space. Early tenants moved into the lower floors while the upper floors were still under construction in 1984.

==Rialto Run-up==
Inspired by the popular Empire State Building Run-Up, a stair race up the , 1222–1254 step race to the 53rd floor of the Rialto building was first run in the late 1980s and became an annual event with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions known as the Rialto Run-up. Previous winners include Robin Rishworth (1989, 1990); Geoff Case (1991). The winner was awarded with a trip to New York City to compete in the Empire State Building race. The event was run until 2005 and competitors had to go up 1254 steps.

==Observation Deck==

The Melbourne Observation Deck opened to the public on 19 July 1994 and was located on the 55th floor of the South Tower, at . Views of up to can be had on a clear day. The floor is serviced by two passenger lifts. On 31 December 2009, the observation deck closed. In 2010, the fine dining restaurant, Vue de Monde, and associated cocktail bar, Lui Bar, opened for trade on Level 55.


== New podium ==
In 2015–17, the partly roofed, partly open forecourt-podium was replaced with a 5 level perimeter building containing offices, with retail at ground level, and an internal glass-roofed area between it, the towers, and the side wall of the original Victorian era Rialto building. This addition was designed by Woods Bagot architects.

==Statistics==

Rialto consists of two interconnected towers, North and South, with rooftop floors at Level 41 and Level 58 respectively. There are 36 passenger lifts, of lift cables, 706 lift door openings and 1,450 staircase steps. The outer surface of the building has 13,000 windows. There are five basement levels of car park available for occupiers and casual users. When completed in 1986, The Rialto surpassed Sydney&#x27;s MLC Centre to become Australia&#x27;s tallest building at . It was the tallest for five years until being surpassed by 101 Collins Street in 1991. It is currently the tenth tallest building in Australia.

<doc id="408709" wikidata="Q6767774" url="?curid=408709" title="Mark Goodson">
<text>Mark Leo Goodson (January 14, 1915 – December 18, 1992) was an American television producer who specialized in game shows, most frequently with his business partner Bill Todman, with whom he created Goodson-Todman Productions.

==Early life and early career==
Goodson was born in Sacramento, California, on January 14, 1915. His parents, Abraham Ellis (1875–1954) and Fannie Goodson (1887–1986), emigrated from Russia in the early 1900s. As a child, Goodson acted in amateur theater with the Plaza Stock Company. The family later moved to Hayward, California. Originally intending to become a lawyer, Goodson attended the University of California, Berkeley. He financed his education through scholarships and by working at the Lincoln Fish Market. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1937 with a degree in economics.

That year, he began his broadcasting career in San Francisco, working as a disc jockey at radio station KJBS (now KFAX). In 1939, he joined radio station KFRC, where he produced and hosted a radio quiz called &quot;Pop the Question&quot; in which contestants selected questions by throwing darts at multicolored balloons.

==Television production==
Goodson and long-time partner Bill Todman produced some of the longest-running game shows in American television history, and their names were well known at least to the large audiences for these shows. Their first television show, &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, debuted on CBS television on July 1, 1948. The long list of Goodson-Todman productions includes &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; (Goodson&#x27;s personal favorite show), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, and &quot;Tattletales&quot;. Goodson-Todman Productions/Mark Goodson Productions created content for American channels and other international channels. (including Talbot Television Ltd. and Fremantle UK Productions Ltd.). such as CBS, NBC, and ABC in the US, BBC1, ITV (Anglia, Central, Granada, LWT, TVS, Scottish Television, and Yorkshire Television), Channel 4, and Sky One, (also Challenge TV). It licensed many of its shows to the Reg Grundy Organisation to be adapted in Australia and Europe.

Goodson and Todman&#x27;s shows endured through the decades, many over multiple runs, because of Goodson&#x27;s sharp eye for production and presentation, and their strict insistence on maintaining clean, honest contests, thus allowing their shows to survive the quiz-show scandals of the late 1950s. After those scandals wiped out most of their competition, much of the newer game-show output of the 1960s and 1970s came from either Goodson-Todman or companies launched by their former employees: Merv Griffin, Bob Stewart, Monty Hall, and later Jay Wolpert. Goodson-Todman was involved with Jack Barry&#x27;s comeback vehicle &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; for its 1969 pilot, but ended involvement with the show before it debuted in 1972.

While Todman oversaw the company&#x27;s lucrative businesses outside of television, Goodson handled the creative aspects of producing game shows. The people who worked for the company and created most of the Goodson-Todman shows were pivotal to the success of those shows. Goodson-Todman executives Bob Stewart, Bob Bach, Gil Fates, Ira Skutch, Frank Wayne, Chester Feldman, Paul Alter, Howard Felsher, Ted Cooper, Mimi O&#x27;Brien, Jay Wolpert, and others were instrumental in making the shows successful.

The company proved itself to be masterful at games, but was not as successful when it tried other fields of television programs, including the anthology dramas &quot;The Web&quot; and &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;, a talk-variety show for famed insult comic Don Rickles – and what was possibly the company&#x27;s biggest failure, a sitcom titled &quot;One Happy Family&quot;. Goodson-Todman Productions was also involved with three Westerns: &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot; (1958–59), starring Jeff Richards as a newspaper editor in the Old West; &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1959–1961), starring Nick Adams as a former Confederate soldier who traveled to the West after the American Civil War (Johnny Cash sang the theme); and &quot;Branded&quot;, starring Chuck Connors as a soldier who had wrongly been given a dishonorable discharge from the Army.

For many years, the company was headquartered in the Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue in New York City. Most of the company&#x27;s production moved to Hollywood in the early 1970s (as did many other production companies), starting with the ABC revival of &quot;Password&quot; in 1971. The Los Angeles offices were based at 6430 Sunset Boulevard, moving to 5750 Wilshire Boulevard. The company&#x27;s last New York-based show was the 1980 version of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, but the New York office remained open and was used for East Coast &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; auditions.

A few years after Bill Todman&#x27;s death in 1979, Goodson acquired the Todman heirs&#x27; share of the company, and in 1982, the company was renamed Mark Goodson Productions. Traditionally, shows signed off with: &quot;This is (announcer&#x27;s name) speaking for (show name), A Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Production/A Mark Goodson Television Production.&quot; After Goodson&#x27;s death, to pay off a massive inheritance tax, Goodson&#x27;s family sold the rights (except for &quot;Concentration/Classic Concentration&quot;, which had been licensed from NBC) to All-American Television, which was subsequently taken over by Pearson PLC (an educational publisher and communications company based in the United Kingdom), and, in turn, was acquired by RTL Group (a division of Bertelsmann), to form Fremantle, which now owns the rights to the library from Mark Goodson Productions. The Mark Goodson Productions name, logo, and announcement continued to be used for some shows until 2007, when Bob Barker&#x27;s last show of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; aired. Afterward, at the close of each episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, the announcer credits the show as &quot;a FremantleMedia Production&quot; until 2018; it is now credited simply as &quot;a Fremantle Production&quot;, reflecting the name change of the company.

Copyrights to many of the Goodson-Todman&#x27;s game shows were assigned to its specially formed companies, named in &quot;The (program name) Company&quot; scheme, such as &quot;The Family Company&quot;, &quot;The Password Company&quot; etc. They are currently in-name-only units of Fremantle North America.

In 1990, Goodson received the Emmy Award &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award for Daytime Television&quot;, which was presented to him by Betty White. Two years later, in 1992, Goodson earned induction into the Television Hall of Fame.

===Foreign versions===
Many Goodson-Todman games were produced internationally, some under different titles, and were distributed by Reg Grundy Productions. &quot;Family Feud&quot; was known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;, and &quot;Card Sharks&quot; went under the title &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;. In Germany, &quot;Match Game&quot; was known as &quot;Schnickschnack&quot; (loosely translated, &quot;something, anything&quot; and used as a counterpart for the word &quot;blank&quot;, for which German has no direct word). In the United Kingdom, it was known as &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, while in Australia, it was known as &quot;Blankety Blanks&quot; (which, coincidentally, was the title of an unrelated American game show, created by former Goodson-Todman staffer Bob Stewart).

==Shows==
Of the numerous shows Goodson produced in his lifetime, three are currently on the air: &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which has run continuously since 1972; &quot;Family Feud&quot;, which ran in two different iterations during 1976–1985 and 1988–1995, and was revived in its current form in 1999; and &quot;Password&quot;, which was revived in 2022 after a lengthy stint off the air. All revivals since 1994 have been produced by successor companies (All-American Television from 1994 to 1998, Pearson Television from 1998 to 2002, FremantleMedia from 2002 to 2018, and Fremantle since 2018).

==Personal life and death==
In 1941, Goodson married Bluma Neveleff and moved to New York City, where he teamed up with partner Bill Todman. Todman died from a heart condition on July 29, 1979, two days before his 63rd birthday. In 1982, the Goodsons acquired the Todman heirs&#x27; portion of the company.

Goodson and Neveleff had two children, Jill (1942) and Jonathan (1945). They divorced and he married Virginia McDavid, a former Miss Alabama. In 1962, Goodson and McDavid had a daughter, Marjorie, who was a prize model on &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; from July 1987 until its finale in September 1991. In 1972, he married Suzanne Waddell, who had once been a guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; They divorced in 1978.

Goodson died of pancreatic cancer on December 18, 1992, in New York City at the age of 77. He is interred at Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City, California, along with his parents Fannie Goodson and A.E. Goodson. After his death, Bob Barker gave him a small tribute that aired after an episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, as an attached segment that followed the end credits:

Following was a portrait of Goodson and a message saying, &quot;Mark Goodson 1915–1992&quot;.

==Legacy==
Reruns of Goodson&#x27;s shows have continued to dominate both the schedules of Game Show Network and Buzzr because his company saved most of the episodes of the shows, while other companies wiped theirs to reuse the tapes. The practice of wiping was stopped by the start of the 1980s.

===Biography===
On June 3, 2000, an episode of &quot;Biography&quot; called &quot;Mark Goodson: Will the Real Mark Goodson Please Stand Up?&quot; aired on A&amp;E, where it profiled his life and career. This features many interviews of the hosts, panelists, and co-workers such as Betty White, Bob Barker, Gene Rayburn, Kitty Carlisle, Marjorie Goodson, and Suzanne Goodson.

===2009 Game Show Awards===
On June 6, 2009, an awards special that aired on GSN called &quot;2009 Game Show Awards&quot; featured a brief tribute to Goodson as his daughter Marjorie held the Innovator Award herself.

===&quot;Game Show Marathon&quot;===

The series was based on the British format called &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s/Vernon Kay&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot; and ran on CBS from May 31 until June 29, 2006, hosted by former actress/talk show host Ricki Lake, announced by Rich Fields (who formerly announced for &quot;The Price is Right&quot; from 2004 until 2010), and Todd Newton as the prize deliverer in which six celebrities (Lance Bass, Paige Davis, Tim Meadows, Kathy Najimy, Leslie Nielsen, and Brande Roderick) played seven classic game shows for their favorite charities and the home viewer featured five formats based on Goodson-Todman/Goodson shows along with the recreation of their original sets such as &quot;The Price is Right (1972 version)&quot;, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

===Buzzr (YouTube)===
From 2014 until 2016, the Buzzr brand was first used by its parent company FremantleMedia (now Fremantle) for its YouTube channel created by its digital-content studio Tiny Riot. The online channel features mostly classic clips along with its short-form reboots of its classic game-show properties using various internet celebrities as contestants. Four of the Goodson-Todman/Goodson shows that were rebooted are &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, and &quot;Body Language&quot;.

<text>The Istrian Democratic Assembly (, or IDS-DDI) is a centre to centre-left, regionalist, liberal political party in Croatia primarily operating in Istria County.

IDS was founded on the 14 February 1990 by the writer Ivan Pauletta. IDS embraces principles of respect for human rights and freedoms, regionalism and historical characteristics of Istria, protection of private property and anti-fascism. Party advocates decentralization of Croatia, further development of the Adriatic Euroregion and the establishment of a transnational and cross-border euro-region encompassing the whole of Istria. The party president is currently Dalibor Paus, municipal mayor of Barban. IDS held the Ministry of European Integration between 2000 and 2001 in the Cabinet of Ivica Račan and Ministry of Tourism between 2011 and 2015 in the Cabinet of Zoran Milanović. IDS member Boris Miletić serves as current County Prefect of the Istrian County, while former prefect Valter Flego serves as a member of the European Parliament. All prefects of Istria County were members of IDS. In addition, out of 10 towns in Istria county, IDS rules over 5.

IDS is member of the Liberal International and Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.

==Symbols==

The three rams on the party coat of arms represent a historical symbol of the region, which is also represented by the ram in the fourth of the five parts of the crown resting atop the Croatian coat of arms, 25-field white and red chequerboard, on the Croatian flag.

==History==
The party was founded in 1990 by Ivan Pauletta, Elio Martinčić and Mario Sandrić, on the eve of the first multi-party elections in Croatia after communism. The party decided not to participate, thus allowing the post-communist Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) to sweep the region&#x27;s votes.

The party was led by Ivan Jakovčić between 1991 and 2014. IDS instead made its electoral debut in the 1992 elections and used the collapse of the SDP to take all three Istrian constituencies.

This result turned Istria into an area of significant concern for Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which had dominated every other region in Croatia. For the first elections for Croatian Chamber of Counties, which also coincided with the first election for newly formed Istria County, state-controlled media launched an unprecedented media blitz directed almost exclusively at Istria. This effort spectacularly backfired as Istrian voters gave almost three quarters of their votes to IDS. After that no party challenged IDS supremacy in Istria, at least not directly.

The main policy of the IDS is intercession of cultural and economical identity of Istria and equal status for Italian and Croatian in Istria. This was in opposition to Tuđman and his hard-line nationalism. Other Croatian political parties were more pragmatic, and IDS cooperated with them in the Croatian Parliament and during elections. In Istria, however, IDS is bitterly opposed by local branches of SDP, as well as their former member and first Istrian prefect Luciano Delbianco who had defected and formed a new party called Istrian Democratic Forum.

IDS was briefly part of the national government following 2000 parliamentary and presidential elections. One year later, IDS, dissatisfied with the way Ivica Račan and his coalition partners treated Istria, left the government, although they continued to support it in Parliament.

In 2006, IDS joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Party.

From 2010–2015, IDS was a member of the Kukuriku coalition. Its member Darko Lorencin served as the minister of tourism in the Croatian government; he is a cousin of Beatrice Lorenzin: they are of a same Italian-Croat family.

In the Croatian Parliament, Damir Kajin most frequently acted as the party&#x27;s spokesperson, and he headed the party list in the 2007 elections where the party gained 3 representatives. Kajin was however removed from the party&#x27;s membership on 3 January 2013 after forming his own coalition for the 2013 local elections in Istria. This reduced the IDS from three to two representatives in the Croatian Sabor, and forced the party&#x27;s parliamentary club to dissolve due to insufficient membership.

On February 4, 2022, the party&#x27;s presidency launched disciplinary proceedings against former President Boris Miletić, leading Miletić to leave party a day later and leaving the IDS without an Istrian county prefect for the first time since the counties was introduced in 1993.

<text>The Croatian Party of Pensioners ( or HSU) is a Croatian centre-left political party that is currently led by Veselko Gabričević.

When the party was founded, few people took it seriously and many commentators speculated that the ultimate purpose of HSU was to take away pensioners&#x27; votes from rejuvenated SDP and thus help ruling HDZ remain in power. However, the party gradually built its organisation throughout the country and slowly rose in popularity due to both HDZ and left-centre cabinets of Ivica Račan refusing to honour a Constitutional Court verdict that ordered the government to pay back pensions that had been denied in the early 1990s.

HSU gained much notoriety after local and regional elections in May 2005 when many of its members got elected on left-centre election tickets only to support HDZ and right-wing parties during the forming of coalition governments.

At the 2007 Croatian parliamentary election, the party won 101,091 votes and 4.1% of the votes, but this time the electoral math (D&#x27;Hondt method) allowed them to receive only a single representative in the Parliament, Silvano Hrelja. They continued to support the government of Ivo Sanader, which in turn continued to pursue pensioner-related policies aligned with the opinion of the HSU.

In 2009, the economic crisis caused the government of Jadranka Kosor to start talks about extra crisis taxation and after a row with the finance minister Ivan Šuker, the HSU withdrew their support for the government.

The party participated in the Kukuriku coalition since 2011. It continued with the coalition Croatia is Growing at the 2015 Croatian parliamentary election. In that election, it became possible for the candidates of HSU to receive preferential votes, and they won a total of 11,026 (out of a coalition total of 744,507).

<text>The Croatian Peasant Party (, HSS) is an agrarian political party in Croatia founded on 22 December 1904 by Antun and Stjepan Radić as Croatian Peoples&#x27; Peasant Party (HPSS). The Brothers Radić believed that the realization of Croatian statehood was possible within Austria-Hungary, but that it had to be reformed as a Monarchy divided into three equal parts – Austria, Hungary and Croatia. After the creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918, the Party requested for the Croatian part of the Kingdom to be based on self-determination. This brought them great public support which culminated in 1920 parliamentary election when HPSS won all 58 seats assigned to Croatia.

In 1920, disgruntled with a bad position of Croats in the Kingdom, the party changed its name into Croatian Republican Peasant Party (HRSS) and started advocating secession from the Kingdom and the establishment of &quot;peaceful peasant Republic of Croatia&quot;. On 1923 and 1925 election, HRSS doubled the number of won votes, and has thus become the second largest party in the Parliament.

In 1927, faced with a constant prosecution by the regime, HRSS was forced to soften its policy and change ts name into the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), recognize the Vidovdan Constitution and form a coalition with Serbian People&#x27;s Radical Party. This resulted in HSS losing its popularity which was seen in 1927 election when it lost almost third of votes won in the previous elections. After the termination of the coalition agreement with the Radicals, HSS formed Peasant-Democratic Coalition with Pribičević&#x27;s Independent Democratic Party. In 1928, Vladko Maček become the new president of HSS after the assassination of Stjepan Radić.

After King Alexander declared dictatorship in 1929, HSS was banned and its members prosecuted. HSS participated in the 1935 and 1938 election as a part of the United opposition coalition which helped it to regain its influence. In 1939, Cvetković–Maček Agreement helped in the establishing of the HSS-governed Banovina of Croatia. After the establishment of Nazi-puppet state, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in 1941, HSS was banned once again, with half of its members joining either Ustaše or Partisans, and part staying loyal to Maček who believed that the victory of Allies would bring liberal democracy into Croatia and that HSS would return to power. In May 1945, Maček left the country, while HSS split into two fractions which boycotted the 1945 election because of their opposition to the Communists. During the period of SFR Yugoslavia (1945–1991), HSS was active abroad.

On 25 May 1991, HSS was restored under the leadership of Drago Stipac at the so-called &quot;Assembly of Unification&quot;. The party first entered Government after 2000 elections, on which it participated as part of liberal coalition (HSS-IDS-HNS-LS-SDA), with Ivica Račan (SDP) serving as Prime Minister and its president Zlatko Tomčić as Parliament Speaker. After HSS lost 2003 election, it moved to the opposition. In 2007 election, HSS formed yet another liberal coalition (HSLS-PGS-ZDS-ZS) and eventually ended up leading Ministries of Tourism and Agriculture in the Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II, and Ministries of Tourism and Regional Development in the Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor. In 2011 election, the party won only one seat in the Parliament as has moved to the opposition. In 2015 election HSS won one seat as part of the conservative Patriotic Coalition, and supported Tihomir Orešković as Prime Minister. In 2016 election, HSS won 5 seats as part of the liberal People&#x27;s Coalition.

== History ==
===Radić presidency===

The Croatian People&#x27;s Peasant Party (&quot;Hrvatska pučka seljačka stranka&quot;, HPSS) was established in 1904 by brothers Stjepan Radić and Antun Radić in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia – itself a part of the Hungarian part of the dualist Austria-Hungary at the time. The founding of the HPSS was a part of the process of fragmentation of the . The party pursued the establishment of a comprehensive grassroots network, national unity and agrarianism, as the Radić&#x27;s distrusted traditional political parties. Even though the HPSS achieved only minor significance before the end of World War I, the party gradually became a mass movement after 1918. This gave it the central role in the completion of Croatian national integration. The HPSS platform of antimilitarism and pacifism became very popular in the final year of the war, especially in Croatia-Slavonia, which was affected by widespread unrest associated with the Green Cadres. Furthermore, the restricted voting rights were expanded after 1918 by the introduction of universal manhood suffrage, allowing the proportionally large peasant population (80% of Croatia-Slavonia at the time) to predominantly vote for the HPSS. Antun Radić died in 1919, leaving Stjepan as the sole leader of the HPSS.

After the war, following the 1920 Croatian Peasant Rebellion, the HPSS became the only significant political party in Croatia, and the second largest party in the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). In 1920s, the HPSS policy was based on republicanism, opposition to further unification of the new state, demands for a neutral Croat peasant republic, and the advocation of national self-determination. To reinforce the republican message, the HPSS was formally renamed the Croatian Republican Peasant Party in 1920. Shortly following its accession to the Peasant International, the regime initiated a campaign to suppress the party activities in the run up to the 1925 Yugoslav parliamentary election using political, police, military and paramilitary pressure, and arresting its leaders. Even though the party achieved the second-largest share of seats, the government retained its parliamentary majority. Nonetheless, shortly after the election, there were negotiations between Radić and King Alexander&#x27;s envoys. The talks ended in Radić renouncing republicanism and accepting the monarchy in return for his release and participation in a coalition government led by the People&#x27;s Radical Party (NRS). The party was renamed the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). Radić later admitted that he accepted the monarchy to protect his people.
The HSS had little real influence in the coalition government which lasted until 1927. At the same time, the Radić&#x27;s participation in the coalition was criticised in Croatia and in the HSS – although not sufficiently to threaten his leadership. A part of the membership split in protest, forming the Croatian Federalist Peasant Party. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia (&quot;Komunistička partija Jugoslavije&quot;, KPJ) also criticised Radić for his cooperation with the regime. The KPJ had recently adopted the federalist approach to reform of the country and saw the republican movement of the HRSS as a potential recruitment pool. The HSS conversely, regardless of KPJ&#x27;s formal federalist policy, saw the KPJ as unitarists and essentially a political endeavour to promote Serbian agenda.

The HSS left the government in January 1927. Radić resumed pursuit of resolution of the Croatian question by advocating unification of Croatian lands including Slavonia and Dalmatia into a single self-governing unit and stopping Italian immigration by abolishing the 1925 Treaty of Nettuno. In November, the HSS formed the Peasant-Democratic Coalition with the Independent Democratic Party (&quot;Samostalna demokratska stranka&quot;, SDS), the most popular party among the Serbs of Croatia. Tense relations between the opposition and the government deteriorated further until a shouting match in the parliament escalated to the point where NRS deputy Puniša Račić shot several HSS parliament members killing two and wounding three including Radić on 20 June 1928. Radić suggested that the shootings were a result of a regime plan and that the HSS should abandon pacifism. Soon afterwards, Radić died of the wounds on 8 August. Following the assassinations, the Yugoslav state lost any legitimacy among Croats – who appeared united in demands for overhaul of the state. HSS thus became the only major political party among Croats. Vladko Maček was elected to replace Radić almost immediately after his death.

===Maček presidency===

Under Maček, the HSS continued political opposition to the regime. The which included the HSS, stood in 1935 and 1938 Yugoslavian parliamentary election. In the latter, the United Opposition won the majority of votes, but due to operation of the election law, it received 67 out of 373 seats in the parliament.

Prompted by the failure of the government to secure the rule of law and public order, the HSS established the (HSZ) as a party paramilitary force in 1936. The force was established to protect Croats against paramilitaries supported or tolerated by the regime. The force was also designed as a response to Ustaše challenge for dominance among Croats as a force capable of providing physical protection following the Velebit uprising. It was meant to demonstrate that the HSS is not a pacifist organisation resigned to passivity. In cities, the HSZ operated under the name of Croatian Civil Defence.

In 1936 and 1937, Maček unsuccessfully negotiated with Regent Prince Paul Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović with the aim of consolidation of Croatian lands within Yugoslavia – with a degree of autonomy. Then, after contacting several European governments and failing to get their support, he turned to Italian foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano in 1938. Through an intermediary, Maček explained the HSS wanted Croatia united as a federal unit of Yugoslavia encompassing territories of former Croatia–Slavonia to a line between Ilok and Sremska Mitrovica, and Dalmatia without the Bay of Kotor with the addition of Bosnia and Herzegovina west of Vrbas and Neretva Rivers. At the time, Italy was harbouring and supporting Croatian nationalist group Ustaše, but Ciano preferred to work with Maček because the HSS enjoyed far greater support among Croats and because Ciano believed that would discourage contacts between the HSS and Nazi Germany – denying German access to the Adriatic Sea. Ciano wrote back to Maček urging him to demand more territory and elaborate on his ideas.

In 1939, Stojadinović was replaced by Dragiša Cvetković and Maček contacted him with the same request. The two reached a preliminary agreement, but Prince Paul vetoed the idea objecting to partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Maček then wrote back to Ciano explaining that he seeks status of a federal unit for Croatia within Yugoslavia, with joint foreign affairs, defence, central bank, state monopolies, and customs. He modified the territorial demands by moving the Vrbas line to the Bosna River. In return, the Italian Foreign Ministry drafted a document offering Maček a loan to finance an uprising which the HSS would launch and then invite Italian military intervention. The plan also envisaged establishment of a Croatian state under Italian protection. Maček wrote back declining the offer and saying that was not what he asked for and that he had struck a deal with Cvetković government in the meantime.

The Cvetković–Maček Agreement was concluded on 26 August 1939 establishing autonomous Banovina of Croatia. Maček became the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia and several members of the Peasant–Democratic Coalition were added to the cabinet. The agreement angered Ustaše who launched a propaganda campaign against Maček and the HSS as traitors of Croatian interests while Italy switched its support back to Ustaše.

=== World War II and afterwards ===

The party&#x27;s fortunes declined precipitously with the outbreak of World War II and the Axis invasion in April 1941. Some party members were divided among those who sympathized with the Croatian fascist Ustasha independence movement, and those whose left-leaning beliefs led them to join the Partisans. But the vast majority of HSS supporters remained passive and neutral for the duration of the war as the Ustasha, the communist Partisans and the royalist Chetniks fought for control.

After the communist victory, the KPJ established one-party rule — the HSS, along with other political parties were declared illegal. In 1947, HSS joined the International Peasants&#x27; Union. Maček represented the HSS in exile until his death in 1964. Juraj Krnjević took over as leader until his own death 1988, only a year before the HSS could resume its work within Croatia.

=== Modern party ===

With the advent of multi-party system in 1990, the HSS was reconstituted by Ivan Zvonimir Čičak and on the 1990 election won several seats in the Croatian Parliament. They remained in opposition until the 2000 elections when they received three ministerial portfolios as part of their participation in the winning Social Democratic Party of Croatia-led coalition.

On elections 2000 HSS led center coalition alongside IDS-HNS-LS and Coalition won 25 seats in parliament with 17 seats for HSS (16 domestic and one minority seat).
After the elections HSS formed coalition with SDP and had three ministers in government (education, agriculture and entrepreneurship), vice president of government and Speaker of Croatian Parliament, Zlatko Tomčić.

On local elections 2001. HSS achieved its best results ever and won 8 out of 21 county prefects (župan) and lot of municipalities and towns and became party which was second in number of local elected officials.

Today, the HSS considers itself among other center European political parties that advocate pro-agrarian policies and greater economic interventionism by the state. On social matters the HSS is largely conservative, supporting a Christian-based morality in public life. HSS is an associate member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP).

At the elections in November 2003, the party won 7.2% of the popular vote and 10 out of 151 seats (nine domestic seats and one minority seat).

Before the 2007 parliamentary elections, HSS announced a coalition with opposition parties Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar and Croatian Social Liberal Party. The coalition received 6.5% of the popular vote and 8 out of 153 seats (six for HSS itself). After elections they became part of Ivo Sanader&#x27;s governing coalition and received two ministerial portfolios (regional development and tourism), vicepresident of government and vicepresident of Parliament.

On 2011 parliamentary elections party score worst result in party&#x27;s history receiving only one parliamentary seat and 3% of popular vote.

Party convention 28 January 2012 elected Branko Hrg as new president.

In 2014 Croatian Peasant Party in coalition with Croatian Democratic Union won one seat in European Parliament – Marijana Petir. However, on 6 June 2017 Petir was expelled from Croatian Peasant Party, which left the party without seats in European Parliament.

<text>The Croatian Party of Rights (, HSP) is an extra-parliamentary nationalist and neo-fascist political party in Croatia. The word &quot;right(s)&quot; in the party&#x27;s name refers to the legal and moral reasons for the autonomy, independence, and sovereignty of Croatia.

==History==
The HSP, along with other modern Croatian parties, such as the Croatian Pure Party of Rights, claim legacy to the Party of Rights, which was founded in 1861 and existed until 1929.

=== 1991–1995 ===
A group of people restored Croatian Party of Rights on 25 February 1990. Dobroslav Paraga, the first president of the party acknowledged the historical bounds with the older Party of Rights. Soon, the party faced splits. Krešimir Pavelić, a former secretary of the party, became president of the new Croatian Democratic Party of Rights. Some other &quot;rights&quot; parties that claimed origin from old Party of Rights appeared. Croatian Party of Rights did not participate in the Croatian parliamentary election in 1990, which helped Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) to win more votes.

The parties membership grew at a rapid rate, with the party having 18,000 members by the end of 1990, and grew to over 100,000 members by the end of fall in 1991, with thousands of supporters attending the parties rallies and protests. Muslims often joined the HSP, falsifying their nationality to be Croatian while stating they were their fathers and grandfathers.

HSP&#x27;s political appeal and strength were at peak during the 1991–92 when Croatian Defence Forces, a military wing of the HSP, took heavy burden of defence of Croatia. Paraga was the champion of the Croatian will for freedom and independence. Paraga harshly and openly criticized Franjo Tuđman for his cooperation with Serbia and the conflict with Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The HSP used the writings of Ante Starčević and the writings of Ustaše ideologues such as Mile Budak to argue that Tuđman was not radical enough in his defence of the Croatian state.

The ruling HDZ cooperated with the HSP until the fall of Vukovar, after which the leaders of the HSP and HOS were imprisoned for &quot;terrorist activities&quot; and &quot;obstruction of democratically elected government&quot;. Paraga and the Croatian Party of Rights appeared in front of a military tribunal on allegations of insubordination. They were later released. Paraga&#x27;s main political and electoral platform was the creation of a Greater Croatia and the total defeat of the Serbian aggressor. In the Croatian parliamentary election held in 1992, HDZ lost 7% of votes in favor of the Party of Rights.

One of the party&#x27;s first post-communist leaders, Ante Paradžik was a political dissident during the former Yugoslavia when he was a student leader of the Croatian Spring, but he was killed during the war by assassination. Paraga found himself in a power struggle with his deputy, Anto Đapić. Paraga and Đapić fought a legal battle for the right to use the party name, a dispute that Paraga eventually lost. Paraga later formed the Croatian Party of Rights 1861 (HSP 1861) but by this time he was already politically marginalized.

On 17 September 1993, the leaders of the three &quot;rights&quot; parties held a meeting in Kutina and began preparations for a new union on a broad common &quot;rights&quot; program. The initiative for the meeting came from the new leaders of the HSP, Đapić and Boris Kandare, who invited leaders of the Croatian Pure Party of Rights and the Croatian National Democratic League but the meeting was unsuccessful, and those parties are still acting separately. During the parliamentary election in 1995, HSP lost popularity due to bad situation in the party in favor of HDZ.

=== 1995–present ===
The long-time president of modern HSP was Đapić. His political reputation was severely tarnished after the media found out that he cheated to obtain his first post-graduate degree in law at the University of Split, in collusion with Kandare, a senior member of his party and professor at the Law Faculty.

In 2000, Paraga again initiated a dispute about the Kutina Assembly before the Supreme Court, which accepted his lawsuit in May 2000, canceling the conclusion of the Ministry of Public Administration from 1998. He continued to claim that Đapić was not a member of the party and that he falsified his membership. However, on 20 July 2002, the Supreme Court sided with Đapić. The Ministry of Justice and Public Administration issued a decision according to which the leadership of the HSP did not violate the procedure and the law in any detail at the Kutin Assembly.

He was also publicly accused of faking injuries to obtain the status of a war veteran. Despite these revelations, Đapić&#x27;s career as head of the HSP was unaffected. Even after the party was left by many and it had terrible results, losing seven out of eight seats from 2003, and during the Croatian elections in 2007, he remained as head of the party. He temporarily resigned, but in less than few weeks he had withdrawn his resignation.

At the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election, the HSP was in an alliance with Međimurje Party, Zagorje Democratic Party and non-partisan Slaven Letica. Together, they won 6.4% of the popular vote and 8 out of 151 seats, all for the HSP and Letica. In August 2005, the Croatian Democratic Republican Party, a right-wing political party established on 21 October 2000, by merger of three smaller right-wing parties, merged into the HSP.

The first president of HDRS was Joško Kovač. In September 2007, prominent members Miroslav Rožić and Tonči Tadić left the party. In November at the 2007 Croatian parliamentary election, the party suffered a setback, as it won 3.5% of the popular vote and a single seat in Sabor. After the 2009 Croatian local elections, which weren&#x27;t particularly successful for the party either, turmoil in the party leadership escalated when a faction led by former representatives Ruža Tomašić and Pero Kovačević formed a splinter &quot;Croatian Party of Rights — Dr. Ante Starčević&quot;.

At the party convention held on 7 November 2009, Đapić officially stepped down, allowing a new leader to be elected by party members. Daniel Srb defeated two other candidates to become the new president of the party. The HSP announced that during the Croatian parliamentary election in 2011 holders of their list in VII Electoral District (primary Lika and Gorski Kotar) would be exclusively women.

The party, for the first time, didn&#x27;t win any parliamentary seats in the 2011 Croatian parliamentary election, which led to a crisis in Party of Rights; leaders of the Dalmatian branch of the party called for resignation of honorary president Anto Đapić. The president of the HSP in Split, Hrvoje Tomašević, asked for Đapić&#x27;s resignation from politics and election in the party. He was supported by the president of the HSP in Dubrovnik, Denis Šešelj. This appeal resulted in Đapić&#x27;s resignation from party politics.

On 28 January 2013, the Presidency of the Croatian Party of Rights expelled its former honorary president Đapić from the party. Srb, the party&#x27;s president, said that Đapić expelled as he broke his promise that he wouldn&#x27;t be active in politics. Đapić said that he was shocked by the decision.

On 16 July 2020, the county council of HSP Split reached a unanimous conclusion on demanding the resignation of the parties presidency and the president, Karlo Starčević, which he strongly opposed at the presidency session. HSP Split officials gave a statement, in which they resigned and left the party.

<text>William Selden Todman (July 31, 1916 – July 29, 1979) was an American television producer and personality born in New York City. He produced many of television&#x27;s longest-running shows with business partner Mark Goodson, with whom he created Goodson-Todman Productions.

==Early life==

Todman was the son of a Wall Street accountant, Frederick S. Todman, CPA, whose accounting firm was known as Frederick S. Todman &amp; Co. and for many years was located at 111 Broadway, downtown Manhattan. The firm represented some of the United States&#x27; biggest companies, including the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Polaroid, Eastman Kodak, and Chase Manhattan Bank. Frederick S. Todman lectured in post-World War II Japan as part of that country&#x27;s economic reconstruction, and wrote several quintessential books on Wall Street Accounting. Bill Todman&#x27;s brother, Howard, was vice president and treasurer for Goodson-Todman Productions.

==Game shows==
Todman teamed up with Mark Goodson for radio shows. According to radio historian J. David Goldin, among their early work together was the show &quot;Treasury Salute,&quot; a program syndicated by the Treasury Department that honored military members. They later collaborated in producing game shows for radio, then moved into television, where they produced some of the longest-running game shows in history. Their many shows included &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

Although both men created the programs, Todman gradually became less involved with the day-to-day operations of the game-show business and moved Goodson-Todman into a bigger business strategy. Todman was responsible for diversifying Goodson-Todman into the newspaper, radio station, and real estate businesses. The television business was lucrative, but not nearly as much as the other businesses in which Todman invested, which earned millions. Goodson continued to work on game shows, while Todman expanded the company. Goodson-Todman likely would never have survived the roller coaster of the television business, including the slow period for game shows in the late 1960s, had Todman not been aggressive in expanding the company into other ventures.

==Death==
Todman died on July 29, 1979, two days before his 63rd birthday, in New York City as a result of a heart condition. He was survived by his wife Frances Holmes Burson and two children: William Jr. and Lisa Todman Plough. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. 

Goodson-Todman game shows that were still running at the time continued to be billed as &quot;A Mark Goodson — Bill Todman Production&quot;. In the early 1980s, Mark Goodson acquired the Todman heirs&#x27; share of the company. &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, which premiered in 1982, was the first show to be billed as simply &quot;A Mark Goodson Television Production&quot;. The Goodson-Todman library of game shows is now part of FremantleMedia.

==Legacy==
* Todman was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011.

<text>The Croatian Social Liberal Party ( or HSLS) is a conservative-liberal political party in Croatia.

The HSLS were established in May 1989 in Zagreb as the first Croatian political party formed after the re-introduction of the multi-party system, at the time when SR Croatia was still part of SFR Yugoslavia.

Following Croatia&#x27;s independence in 1991 the subsequent rule of the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the HSLS were one of the dominant forces in Croatian politics, espousing a liberal and centre-left platform. The party first won elections in 2000 and formed a coalition government with four other parties, including the major social-democrat party SDP.

The next couple of years were marked by squabbles between HSLS and SDP, with HSLS leader Dražen Budiša gradually becoming more right-wing, briefly resigning in 2001, only to come back to leave the Račan cabinet in 2002 and move back into opposition. The move led to at least two liberal factions splintering, and the HSLS turning more conservative. After losing the 2003 election, in which Budiša&#x27;s HSLS shunned both the centre-left and centre-right coalitions, the party&#x27;s decline in political influence started.

Between 2010 and 2015 the party was not represented in parliament. Since 2015 HSLS consistently run on tickets with the ruling HDZ. In the most recent 2024 election HSLS won two MPs in the 151-seat Sabor, as part of a wider conservative coalition.

On the European level, HSLS are one of several Croatian parties affiliated with ALDE, the main pan-European liberal political group. Since 2019 the party has been led by Dario Hrebak, who also serves as the mayor of Bjelovar, the party&#x27;s only town mayor in Croatia.

== History ==

The HSLS was formed on 20 May 1989 as Croatian Social Liberal Union (). It was the first Croatian political party formed after the reintroduction of multi-party system. As such it was part of Coalition of People&#x27;s Accord during the first free elections in 1990. Its first leader was Slavko Goldstein, succeeded in 1990 by Dražen Budiša, who remained the leader until 1995. HSLS became the main opposition party after 1992 presidential and parliamentary elections and remained such until the late 1990s.

In February 1996, Vlado Gotovac became the president of the party. However, in November 1997 Budiša became the president again, and a faction led by Gotovac split off to form the Liberal Party.

In 1998, HSLS created permanent coalition with Social Democratic Party (SDP), which won elections two years later, replaced ruling Croatian Democratic Union and formed the new government together with four other parties.

However, after the party split in 2002 (the forming of LIBRA), HSLS left the government.

At the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election, an alliance of the HSLS and the Democratic Centre won 4.0% of the popular vote and 3 out of 151 seats. Two of these seats were held by the HSLS, down from 25 in 2000, causing Budiša to submit his resignation as president. After elections the HSLS supported the government of Ivo Sanader. In 2004, Ivan Čehok was elected party president.

After the 2005 Croatian local elections, it was announced that there are merger negotiations between HSLS and the Liberal Party. The latter dissolved itself, with membership and party infrastructure re-joining HSLS in January 2006. Đurđa Adlešič succeeded Ivan Čehok as the leader of reunited party.

Before the 2007 elections, HSLS, although still in government announced joint election ticket with opposition parties – Croatian Peasant Party and Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar. This coalition as a whole lost five seats compared to the previous election, but HSLS retained their two seats. They remained in the governing coalition under Ivo Sanader.

HSLS continued to support the government of Jadranka Kosor until 20 July 2010, when Darinko Kosor, the leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, announced his party&#x27;s decision to leave the governing coalition. This resulted in the party&#x27;s two MPs, Ivan Čehok and Antun Korušec, resigning from the party on 14 July 2010, leaving HSLS with no members in Parliament for the first time in party&#x27;s history.

In the next election in December 2011 HSLS ran in a coalition with Democratic Party of Zagorje (DPZ), a small regionalist party from northern Croatia. The coalition won only 3% of the vote and failed to make the threshold for parliament. For the next election, in November 2015, HSLS was part of the wider conservative-right-wing Patriotic Coalition led by HDZ, and managed to gain two seats in the 8th Assembly, which meant that the party returned to parliament in December 2015, after a five-year absence.

In the next three elections (2016, 2020, 2024) HSLS have been part of coalitions led by the conservative HDZ party and have supported the governments of Prime Ministers Tihomir Orešković and Andrej Plenković, without having members in their cabinets. However, the party never regained its influence from the early 2000s, and since 2003 and their turn towards more conservative positions they have never had more than two MPs in the 151-seat Sabor.

After Croatia joined the European Union in 2013 HSLS also ran in all European Parliament elections either independently or as part of various coalitions, without winning a single MEP.

== Ideology ==
In recent years by supporting Ivo Sanader, HSLS moved from social liberalism to conservative liberalism. This was considered unpopular, and the party&#x27;s decline in political influence resumed.

Ahead of 2013 constitutional referendum for defining marriage as being a union between a man and a woman, HSLS urged its members and supporters to vote against proposed change.

<doc id="408724" wikidata="Q1055882" url="?curid=408724" title="Virgin Megastores">
<text>Virgin Megastores is an international entertainment retailing chain, founded in early 1976 by Richard Branson as a record shop on London&#x27;s Oxford Street.

In 1979 the company opened their first Megastore at the end of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The company expanded to hundreds of stores worldwide in the 1990s, but lost a large number of stores during the 2010s, largely with the sale and eventual closing of the European, North American, Australian, Japanese and Chinese stores. By 2015, it operated only in the Middle East and in North Africa.

== History ==
=== Branson&#x27;s early business ventures ===
Richard Branson and Nik Powell had initially run a small record shop called &quot;Virgin Records and Tapes&quot; on Notting Hill Gate, London, specialising particularly in &quot;krautrock&quot; imports, and offering bean bags and free vegetarian food for the benefit of customers listening to the music on offer. After making the shop into a success, they turned their business into a fully fledged record label, Virgin Records. The name Virgin, according to Branson (in his autobiography), arose from a colleague of his when they were brainstorming business ideas. She suggested Virgin, as they were all new to business, like &quot;virgins&quot;. The first release on the label was the progressive rock album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; by multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield in 1973.

=== Virgin Megastores ===
Virgin&#x27;s first formal store opened on London&#x27;s Oxford Street in January or February 1971 (exact date uncertain). In 1979 the company opened their first Megastore at the end of Oxford Street and Marble Arch. Virgin Megastores and Virgin Records operated as entirely separate entities, like many of the other Virgin companies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Virgin Megastores opened over 100 stores in the UK, and many others around the world, including expansion into Asia Pacific and North America, under the leadership of Ian Duffell – President &amp; CEO of Virgin Entertainment Group until 1998. Simon Wright – Chief Executive of the Virgin Entertainment Group from 1999 to 2009 was instrumental in the growth of the stores in particular developing the stores in the Middle East before their eventual disposals under license detailed under Ownership.

==== Ownership ====

Like many of Branson&#x27;s Virgin brands, Virgin Megastores is not wholly owned by the Virgin Group. During the early to mid-2000s Virgin Group decided to sell off most of its Virgin Megastores to various companies, including the Lagardere Group. By 2001 the Virgin Megastores worldwide were split between the Virgin Group and the Lagardère Group. The Virgin Group kept the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Japan outlets while the Lagardère Group obtained the shops in France and travel retail locations globally including Australia, China, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Greece, Italy, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.

Virgin Megastores in the Middle East currently trades as V Star Multimedia LLC. Culture Convenience Club owns what was Virgin Megastores Japan, which have since been rebranded as Tsutaya. The Australian Virgin Megastores and Virgin at Myer concept stores were operated by Brazin Limited. (Sanity Entertainment after 2009) until all were closed in 2010; Brazin also ran local HMV outlets, in addition to their own Sanity brand. In December 2007 Butler Capital Partners announced their intention to mount a majority takeover of the French arm of Virgin from Lagardère. This deal was finalised in February 2008.

In 2007 the real estate company Related Companies and Vornado Realty Trust acquired Virgin Megastores North America. Related and Vornado were the landlords for the two most profitable stores in the United States and those stores were profitable because they had long-term leases in which rents were locked in at an extremely low rate. Both real estate companies wanted to break the leases and replace Virgin with new tenants that were willing to pay the then current higher rental rates that would make an entertainment retail business unprofitable. They have since decided to close all the American stores.

== Store experience ==

=== Product range ===

Virgin shops have a wide selection of CDs, games, books, DVDs, vinyl records, magazines, portable media players, accessories and additional products such as calendars, board games and Virgin branded items. Larger stores also stock electronic equipment and computer peripherals. Not all of these product categories are stocked by all Virgin shops, though the larger stores do generally stock the full product range.

In 2003, all US Stores increased their focus on multiple fashion categories spanning Pop culture, Street, Urban, Movie &amp; TV to complement the music, DVD and video games offers. Virgin Mobile products can also be found in separately run Virgin Mobile Concessions within most Virgin Megastores. Some shops also house cafes or coffee shops run by external companies.

== Technology ==
In 2005, Virgin Digital was launched to cater for those that bought their music digitally or wanted to rip and burn their current music collection. This is designed to add to the services provided by Virgin, rather than replace the Megastores. The download service faced some criticism from consumer groups due to its incompatibility with the popular iPod music player. The service has since been discontinued. Around the world there were other Virgin branded digital music retail websites, such as VirginMega.fr, France&#x27;s number 2 music download website.

== Operations ==
=== Europe ===

==== Austria ====
In 2003, the first and only Virgin Megastore in Vienna, on Mariahilferstraße, was sold and closed.

==== France ====

There were 35 Virgin Megastores in France. Twelve additional stores in France were branded Furet du Nord, and about ten international stores were owned by the same company. The French Megastore business was launched in 1988 by Branson and Patrick Zelnick, CEO of music publisher Naïve.

Lagardère Group bought the chain in 2001. In December 2007 Butler Capital Partners announced their intention to mount a majority takeover of the French arm of Virgin from Lagardère. This deal was finalised in February 2008. According to the Lagardère 2007 report, 80% of the Virgin stores was to be sold by Lagardère Services at a value of €76.4 million, and 20% would be kept. Prior to this sale 51% of VirginMega, France&#x27;s number 2 music download website, was transferred to the Virgin Stores company (sold to Butler), and the remaining 49% was kept by Lagardère Active.

In July 2012, LS Travel Retail announced that they will phase out the Virgin Entertainment brand in France, commencing 2013, converting all remaining Virgin travel outlets into larger sized Fnac formats stocking the same range in addition to more product lines.

In January 2013, Virgin Megastore France filed for bankruptcy. At that time there were 26 Megastores in France, employing 1,000 people, after two years of cutting over 200 staff and several shops. The company had taken steps to terminate the lease on its flagship Champs-Élysées store in Paris after 25 years on the famous avenue. In June 2013 the company was finally liquidated and ceased operations after 25 years.

==== Germany ====
Virgin Megastore withdrew from the German market in 1994, amid complaints that the country&#x27;s shop-closing law was too restrictive.

The Virgin name is used by the Lagardère Group to brand a small number of convenience stores within airports and railway stations. In September 2019 there were seven Virgin shops, of which four are in or adjacent to Frankfurt airport.

==== Greece ====
As of June 2005 there were 15 Virgin Megastores in Greece, operated by Vivere Entertainment. As of 2015, no Virgin Megastores exist in the country.

==== Hungary ====
In 1996, local merchandising group Fotex opened the first and only Hungarian Virgin Megastore (1000 m2) in the first &quot;western&quot; shopping mall, Duna Plaza, in Budapest. It was operated under a franchise until 2000. Between 2001 and 2006, Fotex operated the store as &quot;Hungaroton Gigastore&quot;. The shop was closed in 2006 and no more Virgin Megastore shops were opened in Hungary.

==== Ireland ====

Virgin Megastores opened its first store in the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 1986. More stores opened in Ireland from the early 1990s including Cork City. The company had planned to launch an online store specifically for the Republic of Ireland at virginmegastores.ie however plans were shelved when its Irish operations were sold in 2007. At its height of success the company owned 6 stores in the Republic of Ireland, however, by 2002 stores began to close. The Virgin Group sought to sell its Irish operations during 2007, and on 17 September 2007, it was announced Irish and UK stores would separate from the Virgin Group. A management buy-out offer was accepted. Stores were rebranded as Zavvi.

Following the collapse of Zavvi&#x27;s supplier in December 2008, stores in Ireland were immediately closed in January 2009 with the hope Irish stores could be sold to another buyer unfortunately all were closed with some taken over by other music retailers.

==== Italy ====
In February 2004, the Virgin Megastore in Piazza Duomo Milan closed. Currently this building is occupied by a Mondadori retail store. After the Italian franchise Virgin Retail Italy filed for bankruptcy and liquidation, the Italian bankruptcy court ordered in May 2004 the immediate closure of three out of four of the remaining stores while allowing the store in Bergamo to remain open for a few additional months to allow the company to depose of its remaining inventory.

==== The Netherlands ====
Virgin Megastores entered the Dutch market in the 1990s and operated four stores (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Maastricht). In 2000, it decided to exit the market. Three stores were sold to the Free Record Shop group, while the Maastricht branch was closed. Free Record Shop also acquired three Virgin Megastores in Belgium.

==== Spain and Portugal ====
Virgin Retail España, S.L. opened its Barcelona store in November 1992, just after the Barcelona Olympics. This opening was followed by another Megastore in Seville (1993) however the opening of a flagship store in Madrid eluded the retailer, because at that time, cinemas and theatres in the Gran Vía (Madrid&#x27;s most popular commercial thoroughfare) could not easily be reassigned for commercial use. The Spanish company diversified by opening small outlets in busy Spanish and Portuguese airports. In 1994, Virgin Retail España reached an agreement with the department store chain Galerías Preciados and opened small concessions in their Madrid stores (Callao, Goya, Serrano, La Vaguada and Parquesur). Galerías Preciados ceased trading the following year and Virgin Retail España quickly re-organised its operations and opened medium-sized stores in ABC Serrano (Madrid), La Coruña, Vigo, Málaga, Bilbao and Santander. Larger stores followed in Portugal (Lisbon and Oporto) but by 1997 the impact of digital technology had already hit their distribution model very hard. Music was by then being traded freely on the Internet but the major music labels did little to help support high street retailers. Inevitably, the Virgin Retail Group took the difficult strategic decision to close all of Virgin&#x27;s high street stores in southern Europe. In July 1998 Virgin Megastores closed its southern European flagship store in Barcelona on the corner of Passeig de Gràcia and Gran Vía de les Corts Catalans. This building is currently occupied by Zara clothes store.

==== UK ====

The first Virgin Megastore opened in the United Kingdom in 1979 and between the 1980s and 1990s, the chain grew, including via its merger with Our Price whilst under the ownership of WH Smith. By the 1990s Virgin Megastores had become an international franchise as part of the Virgin Group.

The Virgin Group sought to sell its UK and Ireland stores during 2007, and on 17 September 2007, it was announced that the UK and Ireland arm of the Virgin Megastores brand was to break away from the Virgin Group. A management buy-out offer was accepted. Stores were rebranded as Zavvi.

Following the collapse of Woolworths, which owned Zavvi&#x27;s supplier Entertainment UK, Zavvi entered administration on 24 December 2008 as it had been unable to source stock from other suppliers under favourable terms. By February 2009 Zavvi had closed its stores, selling some to rival HMV, and a few to Simon Douglas and Les Whitfield&#x27;s Head Entertainment.

==== Turkey ====
Virgin entered the Turkish market in March 2011 with a store located in the Demirören shopping centre on Istiklal Street near Taksim, Istanbul. The product mix of books, digital media and electronics failed to compete with better established chains and the store closed in autumn 2012.

=== Arab world ===
The Azadea Group of Beirut, Lebanon has an exclusive license since 2001 to operate Virgin Megastores in many countries within the Middle East, except for countries which already have a franchise.

==== Lebanon ====

Virgin&#x27;s main store in Lebanon was located in the old Cinema Opera on Martyrs&#x27; Square, Beirut Central District; it opened on 3 July 2001 and was shut down in 2018. The four level store&#x27;s inauguration was attended by Virgin&#x27;s founder Sir Richard Branson. There are also smaller outlets at ABC Malls at Achrafieh, Dbayeh, Verdun and CityMall Dora, as well as in Beirut International Airport. New stores were opened in ABC Mall Dbayeh in November 2012 and ABC Mall Verdun in November 2017.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
First megastore in Riyadh opened in February 2015.

By December 2015, there were four Virgin Megastores in Saudi Arabia. They were located on Tahliah Street in the Roshana Centre, Red Sea Mall and on in Jeddah domestic airport in Jeddah and there&#x27;s one at Dhahran Mall Eastern Province.

In November 2017, a fifth Saudi location was open at the Hayat Mall in Riyadh.

==== Bahrain ====

And the 4th and newest branch opened in Mall of Egypt on 27 September 2017.

==== Kuwait ====

The first location in Kuwait opened in 2002. By May 2008, there were two Virgin Megastores in Kuwait, one at Marina Mall in Salmiya and the other at the airport. However, by late 2011 the airport branch was shut down, while the second branch shut down in March 2012.

After a seven-year absence, Virgin Megastores returned to Kuwait in February 2020 by opening its first new store there at The Avenues Mall.

==== Qatar ====
Virgin Megastores currently has six stores in Qatar, with one being located in the Villaggio Mall (an Italian-themed mall), Doha which is the shopping centre&#x27;s main anchor. In November 2008 they opened a smaller store in a shopping centre called Landmark. Other locations includes Mall of Qatar, Qatar Mall, Doha Festival City, Hamad International Airport (departure area) and a small kiosk at The Pearl.

==== United Arab Emirates ====

The first Virgin Megastore in the United Arab Emirates in September 2001 at the Deira City Centre in Dubai, two months after the opening in Beirut. A few months later, the second store in the country was opened in Abu Dhabi in October 2001. A fourth store in UAE opened in Jumeirah in 2002.

By October 2005, there were four stores in the UAE, with stores at the Deira City Center, at Burjuman and at Mercato Mall in Dubai and at the Abu Dhabi Mall in Abu Dhabi. A month later, Branson was present at the Virgin Megastores opening at the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai.

Sometime between 2009 and 2010, the ownership for the Virgin Megastore franchise in the United Arab Emirates and the Middle East was transferred from Star Multimedia to Virgin Megastores Middle East, Azadea Group. By May 2010, stores were also added at the Mirdif City Centre and at the Jumeira Beach residence in Dubai to make a total of seven stores in the UAE.

The eighth store in the UAE was opened in September 2011 at the Dubai Mall in Dubai. The Jumeirah Beach residence appeared to have been closed sometime before September 2012, bring the store count back down to seven.

A second store in Abu Dhabi opened at the Al Wahda Mall in November 2012.

As of November 2012, there were eight Virgin Megastores in the UAE six of which are located in Dubai.

In December 2014, a store was opened at the Yas Mall in Abu Dhabi. The thirteenth store in the UAE was opened at the Al Jimi Mall in Al Ain in July 2015.

As well as being an all-rounded entertainment retailer, these Megastores also act as venues, with artist signings/appearances, performances and quiz nights and a newly launched boutique section offering everything from movie memorabilia to jewellery.

This store is quite popular among locals and expats in the country, as this is the only store where they sell more music than most stores in the country, which also explains why the country has more branches than the other Gulf countries.

==== Jordan ====
The first Virgin Megastore in Jordan opened in Amman at the City Mall in September 2007. A second location, also in Amman, was opened at the Taj Mall in October 2015.

==== Morocco ====
In 2007, Best Financière (Label Vie Carrefour) of Rabat received a franchise from Lagardère to operate Virgin Megastores in Morocco. The first store in Morocco opened at the Almazar mall in Marrakech in April 2010. A second store was opened in Rabat (Kitéa Géant Mall) in December 2012 which was quickly followed weeks later by the openings of two additional stores in Casablanca (AnfaPlace Shopping Center) and Fez (Borj Fez Mall). A fifth store was opened in downtown Casablanca in September 2015. In August 2016, a sixth store was opened on the property of a Carrefour Store located in the Sidi Maârouf Neighbourhood next to the city of Casablanca.

==== Syria ====
In 2007, Antar Group of Damascus was awarded a franchise by Lagardère to operate Virgin Megastores in Syria. The Antar Group was in the process of opening a store in the Al Shahba Mall in Aleppo when the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011. The business has since closed after the mall had been heavily damaged during the fighting.

==== Oman ====
The first Virgin Megastore in Oman opened in Muscat in November 2015 at the Muscat City Centre.

=== North America ===

==== United States ====

In 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster entered into a joint venture to set up the first Virgin Megastore on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, which was closed in 2008. The US Megastore business was launched in 1992 by Richard Branson and Ian Duffell, CEO of Virgin Entertainment Group. At its peak, there were 23 Megastores in the U.S. which generated $310 million annually. The U.S. stores were purchased by Related Companies and Vornado Realty Trust in 2007 for the purpose of closing the stores and to break the long term long rental leases.

===== Store closures =====
Under new ownership, eleven stores were gradually closed in 2007. On 2 March 2009, it was announced that all Virgin Megastores in the United States would close.

The store at Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento, CA, closed in 2005 and was converted to an Urban Outfitters, while the Grapevine Mills location was closed at the end of 2008. Related Companies announced that the Virgin Megastore flagship store in Times Square would close by April 2009, with the space being replaced by Forever 21. On 25 February 2009, it was announced that the stores in San Francisco and Union Square (New York) would close in April and May, respectively, and the announcement of all stores closing followed soon thereafter. On 12 May 2009, the Virgin Megastore at Downtown Disney (now Disney Springs) at Walt Disney World closed permanently. As of September 2012, the last remaining Virgin Books &amp; Music outlet operated in Terminal 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Both airport locations closed by the middle of 2013. The JFK Airport location was closed by the time Terminal 3 was demolished and converted into a parking lot in 2013.

===== In-stores =====
Most locations included an in-store radio station, branded Virgin Radio. U.S. Virgin Radio was not a broadcast radio station, but a DJ operated hard-lines system which broadcast throughout the store, and the complex in which the store was located. At the Times Square location, DJ selections were heard on the retail floor, in the office areas, processing areas, and even out on the shop&#x27;s Broadway sidewalk frontage.

All employees of the U.S. Virgin Megastores could be identified by their trademark red or black t-shirts which had the Virgin logo on the front and the word STAFF on the back, as well as required lanyards with their first name printed on them.

===== Technology =====
The Virgin Megastore chain in the U.S. had a different GSA look-up system to other the international arms of the chain. This system was a private network that linked all North American stores, updating each shop&#x27;s product inventory every 24 to 48 hours.

American Virgin Megastores implemented a near real-time data warehouse in 2004. The data warehouse named &#x27;Crescendo&#x27; collects POS transactions, along with customer traffic counts and generates KPI reports in near real-time. The near real-time information helped the managers identify trends quicker and react accordingly. The U.S. stores shared their experience with the real-time warehouse and the UK stores also used similar process.

Virgin Megastore (U.S.) had a Customer Loyalty Program named &#x27;Virgin V.I.P.&#x27; The Program used a read/write &#x27;GraphiCard&#x27;. Every time a member purchase is made, the Graphicard was swiped through the POS Graphicard Terminal. Members points were instantly updated on the face of the card. The website shared the loyalty program with the U.S. stores.

===== Website =====
Virgin Megastores U.S. website is VirginMega.com. In 2002 this website became co-branded with Amazon, and was powered by Amazon. Later in 2002 VirginMega.co.jp, the Japanese equivalent, followed suit. In 2007 the website was again changed, when Virgin Megastores partnered with Baker &amp; Taylor. On 31 May 2009 VirginMega.com ceased operating.

==== Canada ====
The first and only Virgin Megastore in Canada opened in December 1996 at 750 Burrard Street, at the corner of Robson Street and Burrard Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. The , three-level store was located in Downtown Vancouver, the city&#x27;s busiest and most prestigious retail destination. The building was previously home to the central branch of the Vancouver Public Library. The Virgin Megastore ceased its operations in Vancouver on 4 September 2005 when on 28 June 2005, HMV Canada announced it was planning to expand the store and rebrand the location into the HMV brand. The acquisition took effect immediately after the closure and on 5 September 2005, HMV was opened. With the dominance of HMV in Canada, Virgin thus decided to exit the Canadian market entirely. This Vancouver HMV location would later close in 2012.

There were also plans to build its second Canadian store at Metropolis (later Toronto Life Square, now 10 Dundas East) in Downtown Toronto, just south of the since-closed Sam the Record Man flagship store as well as HMV&#x27;s existing Toronto flagship. However, the exit from Canada resulted in the cancellation of these plans. An Adidas Performance store stands where Virgin would have.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

The first Australian Megastore was launched in 1988 by Richard Branson and Ian Duffell, CEO Virgin Megastores Asia-Pacific. Between 1988 and 1992 Megastores were opened in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. In 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster Inc. entered into a joint venture. This lasted until Virgin sold their interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, who promptly rebranded them in 1993 to Blockbuster Music.

In October 2001, Ian Duffell, managing director of Brazin Limited (owner of Australia&#x27;s largest entertainment retailer, Sanity) reintroduced Virgin Megastores in the country via two related transactions with the Virgin Group, acquiring 77 troubled Our Price music stores in the UK for a symbolic £2, and in turn gaining exclusive license rights in Australia for Virgin Entertainment, initially setting up the first Virgin Megastore on Chapel Street&#x27;s, The Jam Factory in April 2002. Brazin also intended to use the Virgin brand to open 45 new Megastores in addition to converting 55 of its existing small-scale IN2 Music stores that had not already been rebranded as Sanity. Yet, the programme stalled as Brazin battled internal disruptions and struggled to separate the target-markets for Virgin and its chain of more than 200 Sanity stores (at the time). As a result, the company&#x27;s entertainment division posted a $27 million loss in financial year, 2002–03, and by mid-2004, Brazin had only managed to open 12 Virgin Megastores.

In September 2003, Brazin sold out of its 118-store Sanity UK (former Our Price and VShop outlets) store network to Primemist Limited. In July 2004, Brazin entered into an agreement with Coles Myer to open 62 Virgin concept stores within the Myer department store chain. Brazin agreed to buy all of Myer&#x27;s remaining CD and DVD stock, recruit, train and pay their own staff, and work within Myer&#x27;s systems and promotions. These concept stores were marketed separately to stand-alone Virgin Megastores (due to their more limited stock availability) and branded, Virgin at Myer. This solved Brazin&#x27;s problem since 2002 by separating the Virgin and Sanity target markets by making Virgin more &quot;family orientated&quot; while leaving Sanity&#x27;s &quot;street edge&quot; to continue. Exactly a year later, Brazin stated that after a rocky start (with staff recruitment issues and aligning products with the typical Myer customer), Virgin at Myer was up 45 per cent on comparative sales and was performing well.

In December 2004, HDS Retail Asia Pacific opened Australia&#x27;s first Virgin Books and Music travel outlet at Melbourne Airport. Since then, the company – now known as LS Travel Retail – opened another five Virgin outlets at other major capital city airports in addition to one railway outlet at Southern Cross station in Melbourne. Yet, by early 2012, all of these stores have been closed.

By mid-2010, Sanity Entertainment (formerly Brazin Limited) closed all Virgin Megastores. Also, in August of that year, all Virgin at Myer concept stores stopped operating under the Virgin brand due to Sanity Entertainment not renewing their contract with Myer Holdings (formerly Coles Myer) and were either closed or converted back into a basic audio/visual department operated by Myer (in 2011, these non-branded audio/visual departments were later closed by Myer anyway). Sanity elected to exit the Virgin brand despite the licensing deal running until 2015.

Virgin Entertainment&#x27;s Australian peak was reached in 2006 with 24 Virgin Megastores, 62 Virgin at Myer outlets, and 2 Virgin Books and Music stores in operation. As of September 2012, Australia contains no more Virgin Entertainment outlets.

=== Asia ===

==== Japan ====
In 1990 Virgin Megastores Japan Limited was started as a 50/50 venture between Marui and the Virgin Entertainment Group. In September 1990, the first Japanese Virgin Megastore opened in Shinjuku. During the 1990s, more Megastores were opened all over Japan. On 19 September 2002, following its American counterpart, the VirginMega.co.jp website became powered by Amazon.co.jp. This website has since disappeared.

In 2005 Culture Convenience Club bought Virgin Megastore&#x27;s operations (totalling 22 stores) in Japan from Marui Co. By November 2008 the number of Virgin Megastores in Japan had lessened to 15. Culture Convenience Club&#x27;s licensing contract with Virgin Group for the use of the Virgin Megastore brand had expired, and there was no desire to renew it. As of November 2008 Culture Convenience Club&#x27;s subsidiary company, Tsutaya Stores Holdings Co., is expected to acquire Virgin Megastores Japan Co. Virgin Megastores Japan are to be rebranded as Tsutaya by early 2009.

==== China ====
In November 2007, HDS Retail Asia Pacific (now known as LS Travel Retail) opened China&#x27;s first and only Virgin Books and Music travel outlet at Hongqiao International Airport in Shanghai. As of June 2012, it is still in operation.

==Virgin Books and Music==
Virgin Books and Music is a Virgin-branded entertainment retail chain exclusive to airports and travel locations, operated by the &quot;Lagardère Services&quot; division of the French conglomerate Lagardère Group. Such stores have a much smaller size than Virgin Megastores and currently operate in 10 countries: Canada, China, Germany, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

<text>The Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats ( or HNS) is a social-liberal political party in Croatia.

In the 11th Sabor, since 2024, a single HNS representative forms a parliamentary club together with two independent representatives. HNS is an affiliate member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party.

==Origins==
The People&#x27;s Party in Croatia was originally formed in 1841, during the period of Croatian romantic nationalism. The Croatian People&#x27;s Party describes the events of the Illyrian movement since 1835 as its history.. After 1861 the People&#x27;s Party was known as the People&#x27;s Liberal Party, its main splinter party was the Independent People&#x27;s Party (1880–1903) which became more pro-autonomist, while the &quot;old&quot; People&#x27;s Party developed into &quot;party of the Settlement&quot; having collaborated with the pro-Hungarian Unionist Party (known as the People&#x27;s Constitutional Party). The Progressive Party (1904–1906) and the Croatian People&#x27;s Progressive Party (1906–1910) were also liberal parties in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as an autonomous part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

In 1860, the national liberals formed in the Dalmatia (Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) the National party known also as the People&#x27;s Party in Dalmatia. The party developed into a conservative party around 1889 (the National Croatian Party).

In the first Yugoslavia (1918–1941), main liberal party was the Independent Democratic Party composed by the Serbs from former Austro-Hungarian parts of the new state and Slovene centralist liberals.

During Communism in the second Yugoslavia (the Socialist Republic of Croatia, SRH), the liberal leaders of the League of Communists of Croatia were Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo, who participated in the Croatian Spring of 1971.

==Modern party==
The modern Croatian People&#x27;s Party was formed in late 1990 by members of the Coalition of People&#x27;s Accord () which had participated on the first multi-party election of 1990, led by Savka Dabčević-Kučar, Miko Tripalo, Dragutin Haramija and others.

The HNS remained a small opposition party. In the 1992 election they won 6.7% of the vote and attained 6 seats in the Croatian Parliament. In 1994, construction entrepreneur Radimir Čačić became party chairman. In the 1995 election they won 2 seats as part of an election alliance.

In the January 2000 election, they formed a four-party coalition with HSS, LS and IDS, which together won 25 seats in the Parliament, two of whom were HNS representatives. As a result, the party participated in the 2000–2003 government of Ivica Račan through the minister of public works, construction and reconstruction Radimir Čačić. A few weeks later, the coalition&#x27;s candidate and HNS member Stjepan Mesić was elected President of the Republic.

Also in 2000, HNS elected a new party chair, Zagreb University professor of sociology of politics Vesna Pusić.

In the November 2003 elections, their alliance with the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar and the Slavonia-Baranja Croatian Party won 8% of the vote and 11 out of 151 seats, 10 of them HNS representatives. However, despite significantly improved results, the party moved to the opposition.

A second element of today&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party, the Party of Liberal Democrats or Libra, originated in time of the Račan government when in 2002 Dražen Budiša, the leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), pulled out of the coalition. Ten members of parliament from Budiša&#x27;s party, led by Jozo Radoš, refused to bring down the government and instead split from the HSLS, forming Libra, the Party of Liberal Democrats. That party won 3 seats in the 2003 election. On 6 February 2005, most of the 1,250 representatives of HNS on its seventh convention voted to merge with Libra as the &quot;Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats&quot;. The total number of parliamentary seats for the party increased to 13.

In the November 2007 elections, the party ran on its own and got around 7% of the vote and 7 seats in the Croatian Sabor. It remained in the opposition. In April 2008 Radimir Čačić was elected as party chair after defeating Dragutin Lesar (MP). Lesar left the party, first acting as an independent MP, but then founded a splinter party, Croatian Laburists in March 2010. Zlatko Horvat MP left the party as well.

In the 2011 elections, HNS participated in centre-left &quot;Kukuriku coalition&quot; spearheaded by SDP. After the coalition won, HNS entered the cabinet and held posts of foreign relations, commerce, culture etc. Čačić was reelected as a party chairman again in March 2012. After he was sentenced to a prison term due to a traffic accident in which two people died, he resigned from the cabinet and was forced to leave the party. Vesna Pusić was elected as party president in 2013. On 21 September 2014 about 200 members from HNS Zagreb and Varaždin branches each left the party in order to form liberal and centrist People&#x27;s Party - Reformists under Radimir Čačić&#x27;s leadership.

HNS held the same alliance in the parliamentary elections of 2015 and 2016 as a part of SDP-led &quot;People&#x27;s coalition&quot;, switching to opposition. After the party chairman Ivan Vrdoljak and the party&#x27;s general board decided to enter the government with centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and support Andrej Plenkovic&#x27;s cabinet in the parliament (overriding the opposition of party&#x27;s presidency), in June 2017, four MPs and the only MEP (Jozo Radoš) left the party to create left of the centre Civic Liberal Alliance. This splinter also resulted in numerous party members and branch leaders leaving the party, either to join Civic Liberal Alliance or other parties. In October 2018, MP Marija Puh left the party fraction in the parliament to join Milan Bandic&#x27;s party, reducing the fraction further down to just four MPs.

In the run-up to the 2024 Croatian parliamentary election, HNS-LD decided to run together with HDZ, nominating a total of 4 candidates in 4 electoral units.

<text>Luisa Tetrazzini (29 June 1871 – 28 April 1940) was an Italian coloratura soprano of great international fame. Tetrazzini &quot;had a scintillating voice with a brilliant timbre and a range and agility well beyond the norm...&quot;. She enjoyed a highly successful operatic and concert career in Europe and America from the 1890s through to the 1920s. Her voice lives on in recordings made from 1904–1920. She wrote a memoir, &quot;My Life of Song&quot;, in 1921 and a treatise, &quot;How to Sing&quot;, in 1923. After retirement, she taught voice in her homes in Milan and Rome until her death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tetrazzini was born on 29 June 1871, in Florence, Italy. Her father was a tailor and she had two sisters and two brothers. Reportedly, she began singing at the age of three. Luisa herself recalled singing early on as a child and reminisced that her father was the first person to ever compare her to the famous bel canto soprano, Adelina Patti. Luisa first studied singing with her oldest sister, Eva Tetrazzini (1862–1938)(it). Eva was also a prima donna soprano who made a name for herself internationally. While doing chores, Luisa was known to practice entire acts of operatic roles and to sing every voice part. She began studies at the Istituto Musicale between the age of ten and thirteen with Professor Ceccherini. She married Giuseppe Santino Alberto Scalaberni on 14 October 1889.

===Career===

Through a stroke of luck, Tetrazzini stepped in for an ailing prima donna and made her operatic debut in Florence on 21 October 1890, as Inez in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; at age nineteen. She reminisces that after her debut, “The pavements from the theatre to my home were lined, even at that late hour, with large numbers of people, all of whom seemed to be shouting congratulations to me.” Next, she sang Inez in Rome on 26 December 1890, for the King and Queen of Italy. She was then invited by the Queen to sing the &quot;Liebestod&quot; from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, as it was the Queen’s favorite opera. The first part of her career was spent mainly in the Italian provincial theaters and then touring in South America. She travelled with Pietro Cesare, who became her lover of nearly 14 years, to Buenos Aires where she was offered £280 per month to sing. While in Buenos Aires, her husband, Alberto, followed her to attempt to return her to Florence. She refused to reconcile. He left for Florence without her in October, and she made her debut a few days later as Annetta in &quot;Crispino e la comare&quot;. When Alberto died on 4 June 1905, they were still separated.

Tetrazzini first sang &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in Buenos Aires on 21 November 1892. It was her favorite opera, as well as that of Argentinian President Luis Sáenz Peña. He was her avid fan. By the time of her fourth season in Buenos Aires, she was engaged to receive £5,500 per month. Along with performing in Argentina, she toured South America. She continued to sing there until 1895.

She returned to sing in Europe in 1896. Next she debuted in Saint Petersburg with Mattia Battistini in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; on 31 December 1896. After her first season in St. Petersburg ended in 1897, she finished the year performing in Madrid, Milan, Turin and Odessa. In 1898, she sang in Odessa and Bologna before returning to perform in various South American countries. The winter season of 1899 brought Tetrazzini back to St. Petersburg. This is where she first performed with Enrico Caruso, who sang Edgardo to her Lucia in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; on 22 February 1899. Her 1890s&#x27; repertory consisted primarily of lyric-coloratura parts such as Violetta, Philine, Oscar, Gilda, and Lucia.

From 1899–1903, she sang in Italy, Germany, Poland, and Russia. Her Mexican debut as Lucia came on 22 October 1903. A little over a year later, her performance of Lucia on 8 December 1904, was fortuitous. William H. ‘Doc’ Leahy, impresario of San Francisco&#x27;s Tivoli Theater, was in attendance. He was in Mexico visiting his friend, Ettore Patrizi, who was conducting Tetrazzini at the time. Leahy invited her to come to San Francisco. She made her American debut at the Tivoli in San Francisco as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; on 11 January 1905. 

Due to Dame Nellie Melba&#x27;s absence, an opening came for Tetrazzini at the esteemed Covent Garden in London. Although she had established a career throughout South America and much of Europe, she was practically unknown to English audiences. Tetrazzini’s debut at Covent Garden as Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot; on 2 November 1907 was critically acclaimed and &quot;caused a sensation...&quot; She garnered twenty curtain calls. E.A. Baugham in the &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote, “The quality of tone produced by Tetrazzini ravished the sense. It is soft and golden and yet has none of the impersonal and chilling perfection of the ordinary light soprano...I have never seen the pathos of Verdi’s heroine realized with such grip and sincerity... I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that Mme Tetrazzini has the voice of the century and stands out from even the great Italian singers we know...” Additional reviews were similarly complimentary of Tetrazzini’s abilities, even comparing her to the famous Adelina Patti, the premiere soprano of an earlier generation. Tetrazzini idolized Patti greatly. She remarks that Patti saw her performance and invited her to a lunch in which she confirmed the press’s clamoring that Tetrazzini would continue her legacy. Tetrazzini and Patti became great friends, and were frequent correspondents until Patti’s death. Patti made it a point to attend and loudly applaud the younger soprano&#x27;s performances. Tetrazzini remarks about a letter from Patti about one of her performances that she prized it as her greatest treasure saying, &quot;Praise from a mixed audience is very gratifying after one has given it of her best. But, praise, and such praise, from Patti is far more than the passing pleasure of a public ovation.&quot;

From this point on, Tetrazzini was an international operatic superstar, commanding the highest fees and selling out opera houses and concert halls wherever she performed. In 1904, the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s general manager, Heinrich Conried, had tried to engage Tetrazzini with a contract that committed her to singing with the Met for three years starting in November 1905. This contract never became binding as Conried failed to give her bank the guarantee deposit. In 1908, Tetrazzini finally appeared in New York City, not at the Metropolitan, but at Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s Manhattan Opera Company, again as Violetta with great success. She remained loyal to Hammerstein and appeared at the Met for only one season, in 1911-12 (giving just eight performances, in the roles of Lucia, Violetta, and Gilda). From 1911 to 1914 she sang with the Boston Opera Company and Chicago Grand Opera Company.

After some legal difficulties in New York that blocked her from performing, she held a press conference and declared, &quot;I will sing in San Francisco if I have to sing there in the streets, for I know the streets of San Francisco are free.&quot; This line became famous. She won her legal case, and her agent announced she would sing in the streets of San Francisco. On a crystal clear Christmas Eve in 1910, at the corner of Market and Kearney near Lotta&#x27;s Fountain, Tetrazzini climbed a stage platform in a sparkling white gown, surrounded by a throng of an estimated two to three hundred thousand San Franciscans, and serenaded the city she loved.
Tetrazzini possessed an extraordinary vocal technique that enabled her to surmount any vocal challenge with joyful ease. She had complete mastery of runs, trills, staccati and vocal ornaments of all kinds. She also had a brilliant upper register, extending to F above high C. Unlike many other coloratura sopranos, such as Amelita Galli-Curci, Tetrazzini&#x27;s high notes were not thin and delicate, but full, powerful and ringing. On the debit side of the ledger, her vocal registers were not as well-integrated as those belonging to her direct soprano rival, Nellie Melba. Also, although her lower register was strong, her middle voice was comparatively thin or &#x27;white&#x27; in tone, with a quality which some American and English critics described as &quot;infantile&quot; and &quot;child-like&quot;. The Irish tenor John McCormack even compared it, using hyperbole, to &quot;the wailing of a cross infant&quot;. With age, however, Tetrazzini&#x27;s middle register filled out to some extent; and the way that her mid-voice sounded, even when she was younger, does not seem to have troubled the ears of Mediterranean critics, going by their written record.

Tetrazzini was short and grew quite stout as she aged; but she could act effectively on stage, especially in lively or comic roles. She was a good musician, too, and she possessed an amiable, zestful and vivacious personality. These extra-vocal qualities come through on the many records that she made. She recorded extensively for the Victor Talking Machine Company and the Gramophone Company/HMV. Her best recordings include a spectacular rendition of &quot;&quot;Io son Titania&quot; from Ambroise Thomas&#x27; &quot;Mignon&quot; and &quot;Saper vorreste&quot; from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, in which Tetrazzini&#x27;s personality virtually jumps out of the grooves at the listener. On a different note, her recording of &quot;Addio, del passato&quot; from &quot;La traviata&quot; is very moving and also demonstrates her fine legato, as is her &quot;Ah! non credea mirarti&quot; from &quot;La sonnambula&quot;. Her &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot;,&quot; and &quot;&quot;Ah! non giunge&quot;,&quot; made for Victor, remain, after all these years, unequalled for their sheer joy, easy virtuosity and spectacular ornamentation.

Tetrazzini had a bitter feud with Nellie Melba while at Covent Garden but was extremely well liked by other colleagues such as Frieda Hempel and Enrico Caruso. Tetrazzini and Caruso had been close friends for many years, and his premature death at age 48 left her devastated. After he fell ill, Caruso wrote her a postcard saying “I am waiting for you with open arms, waiting every moment to salute you with a golden note.” Unfortunately, she was unable to see him before his death. She is known to have visited his tomb frequently. Additionally, she obtained permission from the Pope to sing a Requiem Mass on the first anniversary of his passing. 
The two also wrote the book &quot;Caruso and Tetrazzini On the Art of Singing&quot;

Tetrazzini was a frequent traveller on the famous Cunard liner . Along with other well-known names, including Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern, she was a member of the ship’s mock secret society of devoted passengers, the Heathens. It was on board the &quot;Mauretania&quot; in November 1910 that Oscar Hammerstein served her legal papers in an attempt to prevent her from performing under a different manager. During a crossing in April 1912, she sang a requiem recital in the &quot;Mauretania&quot; first class lounge in honour of the victims of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Her performance took the place of the passenger-led concert in aid of the Seamen’s Charities of Liverpool and New York, a customary event during a transatlantic crossing.

===Later years===

After World War I, Tetrazzini largely abandoned the opera stage for the concert platform. She wrote a memoir, &quot;My Life of Song&quot;, in 1921 and a treatise, &quot;How to Sing&quot;, in 1923. In 1932, when she was retiring, she was filmed listening to a recording of Caruso&#x27;s rendition of &quot;&quot;M&#x27;appari, tutt&#x27;amor&quot;,&quot; and began to sing along with the record showing that her voice still had plenty of power (this video can be seen from the link below under the &quot;External Links&quot; section). She taught voice after retirement in 1934 and named Lina Pagliughi her successor. Tetrazzini’s recordings range from 1904-1920. Tetrazzini became a worldwide name and was “glorified even in food, as in the dish Turkey Tetrazzini.”

Tetrazzini’s thirty-two year career accrued her enormous wealth. Critics described her as singing with youthful abandon, while noting her solid vocal technique. Her emotional interpretation of roles catapulted her to fame and led to comparisons with Patti, Lind, and Melba. Some of her most well-known roles included: Rosina (&quot;Il Barbiere di Seviglia&quot;), Violetta (&quot;La Traviata&quot;), and Gilda (&quot;Rigoletto&quot;). She sang her favorite role, Lucia, over 100 times.

She was married three times and had many passionate affairs during her life. She was the aunt and mentor of the actress Marisa Vernati. Tetrazzini was plagued by legal battles with her third husband, which substantially affected her finances towards the end of her life. She generously gave away the money and belongings that she possessed but remained cheerful and lovable despite her reduced circumstances. She would often say, &quot;I am old, I am fat, but I am still Tetrazzini.&quot; Tetrazzini left little behind when she died in Milan on 28 April 1940. Her funeral was honored with a Requiem Mass at the church in Via Casoretto and was attended by close family and friends. She was buried in a mausoleum, of her choosing, with an epitaph from &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;: “Alfin son tua.” (At last I am yours).

<text>Absolution Gap is a 2003 science fiction novel written by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds. It takes place in the &quot;Revelation Space&quot; universe and is a direct sequel to &quot;Redemption Ark&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The plot of the novel takes place in four separate time periods. The bulk of the novel is contained in the 2675 and 2727 sections.

===2615===

Queen Jasmina of the lighthugger &quot;Gnostic Ascension&quot; wakes Quaiche, a member of her crew, from Reefersleep. She is disappointed with him; despite his promises that he would improve the crew&#x27;s fortunes, he has not done so. In fact, many of the systems he has explored were filled with extremely valuable artifacts which he failed to detect and were picked up by other ships. As such, she gives him one last chance.

Jasmina sends him to explore the star 107 Piscium and its planets. His lover, Morwenna, is sent with him in the scrimshaw suit, a sensory deprivation device which paralyzes and blinds its wearer until they remove it. On one of the moons of a gas giant he names Haldora (which also seems to disappear every so often for a few fractions of a second), he discovers an alien bridge, whose automated defense system attacks him. He crashes and finds he does not have enough oxygen to survive until his shuttle returns from the other side of Haldora. However, Haldora vanishes and his radio signal reaches the shuttle, which races to save him at maximum acceleration, killing Morwenna.

===2675===

On Ararat, 23 years after the events of &quot;Redemption Ark&quot;, Scorpio, a hyperpig, seeks out Nevil Clavain, who has left mainstream society, leaving Scorpio in charge. Scorpio seeks his aid in opening a capsule which has come down from space. Also with him is Vasko, a reasonably competent but naïve young man. They open the capsule and discover Ana Khouri. Khouri informs the colony that humanity is now at war with the Inhibitors. They are getting the relevant technology from Aura, Khouri&#x27;s daughter, who has been modified by the Hades Matrix, an alien data repository. However, Skade has kidnapped her from Khouri&#x27;s womb. Clavain and Scorpio lead a team who discover Skade in her crashed ship, which has been attacked by the Inhibitors, causing its Cryo-Arithmetic Engines (a cloaking device) to malfunction and cover the ship in ice. Skade agrees to give the colony Aura in return for Clavain&#x27;s being tortured to death. Clavain agrees, but tells Scorpio to throw his corpse into the sea (where the Pattern Jugglers absorb him and reunite him with Galiana and Felka). The survivors are attacked by Inhibitor machinery, but Remontoire, a Conjoiner leading the war, protects them from space.

Back in the colony, the leaders debate as to what to do next. They eventually decide to leave. Meanwhile, Captain Brannigan of the lighthugger &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; has been preparing to do so. After some deliberation, some fourteen thousand of the over 150,000 colonists board the ship, and it leaves. In space they meet Remontoire, who gives them Aura&#x27;s technology to defend themselves. The leaders debate whether or not to go to the moon Hela (which Aura suggests they do) or Yellowstone, to help evacuate the planet. They decide to do the latter, but find they are too late; by the time they reach Yellowstone (in 2698), it has been overrun. As the crew collect the last refugees attempting to escape the system, a minor mutiny breaks out amongst the upper echelons, in which Scorpio&#x27;s leadership is overturned and the other leaders take power as a group. This is due to Scorpio electing to rescue the last refugees off a shuttle that had been contaminated by the Inhibitors. After the final disputes are settled, the ship is redirected towards Hela.

===2727===

Rashmika Els, a 17-year-old girl, leaves her home on Hela to search for her long-lost brother Harbin, who left to join the Cathedrals years before. The Cathedrals were set up by Quaiche after the 2615 timeline and constantly move across Hela (making use of various propulsion systems, such as legs and tracks) to &quot;observe&quot; Haldora and its disappearances (known as &quot;vanishings&quot;). It uses special indoctrinal viruses to maintain religious faith amongst its supporters, although certain areas, such as Rashmika&#x27;s town, are exempt. She joins one of the caravans, a massive vehicle composed of several smaller units, to get to the &quot;Permanent Way&quot;, where the cathedrals can be found. She has the ability to tell whenever people are lying to her, which makes Quaiche very interested in her. He uses false evidence to convince Rashmika that Harbin has become a supporter of the church. In fact he is dead. She arrives at Quaiche&#x27;s Cathedral and begins working for him.

In the Cathedral she suffers nightmares about a race called the &quot;Shadows&quot;, who exist in a parallel Brane to our own. Their universe has been consumed by a rogue terraforming agent and they are trying to join Rashmika&#x27;s. They had showed the Scuttlers, the long-extinct inhabitants of Hela, how to build a machine that could bring them across. In return they would destroy the Inhibitors. However, the Inhibitors allegedly destroyed the Scuttlers first.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; makes its presence known to Hela and offers to protect it (Quaiche has been asking various lighthuggers for protection). Quaiche agrees and sends &quot;delegates&quot; onto the ship, who are actually soldiers. They attempt to take the ship, but the crew defeats them. Quaiche holds Khouri and Vasko hostage, as well as Rashmika (who is actually Aura). He reveals he actually wants the ship to change Hela&#x27;s rotation with its engines to stop it spinning; this will permit him to keep watching Haldora eternally, without the need for moving Cathedrals. Brannigan agrees and lands, but not before he deploys a Cache Weapon on Haldora and destroys its exterior, revealing it to be the Shadows&#x27; transport mechanism.

Quaiche and Grelier (his right-hand man) leave with Aura, but Quaiche panics and dies falling from the shuttle, whilst Grelier is killed by Brannigan&#x27;s hypometric weapon when he tries to hold Aura hostage. The soldiers of the Cathedrals overwhelm Brannigan and destroy him. Scorpio arrives and rescues Aura, who suggests they take the Scrimshaw suit (now a prison for the Shadows&#x27; digital envoy), but Scorpio advises against doing so; Remontoire has shown him a shard of material from Ararat, which matches similar ones found on Hela. He believes that the race that made them also killed the Scuttlers for talking to the Shadows. They leave the Scrimshaw suit and retreat as the Cathedral is destroyed. As they walk away, Khouri asks Scorpio why he saved the shuttle in the Yellowstone system and it is implied that he saw her husband, Fazil, was on the passenger manifest.

===3125===

The prologue and epilogue of the novel are both set in roughly 3125, four hundred years after the rest of the book.

====Prologue====

An unnamed woman and her guardian are standing on the surface of a Pattern Juggler planet which is being evacuated. The woman agrees with her guardian to spend one more hour before returning to their ship. She stares up towards the stars and has the machinery in her clothing magnify one of them, revealing it to be colored green.

====Epilogue====

The epilogue reveals that the woman is in fact an older version of Aura (with her guardian implied to be Scorpio), reflecting on the events that happened after the battle on Hela. Scorpio turned out to be right; the race - known as the Nestbuilders - that wiped out the Scuttlers had been watching humanity and aided them. The Nestbuilders advised humanity to hide with them between the stars, but the humans instead used Nestbuilder weaponry to defeat the Inhibitors and cleanse human space of them. However, in doing so, they created a greater problem: the so-called &quot;Greenfly&quot; machines, self-replicating terraformers programmed to destroy every object in a solar system and reorganize them into trillions of vegetation-filled habitats that orbit the local star (behavior that is exactly the same as the threat described by the Shadows). The Inhibitors had kept them in check, but without the Inhibitors, the Greenfly are now out of control. Nothing the humans or Nestbuilders can do has stopped them. As such, humanity is evacuating towards the Pleiades. Aura reminisces on the decision she made not to invoke the Shadows. She decides that, before she returns to the ship, she will swim with the Pattern Jugglers and warn the people they have assimilated about what is coming. She enters the ocean as the novel ends.

The Greenfly threat is described in detail in the short story &quot;Galactic North&quot;, from its origins until the year 40,000, by which time it has spread to such an extent that humans are forced to abandon the Milky Way Galaxy.

<doc id="408738" wikidata="Q2849572" url="?curid=408738" title="Broken Angels (novel)">
<text>Broken Angels (2003) is a military science fiction novel by British writer Richard Morgan. It is the sequel to &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, and is followed by &quot;Woken Furies&quot;.

== Plot ==
Approximately 30 years after &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, Takeshi Kovacs is now serving in Carrera&#x27;s Wedge, a mercenary organization that joins a war on a distant planet, Sanction IV, fighting against an anti-corporate-government rebel group. Pilot Jan Schneider recruits Kovacs to help him lay claim to a buried Martian artifact. The artifact is a gate that opens a portal to a Martian starship. Kovacs and Schneider rescue Tanya Wardani, the archaeologue who coordinated the gate&#x27;s discovery, from a prison camp. Unable to reach the heavily contested location alone, Kovacs enlists the support of the Mandrake Corporation, one of the corporate entities profiteering off of the war. Mandrake is represented by an executive named Matthias Hand.

Kovacs and Hand select an elite squad of resurrected soldiers to accompany them. Hand secretly leaks information that prompts the rebels to destroy the city of Sauberville with a nuclear weapon. This clears the gate site of opposing forces, and the recovery expedition begins. However, the radiation severely damages the team&#x27;s bodies, and they must work against the clock to find the ship before dying of radiation poisoning. While Wardani works to open the gate, someone sabotages the beacons necessary to claim the starship. Two expedition members are killed by nanodes deployed by Hand&#x27;s rivals within the Mandrake firm.

The party goes through the portal and finds an inactive Martian starship, along with the bodies of Tanya&#x27;s original archaeologue team. Mysteriously, it appears that the original team chose to die in space rather than inside the breathable air of the spaceship. Suspecting that Schneider is the saboteur, Kovacs confronts him. Schneider flees in the shuttle they arrived in, triggering a booby trap set by Kovacs and blowing the shuttle up.

During their exploration, the Martian starship is attacked by an unknown starship, which causes its automated defense systems to come online. During the attack the party begins to experience visions and emotions from the dead Martians, bringing them to the brink of insanity. Hand realises the danger and orders Kovacs to shoot the others with a stunning weapon to render them unconscious.

After the battle is over, Isaac Carrera and a Wedge unit arrive and imprison the remaining members of the squad. One member of Kovac&#x27;s squad, Sutjiadi, is wanted for killing an officer of the Wedge. The Wedge opts to torture him to death. During this public execution, Kovacs frees his squad and kills the Wedge unit. Kovacs then follows Carrera through the portal and kills him.

Kovacs realises that Tanya Wardani sabotaged the first archaeological team after discovering that they wanted to use the Martian ship as a weapon. She was responsible for the bodies they found, as well as the destroyed equipment in the shuttle. She decides to stay and oversee the recovery of the portal. Kovacs trades the rights to the Martian ship for safe passage out of the solar system for the surviving members of his team.

==Themes==

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Colin Greenland found that &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; was about fighting against wealth and power. In contrast to the first novel, in which Kovacs was attempting to fight for human value, Greenland finds that &quot;truth and justice ... are rarely the ethos, or the issue&quot; in &quot;Broken Angels&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that the novel succeeded despite a formulaic structure, calling it a &quot;superior, satisfying cyberpunk noir adventure&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that the novel was a good expansion of the worldbuilding which began in the first novel, praising it as &quot;a thrilling cyberpunk actioner&quot; while stating that it occasionally overdid its world-weary tone.

<text>The Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP; Russian Институт теоретической и экспериментальной физики) is a multi-disciplinary research center located in Moscow, Russia. ITEP carries out research in the fields of theoretical and mathematical physics, astrophysics, high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, plasma physics, solid state physics, nanotechnology, reactor and accelerator physics, medical physics, and computer science. ITEP also maintains an extensive educational program and organizes physics schools for scholars and undergraduates. The institute is located near the corner of the Sevastopol prospect and the Nachimowski prospect (address Bolschaja Cheremuskinskaja 25) and occupies part of the former estate &quot;Cheryomushki-Znamenskoye&quot; – an 18th-century manor that is a monument of architecture and landscape art of the 18th–19th centuries.

== History ==
ITEP was established on December 1, 1945, initially carrying the name &quot;Laboratory №3&quot;, with the purpose of conceiving a heavy water nuclear reactor and cosmic ray studies. Developed of the theoretical part KS 150. The laboratory worked with nuclear reactor development in the 1940s and over the years the institute expanded its research programme into high energy particle physics, astrophysics, medical physics and other related fields.

The founder and director until 1968 was Abram Alikhanov.

ITEP scientists won 8 Lenin awards and 29 state awards during the Soviet Union.

A research program to research nuclear fusion using heavy ion accelerators was started in the 1980s.

At the moment (2008), the focus areas are theoretical and mathematical physics (e.g. quantum field theory and string theory), astrophysics, elementary particle physics (e.g. they are involved in working with DESY and CERN experiments), nuclear physics, plasma physics, solid state physics, nanotechnologies, nuclear reactor technology, accelerator physics, medical physics (such as PET devices, cancer treatment with the proton accelerator) and computer science. They were one of the first Russian institutes networked on the World Wide Web and operate the Moscow mirror of the Arxiv preprint server.

== Facilities ==

From 1949 the ITEP maintained a heavy water reactor (there is still a Maket heavy water reactor there) and from 1961 a 7 GeV proton synchrotron, the first Russian particle accelerator with strong focus and prototype for the later 70 GeV accelerator in Protvino. Today they maintain a 10 GeV proton synchrotron and a proton linear accelerator.

== Research ==
The school conducts original scientific research in several fields of physics and technology. Research areas in theoretical physics concentrate around quantum field theory including the string theory. Experimental research includes active participation in large international projects, such as the CERN&#x27;s LHC experiments, as well as smaller, national and locally managed projects. The employees are also active in teaching (at undergraduate and masters levels as well as doctorates) and regularly organize conferences, seminars and a winter school.

== 2012 controversy ==
A large group of scientists at the ITEP are protesting about the Russian government&#x27;s plan to merge ITEP with the Kurchatov Institute. According to them, the real purpose of the move is to effectively &quot;kill&quot; ITEP.

== People ==

The Russian theoretical physicists Lev Landau (ITEP considers themselves in the tradition of the Landau school) and Isaak Yakovlevich Pomeranchuk, who led a seminar here from the 1950s, were of particular importance. The well-known textbook on quantum electrodynamics by Aleksander Akhiezer and Vladimir Berestetsky was created at the institute in 1953. The ITEP achieved success for example with scientists such as Mikhail Shifman, , Arkady Vainshtein, Mikhail Voloshin, Victor Novikov and in quantum chromodynamics in the 1980s. Other theorists were Vadim Knizhnik, Alexei Morozov, Igor Krichever and Sergei Gukov in the field of string theory, quantum field theory and mathematical physics, Alexander Dolgov in cosmology, , . Other important theoretical physicists at the institute were Karen Ter-Martirosian and Lev Okun, both of whom were responsible for the selection of scientists during the Soviet Union, which at the time amounted to a strict &quot;screening&quot;.

== Pomeranchuk Prize ==
Since 1998 ITEP has awarded annually the Pomeranchuk Prize, an international award for theoretical physics. It is named after Russian physicist Isaak Yakovlevich Pomeranchuk, who together with Landau established the Theoretical Physics Department of the Institute.

<doc id="408741" wikidata="Q26749" url="?curid=408741" title="War of the Second Coalition">
<text>The War of the Second Coalition () (1798/9 – 1801/2, depending on periodisation) was the second war targeting revolutionary France by many European monarchies, led by Britain, Austria, and Russia and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, Naples and various German monarchies. Prussia did not join the coalition, while Spain supported France.

The overall goal of Britain and Russia was to contain the expansion of the French Republic and to restore the monarchy in France, while Austriaweakened and in deep financial debt from the War of the First Coalitionsought primarily to recover its position and come out of the war stronger than when it had entered. The first half of the war saw the Coalition manage to drive the French back in Italy, Germany, and Holland, but they were not able to seriously threaten an invasion of France, nor defeat the French decisively in battle. The second half of the war saw Napoleon Bonaparte and General Moreau inflict major defeats, forcing the Coalition to surrender, which resulted in the status quo from the previous war being upheld. In large part because of the difference in strategy among the three major allied powers, the Second Coalition failed to overthrow the revolutionary government, and French territorial gains since 1793 were confirmed. In the Franco–Austrian Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801, France held all of its previous gains and obtained new lands in Tuscany, in Italy. Austria was granted Venetia and the former Venetian Dalmatia. Most other allies also signed separate peace treaties with the French Republic in 1801. Britain and France signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, followed by the Ottomans in June 1802, which brought an interval of peace in Europe that lasted several months until Britain declared war on France again in May 1803. The renewed hostilities culminated in the War of the Third Coalition.

==Background==

On 20 April 1792, the French Legislative Assembly declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792–97), France fought against most of the states with which it shared a border, as well as Great Britain, Portugal and Prussia. The Coalition forces achieved several victories at the outset of the war, but were ultimately repulsed from French territory and then lost significant territories to the French, who began to set up client republics in their occupied territories. Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s efforts in the northern Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Treaty of Leoben (18 April 1797) and the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797), leaving Britain to fight on alone against France, Spain and the Netherlands.

==Peace interrupted==

From October 1797 until March 1799, France and Austria, the signatories of the Treaty of Campo Formio, avoided armed conflict but remained skeptical of each other, and several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement. The French demanded additional territory not mentioned in the Treaty. The Habsburgs were reluctant to hand over designated territories, much less additional ones. The Congress at Rastatt proved inept at orchestrating the transfer of territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Republicans in the Swiss Cantons, supported by the French Revolutionary Army, overthrew the central government in Bern and established the Helvetic Republic.

Other factors contributed to the rising tensions. In the summer of 1798, Napoleon led an expedition to Egypt and Syria. On his way to Egypt, he had stopped at the heavily fortified port city of Valletta, the capital city of Hospitaller Malta. Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, who ruled the island, allowed only two ships at a time in the harbour, in accordance with the island&#x27;s neutrality. Napoleon immediately ordered the bombardment of Valletta, and on 11 June 1798, General Louis Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers directed a landing of several thousand French troops at strategic locations around the island. The French Knights of the order deserted, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a successful resistance. Napoleon forcibly removed the other Knights from their possessions, angering Emperor Paul I of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. Moreover, the French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, Neapolitans, Russians and British actually discussed this possibility. Napoleon&#x27;s army got trapped in Egypt, and after he returned to France (October 1799), it eventually surrendered (September 1801).

==Preliminaries to war==
Military strategists in Paris recognized the strategic significance of the Upper Rhine Valley, the southwestern German regions, and Switzerland for the defense of the Republic. The control of the Swiss passes was crucial as they provided a key route to northern Italy. Therefore, the army that maintained control over these passes could swiftly deploy troops between the northern and southern theaters of operations.

Toward this end, in early November 1798, Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan arrived in Hüningen to take command of the French forces there, called the Army of Observation because its function was to &quot;observe&quot; the security of the French border on the Rhine. Once there, he assessed the forces&#x27; quality and disposition and identified needed supplies and manpower. He found the army woefully inadequate for its assignment. The Army of the Danube and its two flanking armies, the Army of Helvetia and the Army of Mayence, or Mainz, were equally short of manpower, supplies, ammunition, and training; most resources were already directed to the Army in Northern Italy, the Army of Britain, and the Egyptian expedition. Jourdan assiduously documented these shortages, pointing out in lengthy correspondence to the Directory the consequences of an undermanned and undersupplied army; his petitions seemed to have little effect on the Directory, which sent neither significant additional manpower nor supplies.

Jourdan&#x27;s orders were to take the army into Germany and secure strategic positions, particularly on the southwest roads through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the westernmost border of Lake Constance. Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland), André Masséna would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above Feldkirch, particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around Zürich and Winterthur. These positions would prevent the Allies of the Second Coalition from moving troops back and forth between the northern Italian and German theatres, but would allow French access to these strategic passes. Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna. Finally, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.

== Formation of the Second Coalition ==
The Second Coalition took several months to form, starting with Naples allying itself with Austria (19 May 1798) and Russia (29 November), after which British Prime Minister Pitt and Austrian State Chancellor Thugut (the latter only on the condition that Russia also joined the coalition) failed to persuade Prussia (which had left the First Coalition as early as April 1795) to join in. Neither were Britain and Austria able to formalise an alliance, due to lack of an agreement on the loan convention that would cover Austria&#x27;s outstanding debt to Britain from the previous war, let alone British subsidy to Austria for the upcoming war; they resorted to &quot;ad hoc&quot; cooperation without formal agreement. Next, Russia allied itself with the Ottoman Empire (23 December) and Great Britain (26 December) while attacking the French Ionian Islands. By 1 December, the Kingdom of Naples had signed alliances with both Russia and Great Britain.

The preliminary military action under the alliance occurred on 29 November when General Karl Mack, an Austrian serving Naples, occupied Rome, wishing to restore Papal authority with the Neapolitan army. King Ferdinand was pushed by his angry Austrian wife Queen Maria Carolina, Marie Antoinette&#x27;s sister, and by Horatio Nelson through his secret lover, the British Ambassador&#x27;s wife Emma, Lady Hamilton. All these companions became reckless gamblers when the poorly equipped and led Neapolitan army was not only soon defeated outside Rome and pushed back, but Naples itself was occupied by France on January 23. The king, the British officials and the women had only the time to escape to Sicily.

== War ==
===1799===
In Europe, the allies mounted several invasions, including campaigns in Italy and Switzerland and an Anglo-Russian invasion of the Netherlands. Russian general Alexander Suvorov inflicted a series of defeats on the French in Italy, driving them back to the Alps. The allies were less successful in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, where the British and Russians retreated after a defeat at Castricum, and in Switzerland, where after initial victories an Austro-Russian army was completely routed at the Second Battle of Zurich. These reverses, as well as British insistence on searching shipping in the Baltic Sea, led to Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from the Coalition.

Napoleon invaded Syria from Egypt, but retreated after a failed siege of Acre, repelling a British-Turkish invasion. Alerted to the political and military crisis in France, he returned, leaving his army behind, and used his popularity and army support to mount a coup that made him First Consul, the head of the French government.

===1800===
Napoleon sent Moreau to campaign in Germany, and went himself to raise a new army at Dijon and march through Switzerland to attack the Austrian armies in Italy from behind.

Moreau meanwhile invaded Bavaria and won a great battle against Austria at Hohenlinden. He continued toward Vienna and the Austrians sued for peace. The result was the Armistice of Steyr on 25 December.

In May 1800, Napoleon led his troops across the Alps through the Great St. Bernard Pass into Italy in a military campaign against the Austrians. He conducted the Siege of Fort Bard against the Sardinian and Austrian armies for two weeks, after which he was able to cross the Alps and enter Italy. He narrowly defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo. While the Austrians had a much larger force, Napoleon was able to organise a hurried retreat from the village before returning with reinforcements. The French successfully charged the Austrian flank with cavalry and Napoleon negotiated for Austria to evacuate Piedmont, Liguria and Lombardy.

===1801===

Prior to the Acts of Union of July/August 1800, Ireland was a separate kingdom, with its own parliament, held in a personal union with Great Britain under the Crown. In response to the 1798 United Irishmen revolt, it became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, effective 1 January 1801.

The Austrians signed the Armistice of Treviso on 16 January, ending the war in northern Italy. On 9 February, they signed the Treaty of Lunéville for the entire Holy Roman Empire, basically accepting the terms of the previous Treaty of Campo Formio. In Egypt, the Ottomans and British invaded and compelled the French to surrender after the fall of Cairo and Alexandria.

Britain continued the war at sea. The Second League of Armed Neutrality, which included Prussia, Russia, Denmark–Norway, and Sweden joined to prevent neutral shipping from being stopped by the Royal Navy, resulting in Nelson&#x27;s successful surprise attack on the Danish fleet in harbour at the Battle of Copenhagen.

France and Spain invaded Portugal in the War of the Oranges, forcing Portugal to sign the Treaty of Badajoz (1801).

Russia formally made peace with France through the Treaty of Paris on 8 October, signing a secret alliance two days later.

In December 1801, France dispatched the Saint-Domingue expedition to recapture the former colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), which had been independent since the 1791 Haitian Revolution. This included over 30,000 troops with many experienced and elite veterans, but ended in catastrophic failure; by the end of 1802, an estimated 15,000–22,000 had died of disease and yellow fever, among them Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law General Charles Leclerc.

== Aftermath ==
On 25 March 1802, Britain and France signed the Treaty of Amiens, ending British involvement in the war. After a preliminary treaty signed at Paris on 9 October 1801, the Treaty of Paris of 25 June 1802 ended the war between France and the Ottoman Empire, the last remaining member of the Second Coalition. The peace treaties ceded the left bank of the Rhine to France and recognized the independence of the Cisalpine, Batavian and Helvetic republics. Thus began the longest period of peace during the period 1792–1815.

== Strategic analysis ==
American historian Paul W. Schroeder (1987) claimed that, at the time of his writing, most historians – exemplified by Piers Mackesy (1984) – had all too simplistically blamed the Second Coalition&#x27;s failure on the requirement of &quot;Britain and Russia to trust Austria, when it was obvious that Austria could not be trusted&quot;. These historians had assumed that Austria failed to act in accordance with the Coalition&#x27;s common goal of invading France, ending the Revolution and restoring the Bourbon monarchy, because Vienna was too selfish and too greedy for territorial expansion. Schroeder argued it was not that simple: while Austria&#x27;s primary war aim was not to overthrow the French Republic, it was reasonable for Vienna to set its own conditions for entering a war with France. The enormous financial debt it still had from the War of the First Coalition jeopardised not just the Habsburg Monarchy&#x27;s ability to field an army capable of defeating the French, but had also caused hyperinflation and internal instability that risked a revolution inside Austria itself. The Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s very survival was at stake, and so Emperor Francis II and Thugut resolved not to enter a war in order to defeat France at all costs, but to make Austria come out stronger than it went in. Moreover, Schroeder reasoned that all the other great powers that were negotiating to form the Second Coalition – Russia, Prussia (which ultimately remained neutral), Britain, and the Ottoman Empire – were duplicitous: each was afraid of and scheming against the others to make sure it gained the most from the war and the others would gain little or actually grow weaker with the new postwar balance of power.

<doc id="408743" wikidata="Q318503" url="?curid=408743" title="Mark Cuban">
<text>Mark Cuban (born July 31, 1958) is an American businessman and television personality. He is the former principal owner and current minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), co-owner of 2929 Entertainment, and is one of the main &quot;sharks&quot; on the ABC reality television series &quot;Shark Tank&quot;. As of February 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimates his net worth to be $5.7 billion.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cuban was involved at a young age in ventures ranging from selling garbage bags to running newspapers during a strike. He graduated from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University and embarked on a diverse business career that included founding MicroSolutions and Broadcast.com, both of which he sold at substantial profits. Cuban&#x27;s investments span various industries, from technology and media to sports and entertainment. He has been a prominent figure in the NBA, known for his active involvement with the Mavericks (with which he won the 2011 NBA Championship as owner), and disputes with the league&#x27;s management. In his side ventures, Cuban has been involved in philanthropy, political commentary, and reality television.

==Early life and education==
Cuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 31, 1958. His father, Norton Cuban, was an automobile upholsterer. Cuban described his mother, Shirley (née Feldman), as someone with &quot;a different job or different career goal every other week.&quot;

Cuban is Jewish, and grew up in Mount Lebanon, a suburb of Pittsburgh, in a working-class family. His paternal grandfather changed the surname from &quot;Chabenisky&quot; to &quot;Cuban&quot; after his family emigrated from Russia through Ellis Island. His maternal grandparents were Romanian Jewish immigrants, according to Mark&#x27;s brother Brian, though Mark has claimed his maternal grandmother was from Lithuania.

Cuban first ventured into business at age 12. He sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive sneakers. A few years later, he earned money by selling stamps and coins. At age 16, Cuban took advantage of a &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; strike by running newspapers from Cleveland to Pittsburgh.

Instead of attending high school for his senior year, he enrolled as a full-time student at the University of Pittsburgh, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, Cuban transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he graduated from the Kelley School of Business in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in management. He chose Indiana&#x27;s Kelley School of Business without even visiting the campus because it &quot;had the least expensive tuition of all the business schools on the top 10 list&quot;. He had various business ventures during college, including a bar, disco lessons, and a chain letter.

After graduating, Cuban returned to Pittsburgh and took a job with Mellon Bank, where he immersed himself in the study of machines and networking.

==Business career==
On July 7, 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas, where he first found a job as a bartender for a Greenville Avenue bar called Elan and then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the earliest PC software retailers in Dallas. He was fired less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.

Cuban co-founded MicroSolutions with support from his previous customers at Your Business Software. Initially, MicroSolutions operated as a systems integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe. One of the company&#x27;s largest clients was Perot Systems. The company grew to more than $30 million in revenue, and in 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&amp;R Block—for $6 million 
(over $14.7 million today). He made approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.

===Audionet and Broadcast.com===
In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner joined Audionet (founded in 1989 by Chris Jaeb, who retained 10% of the company), combining their mutual interest in Indiana Hoosier college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line, Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter. In 1999, Broadcast.com helped launch the first live-streamed Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show. That year, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.7 billion in Yahoo! stock. 

Yahoo!&#x27;s costly purchase of Broadcast.com is now regarded as one of the worst internet acquisitions of all time. Broadcast.com and Yahoo!&#x27;s other broadcasting services were discontinued within a few years after the acquisition. Cuban has repeatedly described himself as very lucky to have sold the company before the dot-com bubble burst. However, he also emphasized that he hedged against the Yahoo! shares he received from the sale and would have lost most of his fortune if he had not done so.

Cuban continues to work with Wagner in another venture, 2929 Entertainment, which provides vertically integrated production and distribution of films and video.

On September 24, 2003, the firm purchased Landmark Theatres, a chain of 58 arthouse movie theaters. The company is also responsible for the updated version of the TV show &quot;Star Search&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS. 2929 Entertainment released &quot;Bubble&quot;, a movie directed by Steven Soderbergh, in 2006.

===Investments in startups===
Cuban has also assisted ventures in the social software and distributed networking industries. He was an owner of IceRocket, a search engine that scours the blogosphere for content.

In 2005, Cuban invested $1.7 million in file-sharing company RedSwoosh, co-founded by Travis Kalanick, providing much-needed capital to the company after the early 2000s recession. Red Swoosh was acquired by Akamai for $19 million in 2007. Kalanick later approached Cuban in 2009 to invest in his next venture Uber at a $10 million valuation. Cuban proposed a $5 million valuation, but never heard back from Kalanick.

He was also an investor in Weblogs, Inc., which was acquired by AOL.
In 2005, Cuban invested in Brondell Inc., a San Francisco startup making a high-tech toilet seat called a Swash that works like a bidet but mounts on a standard toilet. &quot;People tend to approach technology the same way, whether it&#x27;s in front of them, or behind them&quot;, Cuban joked. He also invested in Goowy Media Inc., a San Diego Internet software startup. In April 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio announced that Cuban would host his own weekly radio talk show, &quot;Mark Cuban&#x27;s Radio Maverick&quot;. However, the show has not materialized.

In July 2006, Cuban financed Sharesleuth.com, a website created by former &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; investigative reporter Christopher Carey to uncover fraud and misinformation in publicly traded companies. Experimenting with a new business model for making online journalism financially viable, Cuban disclosed that he would take positions in the shares of companies mentioned in Sharesleuth.com in advance of publication. Business and legal analysts questioned the appropriateness of shorting a stock before making public pronouncements which are likely to result in losses in that stock&#x27;s value. Cuban insisted that the practice is legal in view of full disclosure.

In April 2007, Cuban partnered with Mascot Books to publish his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Mavs!&quot;. In November 2011, he wrote a 30,000-word e-book, &quot;How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It&quot;, which he described as &quot;a way to get motivated&quot;.

In October 2008, Cuban started Bailoutsleuth.com as a grassroots, online portal for oversight over the U.S. government&#x27;s $700 billion &quot;bailout&quot; of financial institutions. It no longer exists as a website.

In September 2010, Cuban provided an undisclosed amount of venture capital to store-front analytics company Motionloft. According to the company&#x27;s CEO Jon Mills, he cold-emailed Cuban on a whim with the business proposition and claimed Cuban quickly responded that he would like to hear more. Mills credited that sentence for launching the company. In November 2013, several investors questioned Cuban about Mills&#x27; representation of a pending acquisition of Motionloft. Cuban denied an acquisition was in place. Mills was terminated as CEO of Motionloft by stockholders on December 1, 2013, and in February 2014 was arrested by the FBI and charged with wire fraud; it was alleged that Mills misrepresented to investors that Motionloft was going to be acquired by Cisco. Cuban has gone on record to state that the technology, which at least in part is meant to serve the commercial real estate industry, is &quot;game changing&quot; for tenants.

In 2019, Cuban, Ashton Kutcher, Steve Watts and Watts&#x27; wife Angela, acquired a 50% stake in Veldskoen Shoes United States business. In 2021, Cuban, Pantera Capital, BlockTower, Hashed, Cadenza Ventures (backed by 100x Group), CMS and QCP Capital backed a layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol, Injective Protocol and their CEO Eric Chen. Also in late 2021, Cuban purchased the entire town of Mustang, Texas, a 77-acre town in Navarro County. He told the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; that a buddy needed to sell it and, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what if anything I will do with it.&quot;

===&quot;Shark Tank&quot;===
Cuban has been a &quot;shark&quot; investor on the ABC reality program &quot;Shark Tank&quot; since season two in 2011.

As of May 2015, he has invested in 85 deals across 111 &quot;Shark Tank&quot; episodes, for a total of $19.9 million. In 2022, Cuban stated that his portfolio of &quot;Shark Tank&quot; investments had made a net loss, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve gotten beat&quot;.

The actual numbers may vary because the investment happens after the handshake deal on live television and after due diligence is performed to ensure the accuracy of the information presented in the pitch room. For instance, Hy-Conn, a manufacturer of fire hose adapters, after agreeing to a deal of $1.25 million for 100% of the company with Cuban, did not go through with the deal.

Cuban&#x27;s top three deals, all with at least $1 million invested, are Ten Thirty One Productions, Rugged Maniac Obstacle Race, and BeatBox Beverages.

Since Cuban joined the show in 2011, the ratings for &quot;Shark Tank&quot; have increased, and also during his tenure, the show has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Structured Reality Program (from 2014 to 2017). Before the category came into existence it won the award for outstanding reality program for two consecutive seasons (2012 to 2013), all of these awards came after he joined. As of 2023, Cuban is the richest of all Sharks to appear on the show. He announced in November 2023 that the show&#x27;s 16th season will be his last.

===Magnolia Pictures===

Cuban owns film distributor Magnolia Pictures. Through Magnolia, he financed &quot;Redacted&quot;, a fictional dramatization based on the 2006 Mahmudiyah killings, written and directed by Brian De Palma. In September 2007, Cuban, in his capacity as owner of Magnolia Pictures, removed disturbing photographs from the concluding moments of the &quot;Redacted&quot;, citing copyrights/permissions issues.

In April 2011, Cuban put Magnolia Pictures and Landmark Theatres up for sale, but said, &quot;If we don&#x27;t get the price and premium we want, we are happy to continue to make money from the properties.&quot;

Cuban has invested in the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, as well as accepting the particular cryptocurrency as a method of payment for Dallas Mavericks merchandise and tickets since at least early 2021. After being asked by CNBC for his thoughts on the payment method, Cuban responded, &quot;It&#x27;s a medium that can be used for the acquisition of goods and services. The community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.&quot;

After Voyager Digital, a cryptocurrency lender, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks were named in a class-action lawsuit that alleged that Voyager Digital was a Ponzi scheme the following month due to Cuban&#x27;s promotion of Voyager and Voyager&#x27;s sponsorship with the team. In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.

In September 2023, Cuban&#x27;s MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet was drained by scammers. As a result he had lost about $870,000 worth of tokens.

=== Cost Plus Drugs ===
In January 2022, Cuban launched Cost Plus Drugs, with the aim of lowering generic drug prices for end consumers in the U.S. Cuban started the company after receiving an email from a radiologist named Alex Oshmyansky, who pitched the idea of an online-based pharmacy. He often refers to Cost Plus Drugs as a critique and disruptor of the US healthcare system, including offering transparent, direct-to-consumer pricing and reducing the role of pharmacy benefit managers.

==Sports businesses==
===Dallas Mavericks===

On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA&#x27;s Dallas Mavericks for $285 million from H. Ross Perot Jr.

In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games and had a playoff record of 21–32. In the 10 years following, the team won 69% of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one. The Mavericks&#x27; playoff record with Cuban is 49–57, including their first trip to the NBA Finals in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat.

NBA team owners historically play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban, however, sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane—a Gulfstream V—to attend road games.

In May 2010, H. Ross Perot Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some $100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center.

In January 2018, Cuban announced the Mavericks would be accepting Bitcoin as payment for tickets in the following season. On March 4, 2021, Cuban announced the Mavericks would begin accepting Dogecoin as payment for both merchandise as well as tickets to games.

In early 2021, he decided to stop playing the National Anthem at Dallas Mavericks games in order to &quot;respect those whose believed the anthem did not represent them.&quot; He also supported the movement as far back as late 2020. The NBA responded by requiring every team to play it, citing it as their &quot;long-standing policy&quot;. Cuban did not complain, and ended up playing the anthem.

On November 28, 2023, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that Cuban was in the process of selling his share in the Dallas Mavericks to Miriam Adelson.

On December 27, 2023, the NBA approved the sale of a controlling interest of 73% in the Dallas Mavericks to Adelson and Sivian and Patrick Dumont.

===Major League Baseball===
Cuban has repeatedly expressed interest in owning a Major League Baseball franchise and has unsuccessfully attempted to purchase at least three franchises. In 2008, he submitted an initial bid of $1.3 billion to buy the Chicago Cubs and was invited to participate in a second round of bidding along with several other potential ownership groups. Cuban was not selected to participate in the final bidding process in January 2009. In August 2010, Cuban actively bid to buy the Texas Rangers with Jeffrey L. Beck. Cuban stopped bids after 1 a.m., having placed bids totaling almost $600 million. He had outbid a competing ownership group led by ex-pitcher and Rangers executive Nolan Ryan, but lost the deal before the Rangers played the San Francisco Giants in the 2010 World Series.

In January 2012, Cuban placed an initial bid for the Los Angeles Dodgers, but was eliminated before the second round of bidding. Cuban felt that the value of the Dodgers&#x27; TV rights deal drove the price of the franchise too high. He had previously said that he would not be interested in buying the franchise at $1 billion, telling the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in November 2011 &quot;I don&#x27;t think the Dodgers franchise is worth twice what the Rangers are worth.&quot; However, as the bidding process drew near many speculated that the sale would surpass $1.5 billion, with Jon Heyman of CBS Sports reporting on Twitter that at least one bid in the $1–1.5 billion range was placed in the initial round of the bidding process. Ultimately, the Dodgers sold for $2.15 billion to Guggenheim Baseball Management.

Cuban also previously expressed interest in becoming a minority owner of the New York Mets after owner Fred Wilpon announced in 2011 that he was planning to sell up to a 25% stake in the team.

Cuban has wanted to purchase his hometown Pittsburgh Pirates, but was rebuffed by then owner Kevin McClatchy in 2005.

===Other sports businesses===

In 2005, Cuban expressed interest in buying the NHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins. In 2006, Cuban joined an investment group along with Dan Marino, Kevin Millevoi, Andy Murstein, and Walnut Capital principals Gregg Perelman and Todd Reidbord to attempt to acquire the Penguins. The franchise ultimately rejected the group&#x27;s bid when team owners Mario Lemieux and Ronald Burkle took the team off the market.

At WWE&#x27;s Survivor Series in 2003, Cuban was involved in a staged altercation with &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager Eric Bischoff and &quot;Raw&quot; wrestler Randy Orton. On December 7, 2009, Cuban acted as the guest host of &quot;Raw&quot;, getting revenge on Orton when he was the guest referee in Orton&#x27;s match against Kofi Kingston, giving Kingston a fast count victory. He then announced that Orton would face Kingston at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs. At the end of the show, Cuban was slammed through a table by the number one contender for the WWE Championship, Sheamus.

On September 12, 2007, Cuban said that he was in talks with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon to create a mixed martial arts company that would compete with UFC. He is now a bondholder of Zuffa, which was formerly UFC&#x27;s parent company.

Cuban followed up his intentions by organizing &quot;HDNet Fights&quot;, a mixed martial arts promotion which airs exclusively on HDNet and premiered on October 13, 2007, with a card headlined by a fight between Erik Paulson and Jeff Ford as well as fights featuring veterans Drew Fickett and Justin Eilers.

Since 2009, Cuban has been a panelist at the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.

In April 2010, Cuban loaned the newly formed United Football League (UFL) $5 million. He did not own a franchise, and he was not involved in day-to-day operations of the league nor of any of its teams. In January 2011, he filed a federal lawsuit against the UFL for their failure to repay the loan by the October 6, 2010, deadline.

In June 2015, Cuban invested in the esports betting platform Unikrn.

In February 2016, Cuban purchased a principal ownership stake in the Professional Futsal League.

==Political activity==
Cuban is an admirer of author Ayn Rand. About Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, he said that it &quot;was incredibly motivating to me. It encouraged me to think as an individual, take risks to reach my goals, and responsibility for my successes and failures. I loved it.&quot; His political views have leaned toward libertarianism. He held a position on the centrist Unity08 political organization&#x27;s advisory council. Despite leaning towards libertarianism, Cuban posted an entry on his blog claiming paying more taxes to be the most patriotic thing someone can do.

In 1996, Cuban donated $6,000 to Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. In 2002, Cuban donated $1,000 to Democratic California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren.

On February 8, 2008, Cuban voiced his support for the draft Bloomberg movement attempting to convince New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run in the U.S. presidential election of 2008 on his blog. Cuban concluded a post lamenting the current state of U.S. politics: &quot;Are you listening, Mayor Bloomberg? For less than the cost of opening a tent pole movie, you can change the status quo.&quot; He eventually voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 election.

In November 2012, in response to Donald Trump offering President Obama $5 million to a charity of President Obama&#x27;s choosing if he released passport applications and college transcripts to the public, Cuban offered Trump $1 million to a charity of Trump&#x27;s choosing if Trump shaved his head.

On December 19, 2012, Cuban donated $250,000 to the Electronic Frontier Foundation to support its work on patent reform. Part of his donation funded a new title for EFF&#x27;s staff attorney Julie Samuels: The Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents.

At the Code/Media conference in February 2015, Cuban said of net neutrality that &quot;having [the FCC] overseeing the Internet scares the shit out of me&quot;.

Cuban formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president at a July 30, 2016, rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During that campaign stop, Cuban said of Republican nominee Donald Trump, &quot;You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh? A jagoff ... Is there any bigger jagoff in the world than Donald Trump?&quot;

On November 22, 2016, Cuban met with the then President-elect Trump&#x27;s key advisor Steve Bannon. In October 2024 Mark revealed on the All-In Podcast that Trump had reached out to him for a position during his administration.

During an appearance on an episode of &quot;Hannity&quot; in May 2020, Cuban voiced his support for former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

On February 2, 2021, Cuban joined Reddit&#x27;s WallStreetBets &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; forum with millions of members and fielded user questions related to the GameStop short squeeze. In the AMA session, Cuban publicly called the trust of the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission into question as well as the capabilities of zero commission brokerage firms, like Robinhood, that restricted retail traders from purchasing GameStop shares and other shorted stocks which he said crippled demand. Cuban&#x27;s advice to Reddit users was to hold GameStop shares if they could afford it in anticipation of additional short sales by Wall Street firms, but ultimately acknowledged that the odds were stacked against them and to use it as a learning experience. He offered insight into his trading technique suggesting that traders know why they are buying something and to &quot;HODL&quot; (hold on for dear life) until they learn that something has changed. Cuban noted a need for policy change to better support retail traders, credited the WallStreetBets community for leading the charge, and expressed optimism about blockchain trading as a more efficient, transparent and trustworthy form of trading for retail traders in the future.

Prior to the 2024 Presidential election, Mark Cuban endorsed Kamala Harris for President, describing her as the only candidate in &quot;founder mode&quot;—a term used to describe hands-on business leaders. Alongside LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Cuban launched &quot;Business Leaders for Harris&quot;, a group of executives supporting Harris for President. The group included Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, former Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and Box CEO Aaron Levie. Cuban also expressed interest in serving as the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if Harris were elected and offered himself for the position.

In October 2024, Cuban joined Kamala Harris on the campaign trail for the 2024 election, first making an appearance alongside her in Wisconsin on October 17. At his first appearance he mainly spoke about Donald Trump&#x27;s tariff policies, warning that they will drive up prices and &quot;ruin Christmas&quot;. Adding onto this he compared the former president to the Grinch, stating &quot;Donald Trump is the Grinch that wants to steal your Christmas. The Grinch doesn&#x27;t understand how tariffs work... The Grinch is the one that&#x27;s going to be putting these small business out of business.&quot;

===Fallen Patriot Fund===
Cuban started the Fallen Patriot Fund to help families of U.S. military personnel killed or injured during the Iraq War, personally matching the first $1 million in contributions with funds from the Mark Cuban Foundation, which is run by his brother Brian Cuban.

===Speculation of a presidential run===
In September 2015, Cuban stated in an interview that running for president was &quot;a fun idea to toss around&quot;, and that, if he was running in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he &quot;could beat both Trump and Clinton&quot;. This was interpreted by many media outlets as indication that Cuban was considering running, but he clarified soon afterward that he had no intention to do so.

In October 2015, Cuban posted on Twitter, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll run for Speaker of the House.&quot; At the time, there was no clear front-runner to replace the outgoing John Boehner (the Speaker of the House does not have to be a member of Congress).

Cuban told &quot;Meet the Press&quot; in May 2016 that he would be open to being Clinton&#x27;s running mate in the election, though he would seek to alter some of her positions in order to do so. In the same interview, the self-described &quot;fiercely independent&quot; Cuban also said that he would consider running as Republican nominee Trump&#x27;s running mate after having a meeting with Trump about Trump&#x27;s positions on the issues and suggesting solutions. Cuban also described Trump as &quot;that friend that you just shake your head at. He&#x27;s that guy who&#x27;d get drunk and fall over all the time, or just says dumb shit all the time, but he&#x27;s your friend.&quot; On July 21, 2016, Cuban appeared on a live segment on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; entitled &quot;Gloves Off: Mark Cuban Edition&quot; in which he mocked Trump, including referencing the Trump companies&#x27; multiple bankruptcies, the failed Trump University program, and questioning the size of Trump&#x27;s actual net worth.

In a September 2016 interview with NPR, Cuban effectively positioned himself to support Clinton. He posited that the best strategy to beat Trump was to attack his insecurities, especially that of his intellect. He also added that Trump is the least qualified to be president and is not informed about policies.

In September 2016, during a post-presidential debate interview, Cuban criticized Trump&#x27;s characterization that paying the minimum required taxes &#x27;is smart&#x27; and criticized Trump for not paying back into the system that allowed him to amass such wealth.

In October 2017, Cuban said that he would &quot;definitely&quot; run for president if he was single. Later that month, Cuban claimed that if he ran for president in 2020, it would be as a Republican, and described himself as &quot;socially a centrist ... but very fiscally conservative&quot;. It had also been speculated that he could have challenged president Donald Trump in 2020 as a Democrat. However, in a March 2019 interview with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Cuban stated that he was &quot;strongly considering running&quot; for president as an independent candidate. In May 2019, Cuban said: &quot;It would take the perfect storm for me to do it. There&#x27;s some things that could open the door, but I&#x27;m not projecting or predicting it right now.&quot;

In a June 2020 interview with CNN and former Obama advisor David Axelrod, Cuban revealed that he had seriously considered running for president that year as an independent candidate. He went so far as to commission a national poll, which, according to Cuban, showed he would only receive 25 percent of the vote in a hypothetical matchup with President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Cuban also said that the poll showed his candidacy would have pulled votes from both Trump and Biden.

== Legal issues ==

=== NBA fines ===
Cuban&#x27;s ownership has been the source of extensive media attention and controversy involving league policies.
Cuban has been fined by the NBA at least $1.665 million across 13 incidents, primarily for critical statements about the league and its referees. In a June 30, 2006, interview, Mavericks player Dirk Nowitzki said about Cuban:

In an interview with the Associated Press, Cuban said that he matches NBA fines with charitable donations of equal amounts. In a nationally publicized incident in 2002, he criticized the league&#x27;s manager of officials, Ed T. Rush, saying that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be able to manage a Dairy Queen.&quot; Dairy Queen management took offense to Cuban&#x27;s comments and invited him to manage a Dairy Queen restaurant for a day. Cuban accepted the company&#x27;s invitation and worked for a day at a Dairy Queen in Coppell, Texas, where fans lined up in the street to get a Blizzard from the owner of the Mavericks.

During the 2005–06 NBA season, Cuban started a booing campaign when former Mavericks player Michael Finley returned to play against the Mavericks as a member of the San Antonio Spurs. In a playoff series between the Mavericks and Spurs, Cuban cursed Spurs forward Bruce Bowen and was fined $25,000 by the NBA for rushing onto the court and criticizing NBA officials. After the 2006 NBA Finals, Cuban was fined $250,000 by the NBA for repeated misconduct following the Mavericks&#x27; loss to the Miami Heat in Game Five of the 2006 NBA Finals.

In February 2007, Cuban publicly criticized NBA Finals MVP Dwyane Wade and declared that he would get fined if he made any comments about what he thought really happened in the 2006 NBA Finals.

On January 16, 2009, the league fined Cuban $25,000 for yelling at Denver Nuggets player J. R. Smith at the end of the first half on a Mavericks-at-Nuggets game played on January 13. Cuban was apparently offended that Smith had thrown an elbow that barely missed Mavericks forward Antoine Wright. Cuban offered to match the fine with a donation to a charity of Smith&#x27;s choosing. Cuban stated that if he doesn&#x27;t hear from Smith, then he will donate the money to the NHL Players&#x27; Association Goals and Dreams Fund in the names of Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore. In May 2009, Cuban made a reference to the Denver Nuggets being &quot;thugs&quot; after a loss to the Nuggets in game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals. The statement was geared towards the Nuggets and their fans. As he passed Kenyon Martin&#x27;s mother, who was seated near Cuban as he left the arena, he pointed at her and said, &quot;that includes your son.&quot; This controversial comment revisited media attention on Cuban yet again. Cuban issued an apology the next day referencing the poor treatment of away fans in arenas around the league. The league issued a statement stating that they would not fine him.

On May 22, 2010, Cuban was fined $100,000 for comments he made during a television interview about trying to sign LeBron James.

Despite his history, he was notably silent during the Mavericks&#x27; 2011 championship playoff run.

Despite Cuban&#x27;s history with David Stern, he believed the NBA Commissioner would leave a lasting legacy &quot;of a focus on growth and recognizing that the NBA is in the entertainment business and that it&#x27;s a global product, not just a local product. Whatever platforms that took us to, he was ready to go. He wasn&#x27;t protective at all. He was wide open. I think that was great.&quot;

On January 18, 2014, Cuban was once again fined $100,000 for confronting referees and using inappropriate language toward them. As with previous fines, Cuban confirmed that he would match the fine with a donation to charity, however, with the condition that he reaches two million followers on his Twitter account. Cuban also jokingly commented that he could not let Stern leave without a proper farewell.

On February 21, 2018, Cuban was fined $600,000 by the NBA for stating that the Dallas Mavericks should &quot;tank for the rest of the season.&quot; Commissioner Adam Silver stated that the fine was &quot;for public statements detrimental to the NBA.&quot;

On March 6, 2020, Cuban was fined $500,000 by the NBA for &quot;public criticism and detrimental conduct regarding NBA officiating&quot;, according to the league.

===SEC insider trading allegation===
On November 17, 2008, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil suit against Cuban relating to alleged insider trading in the shares of Mamma.com, now known as Copernic. A stock dilution occurred shortly after a trade in June 2004, giving hints of inside knowledge at the time of the trade, and Cuban allegedly was saved from a loss of $750,000. The SEC claimed that Cuban ordered the sale of his holdings in Mamma.com after he had been confidentially approached by the company to participate in a transaction likely to dilute shares of current shareholders. Cuban disputed the charges, saying he had not agreed to keep the information secret. On his blog, Cuban contended the allegations were false and that the investigation was &quot;a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion&quot;. &quot;DealBook&quot;, a section of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported through an anonymous source that Cuban believed the investigation was motivated by an SEC employee having taken offense to his interest in possibly distributing the film &quot;Loose Change&quot;.

In July 2009, the U.S. District Court dismissed the charges against Cuban, and the SEC appealed. In September 2010, an appeals court said that the district court had erred and that further proceedings would be necessary to address the merits of the suit.

A federal jury in Texas found in favor of Cuban on October 16, 2013. The nine-member jury issued the verdict after deliberating 3 hours and 35 minutes.

In March 2014, Cuban was on air at CNBC criticizing high-frequency trading (HFT). Those against HFT, such as Cuban, believe the technology is equivalent to automated insider trading.

===Sexual harassment allegation===
In a March 6, 2018, article, &quot;Willamette Week&quot; reported on an alleged April 2011 incident between Cuban and a female patron of a Portland, Oregon bar called the Barrel Room. The woman told Portland police that Cuban sexually groped her while she posed for pictures with him. She submitted seven photographs, two of which Portland Police Detective Brendan McGuire referred to as &quot;significant&quot;. Cuban denied the allegations, and his attorney provided the results of a polygraph test taken by Cuban and written statements from two medical doctors stating that the actions described were anatomically improbable. The Portland District Attorney&#x27;s office declined to prosecute, citing a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim and the woman&#x27;s preference not to proceed with charges, and concluding that &quot;no crime can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. The NBA announced on March 8, 2018, that it was reviewing the matter.

== Personal life ==
Cuban has two brothers, Brian and Jeff.

In September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart in a private ceremony in Barbados. They have two daughters, born in 2003 and 2006, and a son born in 2009. They live in a mansion in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, Texas.

Cuban is a vegetarian. He is a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

===Philanthropy===
In 2003, Cuban founded the Fallen Patriot Fund to help families of U.S. military personnel killed or injured during the Iraq War.

In June 2015, Cuban made a $5 million donation to Indiana University Bloomington for the &quot;Mark Cuban Center for Sports Media and Technology&quot;, which was built inside Assembly Hall, the school&#x27;s basketball arena.

In 2020, Cuban picked up homeless former NBA player Delonte West from a gas station in Dallas. He paid for a hotel room for West along with his treatment at a drug rehabilitation center.

==Awards and honors==
The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; credits Cuban with the &quot;largest single e-commerce transaction&quot; after purchasing a Gulfstream V jet for $40 million over the internet in October 1999.

In 2024, Cuban was included in the Time 100 Most Influential People 2024.
